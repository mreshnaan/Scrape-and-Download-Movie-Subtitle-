Aw, but we love you! Come on! And I wanna keep it that way. Um, okay. That was for my beautiful, sweet, darling fiance, Nathan. [laughter] Who loves that song very much. Bubba, you wanna come up here? -No. [chuckles] -[all laughing] [Allison] Come on! It's our engagement party. He's very shy! [all chanting] Nathan! Nathan! Nathan! Nathan! Nathan! Nathan! Nathan! [whooping] [guests] Mm! Ah! Mm! -Did you like it? -It was amazing. [Nathan inhales deeply] -Hey, y'all... -[laughter] Um, I'll just briefly say that she played that song for me on our very first date on a beautiful, old piano she found at the back of an empty bar. -Well, you better go, girl! -Come on. Come on! -Always be closing. -[Molly] Absolutely! Welcome to the family! -Allison... [chuckles] -Yes... [chuckles] Every memory I cherish in my life has you in it. Some of them are just tiny seconds. The way you close one eye when you really wanna focus on tasting something. -[guests laugh] -I do that. I do that. I go, like... [guests laughing] [laughing] I can't believe this is real. It's real, baby. -Thank God. -[Allison] Mm. -I love you. -I love you. [all] Aw. -Okay. -Hey... -Um... Drink, smoke, be merry. -[man] Yeah. And if you choose to sleep with Chip, make sure he wears, like, 11 condoms. [all exclaiming] I'm, like, literally a virgin. -[others laughing] -He's kidding.

Uh, a '67 cloth top Bronco is a work of art, baby. It's not a truck. -I'm looking at art. -Yeah. Oh. -Like this butt. -[Allison laughing] I am so high from that gummy you gave me. -What the fuck was that? -[Nathan chuckling] I still can't feel my ankles. You don't need your ankles right now. Yeah, but I would still like to feel my ankles. Hey, come kiss me. -Hey, babe? -Yeah? This creepy doctor from my sales list is really trying to flirt with me on Instagram. [inhales sharply] Maybe you gave him the wrong impression. What? Come on! As if! I go in there, and I'm, like, waving my engagement ring around. You always say, ""Flirting is a part of the job."" Someone's bound to get the wrong impression. It's very light flirting. -Ah, okay. [laughs] -It is! It's like... It's just... It's sushi with a smile, so that he can write the fucking prescription, and I can get a fat bonus, and then you and I can maybe one day move to the city. If we don't go to hell first. Oh! Why would you say that? -Come on! -I'm sorry. I'm only pushing HUMIRA, like, I won't go to hell for moderate to severe psoriasis. Come on. That would be so unfair. Yeah, yeah. Shut up. -Okay. Hey. -Mmm. It's just a stepping stone, baby. I know. Do you think it's too late for astronaut school? -[laughing] -What? -What? -Nothing. I could be a professional dancer. -Oh, word? -Yeah. Yeah. -You got them moves? -Ooh. -[laughs] -Wait, let me stand up. I'm way better when I stand up. -Okay. -It's so much better when I stand up. -Are you ready? -Yeah, yeah, yeah. -Whoa. -What genre is this? I don't know, but my body just goes... [Nathan] Go. Is this modern, right? [laughs] -This is professional. -Wow. So I would appreciate it if you took me seriously right now. I'm taking you very seriously. And then, we'll finish with something like this. -[Allison humming] -[laughs] But I'm not gonna show you anymore, because it's a work-in-progress.

Oh, you mean your future niece? [gasps] Oh, my goodness. She's so pretty! Yeah, the varsity coach said she might start next year. -Oh, yeah? -[Jesse] Mmm-hmm. She scored 19 goals last season! -Tell her. Tell her. -Wow! Oh, my God. You must be so proud of her. I can't believe I haven't met her. I'm so sorry Nathan and I haven't made it down there yet. Don't worry about it. I mean, it's far. We're gonna try to come up more often now that our dad's getting older. [Allison] Yeah. Well, I've only met your dad a few times, but that we can't blame on distance. [chuckles] This is fucking nuts. I'm sorry. Wait, so tell us about these wedding dresses we're seeing. Yes, please. I couldn't sleep last night thinking about it. -[laughs] Shut up! -You are such a good sport. No, he isn't. He just thinks that after we see dresses, -we're going to go... -Yeah? -...on a pub crawl. -[Jesse] Mmm-hmm. But actually we're going to see a play. -You are? -No, we're not. You said that we'd have to get tickets already. No. We just gotta see some shit nobody else wants to see. -[laughing] -Oh, great. That's awesome. -Yeah, right? -Great. Great. Hey, look, it's finally opening up.

You got me here so early. Yeah, well, it's better to be a half-hour early than one minute late.

Okay. -[automated voice]Nathan.-[cell phone ringing] [Ryan] It's Uncle Nathan. Answer it. Why would he be calling me? Pick it up. [sighs] Thought we weren't talking anymore.

I'm headed right there. I just gotta drop her off, okay? See, that wasn't so bad. Mom says she wishes you guys could find a way to get along. I... I've... I've got to leave, sweetie. But I look like a dork being here this early. I'm sorry. I'll, uh... I'll be picking you up today. Why can't Mom? She said they'd be back from the city today, right? Well... -she can't. -[sighing] Okay. I'll text her. [Daniel] Okay. Okay. Bye. Tell me you love me. I love you, Grandpa. I love you too. [chuckles] -Bye. -Bye. [somber music playing] [car door closes] [sighs] [machine beeping] [Allison weakly] Mom, my head hurts so much. I can't even explain how much pain my head's in. [Diane] Can you click on the morphine again? I've been clicking on it. I'm clicking on it, and nothing is happening. Oh, shoot, you're right. It is empty. We gotta get more. We'll have to get the nurse to get us more. Nathan, why are you looking at me like that? Like what? Is it bad? Do I look that bad? No, he's just upset, sweetheart. He's upset 'cause we've been -so worried all night long. -[Allison] Okay. Okay. This backhoe thing just reversed into the middle of the street. [Diane] I know, I know. [Allison] I didn't know what to do. I know, but you don't have to worry about that right now. -Right, Nathan? -Yeah. No, you just need to focus on getting better. That's all you need to think about, okay? -[Allison] Okay. -Right, Nathan? -Yeah. -[Nurse] Sorry to interrupt, but the police are here to collect a blood sample. Oh, no. Absolutely not. Now is not a good time. She is in a lot of pain. -You have to come back. -No. -[Nathan] She just woke up. -Why are the police here? Unfortunately, I can't. Legally, the sample has to be drawn as soon as possible. We waited for her to stabilize, but with an accident like this, it's imperative we test... What is he talking about? It wasn't my fault. -Officer, she doesn't know. -It wasn't her fault. With an accident of this magnitude involving fatalities, we're required... -She hasn't been told. -Fatalities? She hasn't been told, -you fucking asshole! -[whispers] Fuck. -[Diane] She didn't know. -Mama, what's going on? -I'm so sorry, honey. -What is he talking about? I'm so sorry. [Allison] Nathan? Nathan, what's going on? They're gone. They're both gone. Who's gone? [Diane] Honey... [melancholy music playing] [sighs] No, Mom. [gasping] [voice breaking] Why, Mom? [Diane] I'm so sorry, honey.

And the others are ankle weights. Remember? We said we were gonna get in shape? Oh, my God. Allie, what the hell did you do to your hair? What? It's makeover Monday. -It's Friday. -Oh. -It's so dark in here. -No, please, don't open that. Mama, that is so bright! [Diane] Did you go to physical therapy today? Um, well, I tried to, -but I overslept. -Allie... What? I don't need PT. I don't. Allie, your hair. You don't like it? I just don't understand why you would cut your own hair. Well, the girl said it was easy, and it was not. What girl? This girl on the Internet. She's an influencer. She influenced me. Such a pigsty in here. I am not happy about this. Hey, Mama, can you tell me where my pills are? Which ones? We said we were going to wean off of them. Remember? -Did we? -Yes. Because ""we"" are in pain and ""we"" need more. They're not gonna give you more, Allie. -They have to! -No, they don't. I need them! Listen to me. You're not in physical pain anymore. Have you been doing the tapping thing that that one shrink taught you? Remember? For anxiety and stress, and it calms you down on the... -eyes, and then the lips. -Mom! [Diane] Or play your piano. That always cheers you up. I don't wanna talk about this, please. I have the worst headache! Can you just stop? Can you call the doctors and help me, please? Which one? Patel? He said no more. Okay, well, fuck Patel. Fuck Patel! How about Goldberg, or... or Fong? -Allie... -Please, Mom. -Just call 'em. Just help me. -You're being a little... -No. -Just help me, please. Guess what? They all said ""no."" Patel. Goldberg. Fong. Rosenberg. Okay, well, I'll try Vromen. He loves me. Vromen is an orthodontist. Yeah, but he used to flirt with me when his fingers were really deep inside my mouth, and it was very inappropriate, and so, he really owes me one. Allie, I don't like how you're acting. You know what? Enough is enough. You gotta get out of this living room, take off your pajamas, and get your ass, and go get a job. I'm sick of this crap. As if you have any right lecturing me on medicating myself. What is that supposed to mean? It means, Mom, you're such a fucking hypocrite! You don't think that I clock how many Xanax you take? Or how many glasses of wine you drink? You think I'm just a zombie that doesn't notice anything, but I notice fucking everything! I see you. So, can I have my pills, please? You're not listening. There's no more. [breathes heavily] [Diane] You get right back here, -you little brat! -No! What in the hell do you think you are doing? Get out of there! -Get out of there! -[Allison] Get off me! -No! Get out of there! -Let go! -[Diane] What are you doing? -No! Are they in here? -[Diane] Get back! Cut it out! -You are hurting me!

See, you talk to people like that, bitch, that's why you have no fucking friends. Why are you hitting on me, huh? Uh, I'm not the one named ""Ryan."" It's a fucking dyke's name. You a dyke? -Only when I fuck your mother. -Oh, at least I have a mother. What the fuck did you just say to me? Hey! Stay away from Damien, you fucking whore. Hey! Break that up, Ref! -[Ryan grunts] -[whistle blowing] [referee] Break it up. Break it up! Hey! [whistle continues blowing] [referee] Hey! That's it! You're both out. Red card. [Daniel] Ryan, what the hell was that? [huffs] I quit. [tearfully] I quit. I hate this fucking game. Why? Because you got in a fight? Come on, that's not you. You're tough. You're not a quitter. -She made fun of Mom. -What? She said, ""At least I have a mom."" Well, fuck her. Well... And what kind of a punch was that? You throw this hard right hook and then you leave yourself wide open for the jab. We're gonna have to work on that. [mellow music playing] [breathing heavily] Hi. I'm here to get a prescription refilled. Last name, Johnson. Birthday, August 24th. Okay. For which medication? Uh... The Oxy. OxyContin. It says here you are out of refills. I see you've been on them for over a year now. Your doctor's probably trying to wean you off of them. As I'm sure you know, they can be very addictive. Oh, really? I hadn't fucking heard that. Sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Listen... I was in a really bad car accident, and I need them, because I'm in a lot of pain. Just now? What? No. Your elbow is bleeding. Oh, shit. Look, it's fine. Let me go get you a bandage. I don't need a fucking bandage. It's fine. Then take this. Oh, my goodness. Thank you so much. Thank you. I feel so much better now. Thank you. Fucking bitch. [hip-hop song playing] [instructor on speaker]Burn,but guess what that burn is?That burn is in your soul.It is lifting you up.You are climbing that mountainand you are reachinghigher heightsthan you ever have before.Keep pedaling.[breathing heavily] [unnerving music playing] [inhales sharply] [sniffles] [gurgles] [swallows] [exhales sharply] [whimpers] [panting] [back-up alarm beeping] [horn blaring] [gasping] [panting] [mellow music playing] -[gasps] Hi. -Hi! -Hey! -Hi! -[giggles] -[Allison] Hi. Oh, my God. I love your hair! -It is so chic. Who did it? -Ah, thank you! Um... I, uh, got a new gal. Well, I gotta get her number. [laughs] Okay. Oh, I was so happy that you reached out. Because you weren't responding to any of my texts. Of course, I wanted to give you your space, but I was worried. -[waiter] Hi, good morning. -Hey! Can I get you anything? Uh, yeah. Can I please get a Jack and Coke? Uh... Sorry, our bar doesn't actually open until 11:00. Oh. Uh, okay. In that case, I'll get a black coffee. -Oat milk latte. -You got it. So, how's, how's work? You're still at Purdue, right? -Still repping Purdue. -Yeah. You'd think it would've been a shit show because of the bankruptcy and all the lawsuits. -Mm. -But, between you and me, my numbers have actually increased. Wow. My bonus last quarter was insane. -It sells itself. [chuckles] -Yeah. Karl Marx was wrong. Turns out the opiate of the masses is opium. [both chuckle] Anyway. How are you doing? When are you going back to work? [smacks lips] Listen, I'm just gonna cut right to it because you're my friend and I know you're gonna understand. Um... I'm still in a lot of pain. Oh, Allie... I know, and my docs are cutting my Oxy scripts because everyone's really freaked out about addiction these days. Uh... [hesitates] So, I was wondering if it would be possible... Allie, please tell me you didn't invite me to breakfast to hit me up for pills. No. -No, no, no, no, no. -[sighs] It's just until I can get in, and see my docs. Um, because my fucking mother, she threw my last refill into the toilet, so... No way. Are you fucking with me right now? No. If you have a problem, you need to get some help. I can help you find the right rehab. Please don't hand me a pamphlet. I already have one. Well, then find them on the street if you have to. Every dive bar in this town's got a guy with a pharmacy in his front pocket. You know, Becka, I really didn't want to do this. But... there's a handful of things that happened at your bachelorette party that I'm pretty sure you want to be kept private. Allison, are you trying to blackmail me for OxyContin? I'm just asking you for help. Like, as a friend. But you did blow that dancer. [chuckles] It happened for a second. I know, I know. But you did it, and I saw. It never went in my mouth. It was in your mouth. It was in your mouth. Past the tip. Past the fucking tip. Allie, you need help. Destroy my life if you have to. But for the love of God, get some fucking help! Okay, bye. Fuck you. Fuck you! [grunts] Uh... I don't... Oh, fuck. [sighs] I don't have any money. I'm really sorry. I can't pay for those. That's okay. Take it. I mixed in a little tequila for you. [slurps] That's disgusting. Thank you. [woman]Mr. Adams,we really wanna doeverything we canto help Ryan.But she needs to take some responsibility for her behavior. That girl does not listen to a thing I say. To be honest, I was hoping you were calling me in here to give me some advice. I need help. [man] It's just that we're a public school. We have 2,000 kids to look after. We don't have the bandwidth to micromanage her in ways that she deserves and needs. So, what are you saying? I will give her an extra strike because of the circumstances. But if she doesn't tone down her language with her teachers and gets into one more fight, we'll have to expel her. [chair scraps] Hi, can I get a double tequila, please? Allison. Yo, I know you. It's Mark. Yeah, hey. Yeah. I haven't seen you since high school. This is Diego. You remember Diego? -Hey. -[Diego] Hey. You just having a little breakfast? Uh... Um... I just... I just needed to get out of the house. [chuckles] Yeah, I feel that. I heard what happened to you. The accident. Saw it in theStar Ledger.Sorry. What happened? [Diego] She was in that accident on the turnpike. Two people died. Holy shit. That was you. Oh, bro. That would've fucked me up. It wasn't my fault. Yeah, I'm sure. But, like, still... [Mark] Damn. [exhales sharply] Hey, can I have another one, please? You having a tough day? Just a day. I just wanna get as far away from here as possible. Yo, there's this app, it tells you the exact opposite of where you are on the globe is. That's where you should go. I'll look it up for you. [Mark] Yo, that's how I feel every fuckin' day of my life. I can't seem to escape this town. It's like there's a force field around it or something. Like, some people know how to get outta here. But the rest of us, we just keep banging our heads up against the glass. It's Perth. That's the city on the other side of the globe from here. You should go to Perth. I don't have enough money to get to Perth, but thank you. Aren't you engaged to Nathan Adams? I was, yeah. He was an amazing running back in high school. He used to run every fucking play. -You remember him, Mark? -[Mark] Yeah. [Diego] Every fucking play, they'd come on the PA system like, ""Nathan Adams, the ball carrier. ""Nathan Adams, the ball carrier."" He was the whole fucking team. You remember him, Mark? Yeah, I remember him. Isn't he deaf? Uh... In one ear. Since birth. Wow, that's impressive that he could be, like, that good, you know? And half deaf. So you're, like, single? [Mark chuckles] Yo. Shut the fuck up, Diego. What? You think she's gonna date you? Where are you gonna take her? You live with your mom. [chuckles] God damn. Allison, I'm sorry. My fucking friend has no tact at all. [chuckles] We're not used to having pretty girls such as yourself come in here. So, you gotta excuse his lack of decor. Decorum. What? ""Decor"" is the Bud Light lamp above my head. ""Decorum"" is his behavior. Neither is currently ideal. [men cheering] Hey, can I ask you something, like, between us old friends? You weren't our friend. You were popular. -You were a bitch, actually. -All right. Diego. That's old shit. Right, Allison? We're past that. We're grown-ups. Those of us stuck behind this force field, -we gotta stick together. -[Allison] Yeah. Um, do you know where I could get some Oxy? [chuckling] God damn, girl. No foreplay. No nothing. No ""How are you? How's your family?"" No, we don't fuck with pills. I remember in high school you were the guys that could, like, get anything. And now you're just buttering us up. I don't have any money. How are you gonna pay for that tequila? I hadn't got that far yet. [sighs] -Is that Rolex real? -Wait a second. Wait. Allie Johnson. Miss lovely Allie Johnson. [grunts] You just stroll in here. [chuckling] You got no money. And you expect us to get you Oxy? For free, and then you want us to pay for your drink. Why the fuck would we do that? Nostalgia? Old friends? You thought you were such hot shit in high school. You're no fucking different now. All right. Shut up. Sorry. This guy. No decorum. No, he's right. I didn't think I was better than you. I knew it. I looked down on guys like you. I thought you were Jersey trash that would never be able to make it out of town. [snorts, laughs] Fucking bitch. But now you're sitting here right beside us and you're looking for a fix. A favor. The favor is a fix. -You're a fucking junkie now. -No, I'm not. -You're a fucking junkie. -No. -[Mark] Yeah, you are. -Yeah, you are. Come on. You're a fuckin' junkie. No. I'm not like you. Allie Johnson, you're so much more like who you think we are than we actually are. Come on. Say it, say it, say it. ""I'm a fucking junkie."" You might like it. Fuck you. It's a pill. It's heroin in a pretty little dress. I thought you were the nice one. Why don't you say it? Say... Say, ""I'm a fucking junkie,"" and then I'll get you whatever you want. Anything. Say it. Just, like, just come out with it. I'm currently reliant... No, that's not what I fucking said. You sneaky little bitch. That's not what I fucking said. -Is that what I said? -No. That is not what I said. Say you're a fuckin' junkie. Look at me. Look at me! Look me in the eyes, and say, ""I'm a fucking junkie."" Say it! I'm a fucking junkie. Good girl. Beth, I got these tequilas. I'm sorry for raising my voice. We're just catching up. Allie, this is Beth. She's divine. She's the best. [soft music playing] That's not Oxy. Same shit. [coughs hoarsely] [inhales sharply] [exhales] [breathing heavily] [vomits] [groaning] Thank you. Ooh, she just walked in. Oh, my God. I was so worried about you. Where were you? -I'm so sorry. -Oh, babe, oh. -I'm sorry. -Uh-huh. No... I need help. I know. I never should have flushed those pills down the toilet. I had no right. I'm so sorry. I was just so worried. Can you help me, please, Mama? Yes, yes, I already did. Here, I got these from Linda. She's the woman who works next to me in the toy kiosk at the mall. Her doctor gave them to her after she got punched in the face by a shoplifter, but she said she didn't need them. She swore by the neck brace. But you need 'em, honey. So here. That right there is a gift from Linda, okay? And we can worry about kicking it later. Let's not rush things. What matters the most is that you're home safe. Oh, babe. [kisses] Oh, my baby. Hey, Ry? [muffled music playing on speaker] Got Chinese food! I got sweet and sour chicken, beef with broccoli, steamed rice. Where are ya? Hey, Ry? Ryan! [hip-hop music playing on speaker] [gasps] What the... Daniel, get out! -[boy whimpering] -Hey. Hey! [boy] Okay. Whoa, whoa! Okay. Whoa, whoa, whoa. Calm down! It's not what you think. I'm pretty sure it is what I think. How old are you? Daniel! Get off of him. Shut up! I asked you a question, boy. How old are you? -I'm 20. -She's 16, and I'm an ex-cop. Looks like you picked the wrong girl. You're choking him! She said she was 18 online. If I ever catch you near my granddaughter again, I'm gonna rip your fucking dick off and shove it down your throat. You feel me? [gasping] Yes, sir. Yes. Get the fuck out of here. Yes, sir. Uh, I need my clothes. They're in my house. They're my clothes now. Run away! [Ryan] Daniel! Get out of my fucking room! What the fuck? [loudly] Hey, look, everybody! Statutory rapist from Williamsburg! I need my keys! Oh, his keys! His keys! Look at him! He's scrambling to his car! Statutory rapist! Hey, Belinda, I found this fool in bed with my Ryan. She said... She said she was 18 online. You're a fuckboy. He's a fuckboy! That's what the kids call them! Get out of our neighborhood, fuckboy! [grunting] Okay. Okay! [Belinda] Get out of here, fuckboy! All right! All right! Right fucking now! -Wet, flaccid fuckboy! -[boy] Okay, okay! Okay! I cannot believe you just did that! Give me your phone. Give me the fucking phone right now! You're grounded. You hear me? You're grounded until... Shit, I can't think of when you won't be grounded. You can't just lock me up, Daniel. For the last fucking time, Ryan, you call me ""Grandpa.""

Trust me, I know how hard it is to get here. It's damn near impossible, and you did it. Don't run away now because of me. There are thousands of meetings. -I'll find another one. -Well, yeah, but this one has the best snacks. -I wanna go. -No. No, no. You've made it this far, and I wouldn't. I don't wanna be here. Nobody does in the beginning. [tearfully] I don't wanna be anywhere. Then you are definitely in the right spot. I thought you were sober. Ten years. I kinda slacked off coming to regular meetings, and then lately, I... I realized I need the support. Because of what happened? No, no, no! No, it's... Is the accident the reason why you came back? No, I just feel that... Daniel, am I the reason why you're back here? Yes! Yes, of course. What the hell do you want me to say? -I'm sorry. -No. Look. I got ten years, and lately, I've been feeling like I really, really want a drink. This works. Thank you. Um, I'm gonna find somewhere else. There are thousands of these meetings. Yeah, but somehow you found your way to this one. Now isn't that something? All right, come on. Come on. Okay. [woman]Everybody, welcome.This is the regular meeting of the Live and Let Live group of Alcoholics Anonymous. My name is Simone, and I'm an alcoholic, and your secretary. Let us open the meeting with the Serenity Prayer. God... [all] ...grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change, the courage to change the things I can, and the wisdom to know the difference. Hey, you got up awfully early this morning. I went to an NA meeting. -[gasps] What? You did? -Mmm-hmm. Mmm-hmm. Oh, Allie. I'm so happy to hear that. [Allison] Well, I'm not saying I'm gonna go again. Well, you gotta start somewhere, and sounds like you did. -Mm-hmm. -So that's good. I don't know if I'll be able to just quit, though, Mom. I think I need real help, like an in-patient program or something. Well, honey, neither of us has insurance, so how the hell are we supposed to pay for that? I mean, you gotta get a job. Mom, who's gonna hire me like this? -Come on. -Like, no... What do you mean? You're a beautiful 26-year-old woman. -You're smart, you're funny... -No, I'm not. No, I'm not. -Yes, you are. -No, I'm not. That's the old me you're describing. You're still you. No, I'm not! I'm... [sighs] I'm something else. I'm something... Ugh. Um... I was thinking, um... You know how Dad was probably gonna get me a wedding gift, or, well, at least he was gonna come, right? Maybe instead of whatever it was that he was gonna give me, maybe he could help pay for me to get help. And so, I was wondering if you would call him for me. Allie, I will never speak to that man as long as I live. Do you know what he did? He packed his car up, and he left us with nothing. But it is what it is, okay? So, you gotta pull yourself up by your bootstraps, now. Thanks, Mom. Yeah, I'm sorry I can't get over this as fast as you want me to. -Allie... -Nah. [somber music playing] [Daniel] Well, look who it is. Hi, Dad. What brings you to the less glamorous side of the river? Ryan asked me to come see her. Turns out, she really wanted me to talk to you. -Oh? -She's worried about you. She's worried about me? That girl's crazy. She says she thinks you need a friend. Hell, I don't need a friend. I need a dog crate the size of a teenager. Look, Nathan, I understand your need to move on after the breakup... but, hell, I never imagined I'd be doing this all by myself. You raised two kids. I had your mother. And you and your sister were much better behaved than Ry. [Nathan scoffs] What? Come on. Speak your mind, son. We were good because we were terrified of you. So, I'm not surprised you don't have any tools in your arsenal since you lost the only one that you had. Fear. I have apologized 100 times to you for the way I was. Your sister found a way to give me another chance. How come you can't? 'Cause Molly never really got the brunt of it, did she? I guarantee you that if she was standing here now, she would be begging you to drop this shit, and help me raise her child. Well, she isn't. No, she's not. I have to catch the train. I saw Allison. Where? Not supposed to say. AA? Not supposed to say. What the hell does she need AA for? -I'm not supposed to... -To say. I got it. Of all the meetings, she ends up at yours? She saw me, she tried to run away, but I pulled her back. Why? She's suffering, Nathan. Broken. Lost. You're the one who blamed her! I stood by her! Yeah, until she left your ass. Sorry. Sorry, that came out harsher than I meant. I have to catch the train. [Daniel] Please, Nathan. I need help. Ryan asked me to come by and say ""hi"" to you. And I did. Okay. Hi. [playing classical music] -Best first date ever.-I heard that.[Allison laughing] [Daniel]I used to drinkwhiskey until I blacked out.Wake up the next morning to find out what I had done, who I had been. [chuckles] My father was a drunk. He beat me right up to the day he died. And I vowed I would never lay a hand on my children. And I didn't... while I was sober. But in the blackness... I always denied because I really couldn't remember. Sometimes there'd be a bruise. ""Oh, you must have fallen down. ""I'm your daddy. I would never hurt you."" August 11th, '99... I woke up on my front porch to the sound of church bells... and an ice cream truck. So, I knew it was Sunday. First thing I saw was my captain standing over me, poking me in the ribs with his nightstick. An ambulance. My son, Nathan, sitting in the back, bleeding from the head. Medics had bought him a popsicle. Turns out that... [sighs] in the blackness... I had beat him so bad that he lost the hearing in his right ear. Forever. And to this day, every time I see him, I beg for his forgiveness. It's just a little dance we do. A mere formality. Because we both know... that there are some things that are just impossible to forgive. I do believe even God knows that. When I was a cop, I used to eat here every day. Free coffee refills. You hungry? No. [Daniel] Hmm. Funny, the things we stop caring about. I used to want to travel. I would leaf throughNational Geographicand dog-ear all of the exotic places I would visit once I retired. Never do that now. -You still could. -No, no. I couldn't. I wasn't drunk, or on anything, by the way. What? When I saw you the other day at the meeting, I instantly got worried that you may have thought that I was drinking or on drugs on the day of the accident, and I wasn't. I was sober. It wasn't my fault. I have every report ever written committed to memory. Right. So, you know that it was the backhoe guy's fault, Alvarez. I don't wanna get into that all right now. Okay, yeah, you're right. Nathan said that he was deaf since birth. He never told you? Maybe he wanted me to like you. I doubt that. I thought that raising Ryan would offer me the chance to be a better father than I ever was. Shit. I'm in way over my head. I got one of those audiobooks from the library. How to Talk to a Teen.[chuckles] Oh, yeah? How's that working out? -Well, it's from the '80s... -[laughs] It's on a cassette. Right. Its advice is, ""Chaperone a dance."" [laughs] ""Chaperone a dance."" I just caught her having sex with a boy who looked like a man. A dance would be delightful. Can I give you some advice from a former teenage girl? She's gonna have sex. And nothing you say is gonna change that. Just make sure she's on birth control. -Birth control? -Yeah. She's 16! No, we'll be going the abstinence route. No offense, Daniel, but, uh, there's a knot in your logic. You're trying to solve a problem by looking in the other direction. I could talk to her if you want me to. Oh, well, no thanks. -It's okay. Of course. -That's not appropriate. I don't even know why I just said that. -I'm sorry. -No, it's okay. It's just that I don't think that it's... I just felt the need, um, the instinct to help in some way. It's the least I could do. I don't know how to do this. What? Start all over. How do you do it? [Daniel] Takes work. -Can I tell you a secret? -Sure. I'm not sure I have the will. What does""amor fati""mean? [Daniel sighs] Certain things are private. Do you think I'm fucked up? Are you high right now? No. I was a cop for 40 years. I was an addict for 50. So, I'm gonna ask you again. Are you high right now? Well, I... I broke a pill in half. So, half. Yes, I think you're fucked up, Allison. Not half. All fucked up. Do you think I'll ever pull out of this? I mean, like, maybe one day I might be the kind of person that people want their granddaughter to hang out with? I have no idea. Me neither. [soft country music playing] Can I have my phone back, please? I'm running out of ideas on how to handle you, Ryan. Grandpa, everybody at my age has sex. It's, like, not a big deal. I know it was different when you were younger, but that's just, like, not how it is anymore. [smacks lips] Well, let me ask you something. Are you... Are you using any protection? Oh, my God! I am so not gonna talk about this with my grandfather. How the hell do you think I feel? [both sigh] -I know you're upset. -I'm not upset. Maybe you should go back and see that therapist again. No. I just want my phone back. I don't have any friends at Columbia and I want to hang onto the few I still have on Long Beach Island. How come you can't make friends? I've been through a lot this year. [Daniel] Hmm. And nobody really understands. They try. Some, but... I mean, it's fake. Don't you think most people are so fake? I would probably say ""duplicitous."" What does that mean? Fake. [chuckles] I'm on your side. I know. Tell you what. You can have your phone back if you promise to start taking birth control pills. Ugh! Oh, my God! Daniel! Grandpa! [sighs] Grandpa. Is it a deal? I'll make the appointment. Fine. Fine. I just never want to talk to you about sex ever again. Oh, really? 'Cause I just love this shit. Have you ever been on campus before? Not since I was a kid. I used to do swim meets here. -Oh, yeah? -Yeah. -You were a swimmer? -[chuckling] Uh, yeah. Well, I was 12, but yeah, I was pretty good. I still have all the trophies and the ribbons. -That's cool. -Mmm. -What stroke? -Mostly freestyle. Why'd you stop? Um, my dad left. Yeah, it was kinda the thing that we used to do together. He would cheer so loud I could hear him underwater. [chuckles] Seemed kind of pointless to do it without him. -Where'd he go? -Ohio. Started a whole new family in Ohio. Wow. He has 10-year-old twins. Yeah. I don't know if they swim or not, though. Oh, man. I am always just amazed at people who can, like, up and leave their kids like that. [Allison] Mmm. I just don't know how you could, like, fucking sleep at night. For so long, I thought that I'd done something wrong. Like, it was my fault, or I'd let him down. And then I just realized, I don't know, maybe some people just aren't good. [Simone] Hmm. It's kinda like he, like, restarted a level in a video game with a fresh life. -[both laugh] -That's exactly what he did! He packed up the car, and left his Rolex in the attic of my dollhouse, and he drove away. Hey, let's sit for a second, okay? -Yeah, yeah. -[clears throat] Uh... So, I'll sponsor you. -Okay. -But, um, you gotta start taking this shit seriously. You can't keep coming to meetings high. What? [chuckles] How did you know? [laughs] Uh, because I was you. And I've helped dozens of women who were you. And some beat it, and some are dead. But, you know, if you want my time, you gotta commit. Because I have a toddler so I just -don't have time for bullshit. -Yeah. No, I do. I... I... I really wanna beat it. Then I want you to do 90 meetings in 90 days. -Wow. -Yeah. And, um, we're gonna get you started on step one. Okay. Okay. Also, enough hiding out, man. It's time you shared with the group. -All right. -Uh... [nervously] Hi, I'm Allison, and I'm addicted to, uh, pills. [group] Hi, Allison. [Allison] Uh... Sorry. Can I start again? I've never done this before, and I'm nervous. You got it. [breathes deeply] Hi, I'm Allison, and I'm an addict. [group] Hi, Allison. I... Um... I was the driver of a car that was in a really bad accident. Two people died. The woman was... The woman was about to be my sister-in-law. We were on our way to try on my wedding dresses. [shudders] And then we weren't. It wasn't my fault. [sighs] I wasn't on drugs or booze, or drunk, or anything. But, uh... [voice breaking] Surviving that day was, is... the most painful thing I will ever have to live through. [sniffles] I got hurt, too. They put a hole in my head. And, um, [sniffles] that helped because at least I had something I could blame the pain on. But then that healed... and I was still hurting. And I guess that's why I didn't realize how bad it was because to me... [breathes shakily] I was still in so much pain. -[shuddering] -[rubbing stomach] I was, um, prescribed them for physical pain, and they really helped with that. They really did. But they made me numb. Blissfully numb. Without them I want to die. [sniffles] Every day. I've never said that out loud before. [sobs] Um... I've never really faced reality without them. [sniffling] And I don't know if I'll be able to handle what I see, but I'm here to try. Okay. That's it. [sniffles] That's it. [sighing heavily] What happens now? [breathing heavily] [toy train horn tooting] You made all of this? Uh, I assembled it and designed it. Yeah. You see, the houses come as a kit. You just assemble them and paint them... Schoolhouse, I built from scratch. Hey, there are two kids making out back here. -That's me. -[chuckles] -You were handsome. -[laughs] And tiny. Yeah, my very first kiss behind the schoolhouse. Olivia Williams. It was fall. Tip of her nose was cold. [chuckles] Little runny. She stood on tiptoe. Tasted like bubble gum. [Allison] Is that who you married? No! No, no. No, she dumped me the next day for Charlie Cook. -Oh. -He smoked Camels. And drove a Buick Riviera Roadmaster. So, is this all inspired by your life? Kinda. Supposed to be South Orange. I grew up here. I was a cop in Newark. I've always lived here. Who's the soldier? [Daniel] That's me. Day I got home from Vietnam. That other little figure there is my father. He came down to the station to pick me up. -This is incredible. -Mm. How long did it take you? Years. I started with a single figure-eight and a two-car train. I work on it when I can. Got more time now that I've retired. My wife passed. Ryan used to hang out with me down here. She liked the whistle and the microphone. There's a microphone? Right over there. How else you gonna tell your passengers -that the train's coming? -[laughs] [toy train horn tooting] [chuckles] [Allison singing ""Take The Last Train to Clarksville""] ♪Take the last trainto Clarksville ♪♪And I'll meet youat the station ♪♪You can be there by 4:30 ♪♪'Cause I bookedyour reservation♪♪Don't be slow ♪[both singing] ♪Oh no no no♪♪Oh no no no ♪♪And I don't knowif I'm ever♪[both sing] ♪Coming home ♪[Daniel laughs] That was just a little serenade for your people from the heavens above. Think that's one of the reasons I enjoy it so much. Why? 'Cause you get to play God? Well, so much of my life has been outta control. Down here, I get to decide if Olivia chooses me. I get to decide if my father comes to pick me up at the station when I get home. Did he? No. He was passed out drunk in our backyard. He'd lain face down so long, an inch of snow had gathered on his back. Next morning at breakfast, he offered me a beer, so... I had a beer with him at breakfast, and I never stopped. When did you last talk to Nathan? Daniel, this is God. Allison would like you to change the conversation now. -I'll bet she would. -[chuckles] All right. Let's get outta here. [switch clicks] [music playing on headphones] [Daniel] Ryan? It's only one o'clock. Why are you home? We had a half-day for the active shooter drill. -I told you this morning. -[Daniel sighs] Well, this is a friend of mine from the program. Hi. Hi. -You should probably get going. -Yeah. Yeah. I'm gonna go. Wait, I know you from somewhere. No, you don't. You do? How do I know you? Uh... My... I'm... I'm Allison. Yeah, I've seen you before. I thought you said the active shooter drill ended at 2:00. Yeah, that's when the pretend shooter fights back. Today, he shot himself, so we got out early. Why do I know you? I'm not sure what I'm supposed to say. -You were Nathan's fiancee. -No. -You were in the car. -No. -I was, yeah. -Weren't you driving? Wasn't she driving? We're in the program together. -But I thought you said it was her fault. -What? How could you bring her into our house? Get out of our fucking house! -Okay. It's okay. -[Daniel] I'm sorry. I... I'm so sorry. I thought you were in school. You ruined my fucking life! I know, I know, I know. I'm... I'm really sorry. [crying] You shouldn't be here! This is our house! My mom grew up in here! I sleep in her bedroom. I use her sheets! [Daniel] All right. All right. She's leaving. Uh, just in case this is the last time I ever get to talk to you, please know, I also wish it was me. Okay? I do. I'm gonna go. [voice breaking] I never got to say goodbye. [Allison sighs] I know. They were going to see a play. I know. She wanted to see a musical, because she loved all the fancy costumes. I didn't know that. She said you made Nate really happy. That you were the best thing that ever happened to him. He made me happy, too. [softly] Okay, I'm gonna go. -[door opens] -Allison. Yeah. Would you like to stay for dinner? What? Uh... So, you're an alcoholic, too? [chidingly] Ryan. Uh, no. Alcohol's not exactly my problem. -What is? Meth? -[Allison snorts] Ryan. No. Not meth. Um... [smacks lips] Prescription painkillers. Oxy. How do you know about Oxy? Kids at my school snort it. It's heroin! No, it's not. I could get it easier than I could get a beer. They sell it at Rite Aid. [Daniel scoffs] -So why'd you dump Uncle Nate? -Ryan. [Ryan] He said you ghosted him. It's not your business. I just don't understand how if he was gonna stay with you, even after everything that happened, why'd you dump him? I was upset. And so I ran. -Like you, quitting soccer. -[curtly] Shut up! You don't say ""shut up"" to me! Ever again! Why'd you quit soccer? -She got into a fight. -'Cause I hate every girl on the team. Oh. Your parents were telling me how amazing you were. -They were? -[Allison] Mm-hmm. Your dad actually was saying how you were definitely gonna get a scholarship. I wanna go to Stanford. [Daniel laughing] Why are you laughing? You quit the team, you're mouthing off in school, and you're not doing your homework. You're gonna get into Stanford? I didn't say I quit the team permanently. I said I wanted to take a break. And I had a 4.0 down the shore. I could get it back in a second if I cared. Why don't you care? Why, do you think? -[Daniel] Shit. -[Allison] Okay. Why don't we just call it a night, okay? [Allison] Yeah, I'm gonna go home. Hey, um... [tears off page] Um, just in case you, I don't know, wanna talk, need to talk... This is me. And it's up to you, but I'm here. Okay. [receding footsteps] [Daniel] I'm sorry about all that. [Allison] Uh, it's fine. You see what I'm dealing with. Honestly, it's okay. Look. [sighs] She's a very fragile kid. So, I'd appreciate it if you didn't contact her. Oh. Okay. Yeah, I just... [stuttering] I just wanted her to know that I was available if she wanted to talk or anything. I'm just asking if you will please just let her be. Scout's honor. No, that's Spock's ""Live long and prosper."" We Boy Scouts do this. Oh. I prefer Spock. Live long and prosper, Daniel. -[Daniel] Good night. -Thank you. [piano keyboard playing] Mmm. [humming] [resumes playing keyboard] [plays descending notes] [keys clang] [cell phone chimes] [indistinct background chatter] [chuckles] [chuckling] [crowd cheering and applauding] Go, baby! Go, go, go! [quietly] Come on, come on, come on. [woman] Come on! Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! -Yeah! -[crowd cheers] Attagirl! Attagirl! [cheering continues] [mouthing] Thank you. [somber music playing] [bed creaking] [heart beating] [breathes heavily] [fan creaking softly] [cell phone chimes] [Ryan]Why do you rideyour bike everywhere?Um... I haven't been in a car since the accident. 'Cause you feel guilty? Uh, no. Because I feel... scared. Daniel says you were using your phone. [Allison] Uh, I was using Maps. Everyone uses Maps. Yeah, well, he has all the reports. He's memorized them. He stares at them at night. It's weird. Okay, well, I was there. And the person who wrote those reports wasn't, so... [Ryan] Tell me why you ended it with Nate. My mom would want you guys to be together still. Ryan, I don't even know what to say to that. My mom used to really, um... just, like, look out for him and stuff, you know? Um... And... I've been thinking maybe now I'm supposed to. Because she can't. I bet that would make her really proud. I could tell you about what's happening -with him if you want. -No, that's okay. Thank you, though. I've tried really hard to avoid all of that... He moved to Tribeca. Wow. Yeah. He has a dog. -A dog? -Mm-hmm. A French Bulldog named Jasper. He never really struck me as a Frenchie type, but okay. [chuckles] It's his girlfriend's. Oh. [Ryan softly] Yeah. I... I don't need to hear this. -Are you okay? -Mm-hmm. How long have they been going out? I don't know. Like, four months, I think. Wow. Yeah. She's a paralegal. I don't even know what that is. Is that, like, a good thing? [voice breaking] Yeah. Wow. -You just keep saying, ""Wow."" -Yeah. It's just a lot to take in. Um... I'm really happy for him. I am. He really deserves to be happy. I... -I shouldn't have told you. -No, no, no. It's fine. But you're upset. We went through so much together. I really want good things to happen to him. I'm really sorry -I made you upset. -[Allison] It's okay. -I'm gonna go to the bathroom. -I really meant for this to be friendly. Yeah. I'll see you in a second. [breathing heavily] [door slams] [brooding music playing] [crying softly] [phone camera clicking] [sobbing] [continues sobbing] [sniffles] Hey. Is something wrong? I, um... I forgot I have a job interview. So, I'm gonna go. [sniffles] -You sick? -[sniffles] [voice breaks] Yeah. -Withdrawal? -I'm trying. All right. Look, don't stop. -Okay? -Okay. Don't use. Okay. Don't stay home tonight. Do something. -Okay. Okay. -All right? Okay. You need a hug? [voice breaking] Um, if I hug you, I'm gonna sob, so no. Well, I can handle that. No, I shouldn't. Not in front of Ryan. [sniffles] Okay. Well, I'm hugging you with my eyes. Thank you. -Be careful. -Okay. [Allison] I have to go. So, I'll see you another time. Bye. [whispers] Fuck me. Hey. Let's go. This asshole charged me six buck for a cup of coffee. Come on. Okay.

What do you think? [groans] [cell phone chimes and vibrates] [Diane] I was thinking it'd be so cute if it was like something fun that we could sell.

I tried texting them, but, you know, they all go green. Do you know what that means? I have no idea. I hate when that happens, when they go... It's all green and you don't know if it's sent.

KATHRYN: (ON TV)Welcome backto I Believe in Miracles.Thousands are gathering every week to listen to one of the young men who is central to the new Jesus Movement. Lonnie Frisbee.LONNIE: Thousands of people are starting to get saved. And it's happening right here in my church, Calvary Chapel. I've really been building it up. God has chosen himself some unexpected prophets. Are you one of those prophets, Lonnie? Well, I told God to use me, and he sure is using me. So I would say, yes, I think so. KATHRYN: I think so, too, Lonnie. REPORTER: (ON TV)As the Jesus Movementcontinues to work its wayfrom the Haight-Ashburyin San Franciscoto Southern California,the question many peopleare askingis whetherthe Jesus peopleare a new religiousgroup or a cult?CRITIC: (ON TV)That's thetrouble with Haight-Ashbury.We need more ministersdown there preachingthat these kids can clean up.I'm tired of theseBob Dylan preacherswho go around the streetstelling these kidsthat they can haveall this and Jesus, too.They're not preachingthe Gospel.We have a churchthat is permissive,total breakdownof discipline...-LONNIE:Riverside?-Disrespect for law and order.I don't get it. We already have our own Wednesday night service. Their church is struggling. Father Malone is getting a little older. He's having difficulty reaching the youth. Well, why don't you do it? It's a youth service (CHUCKLES) for teens and 20s. It's perfect for you. You're trying to get rid of me. Come on, Lonnie. Please, don't get dramatic. It's one night a week. And... there have been some concerns about our methods. I think it's time we pull back on the theatrics. The theatrics? Is that what you think I do? -No, not per se. -Theatrics? Look, I think you're an amazingly gifted man. I think it's possible you may actually walk hand in hand with God. I am so grateful that you came here. But we have to start paying attention to the idea that we can control how we're perceived. What does it matter how we're perceived, Chuck? Kids are getting saved by the Holy Spirit. And you can't control the Holy Spirit, man. But we can control our ministry. And we must. I'll cover things here while you help them there. No. No, I don't feel the Lord calling me to that. Mmm-mmm. GREG: I'll do it. Yeah, I, uh... I feel called. I was just picking up more tracts. No, that's okay. Uh, door's always open. (CHUCKLES) Uh... Why not, Greg? (CHUCKLES) Far out. Great. Okay, thank you.

It's a fair question. You should really stay for dessert. They do blood samples and fingerprints. PILAR: Oh, Dodie. GREG:Look, Mr. Martin,I know that you may not approve of everything that Cathe and I are doing, but I just think that it may be because you don't understand it really. And what I want you to know is that it's real. It really is. And I've got plans for my life, sir. And I just want Cathe to be a part of that. (SIGHS) You're right, Greg. I don't understand it.

They left an empty, abandoned building where a church used to be. Seems a shame, doesn't it? But that's what people do sometimes. They lose sight of what's important. Fortunately, God has a long history of using flawed people. I'm sorry, son. I didn't stand up for you when I should have. I was wrong for that. Thank you. So, what happened to that church?

Excuse me, thank you, thank you. - All right, let's go over to the next scene. There's more room in there. Voila! Ha-ha! Welcome my pretties on your next stop on the scare zone tour: The Lair of the Slutty Cannibal Vampiress Wench. Now, this poor fellow here is one of the vampiress's victims! He came directly from the Camden dungeon of tortures. The first time Prince Harry saw this gag he 'bout shit himself. You. - Margo. - Perfect! You could work this room, all right? You are a slutty blood sucking vampire seeking victims. Now, let me hear you hiss! - Hiss? - Yep. - Uh, hisssss. - Okay, uh, let me hear you, a, shriek! - Um, ahhhh. - Well, she's got the slutty part down. - Shut up Trace! - No, no, no, no, no. It's not a problem. Come forth. - Um. - C'mon. This is what will work for you, this is a shaker can. Okay, you come out of the shadows, all right? And then, yee-ahhh! It jars them pretty good. - Cool! Mind if I- - Oh, yeah. All right, all right, all right, settle down, whoa! Settle down, champ. What's your name? - Tyler. - Of course it is. I've got a job for you and the skinny fellow in a big scene down the hall. Moving on! - Hey Bart, Tyler's pretty good with that shaker can, lots of practice. And you get to work with him! - Oh, great. Thanks, dick-weed. - Okay here we come, comin' in, comin in, comin' in, comin' in. Over there, over there, very nice. Now before the big scene, our guests must pass through the lye vat dungeon. - What's a lye vat? - Yeah, lye was used in powder form for cleaning hides, chemically burning away the hair and the fat, yada, yada, yada. But it also came in handy if you were a serial killer trying to hide the stench of your victims. - Gross. - And you are? - Uh, Jake Jacobs. - Spectacular. Come over here. Now you will be in this part of the slaughter dungeon wielding your bloody ax. You'll be dressed in a mask and jump suit like your friend there. - Okay, ohh. Heavier than I thought. - Yeah, that's because it's real. - Okay. - Okay. Do you know how much a good quality fake plastic ax costs? Damn right it's real! It's cheaper and it lasts longer. The blade is not the sharpest thing in the world, but it could hurt like hell if you chop somebody with it. So, you hold it like this, and threaten! All right? Now don't, let anybody grab it from you. - Okay. - Good, okay, moving on. Chop chop! - Oh god it's real. - Okay sexy man is crazy! - This is sweet. - I don't know. I think this Oliver guy knows a little too much about hacking and killing- - Yeah, and he's got plans for ""the skinny fellow"". Chop chop! - Ha-ha! New for this year: The Raw-topsy Zone where, as you can see, a number of hellish morticians are watching a victim getting sliced up on the autopsy table. Now, sitting among the statues, looking just like the dummies will be Tyler and- - Bart. - Bingo! You'll be frozen just like the rest, and then you leap up and boo-yah! You scream at unsuspecting mazers. Now, you don't want to blow your voice out, all right? So scream a couple of times, and then other times you can use this aluminum bat to hit the railing. Just don't hit anybody. Remember, you scare fast then pull back. You don't want some macho creep punching you out. Dangerous. - Somebody takes a swing at me and he's going down! - No, no, no Tyler. We do not slug the paying guests. - Yeah, we're not supposed to touch them at all, right? - That's right. No touchy. Too much liability. However we, the actors, can interact physically with each other. - Tyler's all yours. - For example, Summer here will play a live victim getting sliced up by some mad doctor. You see, he amputates her leg while she's still squirming. It's a good gag. - Oh and I could be your doctor. Check this out! - No, PJ. No, Oliver. I told you, I'm helping you open this thing and then we're going to Vegas to get married like you promised. Right, honey? - Summer, could I talk to you over here for a moment? - Look, I know you want to get the hell out of here and start your new life with prince charming- - Awesome! - Excellent choice by the way. But I really need you here. - No you don't. You've got Claire, okay? I need to get out of my parent's house. So we're getting married this weekend as planned. - Look, open for me this Friday. If you can stay for Saturday and Sunday I will make the honeymoon really special. Come on you're the only seasoned performer I've got. - All right I'll open for you Friday and I'll talk to PJ about this weekend. - Fair enough. Let's show the others where they'll be stationed. And we are walking- - Oh, Tracy. - Uh, I didn't do that- Oh my God I'm gonna puke! - What makes this smell? - My own secret recipe. - Why hello. - Ugh that's bad. That is so cool. - And we're walking. Okay good, come on, everyone through the body bag room. I've turned the AC up in here to turn this sucker into a freezer. Now, to the doll hall! Ha-ha! Isn't this fantastic! All right, and who's left? - Me. Darryl. - Bonanza! You will be in this zone which was last year's big hit. It's entitled Dies and Dolls. You'll be dressed just as you are, freaking people out with your blood stained machete. You know this still is my favorite room. Every child's nightmare lives in the eyes of these lifeless beings. I've been collecting them for years. Years and years. - Yahhhh! You! You are- - Tracy! - Superlative! In this zone you will be a fresh victim wearing a wedding dress and veil working up and down these stairs. Yes, you are a recent victim. Uh, you're turning vampire, holding the bat-baby that you just gave bloody birth to via the old monkey-wrench cesarean. - Oh my god. Can't I just get like a, shakey-up can? - No. No, you show people your mutated newborn. Sir Oliver! It's ready! - Ha-ha! Now, we are in for a treat! Ah, hello Jesus. - No, no, no. ""Hey-Zu"". - Ex-scusi. I'm sorry, what? - It, it's ready. It's ready! - Ah ha-ha! Buen provetcho! And now welcome to the insanity of the Psycho Strobelight Room! Heh-heh-heh. Good! As usual, I will be in the finale area, playing the pumpkin carver, scaring people shitless with Bloody Molly my trademarked signature patent pending gas powered two cycle 20-inch chainsaw. Now, this is where I break one of my own rules, and only I can do it. Bart. Come here. You see? I locked the chain on, so no chain no pain. Just a hell of a lot of vibration and noise. Grazie, Hymie. Now, I wouldn't normally touch anybody with it, but if there's some complete ass acting too cool in front of his friends, I might feel the need to give him a gut check, like ol' Bart there. Now add to this the smoke machines, lots of light and sound effects, the strobe room, the chainsaw finale, yada, yada, yada, we happily freak out the customers who happily scamper into the gift shop to spend more money! Jesus! No, no, no, ""Hey-Zu"". - No, no, no. Whatever. What the hell was that? De nada. Okay, uh, right. You go into the gift shop and wait for Claire. She'll give you your costumes and talk makeup for anybody who needs help. Say that again but slower. - Yeah I've been coming here the past few years. He's only open three nights but at 10 bucks a head he makes a killing. - Oh, dude, I heard he used to manage a house of horrors wax museum in London, but he got busted for using real blood or a real corpse or something. - No, no! I heard he killed a goat live just to watch people react. - Bullshit. - Yeah, no he got fired and went to prison for, like, animal cruelty or something. - Oh no, no. I heard he went to prison because he killed a boney, pasty virgin. - Oh, shut up asswipe. - Ooh, shopping! Oh, I wonder if we get, like, half-off. - Who's the slut? Perfect. All right I designed this look for you with this make-up illustration you can work from. Your costume's over there, go try it on and I'll help you with the makeup later. The bride? Bat-boy's mother? I didn't design the dress. - Thank God. - Bought it at a consignment shop, but it works. And your makeup needs to be more defined. Okay, we need to be able to see it behind the veil. Why don't you slip that on, try it out. - Great. - Dummies? - Yo! - I mean morticians. You guys need to look just like the mortician dummi- - Sorry. - Costumes are over there, and I made boy-friendly makeup directions for you. - Yes! - Makeup is with your costumes and we don't have a lot of room in here so we put on our makeup here in the shop. We rigged up a curtained off changing area, it has one bench and one mirror- - Whoa! - That's for the girls. Boys just use the shop mirror. Masked psychos? I see you have your costume already. Fit okay? - Yeah. Great. - And your mask, it's up there. There's lots of welder's gloves and a mechanic jump suit, just pick ones that fit. Summer? I have your hospital gown and doctor scrubs for PJ if Oliver can talk you two into- - Claire, I don't know. Okay, we're leaving town to get married. - Need a dress? - I look like a doctor. Perverts! - So, Claire, what part do you play? - Yeah, 'cause I really like your costume. - Yeah. - No. I stay here and work the gift shop. Spider gets their money going in, I get 'em going out. All right remember everybody, today Spider rehearses you, but tomorrow night we open. All right? Any questions? - Uh, yeah. Uh, who breaks us? - No breaks. - What? - Look. We're open from seven p.m. until the last guest goes through. All right, that's usually 'till, like midnight on the first two nights and two a.m. on Halloween. - What if I have to pee? - Then pee! There's a toilet right there. And that's for everybody. - Okay, where do I smoke? - Out the back door in the alley. Look, just duck out, do whatever it is you need to do. No one in the maze is going to say ""Hey, there's supposed to be a psycho killer here"". Well, except maybe some of our regulars. You! You were here last year, right? - Uh, I only went though seven times. Not like some of those no-lifes who go through 10 times a night if they can. - Yeah, 'cause you have a life. - Anyway, if you have to take a break just get back to your post quickly so people get their money's worth. It's only three nights. You'll survive. And if we do good business, Oliver takes care of us with nice bonuses. That's why I'm here. - I'm gonna need some help! - All right. Uh, boys, go see what Oliver needs. And then everybody report to Spider after lunch for rehearsals. Tyler! - Yeah! - Every evening one person has to come in an hour early to help Spider and Oliver prep the house for our guests. And you're up first. So, tomorrow at six. - I'll be here at five! - Whatever. - High as you can there, Pablo. - Didn't this used to be like, a Dollar Store? - No, it was a porno shop. - No way! - Yeah! Douche! - You know actually this entire attraction can fit into two pod containers. Yeah! It takes me, Spider and half a dozen man-power guys. We can put the whole thing up in a couple of days. Actually, Pablo, can you get your men together? Uh, todos juntos? - Ah, si si. - Bellissimo. I'll tell ya, the biggest pain in the ass is getting this sign up so hola muchachos. Un, dos, trio! - ""Prepare to be scared. Scare Zone Three this weekend!"" Who comes up with this? - Oliver does. Keeps all this stuff in storage, pulls it out once a year and does his thing. - Hey, how do you think he makes that toilet scene smell so bad? - Ah he shits in the pots and waits for the mold to grow. - No way! - Ha! Jeez Bart, I don't know, maybe he uses old socks or fertilizer or something. What do you think about Claire? - Freak. Goth gone wild. - I don't know, man, awful smart to be a freak. Talented too. - Freak. ""The Psycho-splatter Raw-topsy Slaughter Dungeon."" - Shit mother! - Damn! Maybe I shouldn't have come so early. Hey! I'm here to- - What? - Uh, I think they're ready. Can we open early? - No. Hell no man! Tyler never showed. Me and Oliver had to open this whole damn place by ourselves. Shithead. Hold on. All right, you can go in now. Go! Go-go-go hurry up! All right you pussy worms! You ready to get freaked out? Yeah! - Are you ready for some blood and guts? Yeah! - Then get ready for Scare Zone Three: The Psycho-splatter Raw-topsy Slaughter Dungeon! Yeah! - Opening in just 10 minutes! - Yeah. Hey, no masks in the maze. You guys know that! - Oh, no-no-no. Sorry Spidey. - Oh, hey freaky geeky. How've you been, man? Wow, you guys startin' to multiply now. It was just the two of you comin' in the last couple of years over and over and over again. I mean not that I mind. I like that you guys have no life. Ha! As is our tradition, we have the winner of our promotional Scare Zone T-shirt contest officially unlock the doors to our chamber of horrors! Yeah, baby! Woo-hoo! - It's open! - Thank you Miss Amber! All right boys, you know the score, move inside to my podium and wait there until I give the signal we're open and I snatch your money. Ha! Excuse me, excuse me out of the way please. Hey, man, Scare Zone 2, Dies & Dolls, man. I love loyalty. That's good, that's good stuff. - Yeah, hey, when's Oliver going to offer an unlimited admissions pass for the regular customers. - Heh-heh. Why would he do that? You guys are stupid enough to pay 10 bucks every time. Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha! Hi Claire! - We're good to go. - All right guys now remember no masks, no smoking, no cameras! No checks, no credit cards. Just cash, baby. All right my fellow zonies! Scare Zone Three is now open for business! - Raar! Shit! - Ah yes. - Help me! - Help me. Help me. Stop it! Help me. - Yah! Haaaa! - All clear? Front door locked? All right, that is it for the night! So we did pretty good for the first night, right guys? Everybody got their costumes hung up? Claire will pay everybody and let everybody out. Spider and I will close up the attraction. Thank you for a great first night. Claire, give everybody an extra 60 clams. Spider! Oliver! - Bullshit. This is why I'm leaving. I hate this town. This job is killing me. I'm in desperate need of a spa treatment. - Hey, an extra 60 bucks isn't ba- - And before I get home to my goddamn parents' house where I'm living to try and save money, horn dog over here is going to want to hump me up one side and down the other. Of course I want him to so there goes half the money we just made on a cheap hotel. - We can do it in the car! - We are so out of here tomorrow, Peege. - Um, tomorrow you're opening. - What? - Yeah, Spider has his appointment, Oliver's not in 'till seven, you're the only one that knows how to run the smoke machines. - Oh my God! - Thanks, Summer! ""Thanks, Summer."" - What happened to Amber the T-shirt pixie? - Oh, she's waiting for you in the car. Bart! I'm kidding. Amber is only here for the opening and then she goes to her regular ""night"" job! - Ohhhhhh. - Get it. - Well, that just leaves me, Tracy and Margo! Hey you guys want to hit Denny's? - Sure. - Uh, Darryl? Can you stay a sec and help me count cash? Sure. - Have fun with Edwina Scissorhands. - Is this a lot of money for day one? You're pretty fast with that calculator. Did you learn that at school or... Classic. - He's scared. - That was awesome! - That was better than last year. I'll never get tired of that one. - Hey, boner! - Shut up! Man, if I hear one more ""boner"" line. - I don't know if this is worth an extra 40 bucks, man. We could get killed out here. Hey, I liked flagging parked cars a lot better. - What? - I said I had an amazing night counting money with Claire. - Yeah, sure you did. - Oh, we talked and laughed and she told me about her family. - Yeah, who? The Addams Family? - Yeah! Look, man. She's a freak all right? - All right, a freak that can add. Why are you focusing on her when you know we can have Margo's mangoes and Tracy's tangerines! - Ah man, fu, was that a beer bottle? - Shit mother! - Will you just stop? - What? - Stop it! Peege, can you hand me another liter of fluid? - You know, I'd much rather be giving you my bodily fluids. - That's sweet, honey, but haven't you had enough of me by now? I'll could never get enough of you. You are my- - Don't say it. - You are my- - Don't say it! Big boy. Come on. To the table. To the table! Come on! Take your shirt off, take your shirt off! Take it off! No, stop. - What? - Stop, stop. - There. I got him. - I have to finish opening. - Ahhh, c'mon Summer! - I have to turn on the lights and the sound. Get your shirt! Where's the frickin' audio? PJ! Stop playing with the chainsaw! PJ! Knock it off! PJ! PJ? What the fuck are... PJ? PJ! Scare Zone! Scare Zone! Scare Zone! Scare Zone! Scare Zone! Scare Zone! Scare Zone! Open! Open! Open! - Will you shut up! Oh shut up, calm down. We're not even open for another half an hour. - Can't you open a little earlier? Yeah! - I'm a little busy in here! Let me find something to entertain you until we open. - No! No! Help me! Help me! - That was awesome! Do it again! Do it again! Do it again! Do it again! Do it again! - Hey man, why do I have to do this again? It's PJ's turn! - PJ's gone, all right? You keep them happy. I've got to finish opening the place up. - Wait, wait, wait, wait! - What? - PJ's gone? And Summer too? - Yeah man gone and eloped! Something. I don't know. Look, they opened the place and apparently split. Okay, good luck to 'em, good riddance. Go out there and keep this crowd from rioting! Go, be a man! - I'm all by myself in here! First no Tyler, now no Summer and PJ! - Relax my little mortician, Oliver Peters has it all sorted. At least for tonight. Ta-ta-da-ta-ta-ta-taaaa! Behold! An international twist to our tortuous tale! Hey! - Darryl! You can come in now. C'mon man go. Go, go, go, go, go, go, go. All right people, we're ready for you if your ready for a boo! As I was saying, no masks, no smoking, no... Hey, what are you three, what? You three bong turds trying to get us shut down? - You got a problem with it, ""mon""? - Oh, no baby. I love the devil's lettuce. I also like my job. So, basically what I'm trying to say here is nobody gets in until these three puff-puff mother-fuckers are out of here! Smoke on that! - Hey, hey, shut the fuck up! - Get out of here assholes! - Kiss my ass, bitch! - Who you callin' bitch, bitch? - What are you looking at you big Sasquatch? - Bye-bye boys. Toodles! And now my pretties, Scare Zone Three is open for the second night of fright! Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha! - Ha-ha-ha-ha-ah. I love Halloween. - Whoa! - Shit! - Ha-haaa. - Hey, I hate 20s! - Okay, that's the real dummy there. This light is out. That guy used to be a girl, and this is a fake leg! - Oh, what the hell happened to this? - Who want's a beer? To the best ""day two"" in the history of Scare Zone! Cheers! - We couldn't do any better unless we were actually killing people. That would pack 'em in. - It actually would, you know. - Okay Claire. You're gonna freak out these kids. Look, you guys did great tonight. The spirits of the dead are with us. - Whooooooo! - I would like everybody to take an extra 100 bones out of the till. Okay, Spider, let's go and close up. Oh, I'm gonna need some extra help with a broken window and wall facade. I need two guys to hold it in place while we nail gun it to the wall. It'll only take about 10 minutes. I'll throw in another 20 bucks. - I'm in. - There you go. - No, uh, Oliver, you've been great. You don't have to pay us. - Hey! Shut your pie hole. I could use the ""dinero"". - Heh-heh. Tonight I can afford it. - He can afford it. - Let's go. - Let's go. - Shut up. - Shut up. - Stop tryin' to be me! - Tracy, you've got to help me with my make-up, last time I about took out a whole eyelash. - Okay, hang on a sec. Okay. Let's go! - Sexy. - Yeah. - Senorita Claire, tell Senor Oliver that we will not be performing for this job tomorrow. He's too, como se dice? - Cheap! - Cheap. - So, you need help again counting? Okay. So it looks like Summer and PJ really went for it. Yep, took the plunge. - They're dead. - What? - Dead. Any relationship that is purely physical is death. They're just going to be a statistic. - Well I hear today that two out of three divorces end in marriage. - Not that death is bad. Death of a relationship, of the spirit, death of the body. I saw a dead body once. Have you ever seen a real dead body, Darryl? - Well, I saw my granddad's ashes, it was kind of dusty. - I was 11. I was riding my bike down Old Camp Road when I saw, up ahead, this dust cloud. As I came closer I saw that a truck had run off the road and slammed into a tree. That was okay. Kind of cool. But further away in the grass is what was really great. There was a boy, about my age. Blonde like me. He was lying in the grass. Not moving, not breathing. He must have been sitting in the bed of the truck. Who knows how high or how hard he hit? But now he was on his back, eyes open, looking at the sky. Still. At peace. - Sorry. - Why? It was beautiful. And I was there. No one was around. I reached out, touched his face. Touched his lips. Then a car came down the road and stopped to help. It ruined our moment. That's the closest I've ever come to really knowing a boy. Claire, uh, we have a, uh, we have a question. - Oh my god there's this, there's this phat Halloween party that we want to go to. We want to go, like, and we- - And, look we just want to leave in our costumes. - So, we'll see you there, okay? - Did you just invite her? - Bye ladies of the night! All right, well, I wish Summer and PJ the best I guess. - Darryl, you seem like a nice guy. Don't be like the rest of them. Don't force yourself on them. Don't, don't guilt and chide and force yourself on... Pretty little blonde. Come here, pretty little blonde. Bring your red lips over here. Black lips. Black hair. I'm dead. I'm not your plaything now, I'm dead. Dead! - Okay, I'm officially creeped out. Maybe you should relax. - Sometimes the haze is so thick, the only way I can remind myself I'm still in this world is with the pleasure of pain. Makes me feel good when I'm in control of my pain. I like that. I've never let anyone watch me before, but I like you Darryl. I've been working on this one. This is our secret. Makes me feel good. - Shit, what was that? - You'd better go see. - Holy shit! Can we not perform a simple task without this juvenile Tom-fuckery! - I don't know what happened, it just shot back or exploded or something. I, I don't know. - Hey man. Put the mother fuckin', Jake, put the motherfuckin' nail gun down. - Put it down! Spider, I'm gonna need your shirt. - Oh, yeah. - Darryl, unplug the compressor before it blows again. Damn! - Oh, for fuck's sake! And don't you touch the nail. We're going to let the doctors remove it. C'mon. Let's get him out of here. - I still get my 20 bucks? - Yeah, I'd rather pay that than for the tetanus shots you're gonna need. - Ah, shit mother! - C'mon you assholes! - Suck my balls, Scare Zone. Ha-ha-ha-ha! - What are you doing, bro? I told you she takes the cash when she leaves, man. - I know that, I was just checking. - You guys suck. Let's tag this this shit-hole. Yeehaw! - Yeah, suck my balls! Oh, no, no, no. Check this out. - Whatcha got? Look at this. Whoooooo! - Hey, how 'bout this man? - Oh shit. - Oh my God. Yeah! - He's paying for this. - What an ass. - He so tagged you, man. - Let's just go back this way. Holy shit! Look at this toilet over here! It's so lifelike. - ""Lifelike?"" - Whichever asshole threw me in here, is going to get, ahhh! C'mon bro, this is not, who's that? - It's not real. What have we got over here, man? - No idea. - Please, please, please! - What's that dip-shit up to now? - Where the hell are we? - Where's that prick at? - Hey, we gotta get out of here. This is bullshit. - Just go check down that way. - Fuck it. I'm gone. And I've got the car keys. I don't give a rat's ass about you piss heads. - Douche bag. Fuck man, where're you at? Hey! Hey! C'mon man! Stop dickin' around! Bart, honey, can you get that? - Sorry mom, I'm injured. - Yes can I, uh, help you? - Yes ma'am, I'm Darryl Myers from the Scare Zone attraction. Is Bart home? - Well hello ""Darryl Myers"", Yes Bart is home, you know my poor boy he's just- - Excuse me. Um, thank you for, uh, cleaning my pipes. Well, let me see what you have there. Oh, how sweet. Well, let me just take these from you and get them in some water. Can I get you anything to drink? Oh Bart! You have company! I thought I was supposed to hang out with dad next weekend! - No, dear. It's your little friend from the scary house. He came to see how you're doing. - I'm in too much pain! Tell 'em to go away. - Hello, Bart! Heh, nice set up you big bullshit artist. - Close the door. - Nice sheets. - Close the door! Don't screw it for me, man. It's the first time in five years my mom's sucked up to me. - Looked like your mom was suckin' up to the plumber. - Funny, fag! Yeah, check out this set-up. This is sweet! - Yeah, if you're seven. - I'm taking this for as long a ride as I, oh! I love this part. Hey, hey, hey! - Sorry, Bart. You and your ""man-gina"" need to get out of bed and help me with today's marketing blitz. - ""Marketing blitz?"" What are you, an ad agency executive? - I need this money and Oliver needs everyone in tonight. - Excuse me. Fatally injured. - Fatal means dead, genius, and you're lifting your arm just fine. C'mon, it's one more night. - I get it. You need me. You can't go on without me. I am Scare Zone. But I can't hand out fliers. Injured. - Fine. We're not actually ""handing out"" flyers this time. - Hey ladies! ""Scare Zone!"" Scare Zone! Scare Zone! - You're terrible. - Tonight's the last night. - Scare Zone! Come check it out, you'll love it! - Yeah happy hallo-weeny! Thanks! - Dude, they're so hot. - They were hot. - I'm going to go meet them. - No, no, no. Dude. We gotta go. C'mon! Oliver? Jake! What the fuck, man! - The back door was open, man, my bad. - What'cha doing here? - Oliver told me to come help you set up. - Oh he tell you but he don't tell me? Ain't this about a bitch. Look, I'm glad you're here, I need your help. I've got an appointment downtown. - Heh. An ""appointment"" right? Heh-heh. - Yes an appointment I've got to meet my parole officer is that okay with you? Can you focus? Focus! Look, first thing I need you to do is take this and put it back where I found it, okay? Now I've got to set up this damn dummy because those Spanish assholes didn't show up, so you go finish filling up the fog machine, then go turn on the sound system, but turn it to the knob with the little piece of tape on it, then go turn on the strobe lights, oh and fill the bat baby up with water and if you're looking for something else to do, you can finish this list, do everything on it then after your done, wait for Oliver or Claire because uh, uh, I ain't givin' you my keys. Okay? Ya got that? - Got it. - Now, Oliver's going to be pissy 'cause I'm not here. Don't let him take it out on you, okay? - 10-4. - Yeah, ""10-4"" wonder bread. Just go turn on the lye vat. Go. Go-go-go-go-go. Go, go! Can you speed? Urgency, yes, go. Spanish people don't show up. Bitches are supposed to like work. What kind of shit? Oh shit! Ahhhh, what? - Ho-ho-ho! - Welcome to ""A Christmas to Remember"" where it's Christmas 364 days a year! That's right every day but what, what? Christmas! So, how can I help you? - I'm looking for Claire, I'm her brother. - Brother, huh? Funny, I don't see the family resemblance. 'Course I guess you don't put on the black lipstick and the funny make-up 'till after midnight, huh? Sandy, have you seen Miss Claire? Hang on honey, I'll be right down. - So, what's Claire's brother's name? - Me? Darryl. - Oh, really, what a coinky-dink. I've got an elf around here named Darryl someplace. - I didn't know Claire had a brother, she never mentioned a brother. But, she's not a big talker. You'll find her right back there by gift wrap. - Thank you. Hey Claire. - Oh, hey, what are you doing here? - You told me to come he- - Shhhh! Oh, you have a note from mom! That is bad. Oh, I'm glad you came. Um, Sandy, Sandy. You know it looks like our mom is really sick and I'm gonna to leave early to, um, care for her. - You said your mother's dead, dear. No our, our mam is sick. That's what we call our grandmother. - Yeah. ""Mam"". - I'm really sorry Mrs. Kane, I really have to leave right now. You know, to get to, mam. - I understand, dear. So, I'll see you tomorrow morning at 10. It's a big day! - Okay, I wouldn't miss it. - Mam. - The holiday shopping season starts the day after Halloween now, you know! Toodles! - Whoo-hoo! Oh, get me out of here! Ha. Ya think vampires and zombies are scary? Those people are scary! - I thought you worked at a funeral home. - Who told you that? - Nobody. - No I've worked for the Kanes for, like, four years and they still creep me out. - I dunno. They seemed like, ""Really nice people"". Thanks for getting me out of there, I'm running out of excuses to cut out early. You confused them good. - Hey, I'm just glad you called. Is your car in the shop? - I don't drive. - Well how do you get around? - I usually walk. - This place is, like, 20 blocks from the strip mall. - Or I'll bum a ride or hitchhike. - Isn't that a little dangerous? - No. - Shit! Put that away! Can't you carry, like, a can of mace or a taser or something? - Mace doesn't stop them, it just blinds them. Tasers you gotta keep charged. It's not practical. - Good point. - Oliver keeps a taser charged and ready to go underneath the cash register at the gift shop, but I'll stick with sexy Sadie, thank you. - She's named her gun. Heh. - Oh, turn here. Turn here! Stop here. - How did I know this was going to end at a cemetery? Claire? This isn't funny. I knew it was you. I just wanted to see what you looked like laughing. - Don't get used to it. Let me show you something. - God damn it. - Darryl, I'd like you to meet someone. - Mary Elisabeth Landers. - Hey, hey! Buddy. What are you doin'? Do you know those kids over there? Are you listening to me? - Your mother? - No. - Not your mother. - No, my mother is, quite alive. - Hello, ass-wipe, I'm talkin' to you! - No, she's my aunt. My mother's sister. Nothing exotic killed her, just cancer. But I wanted you to meet her. You remind me a lot of her. Hey Aunt Mare, I'd like you to meet Darryl. - Hello, Ms. Landers, how are you? - She can't talk to you Darryl, she's dead. - I know. - You know, she was the only person that ever brought me a Christmas present. Every year she would bring me something and wrap it so beautifully. She pretty much raised me 'till I was 10. My Aunt Mare kept me from harm. Then she died. One year she got me this snow globe. It was one of those real glass ones, not like the plastic ones you see at the mall. It had this whole little village in it. That became a great tool for my mom. She could just raise it up and threaten to smash it. She finally made good on that threat. Darryl, I really appreciate you trying to strike up a conversation with me two nights ago. - Hey, I'm sorry you lost somebody that you cared so much about. It seems like things went all down hill after that. You seem to be fighting a lot of demons. - I was just a cute little blonde no one could keep their hands off of. - And, as a friend, albeit a new friend, I want to say something. Go ahead. - Be goth, carry guns and hum strange tunes, but you shouldn't be hurting yourself. You deserve better than that. Get a tattoo and let the professional hurt you! - That could probably take some therapy. - Think about it. Now, ready to go hack, maim, bludgeon and slaughter ourselves to the delight of thousands? - Yippie! Ha-ha. Bye Aunt Mare. Happy Halloween. - So I suppose you like ""How the Grinch Stole Christmas""? - Love it! - And your favorite movie of all time, the ""Nightmare Before Christmas""? - Now you're getting me hot! Chug, chug, chug, chug, chug! Let us in, let us in, let us in, let us in! - Uhhhh. Oh, where the hell is Spider? - Oh, how many times are you going to say that? - Well, where the hell is Spider? - He told me that he was coming back. - Did he say when? Sorry. Sorry Jake I know it's not your fault. Thanks for getting the place open. Okay. I will work Spider's line and take the cash. - Oh good! Here's your cash bags. - Thank you. Wait, Darryl come here. If I'm going to cover for Spider, you have to cover for me. I am entrusting you with the chainsaw finale. - Why me? - Claire recommended you. - Yeah. I'm there! Show me what to do. - Nothing to it. Here's the throttle, this is the chain lock. Now, keep that lock on. Without that lock on you could level a fucking forest. So, for tonight, lock on. Okay? Now, try and rev her up. Jam it there between your knees, pull that cord as hard as you can. Straight up. - Put a bit of mustard on it. Ha ha ha ha! And off! Good, you have earned the orange mask. But don't get cocky. I don't want you trying to bury that thing into somebody's stomach. Just chase them around with it. Good. Okay. Everyone, take your positions! Let us in! Let us in! Let us in! Let us in! - Shut up! Shut up! Shut up! - Hey Oliver! Hey, where's Spidey? You too cheap to pay him? - How do you know he's not in there somewhere, huh? Waiting for you! Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha. Let the slaughter begin! Get in you date-less wonders! - Everybody get batty, bloody birth! - And pull. - Oh man. Oh my god. - This is disgusting. - Would ya, would ya hurry up! - All right, all right, I'm here now I've got a shit-load of tens. Have a nice scare. - Oliver. - Yeah. - I've got to go to work. - Oh okay, save me a table. I'll be there at two. - Gotta pinch a loaf! - What? - Yeah, I've got to drop the kids off at the pool! - Hurry up! - Damn! - Ha, ha, ha, ha! - Awesome! - That was sick! - That bloody guy coming from the wall was new! - Everything okay? - Great! I just have to 'go' bad. - Oh, there's someone in there. Oh, me next! - Hey, I wouldn't go in there if I were you. - Man, I gotta do this fast and get back at it. Uh, no time for airing out! Heads up! - If I'm not back in three hours, call the cops! - Back to slice and dice! Heh, heh, heh. - Oh my gosh it's all wet in there. - You've have blood all over you. - So do you! - Hey, you found my axe- - Dad, this is so fake. - Uh, that's stupid. - Not even scary. - Try scaring somebody next time. This had better not stain. - I think it's just like invisible ink. I think it will just disappear after a few minutes. - Oh, I don't think so. Look at this. - Maybe it's cherry juice or something. - Oh God, it tastes like blood. - Back off! That bitch's been following us the whole way. Get a life! - What's going on? - I don't know, there's something wrong with Tracy. - Is she hurt or sick? - I don't know, I can't tell with this damn costume. - Oh Jesus, she's been stabbed! - I think I'm going to be sick. - Someone just got stabbed! - Excellent! - Let's go. - Whoa-whoa, wait! Ladies and gentlemen, just a slight technical snafu, I will be right back. I will be right back. Shit. - Heh, yeah, this blows chunks, dude. - Hey sexy, you want to suck on this? - Ummm. - I don't know, I don't know. The only thing I can think is, we have this chair that shoots blades through a dummy's chest. No, I, I know it's Halloween and you've been getting a lot of crank calls, but I'm telling you this is real. Just hurry. Just hurry! - Okay. I'm calling this a night. I'm going to- - There's a big fight outside! - Son of a bitch! I'll go break it up and wait for the paramedics. - I'm okay, I've got pressure on the wound. - Okay. Claire, you've got to get everybody out of that maze. - Shit! - What's going on? - Please move to the exits. Thank you. - Boo! This place sucks! I want my money back. - Please move to the exit. Oliver will refund your admission outside. Asshole. Thank you! The exit is that way. - Oh, man, this place is so much more effective with music and lights. Hi! Claire! - Oh, sorry about this. Look you'll get your money back. Please just move to the- - Look, I said we're closed. - I don't think you understand. We came all the way across town and stood in line for two goddamn hours! - Calm down. Hold on. We've had an accident. - Oww, shit. - We're waiting for an ambulance. Oh, I don't have time for this. Where's Claire? - I don't know. - I'll be right back. - Uh, I, I'm going to wait for the ambulance. - Two fuckin' hours! - Claire? Oh my God. Claire. Claire! - Oh Claire. Sweet, sweet Claire - Have you seen Claire? - No. Is the ambulance here? - I don't think so. Bart and Margo are outside. I'm going to call the police. Where's Sparks Malloy? - What? - My fucking taser! - Don't get up! Don't move! Just lie there. That's right, just lie like in death. Lie. Hah! That's you, Claire. That's my Claire. I did it for you. I, I did this all for you! Yes! Claire! Yes, you wanted this. This! And I've come for you. I know all about you. I know, I know how you love death! I know how it, it thrills you... like it thrills me! It took me three years of watching you and practicing. And you, you, you taught me how to cut. We'd watch you on those long quiet afternoons when you didn't think anyone was looking. You didn't see us, but we saw you. We'd lean up to the glass between the branches and the boxes. And we'd watch you through the Christmas window. - Yes, right away please. Well, I think we have a dangerous situation here. Yes, I think so. Look, one was wounded and another was killed. - What's going on, Oliver? - Just get the cops here. I don't know what's going on. Don't go in there! Jake's dead. - What? Where's Claire? - I don't know. I sent her in to get everybody out- - The ambulance is here! - Darryl, don't do it. They're here for Tracy. The police are on their way, let them do it. - Claire is in there! - Something else is in there and it killed Jake. You're a kid in a costume. What are you gonna do? - I'm going after Claire! - You know what's funny, Claire? You cut to feel alive. I cut to kill! I used to try to cut to feel alive, I, I would cut, and I'd cut, and I'd cut and I would cut, but it never felt good till I met you. And I watched how you did yourself so lovingly. You inspired me so. And I grew to love you so much. I had to have you be a part of me. To show my devotion. My devotion. My devotion. The pleasure of pain, right? The pleasure of pain, the pleasure. I did this for you, Claire! - Claire? - Not you! Not you, Claire! Don't be like all the rest of them, a squealing pig! Oh, Claire, don't be scared. I'm here to fulfill your wish. I'm going to take you away from here. And the best part, the best part? I'm coming with you! Now that I've proven my worthiness to you, I need to do for you what you could not do for yourself. - Claire! - Darryl! - Claire! - Now my darling, it is time for me to drain you dry. Claire! - Then open my veins. - Claire! - Ahhhhh! You're not a part of this! And then we will live together in the eternal orgy of hell! - Claire! I'll be right back. Claire. - Come here! - Stupid. Stupid. Stupid! You ruined everything! You ruined my moment! It's okay. Don't worry. I'll be sure to tell Claire all about th- - Oliver! Oliver! - God damn it! Darryl! - I'm okay, I'm okay. - Was it just him? - That thing was living back there! He killed, he killed Spider. He killed all of them because of me. - It's okay, it's okay. The police are here. They're gonna sort everything ou- - No! No! - Excuse me, I'm looking for- - Hey Darryl. - Hey, how are you? - Good. Good. - You look great. - Still working on those demons. - Sorry you had to come back to work so soon. - Oh, me too. Therapy's expensive for a girl! - Selfishly, I'm glad you're back. - God, Darryl, where were you 10 years ago? You know, my psychoanalysis revealed that I have a clinical ""3M"" issue when it comes to relationships. Apparently I deeply believe that all I can attract are maniacs, molesters and monsters. But hiding and disguising myself didn't seem to help. And, it's just going to take a while before I can shake the feeling that I bring out the worst in men. - I understand. Take your time. When you're ready, give me call. Merry Christmas, Claire. - Get lost! Except you in the back, the hot one. Come here. A little bit closer. That's right. "
Strähl,https://yts-subs.com/movie-imdb/tt0396882,https://yts-subs.com/subtitles/strahl-2004-english-yify-490028,"﻿The kebab guy said they're dealing in the loo or the stairwell. Ruedi and I'll come from the front, you guys cover the back. Hey, Carol, today's my lucky day! Won three francs in the lotto, went to the thrift store and what'd I find? René Botteron from FC Zurich! - Come on, let's do something fab. - Yeah. Let's go score some dope. The good stuff. Yeah, but they've got Dragan locked up and the stuff on the street is shit... Know something better? Things okay? Long time, no see. Carol, we got to go. Wait. Who's got the best dope these days? Baby, I've gone straight. I'm a mailman. See? Forget it, he ain't got anything. Let's go. So you're not the king of the street anymore? The coolest Yugo? I'm not a Yugo! I'm Swiss-Albanian. Forget him and let me take care of it. Awesome. Kind of a retard but he's got hot connections. The mailman there. Do we know him? Why would I know any mailmen? Want to get going? Let's wait a bit. Hey, look: ""May and Analannabelle""... I get it: ""Anal-Annabelle! New and hot"" in Zurich. ""She really is new."" Got to check her out. By the way: What's up with Vera? You back together, or is she still doing it with that other guy? Nice piece of tin they gave you. You know who it belongs to? Us, you know. The taxpayers! - So where is it? - Man, I'm not a dealer. But a guy I know will be here in a sec. Give me the money You think I'm dumb? Man, I'm doing you a huge favor here and you're getting all worked up. Don't you get all worked up. You'll get your money when the guy comes. Easy, man. That guy there! The one with the hairdo. Ain't that the Albanian, Berisha? All Albanians are named Berisha. But that's really him! Go in! Come on, go inside... Oh, forget it, he never goes in. Fucking shit! Well then, let's just grab another of his boys and ship him back to Yugoland. Hey, Beko! Still at the post office? He's inside. It's one of Berisha's guys! Fuck the post office. Can you do me a favor? I promised the girl something. We told you you should get in with us, but you listened to your mother. Now don't you tell me the post office is shit. Wait here. There's four of them. Two junkies, a mailman and a Yugo. Cover the back and wait for us. - Good day, City Police! - Everyone stay calm. Hands on the table! - Piss off! Fucking cop! Let go! - Hey! Let her go! Damn it, we're not here for you! Fuck you! I'm not going with you! The cops! Damn it! Have you lost it? Just standing around? I said cover the back! What was that shit? Fucking bullshit! You bastard! Damn! What do we have here? Him again! What do I know? What do you know about the other guy? Berisha? Is he the boss of the one who just split? What do you want? All Albanians are named Berisha. This guy! Man, I'm Beko. I know them all. - But not that one. - Don't lie to me! Why are you asking me then? Ain't you the super cop? Listen up, Beko: It's a jungle out there. The big fish eat up the small ones. Unless you're a piranha. And that you're not! Man, what's this whole fish thing? Reported for theft, assault... You're one of Berisha's dealers. Just admit it. Man, no way! Everyone fucks up a little when they're young. But those times are over. I went to school in Switzerland! Am I supposed to lie and say I'm not working at the post office? - You got in my way, man. That's aiding and abetting. Got it? That'll get you at least one night in jail. If I don't go to work tonight, my boss won't just see me as the foreigner. I'll be the lawbreaking foreigner. Uh, Dani... Could you give his mom a quick call and check that out with his employer? Liens, liens, liens... How can a junkie like you be stuck with so many liens? Hey, it's not my fault. You know, once I had a real cool bicycle workshop, with super exclusive bikes. And then they just took it all away from me. Fuck! But you know what? - I'm going to get it back again. - You always buy your dope from Beko? Definitely not. Carol and I only went in there because... Galatassaray was playing. Is she your girlfriend? Yeah. Man, I'm not a dealer. But that junkie chick, she's totally hot. Don't you think? She's a bit doped up, but act a little nice, and then... Did you know Beko's keen on Carol? Well... why not? Beko's a happening guy, always got a good supply... But he just took the cash, and then you guys showed up! And who'd he get the dope from? How should I know. From the Albanian. Why do you want to lock up Beko? If he's with them, we need him out there so we can shadow him. With him alone, you don't stand a chance with the prosecutor. - Going cold turkey? - You crazy? Look, not a single one! And how about the ecstasy tabs? Him again. That's personal consumption. I want out of here! Fuck you We've got a problem with you. Man, can't you read! We have to send you back to Oberkirch Reform School. You've run away three times. Shit, man! I'm getting thrown in the reformatory. I'll hang myself in there! But hanging out in dealer joints, that's okay? None of your business. Fuck you. What put you in reform school? Stole a piece of candy. Should I scream again? If it does you good... From my end, you can go. You crazy? Oberkirch is bullshit. Can't you just totally delete my record? Get lost! Damn it! And? You guys happy? 10 grams of heroin, no dealer, a little Albanian in jail and a bungled job. And you, Marco, what a screw-up! You're the one who was so gung-ho! That kind of thing can happen. No! It doesn't happen to me! Know why? 'Cause I take this shit seriously! Calm down. The lake beat guy's coming. Fuck the lake beat guy! This place is nothing but crap! Beat Schuppisser from the lake police. ""Asked to switch to narcotics."" ""You can learn a lot from Strähl"" but remember: I'm in charge here, not him. - Hello. - Good luck! Ruedi. Break a leg. And here's our little Strähl! Is that necessary? I figured if he can survive you, then he'll survive the job. Goodbye then. A guy's got a private life too, you know. And there's no dealing after six either, right? - Come on, give me a little too. - Why don't you ask Fritz? Please, give me a little bit. I don't have any more. Come on, let's go or they'll lock us up. Yeah, come on, René. Fritz has got ecstasy at home. This constant oppression is killing me. Really don't have any more? Hey Anz... Shit, Anz is totally out. - Don't you want to share? - Hey! You nuts? We outsiders have got to stick together. Fucking wild! A grenade. A hand grenade. Let me see. Don't worry, he's done that to me before too. Let me see the grenade. - No, leave it alone or it'll go off. - Come on, let me see! Hey, Flaky, did you leave the lake 'cause you don't like fish? No, I just want to be where things are happening and where I can help people. With us narcs, ain't much happening. We mainly deal with garbage. I prefer fish. Piranhas. They eat the garbage. Come on, I'll show you. What're you looking for? I'm all out. And what's that? - That's just personal consumption. - Nope. To consume that you have to tell me who's Berisha's new man. Hey, leave me alone, I don't know. It's way dangerous with these Albanians. But you locked up René today. - Didn't you find his hand grenade? - Grenade? Don't fuck with me! Dangerous having a grenade around! Just imagine what could happen. The idiot doesn't know anything. Let's go. Uh, but... don't we have to do something if there's a grenade going 'round the scene? Listen, Flaky. Join the UN peacekeepers if you want to hunt grenades. We narcs have more important stuff to do. The guy there with the hairdo. That's Berisha. The pig... Lives around here, two kids, a big fat wife, a big fat Mercedes and a big fat business. And we only manage to nab his errand boys with a few grams. Damn it! So what do we do now? Nothing! No mobile, no telephone, no bank account. He never touches the dope. And we don't know where he stashes his big deliveries. Why don't we just collect the few grams we get from his boys until it's a few kilos and then throw it in his car and arrest him? Mr. Brunner? Yes, sir, everything's okay. Come on, let's do a Smarties oracle. And then we'll go out and do some ecstasy. Okay, I'll shake up the Smarties, then you take the first five without looking and that's your future... Such bullshit... Take five without looking. Awesome! Three green. Green's for professional success, and you just got three. Purple is for wild times and red for love... Swallow them or it won't work. - Now what? - Are you stupid? You know... Professional success. Your dream's going to come true. You'll pay back your debts and reopen your bike workshop, but this time much cooler than before, and everyone'll want the <<René special>> bike. Wild times: That's obvious, 'cause we're going out to do some ecstasy. And love. - Because it's all with me. - You don't even believe that yourself. But you swallowed them. It's already happened! You're the best thing that ever happened to me. What's up? You upset? Did you have to tell Brunner about this hand grenade? You're starting to piss me off! Heinz! - Come on in! - You think this is the right apartment? I didn't hear you ring. You got the money? Let's just cuddle! Fuck. You're so boring, you and your heroin. If we'd only left. What's the matter? What'd I do wrong? - Police! Stay calm! - Man, you again, fucking cop! Get lost! - Where's this fucking hand grenade? - Damn it, we don't have one. Where is it? - Come on, this is pissing me off. - Go fuck your grenade! Fucking bastard! Are you crazy? That's totally dangerous! You fucking bastard! Stop or I'll jump! You fucking bastard! So what made that junkie jump out the window? How should I know? Because junkies are a bit stupid? Listen! Wehrli said you threw him out of the window. And Schuppisser saw him flying as well. You can screw Schuppisser for all I care Whatever. Another complaint against you is one too many. You're suspended. And if Wehrli sticks by his statement, that's the nail in the coffin for your career. You don't mean to say you believe the junkie and not me? Listen, Strähl... It doesn't matter who I believe. You've got to protect people and not throw them out of the window or let them jump out! What's the matter with you anyway? Dr. Arbenz didn't help any? Dr. Arbenz is a shit for brains doctor. You'll never manage without me! Never heard we help each other out around here? Did you just let your colleagues at the lake drown too? Leave him alone! It's not his fault. You know how much Strähl would have to pay me in damages if we were in the States? Then I'd already be general importer for Cannondale... - You insane? Damn! - Hey, what's the problem? - You stupid fucking junkie! - Man! Let him go, fucking cop! Yeah! Thanks to you, I'm fully disabled! Go now and retract your false statement. If you'll pay me damages. You insane? You're coming with me! Here's a totally whacked ex-drug cop beating up an innocent victim. And on top of that, he's a pill addict! Fucking junkie! - Fuck you! You're not a real cop anyway! - Yeah! And I want damages! Where are you going? Where do you think? To work! But you've got night shift. And you've hardly slept! Now I'm on day shift. - Since when? - Since today. Did they say something about the police? Leave me alone! I didn't do anything and my boss trusts me. How could they manage without me? My son... I'm so proud of you, Beko Let me go, Mama. Got to leave. Be careful. Don't overdo it with work! What do you want from us, Beko? ""Did we tell you: ""Go work at the Swiss Post""?"" We didn't. But you didn't listen to us. You listened to your mother. And now they've kicked you out. You know Winkelried? Who's that? A cop? You fucking us over? Calm down. He's dead. Back in school, I learned he really helped Switzerland. In war, he threw himself at the spears of the enemies. You understand? Switzerland is still around. And he's a hero. Am I not your Winkelried? Haven't I earned a job with you guys? Don't screw up, okay? Hey! I'm Beko! I never screw up. Sugar, coke. Sugar, coke. - What do you want? - What do I want? It's still my apartment too. I need the car and the key's still here. - You're not getting it. - Goddamnit! The car still belongs to both of us! So Patrick doesn't have a car? That's not fair! How did I stand it with you for so long? You and your fucking job! Damn it! Since I saw you the last time, a lot's happened to you, eh? Now you're already out? No, I just lost them. Mr. Strähl. You're not the only police officer unable to cope with his job. This continual pressure, this misery... Not everyone can handle it. It's important to admit when the job isn't right anymore. You should think about that sometime. Clean things up in your life! Damn it, there's nothing to clean up! Mr. Strähl, it's like this: You're trembling, you smell like alcohol... - Looks like cold turkey. - You prescribed this crap! You know, it's impossible to tell in advance if someone's predisposed towards addiction, and only a small percentage will ever... You're just a shit for brains doctor! Did you hear that? That was the junkie in you talking. Idiot! Hey! You can't do that! It's Strähl! You look like shit. Thanks Want a bite? Otherwise? Things okay? What're you doing the whole day? Taking a little break. Thinking about my future. You know, it makes me sick. You can really piss a guy off, but it was also a lot of fun sometimes. Check it out, you can see right up her privates. Beat wouldn't have found that amusing. So? You guys making progress? You know the Yugo mailman we nabbed in the kebab place... Brunner's got him under surveillance now. Just like you always said. You know, Beat thinks it's a blast. He likes doing that, you know... But, um, this Berisha... I'm telling you: Slippery as an eel. Little Beat doesn't have a chance there. Well, I got to get going. Hey, if I can help you out or anything, just give a ring, okay? Hi there! Strähl from the City Police! Just great. That's the fifth time today I've heard that. Suddendly everyone's with the police, fire department or security service. Can I see your badge? Hey, Anz, over here! Goal! That's a foul! I let that one in on purpose. You know, because of the grenade. Shit, what do you want? Make a statement. Now. What do I get in exchange? And what else? And what else? Hey, Zurich-Basel there. Definitely not 1. Zurich forever, man. You got to stay true to your principles. - Make an X by 2. Zurich never wins. Hey, are you crazy? Man. Okay. Basel, that fucked up chemical industry shit! That makes 356.20. Thanks very much. Thank you. I've got a good feeling. - And what do we do now? - Now? - Nothing. - Fuck yourself up the ass. You go straight to the police station and retract your false statement! There's a case of bribery going on here! That enough for a false statement at the police station? - So cool! Listen, if I'm supposed to say I just jumped out of the window, then you've got to give me a lot more than this here. A half-kilo. Minimum. Yes, Herbert here. I'm in the World Bar and have got a runaway here. Can you come pick her up? Thanks. Zurich City Police, everything under control. You're such a bastard! Goddamn asshole! Leave her alone. Or you can forget the statement, just so you know. Listen: Now you go to the station and if I don't hear from you in three hours, your sweetheart is headed to Oberkirch. Got it? Here's my number. - Hey, you can't do that! - Let Carol go! I can break her arm too. Shit, you can't do that! You know where you have to go, right? You're an unbelievably fucked up asshole! This is kidnapping! You're totally nuts, man! You still there? Hallo? Not hoarse yet? Stupid question. That's not my biggest problem, eh? Your biggest problem is your boyfriend. Someday I'll pay you back for this. Yes? René? All done? Yeah, it all went really well. I've got a good feeling about it. And who'd you give the statement to? Right, same as last time: To Brunner! He's not even there! What, not there? How should I know why he was there! Just go and make a statement. Don't play around with Carol and no bullshit stories. Fuck! You've got until nine. Brunner always leaves work at six! But I think René is on his way now. Hey... Can't you untie me now? Fritz, can I ask you something? If you had to choose between betraying your dream or the best thing that ever happened to you... Well, in any case, betrayal is the most fucked up shit. Gotta go take a piss. - Fritz. What time is it? - About seven. You're a total sicko. No normal person goes through this crap just to become a cop again. Shut up. Are you all doped up? Hands off that and shut up! Pills are total shit. You get no kicks but you're still addicted. You've got super cold hands. Just shut up. If I've got to sit around in your shitty car, then at least I can talk when I want. If you don't shut up right now, then I'm driving you to Oberkirch! And then? Huh? You can forget your fucking job! René's making his statement! I don't care where you are as long as it's not with him. Fuck you! Damn it! Stop! Let go or I'll swallow all your pills! Cut out the shit! Fuck you! Stupid bitch. Damn it! Shit. I overslept yesterday. You're such an idiot. You say you love me, but heroin's the only thing you love. What's wrong now? Sore from playing soccer. Was it bad? Just leave me alone. I'm really glad you're back. But you know... actually we're really damn lucky. - Now Strähl's got to pay! - Just shut up! You're such a fucking asshole! Hello? You know what? If you want to be a cop again, bring me that half-kilo of heroin! Otherwise, instead of saying I jumped out the window myself, I'll say you kidnapped Carol! Strähl! Now that's a nice surprise! Hey, Ruedi, you know you said you'd help me out. Want a bite? Shoot! Honeybunny, uh, give us a second to talk. We'll pick back up in a minute. Listen, Strähl... there's no way I can give you a half-kilo heroin. And what for? But it's no big deal for you. You'll get it back in 12 hours, and nobody'll notice. Okay, but... But you're a total wacko who ought to be in therapy. I mean, the drugs you had stashed in your desk... I took a look at the package inserts... only real psychos eat that kind of stuff. Listen, have you gone completely nuts? Don't take it personally but why don't you go fishing in your little Amazon and spare me this shit. Just quickly: Sorry. I overreacted a little there and... I think you're doing a good job. It's not so tough. I've been watching this Beko guy for ages. He deals and deals, but you never catch Berisha with the dope. Being a narc is really pretty shitty. Remember your joke about Berisha? Putting the dope in his Mercedes? That's a good one. Let's do it. I'll give you a call when I know something. So, where's your connection? Hey, Carol, have you seen Beko? We need something. Hey, Carol, you won't believe it! I fucked over that Strähl guy. Spare me your crap. What now? Who's got something? You guys into pills? Strähl, City Police. I want to help your son but he doesn't want to be helped! Don't believe him. Why does he need help from the police? My son works at the post office! We found this on him. That's heroin. And that's not from the post office. It's not true! Listen, Mrs. Mussafr. We're planning a big hit against the drug mafia. Your son could be of great help to us. - Then he wouldn't have to go to prison? - No. If he shows us where he got this from, he doesn't have anything to worry about. They're going to kill me! Will you be able to protect my son? I promise, Mrs. Mussafr. Take the laundry with you if you have to do it in the middle of the night, or I'll call building management. But they won't do anything. You've got to do it all yourself. Who does this basement belong to? No idea. I couldn't give a shit. Man, you trying to fuck with me. Where's the rest? Think they tell me anything? That guy with Berisha brings it here? Hoxha? Yes. Shit. I don't know anything about this. Listen: Just keep going like nothing happened. Leave Berisha to me. Just don't screw me, okay? Hey, watch out. That junk makes you fat! I don't know. Only retards break in at a cop's place. Perhaps that's the good thing about it. Yeah, you know, no one expects it and that's what makes it totally easy. Are you guys wimps or do you want to break in? Strähl's nuts. He's got a piranha. So where are these pills? Man, that's what we've got to find. Everybody take a room. Let me do this. Hey, I know how it works. Yeah, but let's hurry. Those are my keys. Leave me alone! Boys, I've got it. That's all? Where's René? Come here! Hey, don't screw around. We got to get going. It doesn't matter anymore. You off your rocker? Goal. - Yeah, thanks. - There. 13 right. 120,000 francs! - Goal! - Goal! It's all just like you said. And now I'm going to stop doping. And open up a bike workshop. The two of us... - Damn it, what's... - Shit. Why didn't we get out of here! Fucking mess! Dammit! Don't worry. I'll tell him I don't want anything from him anymore. - Lowlife shitheads. Fuck! - Strähl... You guys insane? Where are my pills? Something I wanted to tell you... What's that? Shit... - Double bingo! - But you wanted to... - Down to the station. - Let me go! - Let him go! - Damn it! That's enough! Shit, I'll do it. Shit, René, I don't have a good feeling - Why? It'll be fine. - Just shut the fuck up and go! Okay... You probably don't want to take that in? Just don't screw up. Next time you see me, I'm going to be starting a new life. That's for you, sweetheart. Sugar, coke... What's up, boss? You screwed up. I didn't do anything! Shut up! Just give us back what you stole from us! Somehow we always end up sitting in the car waiting for René. What's taking him so long? You going to give him the dope when he comes back? Would you give it to him? I'll go have a look. Did a junkie come in here two hours ago wanting to make a statement? Ever seen a junkie wanting to make a statement? Why don't ya get lost if you don't like it! Where is he? Shit, did they lock him up? He's dead. The idiot had to go to the loo first. Don't call him an idiot. Shit. Damn. He's such an asshole... such a retard... What's the matter with you? Why are you never taking the phone? Shit. He'd really wanted to set up his bike workshop again. And now that he came so close... He won. 13 for 13. Fucking hell! Why wasn't he more careful? He'd never have quit. You've got no fucking clue, jerk-off! Can I have some of your heroin? Want some too? You haven't got any more pills. Not hungry? Junkies never get hungry either. Fuck, Vera. What is it this time? Stressed out? Sorry, boys, I'd love to offer you a beer, but today's really inconvenient. - You handling her okay? Don't you want to introduce your new babe? You see, I'm busy. Beat it! - Are we supposed to put up with that? - Shit! Carol! Put it away! Goddamn, Strähl! What's going on here! Now you're doing it with this junkie babe? Calm down, man! Damn it, don't act so bloody stupid! Don't leave me hanging here! What do you want anyway? You guys nuts? Brunner said you'd been acting weird lately. And know what? He's right. Know what? Brunner can just suck my dick! And what about the dead junkie in the loo? About the prescription slips from Arbenz? And what happened to this one? Shit! What was that? The big fish eat the little ones, unless you're a piranha. This one's not even dangerous. Did you get this from her? Will you just shut up! How can you stand it with her? Does she scream in bed like that too? I would have never thought one of us would sink so low. Not even Strähl. Listen. You and me, we don't let our colleagues drown, even if they are total loonies and want to catch a disease between the legs of a babe like that. We'll just tell Brunner the girl had the dope. And there's no way this Arbenz shit's going to land you in jail. You can't do this. Strähl, tell me you won't do this. Fuck. Now I'm getting locked up. Go! And don't let 'em catch you. I'll take care of this! - Damn! Son of a bitch! - Fuck, Strähl! Have you lost it? Goddamn... Go ahead and run! Just wait until Strähl puts the bite on you! So did that make you feel better? Do you have to always screw up everything? Strähl, damn it! Come on, pick up! That's him! That's the officer! Shit. Strähl, help! They're going to kill me! And now? What're you gonna do? Hey Beko, sorry, can you just quickly... Thanks, but sorry, I'm really in a hurry. Hello. Can't do this one. It's much too much. Can't pay that out. You have to mail it in and then they'll send you the money. But I need the dough right now. - Sorry, I can't pay out that much... - But I need the dough right now! Sorry. Those are the rules. I can't pay it out. Damn! Do you have a connection who can trade a 120,000 lotto ticket for 80,000? Fast and in cash? Come on! Um... is an hour fast enough for you? Fuck you - You want to fuck us over? - No! - She ain't getting money from us! - No! We'll take the ticket from her! The ticket'll get you 120,000 francs. And then we're even. But if the girl fucks up, then you're both in trouble! I used to think you were a good police officer. But this here is like kindergarten. And if you simply don't answer the charges by Mrs. Mussafr and the others, then... then things look grim. Admit it! You stole heroin from Mr. Mussafr, and there you really picked on a weak one! And now he's got the Albanians after him! And you don't remember why you stole the prescription slips from Dr. Arbenz either. And then you didn't have anything to do with the dead junkie in the bathroom. Well, I really don't see any other possibility than to call in the prosecutor's office. Then what? What'll you tell them? That I stole a half-kilo heroin from Beko? And where'd a small-time street dealer get a half-kilo of heroin? And anyway, you guys are trailing Beko day and night. You never noticed anything? And you think the prosecutor's going to believe you? Or believe a mom of someone with a record? Do you still have it together or what? Don't you have anything better to do? Know what? This is and always will be a fucking lousy outfit, damn it! Sorry, Flaky Beat said Beko is out with another Albanian. And he said... I don't know, it doesn't make sense... he said they'd picked up something at a kiosk, something with the lottery. And your babe was with them too. Shit. Know what? Go ahead and do whatever you want with your prosecutor. - Hey, baby. Now show me the ticket. - Now first you show me the 80,000. The girl's here. You idiot, what're you waiting for? You're always screwing up. Kill her off and bring me the money! He's got the money. You got something? Sorry, Anz, not now. Then what're you doing with that guy there? Hey, you guys crazy? Come on, now we're doing business. Get the ticket from her! What's this? Where's the cash? Give me the ticket and it'll be fine. The money, damn it! What is this shit? Or we're going up in smoke. Hey! Are you guys crazy? Get the ticket from her! Come on, do it! Freeze! What are you doing here? Get lost! In a sec. But first let's do that joke with Berisha's Mercedes. - Have you lost it, man? You want to just fish around a little or really catch one? Soon you'll be rid of Berisha too. Well, yeah, you said that before. Give me an hour. And you take a look in the trunk. We could have easily kept some dope for ourselves. A little less would have still kept the guy in jail long enough. Too late now. Do you know the Smarties oracle? The first five you take will tell you the future. And what does that mean now? Red's for love, purple for wild times and brown for shit. Now you've got to eat them, otherwise it won't work. So cool.

"Raquel 1,1",https://yts-subs.com/movie-imdb/tt7466970,https://yts-subs.com/subtitles/raquel-11-2022-english-yify-490025,"﻿I'll take the suitcases to the bedroom. I thought you could stay in the room that was mine and I'll stay in your grandfather's. All right? THE SEVENTH SEAL - Thank you so much. - You're welcome. Excuse me, you are from the church, right? Are you new around here? I just arrived. - What's your name? - Raquel. And you? - I'm Ana Helena. - And I'm Laura. - Nice to meet you. - Nice to meet you. Do you know if there is any other activity besides the ones on the wall? Yes. We do many activities to spread God's word. We have a service, that is actual led by my mom. We have a group cell at my house. Have you been touched by God? Yes, a little... I am new to this. So it's worth it. I think so too. Then you meet everybody. Ok. I'll get your number, ok? I felt something interesting about you. ANA HELENA ADDED YOU TO THE GROUP ""YOUTH MINISTRY” GIRLS, THIS IS RAQUEL. WELCOME! RAQUEL, WE WANT TO TAKE YOU SOMEWHERE TOMORROW. CAN YOU COME? BRING YOUR SWIMSUIT! Wow. Help! Darling, are you all right? You are too hot. Are you feeling well? Do you want me to prepare something for you, maybe a tea? No. - Can I turn off the light? - Don't, leave it on. Rest now. Good night. God is thirsty for healing. And we go, like: opening our path, opening our path. Because our path is illuminated. Our path is the word of God. - We have a direction. Am I right? - Amen! In Matthew 26:41, ""Watch and pray. So that you will not fall into temptation."" Do you know what that means, brothers? That even though we're being watchful, Evil will want to prevail. The power of Satan. The force of darkness. The power of the serpent. But we have the power of light. Which is much stronger than any other force. And we will use that. We will use this against Evil. That's right, my daughter! That's right! - And I want an amen! - Amen! - And I want Glory! - Glory! Don't cut it into rings. Cut into small squares. - It's better. - Ok. We have to take advantage of this situation to the fullest, my daughter. We can't suffer any loss from this. At all. I invited some friends. You did? How nice! Which friends? Some people from the church. Oh, from the church... Dad, people from the church also do groceries, right? I know. That's right. It's all right. But... Don't talk too much to these people, okay? Why? They are cool. Okay, they're cool. But college friends can also be nice. By the way, how's this matter going? I don't know yet, dad, but I'm looking into it. It's good to think about this. Think about your future. Cut this one too? Very tiny, okay? - Did it light up? - Yes. - Hello, Elisa! - How are you doing, Dulcidio? Let me do it. Go down a bit. Wait, look! I think it's cute. Do it on Raquel. Come here. We love using it as makeup, you know? Did you see how well they are getting along? - Yes, that's true. - Yes. Hermes, you can count on us for anything you need. Because this period of transition is not easy. Thank you, Elisa. I think about Raquel... After everything that happened to Vera. We are made of love I think he is cute. I think he is cute, and hot... What is this, Laura? God is watching. As for Raquel... She is watching nothing, see? - What? - Gustavo. His family owns Monte's Newspaper. Yes, Monte's Newspaper. - That only prints bad news. - Liar. There's nothing to it. It only runs here and another couple of cities. Oh yeah? God is watching. Vera! - André, now I can't talk. - Wait. Let me talk. I'm trying to talk to you and you don't answer me. I don't answer because I don't want to talk to you. But I'm your boyfriend! You're not my boyfriend, André. We broke up! Open that door! Genesis. Corinthians. Proverbs. Hosea. Deuteronomy. Judges. Raquel. Savior The special name for our Lord Savior ow ow ow The special name for your Love Savior The special name for our Lord Savior The special name for your Love Now I know why God sent me and why he sent you too to this place, to this suffering. This is all part of God's plan. We are not lost men, Assos. Our lives are not insignificant. We have a mission to accomplish, which cannot be done anywhere else. Oh, my brothers! How glad I am to live with you. Because that's God's plan. I'll write it all down. Hey, we're going to have a party at the Church. Want to come? Raquel? - Raquel? - What? - Oh, sorry. - Okay, I'll clean it. WHO WROTE THE WORD OF GOD? To the woman, he said, I will greatly multiply your grief and your conception, and with grief you will bear children; and your desire shall be for your husband, and he shall rule over you. And the head of Christ is God... But the woman is the glory of man. Now, as the Church submits to Christ, so also wives should submit to their husbands in everything. Ephesians 5:24. I'm not doing well these days, you know? But it's okay. I think she was right. I mean, she must be right. I guess... - Hi. - What happened? You know that model contest that I said I was going to do? - I passed. - Wow, how cool. But then the pastor said that I better not go. Yeah, Pietra. Because this is not for you. - That is not a serious profession. - But what's the problem? - You will stray from the path. - But why? Laura has some news. - If you don't tell, I will! - What? - Come on Laura, tell us! - Don't need to gossip about it! - What is it? - Tell us! We got engaged. - Really? - Yes. Damn, congratulations! - Thanks. - Thank you. The pastor gave the blessing and everything. Now the challenge is to wait for the wedding. Congratulations. That's so cool. Thank you. Tamar. How many people have you brought to the church? I always try to bring people in, Anice. How come you never succeed? - That's offensive. - Jesus brought twelve, remember? But I am not Jesus! But we, as a church, must seek that, to be like Jesus. Yeah, right. Laura, you go... Oh, God... What's your biggest fear? My biggest fear? - C'mon, Laura! - Calm down, I'm thinking! Of a car running over me. - Is that your biggest fear? - It is, why? Okay, I just hope this isn't a lie. Because the universe conspires! Oh, really? I thought it was something more interesting. The end of times, Lucifer, spiders, something like that. - Well, it's my fear.. - Uhhh... Why did you come to Monte Megido? Because my father was born here. No, what she meant was... What happened for you to come here? She already answered, her father was born here. Okay, why did you come back? - We wanted to start over. - Start over what? You never wanted to start anything over? It's your turn to answer, Raquel. I already answered, we came to start over. Yeah, she already answered. Now she asks the question. Fine. Ana Helena. Do you believe in everything that is written in the Bible? Everything written in the Bible is divine. Go, Suzana. Your turn, Tamar. But do you think we should be submissive? We who? Women. For you to understand what the Bible says about the woman being submissive, you first have to understand what true submission is. And submission is a rule for every Christian. But it was a book written many years ago and was written only by men. There were many writers, but the authorship is from God. Yes. Ok, but... What's in the Bible is much more than just written words. God speaks in parables. Behind each word is a message. And that message is only deciphered if you've contact with the Holy Spirit. Do you believe that women brought death and sin to Earth because it's written like that? Raquel, you already asked a lot of questions. It's against the rules. What rules? Who wrote the rules? Me. - Ana Helena! - Wow! I think the Bible should be revised. Revised? Yes, if it has been rewritten so many times, why would it be any different now? I advise you to pray. ARE YOU OKAY? YES... I AGREE WITH YOU. AND IT'S NOT JUST ME... WHAT IF WE START A NEW GROUP? WHAT ABOUT THE CELL? IT WILL BE DIFFERENT. BUT DID YOU DECIDE THAT NOW? I THINK THAT... I'VE BEEN RECEIVING SIGNS. Hi, Elisa. Hi, Raquel. How are you? May I help you? Coffee. Do you have it? - There. - Oh. Thank you. All set. - Need bags? - No, thank you. So... I was worried. There you go. - Thank you! - No problem. Hi. And the grocery store is doing well, right? Yeah. It's good to think about that too. - Come back soon. - Good afternoon. Do you wanna talk? Talk about what? I don't know. There's something bothering you? Raquel, I'm worried. Why? You know, darling... Unfortunately, I no longer have the bookstore. And not only I don't have the bookstore, many debts appeared in its place. So our life depends on this. It depends on this city, these people. We have a home here. We have a store that can rebalance us financially. That's what we have, Raquel. I have no other option. You need to help me. I will help you, dad. That's good! That's good! And... There is also something you need to know. We're in a small country town. Here, when you tell someone you've heard or seen something, that person will tell another, that will tell another... And suddenly, everyone is talking about you. And depending on the way as the story goes, you lose control of what they say. You don't want people to be talking about us out there, do you? So you have to be careful with what you say, my daughter. Vera, if you think that I'll just leave here, you can forget about that, ok? André, please, go away! There is no one here! Did you cheat on me with that bastard? Are you completely crazy? Dad, pick up! Please, pick up! André is here. He's completely out of control. He jumped the front gate! I'll burn this house down! He said he's going to set the house on fire. If you're with someone else, just tell me... I'm not seeing anyone! Enough! - I want to see him face to face. - There's no one here! - There is... - Stop! First we start identifying the verses, right? CIRCLE OF RENOVATION Which we will comment on. Then we cut them and organize according to the Books. We take blank sheets, we glue these sections, and we comment below with our observations. - Cool. - Ok? Deuteronomy 22:20. ""If, however, the charge is true and no proof of the young woman's virginity can be found, she shall be brought to the door of her father's house... and there the men of her town shall stone her to death."" Judges 19:24. ""Look, here is my virgin daughter, and his concubine. I will bring them out to you now, and you can use them and do to them whatever you wish."" Corinthians 14:34. ""Women should remain silent in the churches. They are not allowed to speak."" Deuteronomy 22:5. ""The woman shall not wear that which pertaineth unto a man, neither shall a man put on a woman's garment for all who do so are abomination unto the Lord thy God."" If a man marries a woman... Leviticus 15:19. ""When a woman has her regular flow of blood, and her impurity is upon her flesh, her monthly period will last seven days, and anyone who touches her will be unclean till evening."" Timothy 2:12. ""I do not permit a woman to teach or to assume authority over a man. She must be quiet."" Genesis 2:18. ""Then the Lord God made a woman from the rib he had taken out of the man, and he brought her to the man. She shall be called 'woman, ' for she was taken out of man."" Ephesians 5:22. Peter 3:1. Proverbs 30:20. Exodus 22:18. Ecclesiastes 25:26. ""All malice is small compared to a woman's malice; let the lot of sinners fall on her!"" BRAZIL IS RANKED NUMBER 5 IN VIOLENT DEATHS OF WOMEN THE DAUGHTERS OF MARY MAGDALENE WHO WAS MARY MAGDALENE? WHY WAS JUNIA LEFT OUT? NEW MESSAGE FROM ANA HELENA RAQUEL, ARE YOU COMING TO THE SERVICE TODAY? IT WILL BE IMPORTANT TO YOU. In Apocalypse 22:18-19, ""For I say to every man to whose ears have come the words of this prophet's book. If any man makes an addition to them, God will put on him the punishments which are in this book."" And that's why, my friends, for that and exactly for that, that when someone comes, calling herself a prophet, it's very important that we analyze these words according to the Bible. To see if it's true or if it's false. Because it is our guide, am I right? It is our guide. Amen! Now I want to ask you something. And I want to see who will know how to answer me. What happens to those who insist on false prophecies? - What happens? - Sinners! Apocalypse 22:18-19. God will punish these people. There's no way out of it! There is no excuse! Because, in the Bible, it says: ""Every tree that does not bear good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire."" - I want an Amen! - Amen! Praise God! Hermes, I really need to talk to you. Sorry, Elisa, it's just that I'm a little... Is Raquel there? - No, she's not. - I will not take too long. I promise. It will be fast. Look at this, Hermes. Do you know what this is? No. That's where your daughter is taking a lot of teenagers. Taking the girls to the middle of this bush. Without any security. Have you wondered what could happen? Someone may appear there. The things they can do to them. And they're praying for God knows which devil. And who told you that? It doesn't matter who told me. It doesn't matter, the whole church already knows. And then they keep questioning me because they know that I know you. Ok, Elisa. I'll see what this is about. Pietra is dating a boy that nobody knows who it is. Tamar is missing classes almost every day. And everyone is missing church too, right, Elisa? Oh Hermes, please. Try to put yourself in these parents' shoes, at least once in your life. We don't know what they are doing there, if they are making rituals, sacrifices... Look... You have to do something. This girl is going to get in trouble. I'm warning you! Is this a threat? Hey, girls! Hi, Elisa. You came! Good! We are just passing by. Are you okay? - Yes. - Yes... To sweeten your day. Here. Let's make a toast! Want some? You have to drink it! Fine.

But I have something very important to say. One thing that can save the souls of all of you. The Evil. Evil does not appear to be bleak. Macabre. It doesn't look like a monster. Evil has beauty. Evil is manipulative. That person who lets Evil in, that person needs help. Now, if she denies help, if she denies it, there is nothing that we can do. It's very dangerous. We can't let them... Let them destroy us! Now, my question is: What do we do with all this evil? What do we do with these evil angels? Laura! Don't let her do this, Laura. Laura! Don't let her! She's doubting our faith! I never doubted anyone's faith. - Liar. - Why am I lying? I never doubted. Stop this. Go away! I believe in God too! - Out! - Out! I'm also from the Church! - Get out of here! - Get out! Go away! Guys, I never wanted to doubt anyone! I never wanted to doubt anyone's faith! I'm also from the Church! - Get out of here! - Get out! I believe in God! I believe in Jesus, guys! Please! I'm writing it for the Good! For the Good, guys! I also believe in Jesus! I'm writing it for women! Go away! She is not one of us! Timothy 2:18. Help! TAMAR OF COURSE SHE SEES THINGS, GUYS! Raquel? What happened? - Raquel, my daughter? - Mom? No, no. It's me, your father. What are you feeling, Raquel? Raquel, talk to me. No, Raquel. No, no... It is not time for that now. We will write everything again. The exams are all normal. In addition to what you already told me, Raquel, any other discomfort? What can this be? Look, she organizes her thoughts in an absolutely logical way. I have no way of giving you an accurate diagnosis with so little observation. I wanted to show you something. What is this? It's just a notebook! I know it's a notebook, and what's inside? Do you have anything to tell me about this? How come not, Raquel? I think you do. She lost her mother in a very violent way and the two were very close. At the time I thought it was good for her to find strength in faith, in a religion that is... But then she started doing some weird things... Look, it would be very important that you do therapy. Doctor, I'm sorry. Raquel did therapy for a while. And... Anyway, wouldn't there be something parallel to therapy? Something more immediate? Because... I don't know what to do. () WHO IS IT? YOU DON'T KNOW? NO. AREN'T YOU THE PROPHET? I NEVER SAID I WAS A PROPHET. I'LL GIVE YOU A HINT... WE ALREADY KNOW EACH OTHER. WHAT DO YOU WANT? TO TALK. I CAN'T TALK NOW. TELL ME, WHAT DO YOU WANT? THE POSSESSED GIRL FROM MONTE MEGIDO Heretic! Liar! Liar! Witch! - We don't want you here! - You are bringing the darkness! SHE CAME TO CURSE THE CITY. SHE HAD A VISION! LET'S PRAY FOR HER SOUL! SHE MUST BE SICK... SHE OPENED THE DOORS FOR THE EVIL! HER NAME IS RAQUEL HERNANDES REIS. Witch! - Where is he? - Where is who? - Where is he? - What are you talking about, André? - You're crazy! - Confess it already! André, please. Go away! Go away, there is no one here! No! Let me go. Let me go, André! Let me go! Go away! Get out of here! Get out! Help... Help me. Police emergency line. Officer, please! Send help! I beg you, please! My mother's ex-boyfriend is very nervous! Ok, he's nervous. And what is the occurrence? Please, officer. He's assaulting her! Give me your address. - I'll go check your room! - No, you don't, André! I can't talk anymore! I can't talk anymore! Yes? - Hi, Hermes! - Hi. Is Raquel around? No. Raquel's not here. - We know she's here. - Nope. I'm saying she's not here. I already said she isn't here. Can we wait here for her then? Unfortunately, no. Can you, please, excuse me? Ok? Have a good day. We are concerned about Raquel. I appreciate your concern, but she has already started treatment. But what happened, Hermes... I know this is none of our business. The truth is that some things, Hermes, need another type of treatment. Because they are not common things. They are things of a spiritual nature. Sorry, Elisa. I don't believe in this. We can think in a more symbolic way. It's so simple what I'm talking about, Hermes. Look, there are those who work for Good. There are those who work for Evil. Because they are being dominated by that force. I really appreciate your concern. Just one thing. Do you know the Ritual of Healing and Deliverance? Sorry, but I'm not interested. Come on, Hermes, we're already here. I think you could pay a little attention, it won't hurt. Okay, what is it about? When we realize that there is something wrong with a person, a change in behavior, a change in their eyes, in the soul, it could be that this comes from another place. Of the other side. A dark side. It's very dangerous. You don't want that for Raquel, do you? Sorry, but I don't understand what you're talking about. Raquel needs to be exorcised. It's not exactly that, that's not the word. Raquel went to the doctor because this is the treatment that I believe, and this is the treatment she's going to do for now. So I ask you to please respect our decision, and don't look for us again. We can take this evil away from Raquel! Please! Hermes, the enemy might be using her. And you are responsible. - Excuse me. - You will regret it. Get out of my house, please? What happened? I was at home. With Gustavo. We were watching a movie. And then we started to kiss and... He put his hand under my skirt. I didn't want it. I started to scream. Telling him to stop. But he continued. My brother came home. Gustavo started shouting at me. Calling me a slut. Telling my brother that he had caught me with another guy. My brother believed him. My father came home, and started to beat me. I ran away. Am I bothering you? Laura. I came here to apologize to you. I don't know what happened to me that day. Let's go home. I'll take you. I regret that. Come with me? We can talk about it. No, Laura. Stop it. Come back with me, please? Let me go. I won't go. - Laura! - She said she won't go. You're fucked. Witch. Motherfucker. Your call is being forwarded to voicemail and is subject to a charge after the signal. Take care. Bye. Good morning. Go to hell! - What is this? - You are not welcome here. This is no place for profanity! Are you crazy? Go away from here! - Hell! - Get off here! You are not welcome here! Out of here! Go away! Out! Leave us alone! - Get out! - Hell! Leave! You are not welcome here! You are taking our peace away! SATANIC CULT IN THE CITY OF MONTE MEGIDO DEFIES THE BIBLE HERETIC BITCH! Raquel! Raquel, come here! You called the police emergency line. At the moment all our attendants are busy. Shit! Who did this? Who did this, Raquel? I don't know. And what is God's plan for a situation like that? What? Tell me, Raquel! To forgive. To forgive? Forgive! Forgive what, my daughter? Huh? Do you think that forgiving those who destroy our home is to do good? That's it? They don't know what they are doing. And you don't know either. You also don't know what you do. Look! Can you see the absurdity of this situation, Raquel? Can you? I don't know what else to do. I don't know what else to do. Everything was like this when we arrived. I don't know how they got in. The door was open. It was a mess. Things thrown on the floor. They left everything upside down. - Did they steal something? - There was no time to see... Dad!

You want to go out? So let's go out! Raquel, get in the trunk! - No! André, leave her out of this! - Shut your mouth! - For God's sake! Leave her out of this! - Silence! - Leave her! I'll go with you! - Can you be quiet, dammit! Raquel, get in the goddamn trunk! Or I'll beat you up! - Do it, darling! - Ok, I'll do it! I'll do it! Calm down! For the love of God!

How are you all tonight? - Good! Thank God! - Thank God! But I hope you leave here better than when you arrived. Because today is the night of healing and deliverance! It is my favorite night because tonight God works His miracles. - Praise the Lord! - Hallelujah! What is the cure you are looking for today, brother? What cure do you need? What do you need to experience before the Lord, brother? Look. Do not waste your illness. Do not waste, as the disease is an opportunity for revelation, brothers! Amen! It is through disease, be it physical, emotional, spiritual... It is through sickness that God works in us! - Praise the Lord! - And He will work on you! Work the healing on you! Praise the Lord! Tonight, God will do something extraordinary in your lives. If someone needs to cure the pain of guilt, because guilt hurts, brothers. Blame for wrong doings, blame for blasphemy, blame for any crime, it doesn't matter! It doesn't matter because God knows you! He knows each one of you, your life, your struggle. And it is through Him that we will heal! We will heal from everything that affects us. Today is the day that God will work a miracle. Tonight! So I want to pray for you! He is touched by your struggles, brothers. And He wants to help you. Let's all stand up. Lord! Merciful God, perform a miracle tonight. Give this young woman a righteous path to follow. Keep the tortuous paths of blasphemy away from this girl. Take the enemies away from her! The enemies! The evil angels! Take it from her, Lord! The Demon in her body! Take it away, Lord!

Pooh's Heffalump Halloween Movie,https://yts-subs.com/movie-imdb/tt0457437,https://yts-subs.com/subtitles/poohs-heffalump-halloween-movie-2005-english-yify-490020,"This could be the room of any small boy, but it just happens to belong to a boy named Christopher Robin. Now, Christopher Robin had many toy animals to play with, but his very best friend was a bear, named Winnie the Pooh. Together, Pooh and his friends shared many grand adventures. But one of their most unusual began on an early autumn morning. lt was that time of year again. That magical time when leaves fall, and pumpkins grin, and Spookables roam free. Halloween had come to the Hundred Acre Wood. -Boo! -Oh, my! A very, very small Spookable. Whatever shall I do? Don't be afraid, Mama. It's only me! -See? -Oh, Roo. Thank goodness. I'm saved. Sorry I scared you so bad. I was just getting ready for Halloween. Aren't you starting a little early, dear? I can't help it. I'm excited. It's Lumpy's first time trick-or-treating. Well, that is exciting. We're going to Piglet's to practice. -Bye-bye, Mama! -Bye, dear. Have a good time. -Treat-or-Trick! -Lumpy! How was that, then? Did I do it right this time? -Did I? -Almost. But not quite. It's ""trick-or-treat""! Trick-or-treat! Got it. -Roo? -Yeah? -I don't get it. -It's simple. We knock on any door, and say ""trick-or-treat"". And they give us candy and cider and cookies. What? Just like that? Don't worry, Lumpy, you'll get the hang of it. I'll help you. This is gonna be the best Halloween ever because it's... ...our first Halloween together. Come on, let's go practice at Piglet's house. This is gonna be the most fun you've ever had in your life. Trick-or-treat. Boo! Would you look at that. We frightened them so much , they forgot to scream. Oh, bother. I don't think we frightened them, Piglet. Oh, dear. Didn't we scare you at all, Roo? Maybe a little bit. Right, Lumpy? Oh, sure. Scary. Why are you wearing those funny faces? What? Why, these are Halloween masks, Lumpy-boy. I guess the kid's not from around here. -This is his first Halloween. -No kidding? Don't Heffalumps have Heffaween. .. I mean, Halloween? Well, we have Trumplet-Trumpet Day. Flapadoodle Eve. -But that's it. -Well, then, we must make this a very special night, indeed. Well, what're we waiting for? Somebody get this Heffalump some candy. No! No candy for anyone. Not until the proper time to go trick-or-treating. Now, if you'll follow me inside, I have all the fun meticulously planned out. Now, gather round, everyone. As you see, I've collected all the candy to be found in the Hundred Acre Wood, and divided it into equal , easy-to-carry sacks. Tonight, each of you will take your sack home and dispense it for trick-or-treating. Pooh Bear, you'll be trick-or-treating with Piglet. Roo, you'll be with Lumpy. And I'll be with Tigger. -What about me? -You, Eeyore? Forgot about me, didn't you? lt figures. The point is to get organized. If we follow the plan, we can make this the best Halloween ever. Oh, boy! Trick-or-treating begins promptly at the stroke of sunset. But I don't think my tummy can wait that long, Rabbit. lt wants a treat now. Well, your tummy will just have to wait, Pooh. We need to save all the candy for tonight. See, Lumpy? This is gonna be a great night of trick-or-treating. I think I'm gonna like this Heffaween. .. Hallow... The word is ""Halloween"". And it's time we showed our new friend what my favourite night of the year is all about. Now, a Halloween-y night is good When we're trick or treatin' through the woods I'll be sneakin' up and peekin' While my tippety toes are creakin' Boogity Boo-in' like a Super Tigger should Well, a sweet treat is just my cup of tea And a tricky-trick is just the treat for me Oh, everybody pay attention 'Cause I really hate to mention That the ghoulie ghosts are howling up a tree We are daring to be scaring Who's behind that mask you're wearing We can ""Boo!"" a spooky greetin' Then we'll share the sweets we're eating When we're home from trick-or-treating With our friends Oh, the Spookables crawl out from where they hide Do you think they might be hiding here inside? -Well, together we're more clever -We go places they would never! And a boo-hoo-hoo will send 'em for a ride We are daring to be scaring Who's behind that mask you're wearing? We can ""Boo!"" a spooky greeting Then we'll share the sweets we're eating When we're home from trick-or-treating With our friends We are daring to be scaring Who's behind that mask you're wearing? We can ""Boo!"" a spooky greeting Then we'll share the sweets we're eating When we're home from trick-or-treating With our friends Bravo, Tigger. You've succeeded in terrifying poor Lumpy. Lumpy, please come out. Halloween isn't that scary. -Right, Tigger? -You said it, Roo, old pal. Not scary is just what it is. As long as we don't run into the Gobloon, of course. No! Not the Gobloon! -What's a Gobloon? -Well, I'm glad you asked. I didn't wanna leave you in the dark. The Gobloon is the scardiest fraidifier that ever scarified on Halloween night. And he lives in the eeriest part of the Hundred Acre Woods. His lair lies beyond the Creepy Cave... -Dear. -...down the Slimy Slide, and in the Tree of Terror! There, there, Lumpy. Don't listen to that lunatic. There's no such thing as a Gobloon. You are so wrong, Long-Ears! -Tigger... -Rabbit... -Lunatic. -Long ears. Wrong you are, Long-Ears. Every Halloween, he roams the woods for poor victims to turn into jaggedy lanterns. Jaggedy lanterns! Lumpy! I'm sure the Gobloon isn't all bad. Right, Tigger? As a point of factin', Roo-boy, there is one good thing about the Gobloon. If you catch him, you get to make a wish. Did you hear that, Lumpy? What kind of wish? Well, only the wish-iest wish that you could ever wish about wishing for. Meaning, anything at all. -Wow! -Oh, fiddlesticks and nonsense. There's no such thing as a Gobloon and that's all there is to it! Lumpy? Please come out. -Please? -No, thanks. Don't want to get turned into a jaggedy lantern. Lumpy won't come out. What do we do? This is going to require thought, planning, concentration. Quick, everyone. ""Operation : Extract the Heffalump."" Everyone grab hold. Heave ho! We have to get organized. All together now. Put some muscle into it. But I don't wanna come out! Come on, pull! Watch my tail, Piglet. Easy on the stripes back there. Somehow I don't believe they thought this through. Come on, little Lumpster, don't be scarified. The front of me's not coming out. And the back of me's not coming out. And neither is my middle. Who turned out the lights? -It's a Spookable! Help! -Spookables! Run! -Help! -Oh, my! Ah, well, that's more like it. I guess I taught him a lesson or two. Please come out, Lumpy. I thought we were gonna spend Halloween together? You can come under here if you want. You guys go ahead. I'll stay here with Lumpy. It's OK, Lumpy. I was just really looking forward to trick-or-treating together. Lumpy! You're not hiding anymore. -Aren't you afraid? -Oh, I still am. But as long as we're together, I can be brave. -Hooray for Lumpy! -Good for you! That's what I'm talking about! Well, this calls for a celebration. Piglet, fetch some candy. Yes, sir. Rabbit, sir. Yes, I know. You're all surprised. ""No candy until tonight,"" I said. But special occasions call for sweets. So, Piglet, one piece of candy each. -Rabbit? -Yes, Piglet. The candy, if you please. Oh, dear. That's just it. Well, what is it, Piglet? Spit it out! Well, there's no candy left, Rabbit, sir. What do you mean, ""no candy left""? There's sacks and sacks of it over there. Pooh Bear? You ate all our candy? Mighty impressive for one bear, though. I don't know how it happened. I only wanted one, but... ...my tummy kept asking for more. There's gotta be some left here somewhere. We can't have Halloween without candy. Well, I'll betcha Rabbit has a few sweets tucked away. Don't ya, Long-Ears? I'm afraid not, Tigger. You see, I've collected every bit of candy from the Hundred Acre Wood. I'm afraid... ...there will be no trick-or-treating this year. Oh, dear. Oh, bother. My tummy says it's sorry. I wish there was some way we can get more candy. ""Wish""? Maybe there is a way. Remember Tigger's story? If we catch the Gobloon, we could wish for enough candy for everyone. Yeah! We can save Halloween. But if the Gobloon caught us, we'd be jaggedy lanterns. Don't worry. I'll be right there. I won't let him hurt you. OK, Lumpy, let's just go find some costumes for tonight. Yes, Roo, let us do so. That's the spirit. We can still have fun without candy. And don't forget, be back promptly at the stroke of sunset. We will! Now, what did Tigger say again? Oh, yeah. First we gotta find the Creepy Cave, then the Slimy Slide and then. .. -The Tree of Terror. -Oh, right. The Tree of Terror. Thanks, Lumpy. Come on! We're gonna make this the best Halloween ever. Take that! And that! And that! I proclaim Lumpy and Roo to be the floundering members of the... Bravest of the brave? The Bravest of the Brave Gobloon Catchers' Club. Brave together! Brave forever! Conquerors of the Gobloon! Now shake. No, no! Shake hands. That means we stick together, no matter what. What are we waiting for? Let's go! We're friends forever We'll be brave together We can weather whatever comes along One can do it Two is better You and me together forever Braver than brave Stronger than strong Brave together Singing our song -We're friends forever -One can do it, two is better -We'll be brave together -You and me together forever Braver than brave Stronger than strong Brave together Singing our song Rumple de doodle Rumple dee dee We'll rumble and tumble like bumbly bees Two together Together we're one Rumple de doodle De doodle de dum -You're my buddy -You're mine too -If I get scared -I'm right behind you lt would be super if we could be the bravest friends in history We're friends forever We'll be brave together We can weather whatever comes along We can weather whatever Comes Along No prizes for guessing where the Gobloon lives? Oh, don't worry. Gobloon catchers, ho! Lumpy? Come on! All right. Know what I'm gonna wish for when we catch that Gobloon? Assuming the Gobloon doesn't catch us first? I'm gonna wish for a million cookies, and then a million candies, then three more wishes. -How 'bout you? -Gosh. I've already got my best friend and a lunch box full of rumpledoodles. What else do I need? What was that? lt sounded like it came from over there. Look! That's gotta be the Creepy Cave, just like Tigger said. The Slimy Slide can't be far off. Come on, Lumpy. Whoa! Let's go! It's OK, Lumpy. It's only an echo. Listen. Gobloon! Roo, please don't do that again. I'm sorry. Roo! Something's following us. -I don't see anything. -I heard it. I don't hear anything, either. My ears are bigger than yours. Lumpy, it's all in your imagination. It's right behind me, Roo. lt kicked me in the bottom. Lumpy! Stop! It's only your lunch box. See? I don't care. This is too scary. I don't want to go on. But we can't stop now. I'm sorry, Roo. I'm not taking another step and that is final! We're almost through the cave. All we have to... ... find is the Slimy Slide! Lumpy? Are you OK? I think so. OK, we got through the cave and down the slide. But where's that Tree of Terror? Wonder which way we should go? Smell anything? Nope. See anything? -Nope. -Maybe he's not home. Well, only one way to find out. What are you going to do? Don't worry. I have a plan. Lumpy! You know what? He must be out Goblooning. He could be back any minute. He could turn us into jaggedy lanterns. I don't think I can do this, Roo. I want to go home. If we leave, we won't catch the Gobloon and we won't get our wishes and we won't have candy and I won't get to show you how great Halloween is. I'm sorry. I'm just so scared. Gosh, I wish Piglet was here. -Piglet? -Yeah. He was so afraid of Halloween once, it almost was a Hallow-wasn't. -But then he got un-scared. -Really? Say, maybe if I told you the story, Lumpy, you might be un-scared too. All right. lt happened before Mom and I moved to the Hundred Acre Wood. lt was Halloween, and everyone was really excited to go trick-or-treating. They all had funny costumes and Pooh Bear's was the bestest of them all. Look, there he is now. Hi, Pooh Bear. What are you up to? Practicing. For Halloween. Which happens to happen soon. So I must be prepared. Though I'm not fond of tricking, I do enjoy treating, because treating means... ...eating. Bother. I've smackled every smackeral of hon... Happy Halloweenin' to ya, Pooh-boy! Not late, am I? Didn't miss any anythin', did I? Halloween's what Tiggers like the best. Trick or treat! Hello, Pooh. Hello, Tigger. Nice costume. You make a good yak. I'm not supposed to be some yakkety-yakketin'-yak! Now I gotta get a new outfit! 'Cause I'm gonna win that Best Costume Prize. You wait and see! But, Gopher, I don't think there is such a prize. Fine with me! Cuts down on the competition. Night'll be fallin' any minute now, and I still haven't pulled any warm-up tricks! But, Tigger, we can't go yet. What do you mean? Halloween night won't last all day, and we gotta be ready for it! But our very dear friend Piglet is not here. And I would have thought he should have been by now. I hope he is all right. Yes, Piglet, you're gonna be quite all right. Because this year is going to be the year. This Halloween, you're going to enjoy yourself. Nothing is going to frighten you. There! If I'm not scared of something as frightful as this, I'll be unafraid of anything! I hope. Ghoulish goblin Ghastly ghost Everything scares me the most All I really want to do ls be with Pooh, Eeyore and Tigger Kind of creepy, sort of scary Yes, but maybe not so very Well, in order to be brave I tell myself that I am not afraid No, not too much And if I am not afraid Not more than a touch I can be around my friends And being with them is much better We might be more brave together Then I can say that I am not af... What if some spook comes up to me When it's dark and really gloomy How very grand to stand up tall But could I even stand at all? I don't have one scary feature A timid, small and frightened creature Dear, oh dear, I'm just not brave I want to tell them I am not afraid No, not too much And if I am not afraid Not more than a touch I can be around my friends And being with them is much better We might be more brave together It's Halloween I'll face my fear 'Cause it's the spookiest night of the year What a very grand thing to be so brave To show myself that I am not afraid Trick or treat. Or not. Why, Piglet, where is your costume? Oh. I... Actually I haven't entirely decided, exactly, just what I want to be, precisely. Gasp! Look at the time. Half-past a quarter of sunset. And I still haven't done any warmin'-uppin'! Come on! I gotta try some trick-or-trickin' on old Rabbit. There is a trick to pullin' tricks, you know. Storm brewin'. Oh, dear. Piglet. If you were I and I were you, would you think my costume will get me plenty of treats tonight? Namely, honey. I should give it a trying-out to be sure. Oh, Pooh, I really don't know. Say, where y'all buzzing off to, buddy boys? I shall know I'm all the bee that I can be, if the bees see me and see a bee instead of me. See? Oh, Pooh Bear! Perhaps it would be best, Piglet, if you didn't call me by name. lt might make the bees curious. I'm sorry, Pooh Who Isn't. A trick? Or treat? Oh, bother. Each precious pumpkin a picture of perfection! No, no, no! Not this way. That way, to your left. No, your other left! Oh, my! My poor pumpkins. Are you all right, Pauline? Oh, speak to me, Pietro. Oh, don't you know me, Petunia? Trick or treat! Not now, Gopher. And why are you dressed like a muskrat? Muskrat? That guy wouldn't know a rabbit from a hole in the ground! Look at all the pretty pumplekins! Jackie-lanterns just waitin' to happen! Oh, dear! Tigger, stop that! I have no time for this Halloween nonsense. I have work to do. I have pumpkins to protect! How's this one? Of all my favourite holidays, Halloween isn't. A stormin'-good storm. This is gonna be the bestest Halloween ever! With loads of lightnin'! And thunderous thunderin'! And windiferous winds breaking everywhere! Oh, dear. Why, we're gonna be creepin' and crawlin' with Spookables! Oh, dear. You don't suppose there will be any Spookables of the honey-hungry sort? -Do you? -At least half a dump of Spookables. And bug-eyed Woozles and saw-toothed Jagulars! Oh, dear! Deary dear dear! Piglet. And then Piglet ran for his life. Hey, Lumpy, is the story making you feel any better? -I'll take that as a ""no"". -What happened next, Roo? Did the Spookables get Piglet? Well, let's see. Piglet was all alone, lost in the woods, on the ookiest-spookiest night of the year, which really wasn't the best place to be. There. Now you're safe and sound. Who is it? It's me, them, and , of course, us. Oh. But wait. Perhaps if you'd say something only you would say, I'd know you're you. A very good idea, Piglet. But what should I say? Well, possibly.. . ""I am Pooh""? You are? Well, then who am I? It's Pooh. Are you quite all right, Piglet? Yes. You will be joining us for Halloween, won't you? Well, to be perfectly honest. .. What I mean to say is... To put it another way... The truth of the matter is... As a small and timid animal, I'm afraid I'm really too afraid. Oh, but Piglet, Halloween without you would be like... Like last year, and the year before last year. And the year before that year. And all the years leadin' up to and includin' every last Halloween ever. I'm very, very sorry indeed. Oh, that's quite all right, Piglet. We shall simply not have Halloween. Oh, you mustn't do that, Pooh Bear, -only because of me. -Oh, no. This Halloween shall be a Hallo-wasn't and you shall have no reason to be frightened. Thank you, Pooh Bear. Would you like us to stay with you, Piglet? No, I'll be quite all right now. I had hoped it wouldn't happen this year. Everyone was looking forward to Halloween so. I've let down Pooh and Tigger and Gopher and Eeyore and most of all... me. I do so hope this blusterous and rather stormish night will not be too frightening for poor Piglet. I suspect something should be done. But what? I don't know either. Think, think. Why, just because Piglet can't have Halloween with us, there's no reason we can't have Hallo-wasn't with him! I like the way you think. No way, no how, am I gonna miss out on another Halloween! I'll have my own Hallo-wasn't all by myself. If only Piglet was more like me and less like him. I love surprises and wearin' disguises A horribly hideous costume'll do Better be wary, be spooky and scary I'll bounce from the shadows and ""Boo"" I wanna scare myself and everyone else Those thrilly and chilly old willys will rise Cover your eyes, little buddy beware I'm twitchin' and itchin' to scare Myself Unspeakable Spookables Awful unlookables Galloping ghosties and goblins galore What if they find you Oh, look out behind you A terrible Tigger-type roar That would be me, hoo-hoo I wanna scare myself and everyone else Those thrilly and chilly old willys will rise Cover your eyes, little buddy beware I'm twitchin' and itchin' to scare Myself Now Tiggers I figger make scares even bigger They dress up and scream ""Who am I? Can you guess?"" And tricks always happen when ghosts are a-flappin' And tricks are what Tiggers like best! I wanna scare myself and everyone else Those thrilly and chilly old willys will rise Cover your eyes, little buddy beware I'm twitchin' and itchin' to scare Myself And who better? Oh, by the way. Boo! Spookables! Trick-or-treat, again. We're on our way to Piglet's to have a Hallo-wasn't, -if you'd like to join... -What're ya waitin' for? Come on! What was that? Someone's coming! It's a three-headed, bug-eyed , saw-toothed Spookable! I must find Pooh! Perhaps we'd better take off our costumes, so as not to frighten him. Piglet? Piglet? Don't you know what this means? He's been pignapped by Spookables! Hup, two, three, four. Pooh wasn't at Eeyore's either, and neither was Eeyore, and no one was at Tigger's. Hello, Rabbit? Oh, no one at all is where they should be. Oh, dear. Was that you, Eeyore? Wish I could say it was. But it wasn't. If I didn't know any better, I'd think you fellas was all scaredy. We are. Well, I'm not! Now quit climbin' all over me, buddy bear! We got piglets to find! I think I have had a thought. If we put our costumes on, when we find the Spookables, they shall think we're them and we shall think they are us, so we can save Piglet and no one will be the wiser! I know I got it this time! Oh, an infestation of ghosts and goblins and ghouls! Piglet! Excuse me, but could someone, anyone really, help me? Oh, dear! Pooh Bear! Oh, they have Pooh Bear! Two very fierce and savage Spookables! I must save my friend Pooh! Boo! Boo, I say. Boo! Spookable! What? Who's that? Oh no, not this way! Oh, dear! Why, Piglet, you scared the Spookable away! I did? You did and what you did saved us all. I did! Three cheers for the bravest little timid guy ever! Hip-hip! Hooray! Hip-hip! Hooray! Dagnabit! Why, Gopher, what a wonderful costume. lt is? lt is! By dingy, it's the best! That's what it is. Of all the Halloweens I can remember, and I can't, this Hallo-wasn't has been the most unforgettable of all. And I got a super, grade-A, lollapaloozin' good scare! Not that I was frightened by it. And this year Piglet has made it all the way through, so our Hallo-wasn't truly was a Hallo-was. Hey, wait a half a segundo. You never did figure out what you're gonna be, Piglet! Actually, Tigger, I did. I've decided I'd like to go as Pooh's very best, and very bravest friend. That, Piglet, is the thing I should most like you to be. So, with just a little bit of help from his very good friend... -Pooh Bear? -That's right. Piglet became un-scared. And he stayed un-scared for a while. 'Cause he had his friends to keep him company. Lumpy, did my story un-scare you? I think so. If someone as small as Piglet can be brave, -I can be twice as brave. -At least. You would never leave me alone, would you, Roo? Never, Lumpy. I promise. -Brave together. -Brave forever. Conquerors of the Gobloon! Come on, Lumpy. Come on! All we have to do now is wait 'til he comes home. Then I pull the rope, the trap door slams down and wham! -We get our wishes? -Yep! Now... Don't make a sound. Whoa! What was that? Maybe it's the Gobloon. You stay here. I'll go check it out. If it's him, I'll chase him here. And when I give the signal , you spring the trap. What signal? I'll hoot like Owl. Only instead of ""hoo hoo"", I'll hoot ""Roo hoo"". On second thought, why don't you come with me? Good idea. That way I'll know when you give the signal. Come on. It's coming from the bridge. Follow me. Lumpy, come on! Lumpy, quiet! Run, Lumpy! Run! The Gobloon's gonna get us. Help! Roo! Roo? Roo, where are you? You said you'd never leave me alone. Lumpy? Where are you? Help! The Gobloon's got me! The Gobloon's got me! Hold on, Roo. I'll save you! Help! Roo hoo! Where are you, Roo? Please answer me. Roo? Help! The Gobloon's got Roo! Brave together, brave forever. I'll save you, Roo. If Piglet can be un-scared, so can I. Brave together, brave forever. Conquerors of the Gobloon. Oh, no, you don't. -Boo. -Oh, hello, Eeyore. How'd you know it was me? -Hello, Piglet. -Hello, Pooh. Look at me, Piglet. I'm a little honey pot. Oh, very nice, Pooh Bear. Oh, hi, Tigger. Tigger is my mild-mannered alter-ego. I am Super-Tigger. I can leap over a house or something really big, in a single bounce. And then... And I... I'm not kidding anyone. lt just doesn't feel like Halloween without any candy. lt feels more like Hallow-almost or Hallow-Not-Quite-Right. -Or something. -I know what you mean, Tigger. Even my tummy can't be fooled. Cheer up, everyone. Halloween is saved. I knew you could do it, Long-Ears. So, what did ya bring? Popcorn balls? Candied apples? Cookies? -Even better. -Honey? -Even better. -As long as it's candy. Sure is. Nature's candy. Vegetables. Carrots. Radishes. Rutabagas. Oh, they're tasty, juicy, and most important, good for you. Well, I suppose we could go trick-or-treating with these. Well, I'll take the trick, please. Oh, nonsense. This is going to be the best and healthiest Halloween ever! Finally, as it should be. Hey, I just thought of something. If we're all here to go tricking and treating, then none of us are home to be treated or tricked. You're right, Tigger. That is a bother. But what should we do? Think, think, think. I have an idea! Let's take turns. We can practice here at my house. I don't know, Piglet. What if you don't answer the door? Oh, I will! I promise, I will! Well, it's risky. Oh, my head hurts. But it's just crazy enough to work. -Let's give it a try. -Goody-goody! Who's there? It's us! Who else could it be? -""Us"" who? -""Us""! Rabbit, Tigger and Pooh Bear! Forgot me again. Prove it. Open this door at once! -Rabbit! lt is you! -Trick-or-treat! Hooray! I can't wait to try my place. Wonder if I'm gonna be there. Lumpy? Where are you? Lumpy? Oh, no! The Gobloon got you! And he's turned you into a jaggedy lantern. Say something, Lumpy. Oh no, Lumpy. Don't worry, I'll find help. It'll be OK. I won't leave you again. Let's give Rabbit the old trickety-treatment. Knockety knock knockety. Guess who! ""Guess who,"" he says. Gee, I don't know. Pooh Bear? Tigger? Oh, he's good. Very good. Anyway, let's see, where are those treats? Oh, here we go. A nice juicy rutabaga for Pooh Bear. Prunes for Piglet, celery for Eeyore, and for you, Tigger. .. spinach. Roo-boy and Lumpy are missing all the fun, and the spinach. I told 'em to be here at sunset. I'm sure they'll be by any minute. -Help! -Roo-boy. Help! We tried to catch the Gobloon , and we found his tree but I got scared and ran away. Then the Gobloon turned him into a jaggedy lantern. Could you start again from that first Gobloon? -Gobloon! -Oh, dear. The story's true. There really is a Gobloon. Quick, everyone, panic! -Poor Lumpy. -Oh, this will never do. Wait a second. I got it. We gotta catch the Gobloon. -What? -Well, if you catch the Gobloon, -you get to make a wish. -That's it, Tigger. We can wish Lumpy back. Tigger's right. Wait a minute. Tigger's right? That can't be right. Hurry! There's not a moment to lose! -Hurry! -Come on. We're gonna save him. -We're coming, Lumpy. -Don't worry! We'll have you back to normal in no time. I'm sorry I left you all alone. Lumpy, we're coming for you! We're coming, Lumpy! Remind me again, Pooh Bear. How did I ever become un-scared? Listen, everyone. The tree is making noises. Maybe it has a bellyache. That's the Gobloon! The trap worked. We caught him! -Hooray! -Hooray for us! -I knew we could do it. -Hooray! Yay! Now what? -Knock and shout ""trick-or-treat"". -I could offer him some honey. I don't think Gobloons eat honey. Well, he could sure have all of my spinach. Um, Mr Gobloon? I don't want candy. All I care about is Lumpy. I wish my friend back. You hear me, you mean old Gobloon? I want my friend back! Roo? Roo! I'm in here! Lumpy? -You're OK! -lt worked. -Things couldn't get better. -Roo wished Lumpy back! -lt worked! -Oh, yes! Now, that's what I call a happy ending. I'm sorry I ran away, Lumpy. I was just so scared. Would you... Could you... forgive me? Gosh, Roo, you came back for me. That was brave. I guess thinking about being with you made me brave. -Brave together? -Brave forever. Conquerors of the Gobloon! -Hooray! -Hooray for us! Who needs candy to have a great Halloween? When we've got each other. You know, it seems to me there's only one thing left to say. I know, I know. Trick-or-Treat. -Gasp! -Happy Halloween, everyone! Trick-or-Treat. Mama! Come in. I baked cookies and rumpledoodles for everybody. And I made a special jack-o'-lantern for each and every one of you. Hello, gorgeous. Doesn't look like me at all. Why the long face? Oh, look, Piglet. It's me and my very best friend. Oh, mine too! Look, Lumpy. There's even one for me. -Wow! -But where's yours? I'm so sorry, Lumpy. I did make one for you, but it must have fallen off my wheelbarrow. See? I told you. Halloween is the most fun ever. You were right. I love Hallowoon. Hallow-woo... Hallow... Oh, whatever. As long as we're together. We are daring to be scaring Who's behind that mask you're wearing? We can ""Boo!"" a spooky greetin' Then we'll share the sweets we're eating When we're home from trick or treating With our friends We're friends forever We'll be brave together We can weather whatever comes along One can do it Two is better You and me together forever Braver than brave Stronger than strong Brave together Singing our song -We're friends forever -One can do it, two is better -We'll be brave together -You and me together forever -We can weather -Braver than brave stronger than strong -Whatever comes along -We're brave together singing our song Rumple de doodle Rumple dee dee We'll rumble and tumble like bumbly bees Two together Together we're one Rumple de doodle De doodle de dum -You're my buddy -You're mine too -If I get scared -I'm right behind you lt would be super if we could be the bravest friends in history We're friends forever We'll be brave together We can weather whatever comes along We can weather Whatever comes along "

It's time to leave, we are closing. - I'll just drink this. - You'll drink it outside. Move! Hey! Sleeping beauty! Wake up! Hey! You can't do that here! Put the brush back and go! Are you deaf? Put the brush back! - Was she expelled? - We were going to leave, anyway. They don't pay much attention to children there. It's better for Niki here. Wasn't she going to come too? She had a bellyache, and went to the bathroom. - Are you the child's legal guardian? - Yes. - And her parents? - Her mother died. - My condolences. And her father? - We don't keep in touch. She could join the sixth graders even today. But if she feels sick then she should rest. Did you hear? Karola, long time no see. Hello, how can I help you? Hello... I have a savings account with a prize car. You won a car? - No, I need the money from the account. - Your passbook, please. And if I don't have it? I'd suggest that you find it and then come back again. - Then I'd say I can't get it. - How so? Like I said. I don't want to get into this, but... You're in it now, there must be some record of my money here. That's what a passbook is for. It's the official record that you invested at our bank. Without it, anyone could come in and claim money. You mean it's not here? Where the fuck is it? Calm down please, or else I can't help you. Here you are. ID. Address card. Shop loyalty card... ...a photo of my mother, what else will make you believe me? That's not how it works, sir. What's the problem? What's the problem? You steal people's money. You shuffle it then make it disappear like fucking Houdini! - Leave the building. - And if I don't, what then? - I'll call the police. - 'Cause I want to take my money out? - You're disrupting service. - What service? Your service is shit here! I want to talk to your bosses. Fuck, just call your daddy. You're all clowns. Go fuck yourselves. - Not bad, but it's not my style. - I'll try it on. What did you do in England? - Well, all sorts. I didn't go to school. - How come? - They didn't mind. - Your parents? My mom is a musician. She's in a synth-pop band, and I joined her on tour. - Is she the singer? - The drummer. - Cool. - Check this out. Don't you have any clean socks? Hello! Hello! Don't you have any clean socks? - You can't try them on without socks. - Then how? Only with clean socks. I'm calling the manager. Pali, come here. - What is it? - He ate the kid's sandwich. - OK, I'll deal with him. - Come on, Domi, it's 7:30! Hey. Wake up, already. You fuckin' ate Domi's lunch. - A little diet won't hurt that kid. - Don't be such an asshole. - Did you go to the bank? - Yeah. - And? - Nothing. - They need that fucking passbook. - Maybe you should go and ask for it. - You go for it. - Me? I asked you to pick up my things, right? It doesn't matter when your brother is in need, right? - It's weird if I go instead of you. - It's you who needs money. I need money? You eat my food, you sleep on my couch and it's me who needs money? Every day, my wife asks when you're going to chip in. I'll give when I get it. Come! Hello... Hello, Éva. Hello, Éva. It's me, Tibi. Can I buy some new shoes? - You already have some. - But the sole's coming off. How much are they? 21 thousand. Go on, pick it up! Hello. It's Tibi. Is anyone there? Hello? Who is it? Who is it? Who was that? Tibi. What did he want? I don't know. What do you mean, you don't know? - Why didn't you call me? - He hung up. If he calls again, give the phone to me. Who's that? - My dad. - Got a proper pic of him? - No, because he's wanted by the police. - Why? He has an offshore firm in the Bahamas. We get a lot of money from it. He is my mom's manager. If you're so rich, why do you always borrow money? - I told you, I left my purse at home. - Why are you such a liar? - I'm not lying. - Yeah, right. What's the matter? How do you have the nerve to come here? I need the papers. You think I still have them? I told you not to come here anymore! - We don't want to hear about him. - Maybe it was mixed with Edina's stuff. Get lost! Granny Why didn't you answer?Where are you?At Karola's. Are you in the city?What's that noise?We're on our way. To their place. Come home! You didn't tell meyou're staying out!They live really far. In Budakeszi. Then ask her motherto bring you home!She's gone to bed. Next time, tell meyou're sleeping over!Sorry. I put up with shit from your mother-in-law and Kinga. It's not the best fucking time to discuss this. You think it's okay that I go for your stuff, 'cause you don't dare? I went back to work. - I'm tired of cleaning up after you. - You clean up? I keep your house in order! Your fucking garden! I take your dog for a piss. Should I fuck your wife too? - Then she might calm down. - Give me the keys. Get out in the morning. I don't want to see you there anymore. Stop. Show me your purse. - You can't take that in. - Are you serious? - I said throw it out. - It's only water! I don't care, throw it out! Enjoy the party. - Hold it! - What's the problem? - She can't walk. - Get off. Your friend let us in. - What's wrong? - She can barely walk. - Calm the fuck down. - Don't tell me to calm down. - I've had it with you! - They are off their faces! I don't care! Hey, girls! Stop! What's the rush? Back off! You can't take booze in. Who do you think you are? Go back! - I told you, you can't come in! - Fuck off! What are you doing here? Dorci, take this kid away from here! What the fuck is going on here? - What have you done? - They came at me with a wine glass. Get the fuck outta here. Your shift is over. What happened down there? So... How did you get in? Who were you with? I have to call your parents. Please, talk to me! She was walking around alone. Could you leave us? - Why? - Please. - But Gábor told me to... - She's with me. - What? - Like I said. How did you get here? How did you find me? Who told you I was here? Huh? Nobody. Then, how? Did you see what happened upstairs? Why did you come here? It's no place for a kid, for fuck's sake! They'll be looking for you at home. Where do they think you are? With a friend. I have to get out of here. Now. Come. I said come. I'm taking you home, OK? I can go home on my own. Are you hungry? What will you have? - Come on. - I'm not hungry. It's up to you. I bought these for you. I don't eat dessert. You can take it to school, hm? School lunch is crap. I don't want it. Can you believe this? Are you blind, man? This guy too. Can't you see, you prick? Unbelievable. I mean, seriously. I'm conquered. Overcome by the forces of nature. Where do you live? Can't we go to your place? It's not that simple. Why? I'm in between places. But I happen to know a place. In two weeks, they're gonna alter this place. Until then, it's free. Can you put on some music? Sure. Do you want to put on something? - What language is this? - Icelandic. What's she saying? Listen... My life is a mess right now. I have no place to live. You saw, I couldn't take you anywhere. If I get a bit more money, then maybe... but right now, it's just too complicated for us to meet everyday. It's better that way, believe me. My T-shirts? Kinga washed them. They're on the drying rack. You have a place to go? Don't act like you care. - I wanted to help. - I can see that. Some people are beyond help. Last year we learned about animals with a similar diet: cattle. This is the third time you're late. - Your shoes are cool. - Thanks. - You said you didn't like them. - I changed my mind. - Is it a problem? - No. I bet your criminal father can buy them for you, right? Stupid cunt. What's going on back there? Niki, stand up. How many stomachs does a cow have? 69. 69. 69, really? Okay, bring me your report book. That is an F. Listen. You've lost this. Listen, I acted shit, I'm sorry. Let's sit down somewhere and talk. Do you know this man? Do you know this man? No. Leave this child alone. - Let's go this way. - That's not where I'm going. - Would you go away! - Ma'am would you just calm down? You're not going to molest this child! - Is he your father? - No. - Who are you? - Fuck, I don't believe it. I'm going to report you. Where are you going? You hear? Nowhere. Fine, I'm going with you. Are you serious? This is so embarrassing. I'll give you money instead. How much do you need? 21 thousand. Maybe not today. Didn't I tell you not to come here? Or else? What are you gonna do about it? Keep working. She is nice. She sure is. Rad. Cool. Check this out. This is the one I like. Not bad. I'm not loaded right now. But there is something you could find for me. A little green book, with the word Passbook on it. With that, I could buy you those shoes. It must be at the bottom of a drawer. Come with me and let's find it together. I'm not welcome there. Why is Granny so angry with you? Because... you were in prison? That's right. What did you do? I did a lot of shit. I was all over the place, making trouble all the time. Why, what did she tell you? That I shouldn't talk to you. And that you'll never look for me. See, here I am. - Aren't you going to pick it up? - It's unknown. Don't tell them at home that you met me, okay? Are you coming tomorrow? I can. - Hello. - Good afternoon. Is this Tibor Kondor? Yes? I'm calling from the Life Protection Unitof Budapest Police HQ.You have to come infor questioning.Regarding what? The man you beat up Thursday nightfell into a coma today.Come and see mein Teve street at 10 AM.Tibor Kondor. Regarding the life-threatening assault that took place on Thursday September 16, at 22:14, I am questioning you as a suspect. You can file a complaint against being suspected, you are not obliged to speak. You may refuse to speak at any time during the procedure. - Do you understand this information? - Yes. In your own words, tell me what happened. He came with his girlfriend, who was shitfaced. Told them that they can't go in. But they got in somehow. Then I told them that wasn't okay. First, the woman came at me, then the guy. He was already on a roll, so I gave him a little twist. - Can you be more concrete? - Concrete how? ""They got in somehow."" ""He was already on a roll."" ""I gave him a little twist."" Can you elaborate? They wanted to go in, but I didn't let them. - My colleague let them... - His name? Zsolt Bene let them in. I suspected that this was a mistake, since, as I mentioned, they were drunk. I told them to leave. Then she picked up a fat wine glass, broke it, and lunged at me with a shard. Well, that's... Only a woman can do that. Then he hit me... and I did hit him back, more than once. But what was I supposed to do? Stand there like a dick at a wedding? - Do you wish to say anything else? - No. I checked your record. You have a criminal history. You did four years for vehicular manslaughter. That is not relevant. This is not the first time the suspect committed a life-threatening crime, so, I believe that it is relevant. Under the influence of drugs and alcohol he caused an accident resulting in the death of his partner, Edina Várkonyi. I'm going to report bias. Don't you see a pattern between these two cases? - Are we going to the theatre? - To the circus, young lady. - Evenin'. - Good evening. Listen, guys. The doors are open until 7. After that, you're standing outside. Richie, look at you. You want me to button you up? What a dick. One more week, then I'm gone. Because? To fuck about here, for 1500 Forints per hour? Looking like a penguin? Fuck that. I'm outta here! Where? Barcelona, they are hiring at a casino. I'd work two days a week, and I'll make 150 Euros a day. I'll party the whole time. Be careful, or they'll take you as a dancer too. You're just envious. I'm at Karola's... Hello. Are you Julcsi's daughter? Look! It's Julcsi's daughter. You're Anna, right? Your mom told me a lot about you. That you do modeling and such. Tell me, how is it? - Well... - You were abroad... In Japan, right? Yes, and in Cuba too. - You hear that? - Yeah, great. Yes, we lived on a yacht the whole time. Considering that, you look pale. They sprayed me with a whitening cream so I wouldn't get a tan. - With a whitening cream? - There you are! - We introduced ourselves to Anna. - Hello, I'm Julcsi. - She is not your daughter? - I could never get Anna to come here. So? Where can I buy that skin whitener? Leave her be. This is outrageous! - What's the matter? - She sneaked in. - I'll handle it. - I'll handle it myself. She is with me. For this they could cancel our contract! There's no need to be mad, she'll sit here quietly. Why aren't you at your place? - He brought this child in here. - Who is she? My daughter. - What's got into you? - I'll let you two handle this. This is a workplace, not a fucking kids' party. Is it a problem that she ate two sandwiches? No, the problem is that you always get into trouble. For me, it's not worth it. Get outta here, okay? - Are you firing me? - That's right. Right now, right here? And your free shelter is gone. Move out from B7. The exit is not that way! Bon appétit! What are you looking at? This fuckin' shit! Fuck this! Hey, Tibi, stop it. - Come outside. - I'll eat this first. - Buddy! Don't do this, come on! - I said now. Sorry. Stop it! Come outside! Come on. - You'll have to carry me... - That's enough. What is it now? - Why did you do that? - Do what? - We were supposed to leave! - We did leave, didn't we? Why feel sorry for them? Was I an asshole? Yes. Show me how much. So I wasn't an asshole. That's all? I won't ever be an asshole again. Promise? Promise. Tastes like shit. I like it. You should invite this Karola over sometime. It's always them hosting you. It's not right. - What her parents do for a living? - They're lawyers. What are you looking for? - Some tools. - What for? For home economics. I'll find you some tools tomorrow. - Are you coming? - Coming. Thank you. It was next to this. It was mom's, right? I couldn't find the other one. She only wore one. Why? It was her idea. She always had odd socks. What are you doing? What do you think? I'm cooking. You don't need that much. It'll be disgusting. Really? You seem to be doing great with this. - In England, I always cooked for myself. - You were in England? I was an exchange student in Liverpool. Exchange student... what the heck is that? I lived with an English girl, but her parents sent me back, because she told them that I broke her hand. And... It wasn't you? No, but she cried so hard, the teachers believed her. And when I came back they kicked me out of the school. Why are you lying? I'm not lying. Don't give me that, I can see you're faking. She fell out of a tree. She was clumsy. That's it. I built a hideout in a tall tree, then Emily and her friend climbed in, and they didn't let me in. But I built the whole thing on my own! So I locked them inside, and took away the ladder. They sat up there all day long! Then Emily got out. But it's not my fault if she can't jump properly. Did you tell them this? If you had said this, then maybe you wouldn't have to take the blame, right? But I'd love to have a word with this Emily. Hello. - Hello. - Hi! Can't you see the room is occupied? There isn't room for four of us. It's a shared kitchen, didn't you see the sign? I can't believe it. We can't get five minutes in peace! - Relax, man. - Don't 'relax' me. Niki, come on. Did you hear? Thank you very much. Tastes good. I got a letter from the police. We have to appear as witnesses,because of a fight.- Did somebody hurt you?- No!- What is all this? You can tell me...- Nothing happened!What is this businesswith the police?I don't know. Come home,and we'll talk about it, okay?Okay. Something wrong? Granny got a letter from the police. We have to go in. Because of that fight. You don't have to say anything. Okay? Don't say anything, and it'll be fine. Niki, do you know why we're here? There is CCTV footage of you on Thursday, September 16... at the entrance of a nightclub called Red. That night, there was a fight in the club. There is no footage of that. Your father, Tibor Kondor got into a fight with a man. Did he come to see you? It's important that we let Niki speak, so please... I told you to tell me if he contacts you. If you don't let the girl speak, I'll have to ask you to leave the room. You should know that if you tell me what you saw, it might help your father, or it might not. You must be careful to answer me honestly. Can you tell me why you went to the place where your father worked? - You went there yourself? At night? - I have to ask you to leave the room. I have the right to know what happened to my granddaughter. You are obstructing questioning, please leave. Until you do, we can't continue. If you are ready, we can continue. Can you tell me why you went to the place where your father worked? Did your father ask you to go there? You wanted to go there? Why did you want to go there? Did you want to say something to him? I just wanted to see him. Why? - I heard that he was there. - Where was he, until then? - Inside. - Where? In prison. And did you see him at the club? Yes. And did you see the fight? No. You didn't see anybody fighting? Well... I did. A woman went at him, and wanted to beat him up. Your father? Yes. Then did you see the fight, or didn't you? I saw it. And did you see your father fight? Remember, I told you, there are no right or wrong answers. What matters is that you tell the truth. Yes... Did your father strike the first blow? No. Thank you for your help. We are finished. I'm calling the medical expert. Do you stand by your opinion? Yes. Please, in a few sentences, summarize your expert opinion. Based on my examinations, I came to the conclusion that as a result of strikes from the accused's fist, and due to a fall to the ground the victim sustained... serious injuries that resulted in bleeding within the skull. The victim was only saved from death due to prompt medical assistance. To this day, the victim is comatose, and the long-term effects of his injury are unpredictable. Go inside. Hear me? Niki. Niki! You have the nerve to show up here? You promised me that you wouldn't look for her anymore. She came to see me. And I wanted to see her, too. What do you want? Haven't you caused pain enough? I'm sorry. If I see you near her again, I'll tell her what you did! You took her away from me... - I didn't mean to. - You didn't mean to... You made her get into the car while you were drunk! She pulled the wheel. What did you do? We were driving. We had a fight. I was being jealous again. I was driving too fast. I was really mad, and she... ...she wanted to get out while the car was moving. We crashed into the guard rail. I didn't want to hurt her. You two were my everything. Niki I don't know, I think it's math. - We have physics next. - How do you know? We got the final schedule. Well, the teacher told me that she'd send it to me, but she didn't. - But then what is the next class? - I don't know. Something really stinks here. It really stinks here. What's going on here? Both of you, stop it, this instant! Give me your report book, now! I'd like to see both of your parents. In this closed hearing, the court has reached, and announces the following verdict. The accused, Tibor Kondor, is guilty of causing life threatening bodily harm. The court now sentences him to spend three years in prison. The sentence is to be spent in a medium-security prison. This fucking thing... Closing time! I'm closing up now. Hey. Wake up. Let me drink this one. Uh-huh. This is what I owe you, right? No? Thanks. You want to come in? Get inside! Shoo! Get in! Get inside! I'd rather not. When are you going inside? Tonight. The lawyer called. I'm sorry. What are you lookin' at? No more walks. Can you come to school now?Room 8b, fourth floor.What is it? Can I take the car for a ride? Now? I have to make a stop. I'll bring it back right away. Did you tell them at home about the meeting? - Yes. - Then why did nobody come? Show me your report book. This isn't signed. This will have consequences. I'm going to speak to your grandmother. Sorry, we'll have to reschedule this meeting. I left work early today. Karola missed sports practice. I see, but we can't proceed... I'm sorry you had to come here for no reason. - Afternoon! - Good afternoon. I'm Niki's father. You didn't tell your grandmother? Thank you for coming, but the fact is that you aren't Niki's legal guardian. And without the legal guardian we cannot represent Niki here. What legal guardian? Did I invite myself? My daughter called me. Yes, I know, but you can't stay here. What's the issue? Go on. Tell us what you did. You're not proud of it, are you? - I had a fight. - She attacked Karola. Scratched her so badly, it left a wound on her face. Did anyone ask her why she did it? I don't think this level of aggression is ever acceptable. So are they just here for decoration? All right, Niki... ...would you tell us what made you so angry? She smeared dogshit on my shoes. - You did what? - Is that true? - She got the same ones I had! - I wanted them first! - Why didn't you buy them? - You said you didn't even like them! Tell me something you fought for. Something you really wanted and you did everything for it. We'll deal with this, okay? Nothing? - We came first in volleyball. - What did you get for it? A medal. - What if I pissed on your medal? - Leave my child alone! - That tone isn't necessary, OK? - We won't resolve things like this. Would you be pleased? I'd be a real asshole, if I did that, right? Niki worked fucking hard for those shoes. Oh really? And so she can fight? As if that were an excuse. You know what? Here, buy the shoes. But my daughter was hurt, and this won't undo it. Do you want it? Me neither. It seems the only way to get even is if I shit on your daughter's shoes. Let's stop, right here. Please, leave. Gladly. Niki, are you coming? You have a car? Rad. Where are we going? Elvira lawyer Wanna come with me to Barcelona? I'd have a job there... What do you say? We'll leave all these assholes behind. Cool. - But we can't take your phone with us. - Why? Don't worry, I'll buy you a better one. What's the beach like? Pebbles or sand? - Whichever you want. - I'd prefer pebbles. The water is much clearer, and I can see my feet. Pump no. 4. 5710 Forints. This too? 8Yeah. 8805 Forints. Fuck, I thought I had more money. Do you have any? That's enough for the gas. - Then we won't take these. - Just leave them here. Thanks. Yes... that's a good girl. We're almost done. All right. Good girl. You're a good girl. We're almost done. Okay. There you go. There. Now we lift this up. Okay. It's okay now. Almost done. We're just about done. If all goes well, we'll be on the beach tomorrow. Cool right? - What's wrong? - Be quiet for a moment. What's going on? Are you hurt? What's wrong? I thought we were in trouble. Everything will be all right. Everything will be all right. Niki. Niki. Why have we come back? We're not going away? - You promised! - You're expected at home. You promised! - We can't go to Barcelona right now. - Why? I was convicted. Because of that fight you saw. Will you go away? Again? I'll come back. Now, go. Niki. - Good evening. - Good evening. Evening. I think you're looking for me. Tibor Kondor. - Get to the front of the car. - I'll call dispatch. Put your hands on the hood. I'm going to frisk your clothes, understood? Yes. -What? -I understand. ...Tibor Kondor gave himself up. He is currently being taken into custody. Hey! Stop! "
Baantjer het begin,https://yts-subs.com/movie-imdb/tt8747308,https://yts-subs.com/subtitles/baantjer-het-begin-2019-english-yify-490004,"﻿…Queen Beatrix reached the deck of the ship with her mother Juliana, and from… …tonight on Vijzelstraat and Leidsestraat, with Leidseplein and Koningsplein on either side. There has been as much damage as was paid for the festivities. …pure vandalism. ""Horrible, awful and an unbelievable shame,"" were the socialist politician's words. He felt these actions were an attempt to cause mayhem. There have also been reactions to unrest elsewhere in the country. NOS management believes the reports on the event have been responsible. We will conclude with the weather until tomorrow evening. - Yeah? - Good afternoon. The owner of this building kindly requests you to vacate the premises. Oh yeah? Where's the owner then? What he does with his house is none of our business. So… Listen, idiot. If the owner wants us to leave, he can come here and tell us himself. No. The rest of the royal family boarded the S.S. Beatrix… 7 DAYS UNTIL THE CORONATION …to watch the fireworks. At the same time fighting and looting took place in Amsterdam's city center as a result of the violent turmoil earlier this afternoon. In backroom talks it was decided… The guy in two is barfing the whole day. I've had it. Somebody take care of him. George, put Shayla in five, and release the Chinaman in four. This fucking mess is driving me crazy, people. A tidy house is a tidy mind. - Talk to me, honey. - Good day. I have an appointment. Jurriaan DeKok. Keep your fucking hands to yourself. - It's K-O-K. - Congratulations. With capital letters? For a tenner you can blow me. - Freek. - Virginia. Virginia, sit down or I'm going to call your mother. He'll also do it for a fiver. Who do you need? Mr Montijn. Tonnie Montijn. The meeting was for half past nine. - With Tonnie? - That's right. Around the corner. - This way? - He's at Lowietje. Nice shoes. The riots in the capital lasted until the evening. We're closed. Hey idiot, you deaf? No, I have an appointment with a Mr Montijn. Tscheu La Ling. I just don't get it. Fucking unbelievable. Boy oh boy. Tscheu La fucking Ling. Why do we need this half ass Chinaman when we got Vanenburg. - Have they lost their minds? - You know what Ajax should do? - Well? - Get Cruijff back. In your dreams. Soccer? - You must be with the police. - Uh, yes. - Lowie. Get Sherlock some coffee. - Oh no, thank you, I'm okay. Did you just come from the gym? I just wanted to say that I'm glad to receive this opportunity. - What opportunity? - To work together. - Work together? - Correct. I got a letter from the commissioner, De Woerd. A response to my application. He said that I am to work with you. Urk. Yes. Born and raised. Do you have cash on you? No. Lesson one: Always have money on you around here. - Well, I'll see you later then. - Sorry? Half past nine, right? Half past nine in the evening, mate. Night shift. You done, honey? - You were terrific. - Bye, darling. - Well, what can I do for you? - I'm just waiting. What for? The tram? The only line that runs around here is line 69. - Hey, early bird. - Tonnie, you owe me a tenner. Get rid of your crotch crickets yet, Rebecca? Screw you, limp dick. Fuck off, asshole. Leave that at home. For your own safety. This week two cops have been sent to the hospital. And if you're with me, everyone will know who you are. Hey Richard, take it easy. I know where to find you. The lingo is different too. Lesson two: A fiver is different than the Five-O. And a buck is different than a fuck. You'll get the hang of it. - Hey, doll. - Hot stuff. - By the way, do you have a house? - Yes, I found a place. Great. That seems to be a problem nowadays. - Whereabouts? - On Zeedijk. Nice. If you want your mail to smell like piss. - Wife? Girlfriend? Kids? - Uh, no. - Boyfriend? - No, nothing. It doesn't matter to me. Everything goes in Amsterdam. I am single. That'll save you a lot of trouble when you get shot in the face. Here we are. Nell? Nellie? Nell? - Nellie? - Hey, cutie. Hey, Tonnie. I'm looking for Ron. You know where he is? Who's Ron? Really? Are you serious? Have it your way. Ron? Ronny? - Fuck off, man. I'm busy. - Hi, Tonnie. - Asshole. - Sorry. Ton, quit it. He's upstairs. Now, was that so difficult? Urk is new, and he's happily single. For another one of these you'll get a half hour with me. What kind of tourist rates are those? How long have we known each other? - Block is my friend. - It's DeKok. Often misspelled as C-O-C-K. Ronny? Ronny? Ron? Ronny? I've had it with this bullshit. How am I supposed to get it up? Urk, give me a hand. Urk? - Don't point your gun at me, man. - Leave me alone, faggot. Talk to me with some respect, you filthy junk. - I've already said, if he calls me… - Shut up, Ron. I'm busy. Not like this. A drug-related crime, Urk. Fished it right out of his pocket. - You planted that there. - Get up. On your knees. Sit down. Keep an eye on David Bowie here, will you. Let's see what he brought along. Look what I found here. That's so generous. Thanks, buddy. Those pills are for my heart. - Maybe I should… - Keep an eye on your suspect, detective. Goddammit. Hell of a first day, DeKok. - Sorry. Sorry. - Go away. Thanks, asshole. You got some speed, DeKok. Lesson three: Never chase trams, junkies or women. There'll always be a next one. Hey, Ron. What? - Let's go. Give me the keys. - What? Come on, Urk, move it. Go, go, go. Let's go. Let precinct Rapenburg pull it out of the canal. - But I already had it called in. - What? Seriously? - So, Tonnie. You pulled out a drunkard? - And a squatter to boot. That's going to be a week of paperwork. - Why didn't you call precinct Rapenburg? - That's what we would've done. - I didn't know you… - It's best if you stay away from me. 6 DAYS UNTIL THE CORONATION Can someone tell me why our sweet Lord and Savior hates my fucking guts? I see you thinking: ""But, Chief, you're a man who has it all. You have a pretty face, you're a natural leader…"" - Humble. - Yes, humble. Thanks, Van Kemenade. So why the long face? Jesse Schippers. Thierry Lejeune. Maxine de Waard. We know who they are. We know where they live. And we know they've got something planned on Coronation Day. It's our job to make sure it doesn't turn into a goddamn disaster. However, I just received a call from our wonderful mayor himself saying we should keep our hands off of them if we don't have any proof. - Ridiculous. - Something about the constitution. - Oh, that old thing. - So we're going to be busy this week. - I have 35 full-timers in the hospital. - Look, the canal cops. And to make matters worse, my star detective decided that it was a good idea to fish a drunk pisser from the canal. Montijn, my office. Glad someone here is still doing the hard work. District South called saying there's a cat in a tree, maybe you can help? Maybe you should go. You haven't had pussy in while. He's allergic. No, he means pussy. Good one. Fingers off of my blinds, Tonnie. Only I can touch my blinds. Got it? Half my squad is in the hospital and you pull a drunkard out of the canal. - We have uniformed officers for that. - Sorry, sir, it's my fault. I thought ""Vigilance while they rest"" was our motto. I didn't know… - Tonnie? - Chief. Who is this? Jurriaan DeKok, sir. We spoke on the phone. It's my first day. Well, you're off to a great start, DeKok. How long is your trial period? We'll stop by the morgue, pull down his fly, take a photo, and we're done. I want a short report. Don't piss away time with the coronation coming up. Yes, Chief. What were you doing there anyway? Don't you have anything better to do? We were making the rounds when Jurre here saw him floating. Right? - Uh, yeah. - You have two days. Understood, Chief. - Sorry. - Sorry for what? Sorry I didn't know we weren't supposed to… If it gets me away from the coronation for two days, I'm happy. I almost forgot. - Your cut from Ron. - Oh no, that's alright. - Sure? Have you seen your pay check? - Yeah, it's fine. Really. Ron would've used this to buy smack, heroin. You'll learn soon enough that it's not all black and white. I'm hungry. Let's go. Or did you have other plans? - Ma? - Hey, Tonnie. We're getting a bite to eat. This is Jurre, my new partner. - Hello, ma'am. Jurre DeKok. - Nice to meet you. Louise Montijn. Nice you finally brought someone along. If it's not a good time… No problem. I'll peel some extra potatoes. - Where's fatty? - At school. My daughter, Pien, goes to university. Jurre's from Urk. They only have an elementary school over there. Nothing wrong with that. I also only went to elementary school. Oh no, I finished college. He fished a corpse out of the canal last night. Christ's sake. I don't want to hear about that before dinner. - Hang up his jacket, will you. - This will be the first and last time. - Ma? - That's Pien. Good to see you, fatty. - Have you been smoking again? - No, my friends. - I have friends, unlike you. - Very funny. This is Jurre. - Hi. - Hi. Jurre DeKok. I see this was a mistake, Ma. We're kicking him out after dinner. - Here you go. - Tonnie. Jacket. - Want me to hang yours up too, fatty? - Yes. Cheers. The tanks were followed by hundreds of police and gendarmerie officers. Some youngsters… Can you please turn that off? We have a guest. Tanks. Unbelievable. It's as if the goddamn krauts are back. - But they are. - I think Claus is a really nice man. And he seems perfect for Beatrix. At the university they don't really like the royal family. We don't like their money, which could be used to solve the housing shortage. You have a house. You live here. - Please. - Yeah, we do. If that scum wants to live somewhere, they should get a job. - What job? There are no jobs. - Jurre has a job. And he also has a house. - This is lovely. Really lovely. - Yes? Great. They're a bunch of filthy freeloaders. They're fucking lazy. - You sound just like Dad. - That's enough! Jurre, would you like some coffee? Oh no, let me help. You see. That's what they learn in Urk. Work. Work. Jurre has a very refreshing appearance. - What? - Nothing. I saw you. Good for you. - In the squat. - The squat? Why would I be in a squat? I have a home. And you? Do you have a home with its own kitchen? Or do you eat with someone else every evening? I'm certain it was you. Maybe in your dreams. Listen, I understand you have sympathy for the squatters and want to help them. Their hard core isn't playing games. Thank you for your concern, officer. I'll take it into consideration. Now you'll probably tell Tonnie everything, right? This one's still dirty. 5 DAYS UNTIL THE CORONATION This guy drank a little more than just canal water. Anyway, forehead wound inflicted by a blunt object. Maybe a pole, or something at the bottom of the canal. - That was the cause of death? - No. He drowned. - Tumbled in while pissing? - Well… Don't say ""well."" Why did you say ""well""? With the amount of alcohol and heroin in his system I doubt he could even stand upright, let alone open his fly. - Maybe he had help. - My first guess, but I'm not sure, is that his unconscious body was dumped into the canal. - So it's murder. - The rookie is eager. Listen, he fell asleep on the ledge and rolled into the canal. - Happens all the time. - Yes, but then there's also this. - You could've just started with this. - Yeah, but I like to keep it exciting. - Rat. Maybe he was an informant. - Not one of mine in any case. Since I like you guys so much, there is also some good news. His pockets were empty, of course, but they forgot to check his boots. Take a look at that. Thank you. Here you go, DeKok. Let's roll. I can't stand the stench here. Later, babe. Bye? ""John Doe drowned in his own state of mind."" How does that sound? - Tonnie? - Yeah? Duivendrecht. Number three is ours. Just great. Christ. Lesson seven: A search warrant is only needed when someone sees you entering. That's not the case now. Can you shine the light over here? Here you go. - Jurre? - Yeah? - Do me a favor. - Sure. The next time you see a body floating in the canal… - I'll just leave him there. - That would be great. 4 DAYS UNTIL THE CORONATION We found a floor plan of the New Church where the coronation will take place. - Maybe it's fake. - It's not. - I don't mean the floor plan, but… - Wait. It's the same floor plan. Upper House, Lower House, the president of France, the crown prince of England. There are maybe a hundred people who've been given a floor plan like this. - A hundred and one, apparently. - Show me that photo again. - You sure you don't know him? - No, Chief. Goddammit. I told them to do the ceremony at Soestdijk or in The Hague, but no, no, no, it has to be here, in our neck of the woods. - What are we going to do? - We have four days. Take a forensic team with you. If there's even one fingerprint pointing towards one of the squatters in charge, I can finally lock them all up. Tonnie. Only the two of you. Gentlemen, knock yourself out. - You got to explain me one thing, DeKok. - What? Why here? Why the Red Light District? I mean, you were the top of your class. You're a good-looking guy. Very righteous. Maybe a bit too much. So why did you ask to work with me? Oh, that. I wanted a challenge. I knew that this station was the most… The biggest piss bucket in the Netherlands. - This is two kilometers of misery. - Something like that. And I… I really want to make a change. Oh God, you're one of those. - You know what's come to my attention? - Well? Since you entered my life, shit just keeps hitting the fan. Just kidding. Goddammit, it's a quarter past ten. - What? - We're drinking. - Drinking? - Yes, we're getting a drink. - He'll take one too. - He still needs to pay for the last one. Don't be a dick. He's with me. Just put it on my tab. - Your tab? - My tab. You better have a good story, pal. We found a floor plan of the New Church with stuff even we know nothing about. Who is this? He's one of ours. Mees from Groningen. Okay? Nice to meet you. Jurre DeKok. It must be linked to the coronation. And we've found a body in the canal. Most likely a squatter. He had the word ""rat"" carved into his abdomen. - And? - I don't know him. So he's not a squatter. And I also don't think he's an undercover cop. Can you ask around if they're missing anyone? - Sounds like a fucking shit show to me. - Pardon me? I'm not asking around. They're all paranoid. If I do, I'll be lying there next to him. I don't ask. I listen. I'm not listening, I'm asking. Come on, Mees. I need info. Okay, listen. There's a meeting tonight at Fort Keizer with the hard core. - Attend that meeting and we're set. - No, I'm bartending. If I change my routines now, it's going to stand out. - I can get someone in, though. - Fine, I'll go. No. Man, even my mother knows who you are. I'll take this shithead. I don't know if this is a good idea. It's best if you just get a drink and stay at the bar. Most of them will drink so much they'll spill their guts anyway. - And if they ask where I'm from? - Then you're the first squatter of Urk. - From Urk. - Like this? - Yes? - Almost there. - Shame on you. - Why did you do that? Now you really look like a squatter. INOCCUPANCY A TRAVESTY You'll be all right. - A beer. - Coming up. What are you looking at? What the fuck are you looking at? I'm… I'm looking for a friend of mine. Tall guy, mohawk, brown eyes. How did you get in here? Through the front door, idiot. How about you? Fucking wankers. Is everyone having a good time? Thank you. Good evening. Also a warm welcome to all the police who are here tonight. Fuck you all. And now some good news. Our radio station, the megaphone for all squatters, has a new DJ. Hot of the press. She has a heart of gold, an iron will, and an acid tongue. The Pien Machine. Hello, everyone. Live from the Fort Keizer. Squatnet Radio, 95.6 FM. Can you hear me? And at home, fellow comrades, who are exploited and eaten away by the man. People all over the world who are done with the scum who spit us and our friends out onto the street: Can you hear me? And how about you, you dirty filthy capitalist? You and all your friends, bankers and politicians who think they're safe from a small innocent girl like me and the fucking bricks I carry with me. Can you hear me? I hope so, for your sake. If not today, then tomorrow or the day after. You shall certainly hear us roar. - No habitation. - No coronation. It has come to my attention that you're in the market for two kilos of uncut coke. - Where's Marcel? - That's right. Where's Marcel? - I don't know a Marcel. - Marcel the Belgian. - We're supposed to do business with him. - Oh, that Marcel. He's unable to attend. Fucking bullshit. Who let this fascist pig in? Maybe your friend should shut it, Jesse. - Shut the fuck up. - Listen, I'm just here to do business. You can't fight the riot police doped up on heroin. You have a war to win. And I happen to have the magic potion to do just that. - Do you want it or not? - No, Jesse. You won't get it from Marcel. Finally, at least someone is using their brains. Do you think I'll stand out carrying all that cash in public like that? Maybe you should fetch me a bag. Do we have a bag? - Oh, hey. - Don't ""hey"" me. Did Tonnie send you? - Pien. What the fuck is this? - Nothing. - Who's that? - This is Jurre, a friend of mine. - How'd you get inside? - I let him in. Do I need permission for that as well? Can you leave us alone? We were in the middle of something. Leave me alone, okay? We don't like your kind around here. - Drugs? - Coke. 3 DAYS UNTIL THE CORONATION And how much coke are we talking about? - Two kilos. - Two kilos? And how did these squatters get all that cash, Jurre? - There's a lot of them. - Look out the window. This is Amsterdam. Everyone's doing heroin. The only coke here are a few packages that come in by truck from Antwerp. Maybe the Belgian police can help us. - They spoke about a Belgian, Marcel. - I think we have better things to do. Jurre, feel free to contact the Belgians, but do it fast. Drugs are the least of our problems. We have a coronation in three days and an unidentified dead informant with serious indications there's going to be an attack. Perhaps we should focus more on that. - Why don't we arrest the squatters? - Drugs are a daily problem in Amsterdam. In three days someone might blow up the New Church. But I saw them with the coke. Three more days. We'll go on your drug hunt after that, okay? Man, oh man. - You missed a spot. - Excuse me? - It's still black. - I must've washed my hair five times. It's crap dye. Once it's fully dried, it'll takes weeks to wash out. - I think it suits him. - He looks like a guinea pig. He's right, though. - Shame I didn't see it immediately. - What? The dye is partially washed away. Wounds on the scalp. The mohawk was made posthumously. - Who's trying to mislead us? - Oh yeah, and who the fuck is this then? Marcel. The Belgian. I'm starting to like the new guy. If he keeps this up, I think he'll end up on your table soon. Can you tell us who this is? And? Is it true? What? That within an hour you can get that photo anywhere in the world. - Within a half an hour even. - No way. - I can't bring it to Antwerp that quickly. - Antwerp. Never been there. Me neither. Hey, Colombo. Hey, honey. - Explain it to me sometime. - Sure. Listen, lesson eight: Don't dip your pen in company ink. It never ends well. Trust me. Say what you like about those squatters, but they can take a beating. Fucking annoying. You're going to put that shirt on expenses. Baks. It's for you guys. Baks speaking. Thanks. Anonymous tip. Baks. Well, fuck me sideways. - I really had to beat it out of them. - Oh, I thought it was an anonymous tip. - No, it was good detective work. - What the hell are you doing? - Just look at all that. Crazy. - Fucking nut jobs. - Hello? - Mertens, Antwerp Police. Jurre DeKok? - Speaking. - I received your fax, but it's just one big blur. - You can't be serious. - I can't make head or tail of it. - Okay, we'll come over in person. - Today? - Yes. - I'll see you. Bye. What a fucking long drive. I hate Belgium, you know that? - You hate everything outside Amsterdam. - Me? Not true. Anything beyond Marnixkade feels like a day trip for me. - What's Pien studying anyway? - Who, my Pien? - Yes. - No idea. Politics or something. Why? No reason. Jurre, Pien's not for you. Understood? I know. Of course. I didn't mean it like that. I was just curious. Be curious about some other girl, but not Pien. We need to find you a chick, that's what it is. - No, I've had enough of women lately. - Really? Then we definitely need to find you a chick. Nice one. Corneel? The Dutchies. - Tonnie Montijn. - Corneel Mertens. - Jurre DeKok. - Ah, yes. Well… Sorry we had to meet here. Probably the handy work of Flanders' biggest criminal, Seppe Brunae. Absolutely ruthless. A total lack of respect or morals. Cocaine. Be warned. It's coming your way, too. Anyway, the reason we're here is this. Maybe imagine him without the mohawk. I don't need to. That is Marcel Pittoors. Married to Seppe Brunae's niece. And where can we find her? Good night. Evening. Good evening. Two jars, please. Two what? Two beers. - They says ""pints"" here. - Pints… Fuck off. I prefer Café Lowietje, right? Thank you kindly. Excuse me. We're looking for Marcel Pittoors. Don't know him. We understood he was a friend of yours. I don't know any Marcel. And we're about to close. That's 40 francs, please. - Sorry? - Can't we finish our… I'm not asking again. Why are we leaving? How do you think it went? Marcel is dead. What? They found his body in a canal, all blue and bloated. - He's lying. - Unfortunately not. He'd been in the water for a week so the rats got to him, too. Right, DeKok? His dick was hanging by a tiny thread. Fortunately you didn't know him. Is this really necessary? - Let's go inside. - Sometimes you have to push a little. He was sent ahead to Amsterdam. Normally he would sell half a kilo a week, but Seppe wanted to find a new buyer. For two kilos. - And then another 50. - 50 kilos? - To whom? - Those squatters. Do you have any names for us? - I'm really sorry. Thanks anyway. - Wait a moment. Who was the previous buyer? Bob. - Bob who? - Bob… I don't know. Oh, Seppe. Good evening. - Good evening. - And who are the pretty ladies? - None of your fucking business. - Ay. I only hope you weren't sent here by Bob Donkers. And what if we were? What if we were? Wow. You're a long way from home, aren't you? Kitty, my guys are thirsty. Let's go. - Who were those guys? - Marcel is dead. - Come again? - Marcel is dead. Who's Bob Donkers? What is it you want to hear? What is it you want to hear, Jurre? That you were right about Marcel and the drugs? Well done, well done. You did a great job, alright? Now we know who the guy is. Our two days are up. Done. Finished. - Then what do you suggest? - I suggest we warn the chief. Okay. Who is Bob Donkers? 2 DAYS UNTIL THE CORONATION Hi, Barrie. Still paying off your debts? Old habits, you know? - I need new shoes. - Sure, for your new boyfriend? No, for your mother. Alright? Barrie, don't be a dick. Let the boys in. Heavy security. For a shoe store. Hello. He needs to live up to his name, Barrie Kade. - Take a seat, madam. - Thank you. I don't know you. I'm Bob Donkers, nice to meet you. Jurre DeKok. Support soles for the friendly neighborhood cop? Funny. - What do you think, Mrs Van Dijk? - I think they're quite handsome. I couldn't agree more. Put your foot up here. Lift it up a little bit. Well… Go ahead. We're here to ask some questions about Marcel Pittoors. Did you hear that Fat Nelis died? The guy with no teeth? That's rough. He was a moonlighter on Kinkerstraat. Toothless Fat Nelis. - Ton and I grew up together. - Do you have to tell this story? It's a good story. I used to fuck around with my mates on Kinkerstraat. Nasty little fuckers, we were. Not Ton, though. Ton's dad used to smack him about and he wanted to join the police. Right, Ton? But anyway, Fat Nelis approaches us and he says to us: ""What?"" He had no teeth, so I couldn't understand him. He says: ""I'll pay you 12 grand if you kill my wife."" But what does this fucking idiot do? He gives us the money up front. All of it. In one go. Now, you guess what we did next. - You kept the money. - No, of course not! What kind of cop are you? We called the police. Who is Marcel Pittoors? We found him dead in a canal last week. He was on his way here to deliver two kilos of coke. Put your foot on here, madam. Okay, well… Ask your question. We want to know if the Belgians tried to cut you out. It's Jurre, right? Yes. I'm sorry, Jurre, I have absolutely no idea what you're talking about. I'm an orthopedist. I own a few buildings. Which is tough nowadays because you guys can't control the squatters. But, hey, who am I to tell you how to do your job? I'm sure you have the situation under control. Right, Ton? - Absolutely, Bob. - Yeah. The other foot please, Mrs Van Dijk. That's right, very good. Come on. Let's go. - What happened to the woman? - Fat Nelis' old lady? Yes. They found her in the bathtub, cut to pieces. Let's go, we're done here. Could you stand up for a moment? Yes, I'm not quite sure. - Sorry, guys. Hey, Barrie. - Hey, sport. Hey, where were you? You can't keep the chief waiting like that. Calm down, darling. Look, unbelievable. Boys, come in. Sit down. So, Tonnie. The squatter in the canal. Any progress? Unfortunately not, Chief. We don't know jack about the New Church, either. - We hit a dead end in Belgium, too. - Excuse me, Chief. I think we found some major leads in Belgium. Plus, we just spoke to Bob Donkers. And I strongly feel we're being misled. - I would… - Sure, but I need to prioritize things. Is Belgium a threat to the coronation? No. Belgium is all about drugs. That Semtex that was found in the squat clearly indicates that there are plans to blow up our royal family. I spoke to the mayor. He's very sensitive about Amsterdam's reputation as a tolerant city. Where everyone has a right to demonstrate. But if you think the coronation is in danger, then we can talk about additional, temporary… measures. - Do we have a problem, Jurre? - What are you doing? Me? Listen, I know it's all new and exciting in the big city for you, but the coronation is in two days. Do you have any idea what's going down? - No. - That's what I mean. It's not our job. This shit is above us. Above our pay grades. - ""Vigilance while they rest."" - Let it go, will you? - Are you even paying attention? - What do you mean? Let's get one thing straight. If all hell breaks loose with those squatters, I rely on you to have my back. Children, can I have your attention? The mayor has given us a green light to handle things a little differently. It's time to tighten the thumb screws. So if one out of every four squatters accidentally walks into a baton, you won't hear any complaints from me. We will surely get in trouble for that, but that will be after the coronation. The plan is to raid all the smaller squats simultaneously today. And early tomorrow morning we will storm the squatters' HQ, culminating in a raid on Fort Keizer. Thank you. Montijn speaking. It's Jurre. Oh, hi, Jurre. How nice. But Tonnie's not in. I'm not calling for Tonnie, I'm calling for Pien. - Pien? - Yes. She's at the university. No wait, she said she was going to sleep over somewhere. - What's wrong? - No, it's nothing. Bye. Oh, okay. Bye. - Pien. Where's Pien? - Over there. Hold this. - I need bandages! - Pien. - What the fuck are you doing here? - I've come to warn you. - They'll kill you if they see you. - You have to get out. Pien. Go home. - What happened? - The police are going nuts. Thierry! He's not responding. - Fuck! - He's bleeding too heavily. Move aside! - He's losing too much blood. - Has anyone got any coins? He's not responding. Thierry! - Coins. - Jesse. - Coins. - Yes, here. Hold his chin up. At right-angles. - Thierry! - Mouth-to-mouth. Pinch his nose. Okay, out of the way, move! Do it again. I can't feel a thing. No pulse, nothing. Call an ambulance! Move! Get off him. Breathe. Keep his mouth open. Head straight. Amsterdam is preparing for Queen Beatrix's inauguration ceremony. The first guests arrived yesterday. Today, the royal guests will arrive. Prince Charles, the British crown prince and most important guest arrived… Jesse? - Is Thierry okay? - Thierry is alive. - And you? - Me too. - What the fuck is that pig doing here? - He saved Thierry's life. - I don't give a shit. Fuck off, you pig. - Calm down. Knock it off. Right now there are riots between protesters and the police. - You need to get out of here. - No, I'm not leaving. It'll only get worse. Tomorrow, there will be 1,000 riot police on the doorstep. And what about these people and the children? - I don't know. - Where will they all live? I don't know. Somewhere where there are homes. Outside the city? Tucked away in the Bijlmer somewhere? - Is the city only for the rich? - No. Well… No. If all these people decided to move to Urk tomorrow, and the rent goes up by 500 per cent, overnight, - will you all leave? - I understand it's hard. But I just don't believe violence is the solution. Tell your boss that. You were saying something about 1,000 riot police. The police are only trying to keep it livable. - Livable? Don't you have eyes? - Don't you? Why are you being so difficult? I'm just trying to help. I know. Honestly, Jurre. Thank you. Is there anyone more noble in this world than you? - Is that how you want to play it? - Yes, or else? You're off again? Fine. I'll see you and your 1,000 friends tomorrow. Where did you learn that? What? How to do CPR. At sea. And now the Red Light District? I wanted to work somewhere where I could really help people. Oh, Lord. You're one of those. - Your brother said exactly the same. - Tonnie is a relic. He still thinks this is the sixties and they're all petty criminals. If my mother hadn't made him go to school, he'd have ended up just like his friends. What friends? People like Buffoon, Shoeshine Bob, Steel Jan. Bob Donkers? Were they friends? Yes, very close. They still are. Please make sure you're out of here on time tomorrow. Fine, Jurre. AMSTERDAM, 29 APRIL 1980 ONE DAY UNTIL THE CORONATION Alright, the plan is clear. The batons go in first, then you. We arrest all of them, but we want those three in particular. This is the police. Please come outside or we will resort to action. No, no, no. Pien? Hello? No. Stop. Stop. Let me through. Let him through, leave him alone. They've all left, there is nobody there. They have all jumped ship. - What? - Somebody ratted. There's no one inside. Oh, my God. - How the fuck did they know? - They left last night. I don't know. - Where were you? - Nice timing, Jurre. - We waited for you. - Is there something I should know? Shut the fuck up, all of you. - Repeat. Over. - Back-up needed on Rapenburg. To Rapenburg. Move it. Oh, fuck off. How did you get that blood on your shirt? Bob is quite something. I didn't know you were such good friends. Don't get in the way out there or you might get hit with a nightstick. Stand your ground. Don't break formation. Molotov. Stay close together. Maintain formation. Keep walking. There's still someone in the van. - We have to. - Let's go. Move it! There's somebody in here. - Open it, goddammit. - It's jammed. The side door. Here, man. You okay? You okay? We have to get out. We have to get out. Can you hear me? - Help me. - Again. Hold it open. Pien. I saw Pien. I saw my sister. Quick, get out of here. Hold this. Pien! Wait. Come here. This way. Fucking traitor. Pien! No! No, stay with me. Ambulance! Ambulance! That's enough, sit down. Go and argue somewhere else. Sit down. - Listen to me. - Jurre, please. Tonnie. - I have to… - This is about my sister. - Can you hold on to this for me? - Sure. Well, look who's here. Every hand you lay on me means a day less in jail for me. - What was she doing there? - Who are you talking about? - You know exactly who I mean. - Oh, Pien? Our warrior in fishnet tights. - She couldn't stay away. - A dirty whore is who you are. How is she? - He's going to beat her to death. - I hope he does. Take it easy, cowboy. Do you always treat the ladies like this? Does it give you a boner? I'm sorry we had to hurt her a bit. What did you say? Oh, man. You wouldn't accept it if one… if one of my men was fucking your wife. That kind of behavior gets in the way of the cause. No matter how well she conveyed her idealism, she was fucking the enemy. And that makes her a dirty kraut whore. I was actually impressed… by your tolerance. - What's that? - That you let him have his way with her. - With your little sister. - Sorry? We could evacuate the Keizer squat on time and leave you a beautiful surprise behind because he had to follow his dick and stick it into your sister. - What did you say? - Then again, with a name like that. A name like that says it all, really. Man, what is his name again? What's his name again? - Goddam… - DeKok. - Tonnie… - Fuck off. Thank you, Baks. Chief. I wanted to warn Pien, that's all. And she immediately told her friends. - I don't believe that. - What you believe doesn't matter, DeKok. Six of my men are hospitalized thanks to your actions. You've only been here a week. I doubt you'll last another. Chief, Tonnie and Bob Donkers are childhood friends. I'm convinced that Bob Donkers had a Flemish drug dealer killed and dumped as a squatter in a canal. And the evidence for this is what? There is no evidence. - We found something in the Vondel Church. - What? - Three empty sniper rifle cases. - Look, DeKok, hard evidence. You're lucky I need everyone I can get. You'll be providing security tomorrow at the coronation. Every police officer will be within a 200-meter radius to protect our new queen. And if Bob Donkers or whoever wants to sell a kilo of coke tomorrow, we will deal with it the day after tomorrow. Is that clear, DeKok? Unacceptable. Mayor Polak said that a major police intervention at the squat can be avoided if the squatters are prepared to negotiate. But the chances of that are small. HOSPITAL AMSTERDAM, 30 APRIL 1980 CORONATION DAY NO HABITATION NO CORONATION Practically all the prominent guests are staying in the Amstel Hotel, which is heavily guarded. All these measures are in place to ensure a smooth coronation on the Dam. Before the visitors enter the church, they'll pass through metal detectors provided by Schiphol Airport. Let's go to our reporter Hugo van Rijn for an update on the current situation. Fences have been placed and the police are stopping all traffic. Only cyclists and public transport… Okay, today is the big day. Thanks to Mr Hans Wiegel, I have about 6,000 policemen at my disposal, and probably the same number of squatters, demonstrators and opportunists who want to have their own party. The threat to security remains serious. It didn't have to come to this. We don't want power. We don't want money. We don't want to be on TV. Waiting in the Moses Hall are the chairmen of the Upper and Lower House, the representatives of the Dutch Antilles, the cabinet, the vice-president of the Council of State, the queen's commissioner and the Amsterdam mayor. The princess… Today, everyone's eyes are focused on Dam Square and on nothing else. No fuck-ups, no hesitating. If you have to, you hit first and then ask questions. But I don't want to see any firearms today. I'm not going down in history as the chief of police who had a massacre on his hands. Accommodation, safety, honesty. And yes, we're prepared to die for it. The outer ring is shut off to squatters, demonstrators or any other scumbags. - No habitation. - No coronation. I only want to see people celebrating, today. Okay, let's get to work. - Post 1 to Post 11. How are you? - Post 11, everything under control. - Good. Stand by. - Stand by. At the moment, the situation is fairly calm. The number of wounded policemen is six. Of the squatters it's unknown. Jurre to Command, all quiet. 31 to Command, we've got trainloads of demonstrators are heading your way. God, Jesus. What a fucking awful day. - Shouldn't we draw the bridges? - Good advice, not doing it. A building is being squatted on Kinkerstraat right now. Unit A, move from Nieuwmarkt to Kinkerstraat. Switch to Kinkerstraat. Okay, guys. Everyone keep their eyes peeled. Look to the left. Top window. Activity. Can we see what's happening? What do you see? I have no idea. I've got my eyes on them. It's a banner, a banner. They're letting down a banner. Can somebody please get those rats out of there? By eleven o'clock, Dam Square is full of people waiting for the abdicated and the new queen to appear on the palace balcony. I introduce to you Beatrix, your new queen. Yes, they're inside. It's all under control. …as Princess Juliana. All together we head into the future. We're all set, Bob. I strive for nothing else but to be at your disposal and that of the people, and to serve the nation. - I'll be right back. - Long live the Netherlands. - Wait. Command? - Yes, come in. Should Tonnie… - Hello, Command? - I can't hear you, Jurre. Guys, this isn't happening, is it? Hello, can somebody answer me? Hello? Okay, I'm… Jesus fucking Christ. Come on, get on with it. …where you first appeared as Queen Juliana, I now wish you many more years of happiness and satisfaction… - Jurre for Command. - …as Princess Juliana. Command, Command. Long live the Netherlands. Hey, bike for sale. - Did it all work out? - I'm here, aren't I? Bob, I'm not going in, I've done my bit. You have uniforms and a get-away car. Your bit? Your bit is done once we've paid the Belgians. Or did you think we'd be doing the dirty work? We're in this shit because your goons can't control themselves. Okay? And you were there, weren't you? Or did I dream all that? Emergency, ma'am. Call your boss and gather everyone outside. The police has declared a state of emergency. - Can I help you? - An emergency due to the squatter riots. - Everybody must leave the building. - Linda, gather the staff. Stand over here. - The alarm is switched off. - That's great. We want to take a look in your safe. Command? Guys, I… Why don't I hear anything? We don't have access to the safe. - Has anyone done a first-aid course? - Me. - Fuck, goddammit. - Can somebody open the safe now? Jurre to Command. - What the fuck are you doing? - Ma'am, this way. I'll go with you, come on. - You fucking psychopath. - You're on the lookout, half-ass crook. Wait here, stand still. Line up here and stand still. Open it. Perfect, next. Well done. Give me the keys. Don't move! Breathe in and out. You'll be fine. You can call an ambulance once we're gone. - Jurre. - Where are they? - I'm glad you're here. - Where are they? - Call an ambulance. - Move away. - This is not what it seems. - I'm not stupid. - I told you it's not all black and white. - Move away. What a first week you're having. - Come on! - Move, pigs. Move it, faster! Get in there! - This is bigger than you think. - With you and Bob, yes. I'm undercover. I'm undercover. Help me, please. - Bob is emptying out the safe. - How's that? Honestly, Jurre. Grab his arm. He passed out. Take him outside. - Hold his arm. - Yes, we must tie it off. His belt. Sorry, buddy. Come on. - What's all this? - Some loser trying to be a hero. - Well, finish him. - No. Goddammit. Get the fuck out of here. AMSTERDAM, 1 MAY 1980 8 HOURS AFTER THE CORONATION There he is. Well… I have 80 officers in hospital. The riots are ongoing, but the coronation went smoothly. I suppose the leaders of the free world are probably having their dessert. - What are these for? - That was quite impressive. Right under our noses, very smart. And we were very dumb. I'd appreciate it if you were to tell me exactly what happened. We were on the lookout when Tonnie suddenly left. I followed him and he went into a bank with some other guys. I tried to stop him, but he knocked me out. Yes, well, Tonnie told me a very different story. Didn't you, Tonnie? He knows exactly what happened. Don't you? Do you know where the money is? Tonnie just told me that you were the one who suddenly took off to play bank robbers with your mates. Who are your mates? Bob Donkers is one of them, isn't he? - So Tonnie killed the bank manager then? - Killed? No, when I passed out, nobody was dead. He's in a coma, a severed artery. A breath away from dying. And the fact that you betrayed us to the squatters doesn't help you much either. But until I've figured it out, you'll be guarded. Who the hell are you really, Jurre from Urk? Chief? Tonnie. What is it? Sorry. Taxi. Jordaan. - Here you go. - Thank you. Make it 22. Hang on, wait a second. I think we're going for another drive. Yes, stop here. Stop. Seppe, it's good to see you. Ton. It's probably too much. Well, how about you guys? - What about us? - The coke. - There is no coke. - Well, give it back then. We've decided not to do business with you anymore. Take it easy, everybody. Let's calm down. What? Is this about Marcel? Marcel was a junkie and hence a risk to send on errands. First of all, I decide who runs my errands. Secondly, Marcel may have been a junkie, but he was my friend, and family. And that, Bob, brings us to our third point. You don't touch my family. How was I supposed to know he was family? Listen, we must be able to solve this as gentlemen. If we have to raise the price, that's not a problem for me. See? We just need to talk to each other, Seppe. All the squatters are locked up so if you can't do business with me, with who can you? What's the world coming to if even we don't have a moral code… I'm sorry, but it was such a boring conversation. It's a bit impolite, but we'd still be here in the morning. Right, Barrie? And you don't mess with family. I totally agree with that. Five kilos a week for starters? Fine. And Barrie here is all right. But I'm not too sure about this retard. I thought you were a cop. - I am. - Yes, he is. And coincidentally, he's also the last person to see Marcel alive. It was his idea to dump Marcel in the canal dressed up as a squatter. Wasn't it? Fucking asshole. Say hello to Marcel. Man, oh man. Goddammit. It's all fucked up. Jurre? It was all for nothing. Hey, buddy. You used me in everything. You knew all along who Marcel was. You were on top of everything. It should never have come to this. That business with the squatters and the attack was all part of Bob's smoke screen. - How long have you been working for Bob? - I don't work for or with Bob. For how long? I work undercover to roll up this entire fucking operation. Yeah, we all know that story, just like in the bank. Keep that hand away from there. Call an ambulance, I'm losing blood. A lot of it. - Are you giving up on me? - I saw the whole thing. I'm not like you. That's why I love you, buddy. You're not like the rest of them. You're real. I can just picture it. Pien and you. Don't fucking sweet talk me. You're a beautiful person, Jurre DeKok. And hey, lesson number 13. - Stop. - Lesson 13: Unfortunately in our world, who you hang out with… is who you get contaminated by. I'm sorry. No, no. - Jurre? - No, no. No. No, Tonnie. They're on their way, they're on their way. What a mess. That bank manager of yours, he has come to. So… Well done. He said… He said that he was working undercover. That all the top brass knew about it. That's not true, is it? No. Your firearm. Your firearm. I want a brief police report and a statement. Nothing complicated, okay? I'll see you Monday morning. Okay. To Tonnie. To Tonnie. He fucking succeeded, after all. - What? - In the saddle. I always used to say: They'll have to push you into a grave when you're 120. The fucking bastards. Don't get me wrong, Tonnie had his share of mistakes. If you steal a rich man's watch, that's one thing. But you just don't shoot people. I'll put it on a tab. Always have money on you. Lesson number one. "

A gentle soul, who prefers a warm glass of milk over coffee. Always practicing fencing between classes. Makes his cruddy fencing uniform look like Dior Homme. A hybrid of intelligence and physical prowess. He's good-looking. He's single but he's very popular. Mr. Perfect has one thing missing. Me, Park Joohee? - My 28th crush- - I can hear everything. You scared me! Hey, Angry Joo. Are you a ""Satorare?"" What's that? It's when your inner thoughts are heard by others - regardless of- - Woo! Lee Chanho! Lee Chanho! What's the big deal? That's none of your business. I don't take questions from those without an ounce of friendship in their body. Number 28. More like number never. - Is it him this time? - Not another word from you. It's not like you've helped at all. Don't make a scene like last time, and just sit still. You call that a ""scene?"" As your fellow classmate, who endured that wild rollercoaster you called ""crush,"" I'm feeling underappreciated. Listen, Angry Joo. Number 16 was a total fuckboy. - Men know men best- - Stop! You're not my dad! Heads! Park Joohee, watch out! - Oh, no. - Are you okay? - Is she hurt? - That must have hurt. Joohee? Are you okay? Why aren't you answering? Hey, Joohee! Are you okay? You should see a doctor. I'll give you a ride. I'm glad it wasn't worse. Where is this coming from? Is this fine dust? Who did that? Who blew away my protein powder? Come out. Is it you? Come forward right now! I'm going to do jump rope with your spinal cords! - What's his deal? - Don't look. Let's just go. It's him. You son of a bitch! Yes, that's it. Let's go, let's go. What the hell! I was engaged in a life or death situation on this minefield. Until a loser with a land mine for a face came along. But this land mine looks very serious. Did someone step on you? You're not yourself. - What? The school server? - Who am I really? It's time for revenge. Revenge. You look like someone that has been cheated on. That's why you shouldn't touch other people's belongings. I found the bastard! What shall I do with him now? I've seen him somewhere. What's up with his calm demeanor? What's with that devil-may-care attitude? That son of a... I'm going to find you. When I do find you, I'll break you. Some things are meant to be. A symbolic line like that at a time like this suggests that, in most cases, there is a high probability that our story revolves around this gentleman here. Hex. He is the protagonist. [OZ Couple Zone] One, two, three, four, five. Okay. That's the face of someone arriving 15 minutes late to this sacred establishment, then sneaking out of the kitchen to pretend that he wasn't late at all. Upon seeing me, he then blabs, ""Sir, I didn't see you when I arrived."" With a sly wave to boot. I was late. I'm very sorry. - What happened? - Nothing happened at all. Wow, you've got some nerve. The courage to adamantly tell your boss you were late without a reason. I would seriously pay good money for that. You are going places. Thank you, sir. Jaemin, couldn't you just make something up? You have exams coming up. That's a great excuse. Just say you were late because you were at the library. I'm your boss, I'm the owner of this fine internet cafe. - Do you have to be that honest? - I'm a little embarrassed but I have a full four-year Computer Science scholarship. I'm fine as long as I don't get an F. Studying? I don't need it. Are you really embarassed? Here we go. The hacker's motto. Every password can be cracked and every gate can be unlocked. Our world of information and profits is like a 24/7 festival you are always plugged into. [stack based buffer overflow] [Stack buffer overflow] Low security means it's a hacker's playground. Places with high security become a battleground for fame. You don't need a strong castle wall to defend their attacks. What you need is a sharp spear that's ready to attack at any time. In other words, advanced hacking skills. The survival of the fittest. So, if you've stored valuables behind poor cybersecurity, that's all the invitation I need. [Corporate hacking] [""Cyber Robing Hood""?...Hacking a company [Is bad boy hacker ""HEX"" a war criminal or righteous?] - I'd like to pay. - Yes.

[HEX>Who are you?] [HEX>Do you know YOUKNOWWHAT?] [BW> What's the difference you between you and YOUKNOWWHAT?] [HEX>Who are you?] [HEX>Do you know YOUKNOWWHAT?] The king is here. Found it. Found what? What did you find? Were you looking for these? Huh? A can of beer is just what you need at this time of the day. I brought some to cheer up at your boring, lonely part-time job. You are exploding with gratitude, right? Who else but me? This isn't like you. Hey, your friend just bought you some beer and that's your reaction? Can you pick up some food? Something like fried chicken! - It's tasty. - Hey, Angry Joo. By the way, - why did you come all- - There was hardly anyone at your work. It's going to go under soon. It's because it's the exam period. You have exams too. What is it? This is definitely destiny. Like a match made in heaven! I don't know what you are saying. What is your destiny? It's Chanho. Chanho is your destiny. When did you start believing in destiny? It just... came right at me. - So destiny just came right up to you. - Hey, I'm serious. There's something different about this time. My heart is in knots. All right then. Another line for your crush notebook. Oh, the notebook? I lost it. I dropped it somewhere. I don't need it anymore! No more crushes for me. No more crushes? I'm going to ask him out. What? I'm going to ask him out. It's finally time for me to be brave. Or else, it will be one crush after another. You don't have to be that brave. Chanho might like shy girls- - Anyway! - I'm counting on you. - For what? We've been friends for four years. So, who else but you? This is my ""phone a friend"" chance. Look... We went to high school with Chanho. He had no feelings for you then, so why would he now? I'm only saying this for your sake. In case he says no. Help me out? What are good friends for? When will I ever ask you for a favor like this if not now? Just once. Come on. Just this once! [28 - Lee JanHo] My heart just sank to my stomach. Is it because of you? Or... is it this brave face that I'm putting on? This is an impressive resume. Woosung Bio, Mega Corp, Bando Group. Daegun Logistics' ransomware was also his? This is interesting. They are all under investigation for corruption and hiring irregularities. The fact that he only exposed their servers and left, tells me that he wasn't out to extract personal info. He's either a psychopath crying out for attention, or he's looking for someone in our field. It's one or the other. [HEX] - Hey, Jaemin. - Yeah? Do you think... I'm... a little lame? Why? Chanho is a bit out of my league, right? Hey! Why are you talking down to yourself so seriously like that? That guy... Chanho... was a bit popular when we were in high school. No, he was super popular! He could have been a K-pop idol with a face like that. He was academically great too. Wasn't I also cool when we were younger? You are sobering me up. Was that a serious question? Woah, you don't have to burn me like that. You were different from Chanho. You were the kind of type that attracted party girls. You had this mint chocolate vibe. Only liked by a certain group. Definitely controversial. Tasted like toothpaste or chocolate. Neither one nor the other. They were good kids. You only judge a book by its cover. Also, toothpaste? If I was toothpaste, was Chanho mouthwash? No, no, no. He was a classic, luxurious chocolate. From Belgium, like Godiva? Everyone loved Chanho. He was smart, kind, honest. All the teachers really liked him, too. I got along with some teachers, too. Oh, yeah! Remember that teacher that was only good to Chanho? What's next period? Hey, hey! This isn't a flea market! Hey, you are running down the corridor! Join the track team if you want to run! Punks. Chanho, could you get the mock exam results from my office? You came first again. Don't study too hard. Spare some hope for the others. Yes, sir. Anyway, that kid. Always looks like he's goofing off but his test scores are always good. He was second again. Just below you. Your homeroom teacher must be happy to have both of you. I'm just lucky. He's a rare breed. You didn't have to walk me home. Chivalry is it? Hey. I think you two look alike. With who? - Mr. Park. - You asshole! I look like my mom! What are you doing? You don't. You look exactly like the dean. The long-faced version. Ugh, Mr. Park. - You're asking for it! - Hey! Lately? Nothing. My dad. The dean? You know my situation. There's no need to send a car. I'll be fine on my own. So, there is no real pressure, right? Okay. I'll see you then. She better be home soon. He's still his usual self. Yeah. Why is it so stuffy out here? It's hot out, right? Yeah. Then, shall we go? [hacker BW] What the hell is this? I didn't want to go down this road but... When a citizen is in trouble, you call on your government to help. I believe in you, Cyber Bureau. Damn it. [New Message Arrived] What is this? [To. Hex, We welcome you to Better World. Press ""Yes"" to accept.] I didn't even have to ask for an invitation. [Come to Hwarang Hall B1, Room 4] [Deletes in 3 seconds.] What's that? What is it? What's up with you? You really snuck up on me. Are you a ninja? Is it a movie? What movie? Weren't you watching a spy movie? Right! The background music. Chanho, Hwarang Hall is where all our school clubs are gathered. Right? I think so. But most of them moved into the new hall recently. I see. I'm not sure which clubs are still there. That's where the old medical school anatomy room used to be. It's spooky down there. People said there are ghosts down there. This is nuts. Who cares if they fucking come out. Ghosts aren't real. There was a moth in my dress! What? Spill it. I have class soon. No ghost is going to touch us like this! I'm definitely less scared now. This isn't so bad. Totally less scared. Kyungshik, when have I ever made a bad deal? Then my name isn't Nam Hyungsoo. A shrewd investor! The contrarian strategist! The emperor of risk! I know. I'm just slightly worried about that contrarian investing. You're the most successful person from our high school friends. I know that. Yeah, yeah. Just come and listen, okay? It will turn your head. I don't have the money to invest right now. Are you doubting me? Don't you remember that I gave you the most money at your wedding? That was ages ago. Come on now. How long are you going to live like that? Come on, Kyungshik! You have to try living it up for once. If you don't want Joohee on your back down the road, you have to start preparing now. She's in art school. There are tuition and living costs. Soon, she will ask you for a year abroad. After graduation, when she's job hunting, you think she's getting married on her own? Fat chance if you don't have the money these days. You even threw your pension away on that fried chicken shop. All right! I'll hear what they have to say. Just stay for one coffee! It will change your life. You were a teacher for 30 years, now is the time to plan for the rest of your life as your own boss!

You're the TA, can I ask you something? Of course. Is Hwarang Hall down on the basement floor? Well, there was the anatomy room. Ah right. Was there a school club down there? Was the name of the club, Better... [To. Hex, We welcome you to Better World. Press ""Yes"" to accept.] What's that? World? Was that the name? Better World... Better World! - Isn't that a retro game club? - A game club? Everyone avoids going there because it's scary. Anyhow, I'm not too sure. Anything else you want to... Do you have any que- Nope. What are you doing? Open it. You sure? Of course, I am. Just leave it then? No, it's just... Can't you open it? Come on! Hurry up and open it! You don't have to yell. I was about to open it. I'm totally ready. I would have opened it if you didn't yell. Bond. James Bond. That was quite the entrance. What are you going to do about my protein powder, huh? Welcome. Through hacking, we strive to create a better world. We are a white hacker group and that is Better World's mission. We're not only based in South Korea, think of us as a global club alliance.

Why you and what are you? I am- Stop! No, that's not what he's asking. We aren't interested in you at all. It's your friend. You've got the wrong idea. He's not that kind of person. He's nothing, really. What? What do you mean I'm nothing? We need you. Your skills to be precise. The very skill that made you reach the top ten at Def Con as a junior. The Korean team won thanks to your skills, right? What is this? A detective agency? You've got the wrong guy. Join Better World. You're going to need us too. It's a win-win. Do we have to do it like this? I don't like the way it looks. Well, I don't either. Thanks for the fun meeting. Hey, you think we spent our precious time on you because we liked your lousy resume? Your little pet projects? They are nothing. I wouldn't have even bothered if Oh didn't- Shut your mouth. Then tell this ""Oh,"" that my lousy resume isn't good enough to join this club.

No, I don't know where he is. Don't take it out on the kid. Where is your dad? Where is this son of a bitch? Huh? You're Jaemin, right? Park Jaemin. Where is your dad? Is he at the factory? The Ansan factory? They found Park Junhyeong at the Han River. The fire department just confirmed the body. This is horrible. What shall we do? - What are supposed to do? - How are we supposed to live? Are you okay? Yeah. Of course, I am! It just brought back old memories. You said you were late for class. Go ahead. Oh, my class. That's right. Since I'm already late, shall we have a drink? Hey, Angry Joo. I'm really okay. It's an F if you miss another class. Do you want a suspension? I have to go to work soon anyway. I'm really fine. So, hurry to class. I'll call you after class. Okay? Who the hell do you think you are? My past is none of your damn business! Don't mess with me unless you have a death wish. Death wish? The shit you are doing right now, is the same thing those financial hackers did to your dad's company. Hackers aren't crackers, you asshole. It's assholes like you that make people treat hackers like criminals. There are people that have lost their entire lives because of crackers. You're not the only one in the world. You know that better than anyone. Is it really okay? With assholes like that around? Will you dangerously sway on the tightrope in the dark? Or will you come out to the sun? You decide. It would be nice if you joined our side but... it's ultimately your choice. When you're not sure what to do, take action. Take the road less traveled. Trust your instinct to give. And when you're not sure about that last slice of pizza, be brave, and eat it. That's how you're meant to live life. Be stress-free. For a better life. Live minimally. That's all I'm saying. Everyone and their dog wants to better everything. Dog? I'm your boss, you punk. Want a bite? You eat it. So rude. The answer you seek is yes, just do it. I already told you. When you're not sure what to do, take action. You don't even know my dilemma. I knew it right away. Do I go on that blind date or not? That's not it. Really? That's the biggest dilemma in my life. I have a blind date. The girl... Wait, she is older than me. She had been married before. How old are you again? Twenty. Twenty... In that case, Just do it. Do everything you can do. Then, worry about it later. For now, just do it. You can afford to. Why? Because you're twenty. Damn, that was so cool! An explosion of awesomeness! Hello? Oh hey! Hey, Sis. Whoops, I mean Hyeseon. Yeah? My house is minute? How is it minute? Ah, you mean is the house mine? No, I don't own the house. It's a half. So it's kind of half mine? Half mine? Not at all! Hey, Joohee. Huh? What's... Huh? What? Well, when I got home, my dad was intensely reading something. What was he reading so intensely? You know that feeling you get when there is something suspicious in the air. Okay, so what was so suspicious about it? You know I have a sixth sense for this stuff.

The losers on their way here today have no clue what's going on. They'll just wag their tails and applaud at the end. They will probably hand over their entire pension. Fucking idiots. I heard the VP graduated from Harvard. Is it true? - He didn't graduate from Harvard. - He didn't? He's merely a thief stealing from the deaf, dumb and blind. He's a real piece of shit! That's why he's a parasite. This is a misunderstanding, let me explain! Just listen! Let me explain! This is very important to our customers. We should emphasize this part. Everyone is talking about how well Bitcoin is doing. Let's talk about our margins. Phew, fucking hell. Listen. I can explain! No! That's not it! Where are you going? Stop right there! What the fuck?

Can I go out with Joohee? Why are you asking me for? Because you and Joohee are best friends. Best friends? Are we? She's not some object needing approval, whether you two should date, that decision, is between you two. I thought you were interested in her. Guess not, huh? That's a relief. Yeah. I'm...

Do you happen to know - anything about blockchain? - Ah, you want to talk about crypto. - Wow, exactly! - I do know a thing or two about that. What about cryptocurrencies are you... Azilowon? What? How much? 3,000? Damn it, Mr. Park! Just, why? Don't you get it? We are totally known now. We're finally on the radar of those attention-seeking hackers. - We're not saying you're wrong. - Then why stop? After all this way. - What did you recruit me for? - We're a team. A group. You're the only one mad about it. We're not talking about closing down Better World. There isn't a shadow of a doubt about your skills For our last job, you definitely pulled more than half the weight. But, Jaemin, why do we hack? Look at all of our achievements, aren't they amazing? With our inconceivably superior hacking skills, we'll solve any cybersecurity problems, including those the government can't. We are Better World! Do you want to go and tell everyone in town? - Is that why we exist? - We have to be more famous and be known! That's how we get them to the surface. If we want to strike, - we have to be more famous than them. - Is one of those people, YOUKNOWWHAT? Let's all calm down, okay? Jaemin, we promised to help you avenge your dad. So, let's take a short break and recharge. This kind of exposure is not ideal for us in the long run. All right, fine. Let's assume we managed to draw out YOUKNOWWHAT to the surface. They laid low for one year after your dad's company. It was a year and a half after Taegun Finance. That asshole ran circles around all those security experts, evading their efforts. Yeah, he's really going to fall right into our unprepared hands. No, no. Let's say he did. We got lucky and got into his backdoor, and tore up all of his timestamps and checksum values. There is no way the three of us are getting out of there alive but let's say we did! Anyway, despite all these hurdles, your revenge plan succeeds. You think we are going to ""live happily ever after?"" Our real names will be all over the internet. And the Cyber Bureau isn't going to sit idly like they are doing now. I chased him for three years but I couldn't find anything about him. That fucker has finally started moving after being dormant for three years. I was crying and begging for them to catch that fucker and they just stood there with their hands in their pockets. They are worse than that fucker and I have to be scared of what they'll do? We're saying we need a better plan. Disrespectful punk. It's not a gym! Grow your muscles somewhere else! Dumbass. - Are you with Jaemin? - What? No. - What's up? - Call me if you two get in touch. Why? Is there a problem? - It's not my problem if he goes crazy - Would you shut up? Hyesoo? Hyesoo? Are you okay? Jaemin is not answering... What? Why him all of a sudden? He's not a kid and he'll call you once he knows you are looking for him. Don't worry too much. I guess you are right... You are right. He's not a kid. I'm a little disappointed that you mentioned Jaemin as soon as met. No, I'm really sorry. I just had a strange call. I knew this would happen. He's going to explode. Explode? - Is Jaemin angry? - No, I must sound crazy. - What do you want to drink? - No, it's on me. I'm Sorry. We've known each other for a long time. That's true. A long time. You, me, and Jaemin... Ever since 9th grade. So it's been four years already. - Time flies. - Yes. It's been already 4 years. Time really flies. We were all in the same class in 9th grade. We went our separate ways after that. Yeah, right. We were in the same class. - You and Jaemin were really close. - Yes, right. We were best friends... No! Me and him? No way, we weren't that close. We weren't that close, we even lived far apart. Barely friends. Really? [Found Jaemin! He's in Songdo.] I thought you two were best friends. I'm really sorry, Chanho. Let's do this another time. Jaemin is going to be in trouble. What's going on? Jaemin is going to explode and all that? I'm really sorry. I'm so worried. I'm sorry. Where is a cab? I need to hurry... ♪ The door is opening! ♪ ♪ Love at first sight ♪ - Are you crazy? - I didn't recognize you. What's with the suit? Were you at a funeral? He went to his ex-girlfriend's wedding. - We ruined your date, huh? - Yes. Threw away a once in a lifetime opportunity. Total fail. I guess I'm destined to have crushes forever. You're slower than I thought. What? Play the C51 camera. He passed through the Geumcheon toll gate at 3:45. Seeing as he's headed to Dangjin... It's Songdo. That's too easy. So, I'm just curious. How do you change your voice? I don't see a mic around your mouth. I'm just asking because it looks cool. Too personal, maybe? Let's respect each other's privacy, right? All right then. Let's keep it professional.

Meanwhile, dozens of large electronic displays in Seoul and the capital area are simultaneously playing a video file allegedly planted by hackers. According to an official, the alleged hackers wanted to demonstrate their skills by performing a defacement attack. Further away in Yongsan... [LOADING...] Hello, everyone! We are Crackers! Not the eating kind! Do you remember the crypto craze that blew up in Korea recently? New Year's cash, part-time work, tuition! Everything in crypto! Did you go all-in with your precious savings? The money kept piling on! While you went through hell! Keep working like dogs. We'll keep spending it like water. [You Know What?] [What can you do?] [Rainbow Glide Moonshine] [17 Hours Ago] First, go and see where the CCTVs are. I'll ask Senior Oh about hash functions. Senior Oh? Is he getting involved? Senior Oh was the one who told us he was here. Why does he care about him so much? He's one of the greatest hackers, He can go head-to-toe with the Honker Union, Damn, your slaps sting. It hurts! You made me so worried. I had a good reason, okay? You don't know anything! How dare you raise your voice at me! Did you see the post on the site? YOUKNOWWHAT reveals his next target to other hackers in advance. He's not short on confidence. Those bitches. We can't say no after such a considerate declaration of war. I'm going to hack the exchange before YOUKNOWWHAT. The security guards start their patrol at 11:00 p.m. I'll enter the server room after 40 minutes. The parent company is called Smart Cop, they're an IT security firm so it's hard to hack them remotely. We have to directly go to the server room, and plant malware in the main server. You are going inside the building? Well, I have the day off tomorrow. Come on now. I'm tired, too! I want to do nothing but rest on my day off. It's nothing. Wait, I'll call you back. What is this? These damn kids. Leaving things behind. Listen here, young man. I wonder why you were hiding out in the dark - doing something you shouldn't be? - Do something. My goodness, the light went out... [10] [4F Down - 5F Up] - [7F] - [2/1] [Staircase Entrance] Calling all guards. We have a man wearing a mask with a backpack and a black hat. He's making his way to the parking lot. Overtime sucks, right? Ever heard of server management with flexible hours? A dream job that guarantees a work-life balance. Probably only at Google. Just wait! This is a misunderstanding. Backpack. Black clothes. Even I think I look like a corporate spy. We have a man wearing a mask with a backpack and a black hat. And he's making a run towards the back entrance of the parking lot. Wait! This is a misunderstanding. Sounds like Jaemin is having his spinal cords readjusted. What? Oh no. I'm going in. I can't move... You bitch... What should we do? It'll be fine. Manguk is a good punching bag. - He can take all the hits. - No, I'm not talking about Jaemin. What? Come on. Do you know what his nickname was in high school? The wiper. The wiper? - He wiped his nose a lot? - It's because he can wipe out anyone. Oh yeah. He said he was on varsity. Bring it. Bring it! That felt good. You know those kids that are super athletic and super smart. That's right. Just the type you can't stand. All he did was fight and try MMA moves during middle and high school. Until he wised up and started studying really hard, then boom! Great SAT scores. Of course, he did. He's the typical comeback kid? It's such a cliche. [B4 > Entrance] [Career counseling report] Listen. It's great that you're finally studying hard, but why suddenly choose computer science? You were on the podium at the nationals. Athletics... won't help me catch those assholes that got my dad. [ETH Wallet: 28,000,000,000; AWN: 420,000,000,000] Hey! Stay focused! - Why do you look worse than he does? - He's an animal. Did they get you in the head? Hey, snap out of it! And why are you drooling? Did you kill them? - Did you bury them? - What is this, a crime movie? You should stop watching Netflix. So, what's next? We have to let YOUKNOWWHAT and other people know we attacked the exchange. As you are our leader, could you write up our statement? Wait. Wasn't I the leader? Were you flower watching in the middle of summer? - Looks like you were on a date. - Who cares. I'm in a good mood so don't ruin it. I haven't been to the beach in a long time so I was just taking it in. The alcohol is making me feel cold. I should go inside. What's this? I've never seen you show any manners at all. Not at all, I'm full of manners. I have so much that it's spilling out. Whatever. Wait. Why don't we stay a little longer? Why? There's a historical moment happening inside right now. You mean, those two? That's why you're outside? Of course, I can take a hint. Oh my god! It's cold. It's because I'm cold. It's my jacket anyway. Don't misunderstand. I'll have my hands clenched. Okay. Hey. What? It's the middle of summer. We're in ""Major Heat,"" it's the hottest time of the year in the solar term. Okay, that was a good one. The number you have dialed is currently busy right now. Please call again another time. The number you have dialed... The number you have... He's not answering. What should we do? We only have 20 minutes left before the announcement. What is it? What's going on? [Back To Present] Do you really want to know who I am? Then bring the USB. I'll give you the answer you're looking for. [Angry Joo] You are one impressive kid. Coming alone like this. I know that's your character, but don't you think you're too confident? No, wait. This isn't confidence. Is it you? You're YOUKNOWWHAT? So, 28 billion AWN is inside this thing? Everything is so convenient these days. Hey, Jaemin. Let's see those famous moves of yours. Give it a try. The best fighter in high school. You can do better. Jaemin. Jaemin! Jaemin! What should I do with you. All right. I admit you're good. Compliment accepted. I know I'm good. Hey, Jaemin. Look at you. Still trying to be so cool. Stop trying so hard! You're making it worse. I predicted you'd be reckless because it was for Joohee. But don't you think this was too much of a risk? Is it because you like Joohee or is it because of your dad? Hey, Chanho. It was really you? You killed my dad? Yeah. Right. I also told Joohee's dad about Azilowon. I knew that already. You bastard. Stop acting like you know everything. It's disgusting. Did you also imagine this? Being betrayed by a friend from high school? Hey, Chanho. I didn't realize... you wanted to be my friend that badly. You should have just told me. You asshole! You think you are all that? You think you're so fucking great? You confused meatheaded jock. You're parading around town thinking that you are a real hacker? [1st: Lee Chanho, 2nd: Park Jaemin] Being second place is a skill, too. You play futsal with us until 11:00 p.m. and you still get good scores. - You should buy us snacks to celebrate! - You're like a cheat code. Let's go. He has a sad face for being the smartest kid at school. Jaemin is the best fighter here, imagine if he got better test scores, Chanho would kill himself. I think Jaemin is going easy on Chanho. Chanho is studying day and night trying to stay at the top. Jaemin eats, sleeps, and does whatever he wants, and he's still second place. There's not a big difference between their average scores either. Poor Chanho. I should have just done nothing. Then it would have been less painful. Everything was easy for you. Beg. It wasn't for me. Beg for your life. All you have to do is beg, just once. If you beg me, I might let you go. You disgust me. You lost. You lost, asshole! Think again. Think what again? You really think I lost? You're delusional. Chanho, you bastard! Do you think I ransacked the administrator's account? Do you really think I spear-phished Azilowon? Stop your bullshit. I did hack the administrator's page. I sent a bunch of emails with their member's data. Hot wallets, it lets you withdraw tokens directly online. Well, I sent one each to all of Azilowon's 1.2 million members. I just planted a Trojan horse in your mobile. - You lose. - You son of a bitch! YOUKNOWWHAT called me. He said he'll give me the answer I'm looking for if I bring this to him. Really? - Then take it. - What? He's got your answer. Plus, I'm really curious about who he is. - What's this? - A fake USB. It has a tracking device. But it needs electricity to work. So it needs to be plugged in like this, - for us to identify the location. - Can this record too? Of course. Of course, it records everything in real-time and will be broadcast across the nation, just like in the movies. Psych. If you want to mount a camera, we would need MI6... I have another plan. Do you know what YOUKNOWWHAT is? What is it? It's... no one. With Chanho's profound parting words, an unusual summer for a twenty-year-old came and went. The Seoul Cyber Bureau was at Songdo International Exchange... The hack of the century, which could have erased millions of cryptocurrencies, did attract the public's attentions for a while but the news died down and was remembered as the act of an attention-craving hacker. YOUKNOWWHAT, the man I hunted for three years, was forgotten by the public in just three days. [NOTICE: As of August 10, 2020, ""Better World"" club will be converted into a ""Fine Dust"" research room.] ""Better World""? Is it a name of a club? Never heard of it. It's a weird name. ""Better World,"" huh? Maybe it's a volunteering group? So, if we're out, who's replacing us? What's so great about them? They're sponsored by Samsung, collaborating with MIT students on atmospheric engineering research. Kids that can save the world from fine dust? I heard KBS is going to interview them too. Massachusetts... Then, what about us? - Where can we do our club activities? - You guys... should meet in the virtual world. Your club failed to meet the member's requirements anyways. You're making me look like a bad landlord expelling tenants. I have no power. I have no power to help you. Do you want me to make an appointment with the president? My honorable TA, you can't do this to us! It's not like I'm a pearl lacquerware master trying to pass down the torch or noodle pulling master from China. I have no plans to accept any disciples. I just want to be the owner of an internet cafe for the rest of my life. I heard you were a reverse engineer, one of the top three engineers at the Ministry of Science and Technology. If you accept me as a disciple, I will do my best. Who would have thought? That the boss at my part-time job was a genius hacker? That he's one of the very few Wizard Experts in the world. This is not Hogwarts, okay? Wizards? Are you a wizard? Gryffindor or Slytherin? Why do people always say, ""Gryffindor or Slytherin?"" Ravenclaw, known for their cleverness and creativity, and the protectors of morals and character, Hufflepuff. But I am... a Gryffindor. - Such a nerd. - Could you not bring her here anymore? Hey, she didn't even pay for that. He will pay for it. That will be deducted from your wages. Stop eating the expensive snacks, take the bagged ones. - May you travel safely, my master. - Get lost! All my favorites are in this! Nothing but the best. I'm a better cook than your number 28. 28? I totally forgot about him. It's okay, I'll just have to find number 29. Right. Eat. Wait. My dumb dad. Thanks for saving him twice. It's not a big deal. Your dad was kind to me in high school, too. Just tell him to stop going to those weird investment seminars. You make sure he doesn't, okay? So pretty. - Do you want water? - Yes. Finally finished eating. You're looking good, Joohee.

Scala,https://yts-subs.com/movie-imdb/tt14064326,https://yts-subs.com/subtitles/scala-2022-english-yify-489996,"Hello! You are here by yourself? Alright. Let it down. Bring it down slowly. Slowly. Give it to me. Slow down. It's too fast for them to shoot. No. It's like a construction site. You take it down, and that's all. How many floors today? Every floor. I'm going to wash my hands. Wash my hands so that... Yes, everything, including the frame. Hey, hey. Let's film this guy more. Shoot him more - Still won't shut up. - At first, I didn't remember you were Sakchai's daughter. What? Really? This is Sakchai's daughter. I don't remember at all. It's been so many years. How's miss Leka? - She's getting old now. - Really? - Can she walk? - She manages. You live with her, right? Do you still live with miss Leka? She changed a lot. Completely different. I remember her as a little girl with glasses. Her face changed after she's grown. I think every cinema bans cats.But the multiplex cinemas in the shopping malls might not have such problems.In the Siam cinema projection box,there's a sign on the door to the rooftop that says, ""keep cats out.""One day, I found a cat staring at me at my bedroom door,which means it would have had to walk through the entire projection box.We stared into each other's eyes for a whilebefore I kicked it out so no one would notice.Even with a label saying, ""do not feed the cats,""Auntie Cha-Um, the office janitor,would just keep feeding them on the rooftops anyways.It's stuck. I can't take it off. Do we still have to drive the cats out? No, not anymore Does your dad know that they're tearing down Scala? Have you talked to him? No calls? I meant to call him too, but I got too busy. I think it was in late 1973. It was 40, 45 years ago. Around 1974. In the beginning, the Scala had 1,200 seats. It was the biggest one. Siam Cinema had 900 seats. The Lido Theater had 1,000 seats. This cinema had the most. I think it's the end of that October protest. So I started working here at the end of 1973. It was December, I remember. But I actually was working at Samyan cinema first. - Samyan? - Samyan. It's the place where... There were Samyan cinemas next to Hua Lamphong temple. You didn't know? It's a cinema screening Chinese movies. There are the Samyan and Rama cinemas. I worked there for over a year before moving to Lido in 1975. I remember seeing you and your father always arguing when I was working at the Siam Cinema. At first, you guys were able to talk normally, and soon started arguing. That's why Ms. Leka always said, ""If you can't take care of her, give her to me. I will do it myself!"" That's what she said. He was an ill-tempered man. He did not want your mother to see or meet you. It's like he doesn't want you to contact each other. So he had to... That's why you never saw her. I don't have a picture of her either. Back then, what should I say? Taking pictures wasn't easy. Uncle Nao was a projectionist at Siam cinema.It was at the Siam cinema projection box where I first met him.I don't remember when I started living in the Siam cinema.Before I knew it, I was already running around the place.But the Lido and the Scala, I didn't really visit so much back thenunless there was a film I wanted to see that was not shown at our cinema.Although the Scala may look prettier than her sisters,I didn't feel that they were so different on the inside.Go, go. Stop. They've been here since 8:30 a.m. They didn't have the scaffoldings. They just started taking them off. Yes, but... Yes, someone's assisting him. Yes, it seems all right now. At this corner of the Siam cinema projection room,there was a door to our bedroom.Our bed lied underneath the huge air tubes.My sheets were the same fabric as the curtains at the cinema's entrance.I remember because I liked to run and brush these curtains with my handswhile waiting for The Royal Anthem to end so I could enjoy the film right away.They can't start pulling the curtains down because it might rip something. - They're expensive curtains. - There's a procedure! - They're fireproof. - No, it's... - No, just remove the hoops! - Right. - Ready? - Okay! - I will do it in slow-motion, okay? - Okay! One, two, three. Maybe it can be recycled into a prosthetic leg. - No, it's metal. - It can't be. - It's metal? - Metal! It will rust. - I thought it was aluminum. - You sure? Damn, it's metal. - You want to get tetanus? - Right. - Where's Yod? - Come here. - Why don't you turn the light on? - Pull it. Can we rest a bit? Let's take a break. Let's take a break. How about pulling this way? No, you have to go in an angle that way. The rope broke. Even the rope broke. That's the last of it. Just move the rest of the curtains. Are you making a review video? No, more like a documentary film. It's sad, isn't it? Some say they used to come here when they were a child. People in their 30s saying they used to come to the Scala. Some older folks came here, just realizing that it's being demolished, and would say they came here since they were in their teens. Well, times changed. Things have to change too. What was new became something newer. Your side down, that side lifts. - That side first. - Lift. Don't lift yet! Don't lift yet! If you're not ready, just don't do it. Wait, wait. No one below to catch? - No. - No. Did you see that court order? The opposition party won the vote but did not get a seat. Just because he makes small merits with the monks. Now the election committee just revoked his seat in the parliament. How much did Yod win in the lotto? Three hundred? - This? - This one first. Take it here. Where to go? - Where? - Right here. It's just a frame. So, I went to work with uncle Saiyud at the Siam theater. Back then, all the Siam staff had quit. I think it was Sompoj, right? Sompoj. I was sent to help Sompoj, and then I came back here. I remember seeing you walk to school back then. THIS SITE, THEREFORE, HOLDS A HISTORICAL IMPORTANCE IN THAI FILM HISTORY. THIS PLAQUE WAS INSTALLED HERE ON WORLD AUDIOVISUAL HERITAGE DAY. OCTOBER 27TH, 2019 It was only after the cinema closed that I know how to change the lights. - Let me see. - And now I'm an electrician. You still got it. Yes, but getting soft now. Just learning to be an electrician now. How disappointed my parents would be. They said that to Gen. That's all you get from working in Bangkok? Hold this, then. Yes, climb up. - Pull? - No, you hold it from the right. Yes. Hang on, give me a second. Big hammer go up. Hold it like this - Hey. - Hey. - Blackout again? - Blackout again. - Just let it go. I can't see. - Okay. I can't see. Can you see, Gap? Who hit the light switch? The cinema employees were both Bangkokians and people from other provinces.Most of them are probably from the Northeastern region.When I first came, I couldn't understand their dialect much.I started to understand after a while.Back when there were still a lot of employees,at the end of the day, we would turn off the air conditioners, close the doors,and spread out the sheet to sleep in front of the screen.The air remained cool until the next morning.We can talk about this...I love him because he said...it's not about gender...Don't know who won the lottery. PEKING DUCK Gen and Nao. And... Lee and Apaiwong. How about Arun? Nao and Yo. - Arun? - Arun is reporting for unemployment. I attended primary school at Wat Pathum Wanaram.Most of my friends are descendants of the people who work around the Siam area.Some of them have homes in the slums next to the school.One day, when I was in fourth grade,a friend shouted that my house was on fire.We saw a huge smoke rising from Siam Square.But I think the smoke was most likely coming from the Lido.After school, I hurried back to the Siam cinema,and turns out it was safe.After the fire, the Lido was renovated into a three-screen multiplex cinema.Oh, your camera is set up already. - Have you eaten yet? - No. No? Not hungry? I'll eat later. DO NOT ENTER WITHOUT PERMISSION I just bought bread but gave it all to the others. You can use the toilet too. Come, have some hot Ovaltine. It's still warm. Oh, thank you. Someone brought me this cookie. It's quite good. Crispy and yummy. It's their snack. Aunt Sarai brought it for them. They won a lotto, so they brought some. They actually won the lotto. They are so cute. And clever too. They will give whatever you ask for. They're cute, aren't they? Back then, the aunties in the office would bring food just like this.Auntie Ree, the head of the ticket office, liked making stewed eggs,while auntie Leka, the accountant, always brought steamed buns.I spent most of the time with those office aunties while Dad was at work.At first, it was them who brought me to the cinema.Now that I've grown up, I prefer to go alone.OUTSIDERS ARE PROHIBITED FROM ENTERING. BIRDS OF PREY BIRDS OF PREY I'm almost 60 years old. Who would hire someone this old? So there is a saying that over the age of 50, one can only be a security guard. But I can't stay awake that long. Too exhausting. So I have to stay as long as possible before everyone departs back home. Your father started working here before me. Did my father use to work at Scala first? Your dad worked at the APEX company right over there. He was... a programmer. He booked films. His duties were different. Your dad's office was over there. APEX was there. He took the film to the censorship department, then to the film labs, and then to the cinemas. But I started as an usher. I used to wear the yellow jackets. I'm that old. From usher to the chief. It took me 51 years. Back then, we were just like any teenager. We ate, drank, and hung out, just like any normal teenager. And your mom worked at the snack bar in her yellow uniform. The rope can't take the weight. It'll cut your hand if you pull it. - This is dangerous work, you know. - Be careful. We all came after it opened. How could we know? Even Gap's dad didn't know. He came after the cinema opened. - After the cinema opened? - Yes. Who knows who built this screen. But the guy who brought the chandelier might know. - Right, the owner of this thing. - Girl. - Yes, the chandelier's owner. - I saw... I saw him on the last day of the screening. He could barely walk. Yes, he is that generation. Pull it away, Nao, Yod. Pull away. It's stuck here. Go sideways. Hey, do you mind if I ask you something? Have you met your mother? - No. - No? - Not since you were very young, right? - Have you ever met my mother? Yes, I used to visit her at her house. The house near the mosque. I remember your mother had very fair skin. - She is from Phetchaburi, right? - I don't know. Don't you know? I've seen her live there. Disassemble this first. - Come here first. - Shall I disassemble it? Can it disassemble? Or should we move it like that? It can't. Move it. Where's that cat that likes taking photos? Probably got startled and ran away. There were two large windows in the Siam cinema office.From there, you can see almost everyone downstairs.Next to the window was a table.There were six phones on the table.When it rang and no one was around,I would answer and give some general information,such as the showtimes.One day, auntie Ree brought me to that window.She pointed down to the popcorn cabinet and asked if I could see my mom.""She's standing right there.""I think I was becoming short-sighted then.All I saw was a blurry shape of a person.Auntie Ree also told me not to tell my father about what had just happened.I was very curious what would happen if he found out.So I told him after he came back from work.He just left the room immediately.I never heard about my mother ever again.It's burning. I can't fix this. You full already? Thirty-nine years. If this was a big company... by now, I would have been compensated enough to be rich. Why did you choose to work here? I didn't have an education. I didn't pursue an education back then. I only finished the 4th grade. At that time, 30 or 40 years ago. Without any educational background, I have to do whatever I can. I thought about leaving, but there weren't any other jobs. I had no education or credentials. Nothing to build upon. I had no choice. Nowhere to go. So I have to stay as long as I can. Long enough until I became the chief. From usher to the chief. Oh, didn't see you there. It's so dark today. - Isn't that a 50-Satang coin? - Wow, a coin. Move the light, move the light. There's my one Baht. Got only a Baht today. Yesterday, I found a ten Baht coin. Like picking coins from a Krathong at the festival. Is that a cigarette butt? Since when? - Around 30 years? - It was legal 30, 40 years ago. People in the past were able to smoke cigarettes in movie theaters. The ban on smoking in cinemas was only passed in 1979. Before that, they hadn't banned smoking in cinemas yet. Please tell those three-fingered protesters to go to Ratchadamnoen Road. No, they already changed their plans. They are coming here. See? They turn the police into clowns. After 10:00 p.m., the protesters go home. What can the police do? Spend 200 million Baht to chase protestors like this? - They took the soldiers from everywhere. - And who knows how many soldiers came. - What a waste of money. - Yes, a waste of money. They said... Be careful not to talk about politics. Cut it out of the film, okay, Gap? I guess I've already sworn a lot anyways. - I can't even catch my breath. - Again? Watch your head. Watch yourselves. Watch yourselves. Don't pass through yet. How reckless. Put it down, now. Let it go. We'll see it later. Why don't you just let it go? It might hit someone. Well, that's their fault. This person looks like uncle Vinai.Since COVID-19, I can hardly recognize people's faces.I often ran into him when my father took me for breakfastat the Chula University's Dentistry faculty Canteen.Besides the canteen,there was an alley behind Bangkok Bank just next to Siam Cinemaand the allies by the Scala,where people who work around here ate regularlysince the price is not so expensive.The rest are more restaurants for tourists and shoppers.Come on, breakfast. Rice noodles. Grab a plate and join me. Not eating? Are you sure? You'll regret it. I had a banana. All right. If I remember correctly, my first time visiting the Scalawas when my aunt brought me here for the owner's birthday party.It was a Western-Chinese-style restaurant.The recommended menu was Peking Duck.Sometimes, the head of the cinema would bring the Scala's Peking duck ribsto fry with garlic and pepper and ate it along with liquoron the Siam cinema rooftop.Later, a Siam Skytrain station was built.The platform is as high as the rooftop,and the passengers who waited for the train could see us all.Since then, I rarely went out to the roof again.Put it up. He worked too much. He has pain in his legs. Where were you yesterday? I was sick. Stomach ache? At least, I have land at home upcountry. My house is there. I'm here just for work. I have a house here, too, but my land is back there. What province? Kalasin. It's far. Have you ever been? I guess not. You might get lost. In the cinema, there was a row of chairs called spare chairs.It was a row of chairs reserved in case of any ticket problems,such as duplicate seat numbers.They are among the most expensive seat in the back rows.Any employee who wanted to watch a movie could sit there.I sat there as well.In the past, some movies were so popular that they had to add extra chairs.I had to wait until fewer people came before I could get back to my row.Sometimes they forbade me to see certain films.But I would see it anyways just by sitting quietly behind the projector.Gap, who is the protagonist of your film? Or is it all of us? And that's the last person. The last chair. The last chair is done. Lately, people don't come to see movies like beforeNow they rent to watch at home.Or see a movie at the mall.Sometimes there was only one person watching.When this started to happen more often, they would have to cancel whole showtimes.The head of the cinema would then have to apologize and refund the audience.There's a huge air tube above your bed in the Siam theater. The big air conditioner engine is down there. It's an air vent. So cool air gets in here and goes over there. That's what we used. But at Siam, that room is actually a cold room. That's why there's a big tube over your bed. Yes, I know it's Yai's car, but he'll drop by and shop first. OUTSIDERS ARE PROHIBITED FROM ENTERING. No, I mean it's Yai's car, not a big car. - He's not come yet. - No, he's coming later. It's a homonym. - So it's Yai's car, not a big car, huh? - Okay, I get it. I know, I know. But they don't. They don't understand. Big car and Yai's car. It's different. They'll get confused. The bread is moldy. Don't eat it. MONEY IS NOT VALUABLE. IT'S ALL USED UP ON BILLS, ON KIDS, AND ON FOOD. It's 9:00 a.m. already. Take the air conditioner out now. That's good soil. - That plant helps with Gastritis. - Oh, right. Would be good with curry. Do you want some turmeric? No, my land is all covered in concrete. And mine has no sun. Nothing grows. You can grow it again. I think... That's Nodding Clerodendrum. But don't take it. Yan must think it was Chom's plant. So he doesn't want to risk it. - Remember how Chom gets mad? - When he curses, I can't bear to listen. - I can't catch up with what he says. - Is that a Santol? - No, no need to take that. - Would you like this turmeric? No. Why would I? It will just turn into junk. - Take this one. - Don't have. Why take out the clothesline? I still have to do laundry. - Put the clothesline back now. - Calm down, I'll fix it. Take this right away. You can put it back. Calm down. After the Tom Yum Kung financial crisis in 1997,Chulalongkorn University, the landowner,increased the rent exponentially every year.The initial ten-year lease was changed to a one-year lease.A movie that used to screen for over a week.Now they have to show multiple movies in one day.The popcorn that used to be sold in front of the cinema is no longer being sold. They sell only snacks instead. The younger employees would quit to find other prospects. My dad got a new job. Auntie Ree left to look after her grandchildren. As for me, I moved in with auntie Leka not long before the coup d'état in 2006. That is such a white shirt. He's snooping around. Ning, see? He walked this way. Ning, go check the other camera at the stairs for me, but at this exact time. Here, the stairs, this camera. Camera number 28, then. Here. Play backward. Let me see the time first. He's wearing trousers. Is he a driver trying to wake someone? - Here. Right here. - Well... Come, come. He looks like Mr. Apaiwong. What? I was on duty there. Stop and play. - This camera. - At 5:29 a.m., who's that? - There's the phone. There. - Looks like Miss Wang. - Who is that? - She went down the stairs. Only three milk left. I didn't drink it. Drink it, then. If you're afraid it'll run out, drink it. One bag of sticky rice is not enough anymore. How many do you need, then? Five Baht, right? Ten Baht per. What sticky rice costs five Baht anyway? When was the last time you had a five Baht sticky rice? I can buy at this price because of those government apps. It was only ten Baht. No way it's ten Baht without that app. So that's five Baht. The government pays five Baht. - What is this? - What? What's up? It says, ""You've got a pillow. Let's go to bed."" Let's shop. - Oh, shopping, huh? - Again? So that the officers can follow upand arrest the criminals for further prosecution...And that's uncle Gen's house. Want some bananas? Down with Feudalism, Long live the People!Down with Feudalism, Long live the People!Down with Feudalism, Long live the People!Take this first. And then see what all we can load on the truck. Yod. The coil, take it. Okay, just put it down. Has the truck come yet? Not yet. Can't wait for the rope. - Be careful, don't rush. Take it easy. - The middle. Okay, right? That piece is for you anyway. Put it down. - Go, go. - Take the papers. Wrap them with the papers. Wrap them with two sheets of paper. Got to sleep today. - Drive to... - Wait, wait. Shit. The whole fucking thing came down. One evening in May 2010,I heard the news on television that the Siam cinema was on fire.There were red-shirt protests rallying at Ratchaprasong Intersectiondemanding Prime Minister Abhisit's resignation since March.It was the last day of the military crackdown.Live ammunition was used to disperse the assembly,which resulted in at least 99 deaths.To this day, no one knows who burned down Siam Cinema.Later on, the Siam cinema became a new department store.Auntie Leka didn't go back to work ever again.When the Lido's lease expired in 2018,the remaining staff from both cinemas went to work at the Scala,the last standalone cinema.I beg them not to remove the handrail yet. How am I getting up there, then? We said to do it later. Miss Peak, hello. Hello. They're here. Don't step on the wire. Careful not to trip. Here they come. Good. Have you seen your father lately? I just realized you are his daughter. So, have you seen him recently? So you lived with miss Leka after that, right? Please tell your father that Peak misses him. I used to be close to him. Tell him I am the Lido's accountant. We used to be close. What do you do for a living? I make documentaries. Documentaries? Sometimes, I take photos at weddings. Is it okay? Is it hard to make a living? With everything going on now, it's hard. I ask because I see people selling things on live streaming. Is it hard? Well, not really. Any camera will do. Phone cameras? Yes, Front camera phones and internet. It's all about the product, right? I'm tired. What are you going to sell? That's just it. I don't have any products. Prayut, get out! Prayut, get out!Prayut, get out! Prayut, get out!Prawit, get out! Prawit, get out!Brothers and sisters.Free our friends.Draft a new constitution.Abolish 112.Prayut, get out! Prayut, get out!
