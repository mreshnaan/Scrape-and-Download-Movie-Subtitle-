00:03:14,833 --> 00:03:20,174
<i>And we begin our news tour
with the A! Jazeera channel</i>

3
00:03:21,375 --> 00:03:26,546
<i>which said that an extensive
investigation has been conducted</i>

4
00:03:28,708 --> 00:03:34,333
<i>by a team of international
independent technical experts</i>

5
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:41,254
<i>who confirmed the claim of interference
of an Al Jazeera Sports Channel</i>

6
00:03:45,417 --> 00:03:50,335
<i>during the broadcast
of the FIFA World Cup,</i>

7
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:56,047
<i>and the experts were able
to identify the site</i>

8
00:03:56,208 --> 00:04:00,629
<i>from which the interference originated</i>

9
00:04:00,833 --> 00:04:05,301
<i>which is near the city of Salt, Jordan,</i>

10
00:04:05,458 --> 00:04:10,885
<i>and noted that this site is deliberately
interfering with the broadcast</i>

11
00:04:14,042 --> 00:04:17,301
<i>signal of A! Jazeera Sports</i>

12
00:04:17,458 --> 00:04:22,593
<i>resulting in interference of
the live broadcast of a number</i>

13
00:04:24,750 --> 00:04:27,298
<i>of World Cup matches.</i>

14
00:04:44,208 --> 00:04:45,500
<i>""The Guardian"" newspaper</i>

15
00:04:45,667 --> 00:04:48,168
<i>confirms this hypothesis
and further more based</i>

16
00:04:48,375 --> 00:04:49,466
<i>on the secret documents</i>

17
00:04:49,625 --> 00:04:53,465
<i>that refer to the site of interference
being in Jordan and more specifically</i>

18
00:04:53,625 --> 00:04:54,798
<i>near the city of Salt.</i>

19
00:04:54,958 --> 00:04:57,210
<i>which used in the process
advanced equipment</i>

20
00:04:57,375 --> 00:05:00,090
<i>that interrupts the origin
of the signal transmission</i>

21
00:05:00,250 --> 00:05:03,841
<i>and the British newspaper assured,
based on the experts' quotes that</i>

22
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:07,295
<i>this has occurred with the knowledge
of the Jordanian government</i>

23
00:05:07,458 --> 00:05:11,132
<i>in what appears to be linked to anger
in Jordan after failing to reach</i>

24
00:05:11,292 --> 00:05:13,129
<i>an agreement with Al Jazeera Sports</i>

25
00:05:13,292 --> 00:05:16,752
<i>from banks and currencies to the
prices that are changing day after day...</i>

26
00:05:17,083 --> 00:05:19,667
Well... I need two hours
and I'll be back.

27
00:05:25,250 --> 00:05:27,881
Could you please turn it
down a little bit?

28
00:05:31,542 --> 00:05:34,588
Of course I'm by myself!
Who would I be with?

29
00:05:36,583 --> 00:05:40,293
No! Do not come by unless
you give me a call first.

30
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:45,083
Can I be honest with you?

31
00:05:45,250 --> 00:05:48,213
I don't want you in my life anymore.

32
00:12:09,750 --> 00:12:13,839
<i>In Amman, hundreds of
Jordanians protested against the</i>

33
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:17,211
<i>repression and intimidation
of journalists</i>

34
00:12:17,375 --> 00:12:22,009
<i>which took place when they organized
a protest under the name.</i>

35
00:12:22,167 --> 00:12:25,841
<i>The Friday for Dignity
and Freedom of Expression.</i>

36
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:29,094
<i>The demonstrators burned
an American flag</i>

37
00:12:29,292 --> 00:12:33,084
<i>to protest what they called
the U.S. intervention</i>

38
00:12:33,250 --> 00:12:36,426
<i>in the policies of
the Jordanian Government,</i>

39
00:12:36,583 --> 00:12:41,419
<i>and called for the resignation
of the Prime Minister as well as</i>

40
00:12:41,583 --> 00:12:43,966
<i>demanding freedom of the press.</i>

41
00:12:44,125 --> 00:12:47,052
<i>Last Friday, a violence fight broke out</i>

42
00:12:47,208 --> 00:12:50,669
<i>when police tried to
break up a demonstration</i>

43
00:12:50,833 --> 00:12:55,301
<i>that called for reform.
Many journalists were injured.</i>

44
00:12:55,458 --> 00:12:57,675
<i>From Amman, the bureau chief,</i>

45
00:12:57,833 --> 00:13:01,258
<i>Yasser Abu Hilal,
will report on the details.</i>

46
00:13:01,417 --> 00:13:06,501
<i>Yasser, what was the extent of
the fight and what will happen now?</i>

47
00:13:06,667 --> 00:13:11,632
<i>Demonstrations swept a number
of Jordanian cities south in Maan,</i>

48
00:13:11,792 --> 00:13:16,675
<i>and in the south, in Karak
and Tafieleh and Irbid in the north.</i>

49
00:13:16,833 --> 00:13:21,882
<i>This Friday called for reform
but brutal repression by the police</i>

50
00:13:22,042 --> 00:13:26,925
<i>resulted in many of journalists
being injured and hospitalized.</i>

51
00:13:27,083 --> 00:13:32,132
<i>Prior to the demonstration,
a meeting by King Abduflah II and the</i>

52
00:13:32,292 --> 00:13:36,510
<i>official representative
of the journalist, Tareq Momani</i>

53
00:13:36,667 --> 00:13:41,218
<i>took place yesterday,
and the message meeting was clear...</i>

54
00:16:27,958 --> 00:16:30,376
It will do for couple of days.

55
00:16:36,083 --> 00:16:38,086
Can you take me to the airport?

56
00:16:38,750 --> 00:16:39,841
What for?

57
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,003
I finally got my visa.

58
00:16:43,542 --> 00:16:45,343
So what about the money?

59
00:16:45,542 --> 00:16:47,177
Be patient with me.

60
00:16:47,750 --> 00:16:48,793
I need it now!

61
00:16:48,958 --> 00:16:50,131
What's the rush?

62
00:16:50,292 --> 00:16:51,678
I have to have surgery.

63
00:16:51,833 --> 00:16:52,876
Surgery for what?

64
00:16:53,667 --> 00:16:56,464
When was the last time
you checked the oil?

65
00:17:01,125 --> 00:17:03,294
No need... the engine
is the problem.

66
00:17:11,125 --> 00:17:13,424
The car keeps shutting off...

67
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:16,420
This isn't working...

68
00:17:16,833 --> 00:17:19,168
You want me to keep
going on like this?

69
00:17:19,333 --> 00:17:21,550
I don't get it... what do you want?

70
00:17:22,917 --> 00:17:24,801
Just fix the engine.

71
00:17:27,292 --> 00:17:30,835
Fouad, get me the notebook...
it's in the drawer.

72
00:17:58,500 --> 00:18:01,462
You've got 300 dinars worth
of fines since last year.

73
00:18:02,042 --> 00:18:05,420
When are you going to pay them?

74
00:18:05,583 --> 00:18:07,338
I'm going to be honest with you...

75
00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:09,669
In general, I'm unhappy
with your performance.

76
00:18:09,833 --> 00:18:14,089
If you don't shape up within a week,
you give me the cab back and go.

77
00:18:15,833 --> 00:18:17,255
What happened?

78
00:18:17,417 --> 00:18:19,336
The front part is totally wrecked.

79
00:18:19,750 --> 00:18:21,090
So, when will it be done?

80
00:18:21,417 --> 00:18:22,756
Half a day.

81
00:18:25,583 --> 00:18:28,261
So what are you waiting for?
Get back to work.

82
00:18:36,167 --> 00:18:39,296
You think you're the only one
with dignity in this world.

83
00:18:39,458 --> 00:18:41,343
And what if I told you
to buzz off?

84
00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:43,882
A couple of days ago
you called me a jackass!

85
00:18:44,042 --> 00:18:47,834
Or do you only use
etiquette when...

86
00:18:55,208 --> 00:18:56,630
What are you up to?

87
00:18:57,083 --> 00:18:59,051
I'm bored out of my mind.

88
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,050
Going to work.

89
00:19:12,250 --> 00:19:16,208
Mom, are you going out tonight?

90
00:19:23,667 --> 00:19:27,341
Then can you leave me your car keys...
I'm going out but I won't be late.

91
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:28,970
You're going out every day now?

92
00:19:29,125 --> 00:19:30,714
I'm going to a graduation party.

93
00:19:30,875 --> 00:19:32,713
Take a cab.

94
00:19:33,167 --> 00:19:38,381
You want me to step out of the hair salon
into the street and hail a cab?

95
00:19:38,833 --> 00:19:40,552
No way!

96
00:19:40,792 --> 00:19:46,670
The first time I ever went to a salon
was on my wedding day.

97
00:19:47,875 --> 00:19:50,127
Did you add your father on Facebook?

98
00:19:50,292 --> 00:19:51,501
I don't want to.

99
00:19:51,667 --> 00:19:52,709
Why?

100
00:19:52,875 --> 00:19:54,380
Because I don't want to.

101
00:19:54,542 --> 00:19:55,751
Add him!

102
00:19:55,917 --> 00:19:58,595
Mama, can you stop acting like a teenager.

103
00:19:58,750 --> 00:20:00,385
Let me know when you add him.

104
00:20:00,542 --> 00:20:05,093
What do you really want from all this?

105
00:20:06,167 --> 00:20:08,964
Will you give me the keys or not?

106
00:20:10,167 --> 00:20:12,798
Didn't your dad say he'd buy you a car?

107
00:20:12,958 --> 00:20:14,713
Talk to him...

108
00:20:23,667 --> 00:20:24,840
Message?

109
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:26,126
Call him!

110
00:20:26,292 --> 00:20:27,714
I don't feel like it.

111
00:20:27,875 --> 00:20:29,960
And, anyway, I don't have credit.

112
00:20:30,125 --> 00:20:32,342
Your father doesn't answer messages.

113
00:20:32,500 --> 00:20:37,300
You'll see...
I'll keep sending until he answers.

114
00:20:40,792 --> 00:20:43,636
How's your boyfriend, the mechanic?

115
00:20:43,792 --> 00:20:46,209
Mom, he's not a ""mechanic"".

116
00:20:46,375 --> 00:20:50,677
Jaber is a mechanical engineer.

117
00:20:52,375 --> 00:20:55,421
Darling, men are stupid creatures.

118
00:20:55,958 --> 00:20:59,419
Don't comfort him,
don't ever let him feel safe.

119
00:20:59,583 --> 00:21:03,127
You have to always
keep him worried... afraid.

120
00:21:03,292 --> 00:21:05,709
Don't you dare tell him that you love him.

121
00:21:05,875 --> 00:21:08,590
No! He told me loves me.

122
00:21:08,917 --> 00:21:13,717
Don't say it until he loses
hope from waiting.

123
00:21:35,917 --> 00:21:37,671
Jaber...

124
00:21:41,042 --> 00:21:44,420
I've been a taxi driver for a while now...

125
00:21:44,750 --> 00:21:47,049
When will you give me my old job back?

126
00:21:47,292 --> 00:21:49,544
We still don't have any openings.

127
00:21:49,833 --> 00:21:51,671
It's been 5 years.

128
00:21:53,208 --> 00:21:56,752
You know more than anyone what
I can do for the showroom sales.

129
00:21:57,375 --> 00:22:01,215
You're the one who left
to go work in the Gulf.

130
00:24:09,750 --> 00:24:11,883
Imad, what were you doing
on their roof?

131
00:24:12,167 --> 00:24:15,011
Do you want us to get
in trouble with the neighbors?

132
00:24:15,167 --> 00:24:18,426
<i>""After a women has found
her way into a man's heart,</i>

133
00:24:18,583 --> 00:24:20,254
<i>she will seek to control him,</i>

134
00:24:20,417 --> 00:24:23,462
<i>and there are many ways
she can keep that control</i>

135
00:24:23,625 --> 00:24:27,003
<i>like, for example, if he has
a submissive personality,</i>

136
00:24:27,167 --> 00:24:29,170
<i>or h' he is poor and she is not.</i>

137
00:24:29,333 --> 00:24:33,719
<i>She could also be sadistic and
he could be unable to stand up for himself</i>

138
00:24:33,875 --> 00:24:38,047
<i>Moreover, the women's family is
could be wealthy and have power in</i>

139
00:24:38,208 --> 00:24:41,135
<i>society increasing
the psychological pressure.</i>

140
00:24:41,292 --> 00:24:44,835
<i>AH of these things could cause
the husband to surrender</i>

141
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:47,466
<i>and remain silent in the face of abuse.</i>

142
00:24:47,625 --> 00:24:51,133
<i>In fact, in the Arab world
today in only 7% of cases do</i>

143
00:24:51,292 --> 00:24:54,219
<i>men started to admit to
the violence they face</i>

144
00:24:54,375 --> 00:24:58,168
<i>and they do not fully recognized it
until they have reached</i>

145
00:24:58,333 --> 00:25:00,799
<i>a severe stage of depression and abuse.</i>

146
00:25:00,958 --> 00:25:03,542
<i>And so when we try
to know and understand</i>

147
00:25:03,708 --> 00:25:05,676
<i>the reason for their depression</i>

148
00:25:05,833 --> 00:25:08,216
<i>we uncover the truth of the violence.</i>

149
00:25:09,167 --> 00:25:11,466
I've missed you, kid.

150
00:25:15,042 --> 00:25:17,459
Pretty soon you'll be as tall as me.

151
00:25:19,042 --> 00:25:21,127
I might be taller.

152
00:25:28,167 --> 00:25:30,798
So why weren't you two talking?

153
00:25:31,583 --> 00:25:33,135
She was upset.

154
00:25:33,292 --> 00:25:34,548
Why?

155
00:25:36,750 --> 00:25:39,381
I was supposed
to wait for her outside.

156
00:25:39,750 --> 00:25:43,507
Maybe she was afraid that
her mom would see her with you.

157
00:25:45,750 --> 00:25:48,168
Is that why you went up?

158
00:25:48,792 --> 00:25:51,209
I waited but she didn't come out.

159
00:26:04,583 --> 00:26:07,298
No... this goes here.

160
00:26:09,792 --> 00:26:14,461
Dad, I need a new wheel for my bike.

161
00:26:26,292 --> 00:26:28,709
Don't, don't.

162
00:27:55,125 --> 00:27:57,922
And the money?

163
00:27:59,250 --> 00:28:03,208
Didn't you say it's ready?
Come pick it up?

164
00:28:03,958 --> 00:28:05,713
What's wrong with you, man?

165
00:28:05,875 --> 00:28:09,335
Do I have to tell you I don't have
more than 20 dinars in my account?

166
00:28:09,500 --> 00:28:13,672
If you are so in need,
why don't you take from Imad's savings?

167
00:28:13,833 --> 00:28:17,342
He's still young, and when you have
money again you put it back.

168
00:28:20,375 --> 00:28:23,919
So, why don't you
go back to the Gulf?

169
00:28:25,917 --> 00:28:29,460
When my mother was dying
and I wanted to come visit.

170
00:28:29,625 --> 00:28:34,211
My fucking employer wouldn't
give me my passport back.

171
00:28:34,375 --> 00:28:36,841
So I went to the police
and reported.

172
00:28:37,875 --> 00:28:43,251
They threw me in their jeep with criminals
and asked him to follow in his car!

173
00:28:45,125 --> 00:28:50,715
I stayed there waiting for
that motherfucker for half a day.

174
00:28:52,208 --> 00:28:54,128
And what was the response?

175
00:28:54,292 --> 00:28:56,757
Sort it out yourself"".

176
00:28:58,500 --> 00:29:01,676
Well, all you can do is play
and try your luck again.

177
00:29:01,958 --> 00:29:04,506
Luck? What luck?

178
00:29:05,875 --> 00:29:09,751
I lost two years of work in one night.

179
00:29:12,833 --> 00:29:16,543
Good thing I registered under
her name before I...

180
00:29:17,333 --> 00:29:21,505
The apartment she didn't like because
it didn't have the garden she wanted!

181
00:29:22,167 --> 00:29:26,552
By the way, does she still
rent it out fully furnished?

182
00:29:32,875 --> 00:29:34,676
I still don't get it, Fouad.

183
00:29:34,833 --> 00:29:37,417
You've got your family and a good job.

184
00:29:37,583 --> 00:29:40,298
You're supposed to be doing well.

185
00:29:42,250 --> 00:29:44,668
So why do you want to leave?

186
00:29:45,833 --> 00:29:48,678
Man, it's been three months
with no salary.

187
00:29:48,833 --> 00:29:51,417
And you say I'm doing well.

188
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:55,501
And the last time I asked
Jaber to pay me.

189
00:29:55,667 --> 00:29:59,506
He acted like a beggar with no money.

190
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:07,460
What's the story with this operation?

191
00:30:13,625 --> 00:30:17,133
Today, I felt this strong
pain come and go.

192
00:30:20,208 --> 00:30:22,342
It turns out I have a twisted testicle.

193
00:30:22,500 --> 00:30:24,834
So now I need surgery.

194
00:30:28,250 --> 00:30:31,047
The doctor say it's a simple procedure.

195
00:30:31,208 --> 00:30:34,882
It's going to take 15 minutes
and it's over.

196
00:30:37,875 --> 00:30:40,921
But I have a bad feeling about it.

197
00:30:42,208 --> 00:30:45,254
Man, the pain will go on its own.

198
00:30:47,042 --> 00:30:52,217
The thing is, the doctor says
if I don't do it before Friday

199
00:30:53,875 --> 00:30:57,004
it will get worse
and they might cut it off.

200
00:30:59,042 --> 00:31:04,043
So what... if they cut it off,
you still have the other one.

201
00:32:28,333 --> 00:32:31,545
Do you know which one is yours?

202
00:32:48,333 --> 00:32:49,590
Which apartment?

203
00:32:49,750 --> 00:32:51,753
Number 7.

204
00:33:01,042 --> 00:33:02,333
Do YOU pay the bill?

205
00:33:02,500 --> 00:33:04,005
I always pay-

206
00:33:06,458 --> 00:33:10,714
Seems some bastard stole your plug.

207
00:33:15,958 --> 00:33:20,011
I think I have one
at my place somewhere.

208
00:33:32,958 --> 00:33:36,134
If you're looking for a meter plug,

209
00:33:36,958 --> 00:33:40,881
there's an extra one...

210
00:33:53,292 --> 00:33:56,551
Do you know which meter is yours?

211
00:33:56,792 --> 00:33:58,178
Which apartment?

212
00:33:58,333 --> 00:34:01,296
Number 7.

213
00:34:09,167 --> 00:34:12,841

231
00:35:09,125 --> 00:35:11,922
Yusef, it's Jaber.

232
00:35:12,083 --> 00:35:14,584
I tried to call you but haven't
heard back yet.

233
00:35:15,208 --> 00:35:16,381
There's a deal.

234
00:35:16,542 --> 00:35:21,377
If you close it, you'll get 500 dinars
and not a penny more.

235
00:35:21,667 --> 00:35:24,428
The client will be waiting
at the showroom at 8.

236
00:35:24,625 --> 00:35:26,509
Don't be late.

237
00:37:01,292 --> 00:37:02,927
Yes, Mom.

238
00:37:05,167 --> 00:37:06,755
Studying-

239
00:37:09,583 --> 00:37:11,717
I don't know.

240
00:37:13,250 --> 00:37:14,885
I can't hear you.

241
00:37:18,333 --> 00:37:20,301
I can't hear you.

242
00:37:22,958 --> 00:37:26,134
Hush him up or go somewhere
else so I can hear.

243
00:37:28,750 --> 00:37:30,835
Yes, much better.

244
00:37:34,542 --> 00:37:37,303
I was alone, he wasn't home.

245
00:37:38,667 --> 00:37:40,919
He went to see a friend.

246
00:37:42,208 --> 00:37:44,591
Fouad, maybe.

247
00:37:48,958 --> 00:37:53,095
No, I'm not going to say anything.
He should know by himself.

248
00:37:53,625 --> 00:37:55,344
Don't say anything, OK?

249
00:38:06,542 --> 00:38:10,500
Thank you for making coffee.

250
00:38:11,375 --> 00:38:13,876
You still haven't finished the book?

251
00:38:14,042 --> 00:38:16,803
I have but I'm just reviewing.

252
00:38:36,417 --> 00:38:39,877
Where do they sell bike wheels?

253
00:38:40,042 --> 00:38:43,502
<i>...the Jordanian parliament

<i>of the former minister of tourism.</i>

264
00:39:26,125 --> 00:39:28,009
We've got two brands for this model.

265
00:39:28,167 --> 00:39:31,260
A Chinese one for 7 dinars,
and an Italian for 25 dinars.

266
00:39:31,417 --> 00:39:33,669
Unfortunately, we're out
of the Chinese one.

267
00:39:33,833 --> 00:39:36,796
Well, bring us the Italian. - Sure.

268
00:41:45,958 --> 00:41:50,924
Imad, I'm leaving the country.

269
00:41:59,417 --> 00:42:03,635
Dad, the school principle
wants to see you.

270
00:42:07,750 --> 00:42:11,922
What did you do? - Nothing.

271
00:42:13,667 --> 00:42:16,132
So what does he want?

272
00:42:16,292 --> 00:42:17,382
I don't know.

273
00:42:22,667 --> 00:42:25,594
Tell him I'm busy.

274
00:42:26,458 --> 00:42:31,175
He said that if he doesn't see you
he won't let me take the exam.

275
00:42:54,458 --> 00:42:58,381
Take the first right and then
the second street on your left.

276
00:49:10,792 --> 00:49:13,008
The electricity at my place got cut off.

277
00:49:13,167 --> 00:49:15,881
Can I charge my phone here?

278
00:49:34,542 --> 00:49:36,509
Don't look at your watch the client

279
00:49:36,667 --> 00:49:38,255
postponed the appointment.

280
00:49:38,417 --> 00:49:40,502
And you don't have a cell phone.

281
00:49:40,667 --> 00:49:43,168
You should know that
we've showed her the car already.

282
00:49:43,333 --> 00:49:45,301
But she's still not convinced.

283
00:49:45,458 --> 00:49:49,760
Be careful, she's got a dirty mouth
especially when it comes to men.

284
00:49:49,917 --> 00:49:51,422
Do you know her?

285
00:49:51,583 --> 00:49:53,302
She might become my mother-in-law.

286
00:49:53,458 --> 00:49:57,417
But don't mention it.
She doesn't know yet the showroom is ours.

287
00:49:58,375 --> 00:49:59,631
Why?

288
00:49:59,792 --> 00:50:03,003
I don't want her to get greedy.

289
00:50:04,083 --> 00:50:05,672
So which car does she want to buy.

290
00:50:05,833 --> 00:50:07,125
The Toyota Jeep.

291
00:50:07,292 --> 00:50:10,254
And which car would you like her to buy?
- The Range Rover.

292
00:50:11,042 --> 00:50:13,175
So how is this car?

293
00:50:14,375 --> 00:50:16,544
It's your call ma'am.

294
00:50:16,708 --> 00:50:20,797
But if you want to hear my honest opinion,
I recommend the Range Rover.

295
00:50:20,958 --> 00:50:22,250
Why's that?

296
00:50:22,417 --> 00:50:26,423
It's got more room,
it's true that it's two years older...

297
00:50:26,583 --> 00:50:30,293
but I guarantee you that in three years
you wouldn't have to change a single part.

298
00:50:30,458 --> 00:50:32,296
I want the Range.

299
00:50:33,542 --> 00:50:35,794
And how's this car when
it comes to steep roads.

300
00:50:35,958 --> 00:50:38,885
It's a fine.

301
00:50:39,042 --> 00:50:42,502
But the options the Range Rover has
are better for all roads.

302
00:50:42,667 --> 00:50:47,711
Whether you drive around town or outside,
off-road, hills, mountains.

303
00:50:49,167 --> 00:50:51,549
Slow down ma'am.

304
00:50:52,042 --> 00:50:54,720
Slowly. - Okay.

305
00:50:54,875 --> 00:50:58,715
By the way, the Range Rover
has lights on the outside mirrors.

306
00:50:58,875 --> 00:51:04,339
When a car gets too close
the lights turn red with an alarm tone.

307
00:51:05,375 --> 00:51:09,084
So you drive in full control and vision.

308
00:51:09,833 --> 00:51:14,669
Also ma'am, here you'd have buttons
to control almost everything in the car.

309
00:51:14,875 --> 00:51:20,671
Stereo levels, the dvd player,
speed and cruise control.

310
00:51:21,458 --> 00:51:24,220
Are you talking about this car
or the Range Rover?

311
00:51:24,375 --> 00:51:25,584
To be clear with you ma'am,

312
00:51:25,750 --> 00:51:27,718
that Range Rover was ordered specifically

313
00:51:27,875 --> 00:51:30,127
for a client that couldn't
fully pay its price.

314
00:51:30,292 --> 00:51:33,468
That's why it has all those
special additions

315
00:51:33,625 --> 00:51:36,303
that you won't find in any other car.

316
00:51:41,167 --> 00:51:43,798
Have you got any grandchildren ma'am.

317
00:51:43,958 --> 00:51:47,218
I'm sorry. The reason I asked was
to tell you about the special feature

318
00:51:47,375 --> 00:51:49,592
the Range Rover has that
no other car does.

319
00:51:49,750 --> 00:51:52,547
You can separate the front
seat from the back seat.

320
00:51:52,708 --> 00:51:56,003
With one click,
right from the steering over there.

321
00:51:56,167 --> 00:51:59,296
A glass barrier would appear here.

322
00:51:59,917 --> 00:52:03,211
You won't hear a single thing.

323
00:52:03,958 --> 00:52:07,419
And from over here ma'am
there's a sound recorder

324
00:52:07,583 --> 00:52:09,800
of whatever goes on in the back.

325
00:52:10,667 --> 00:52:14,969
Be careful ma'am... give me the phone.

326
00:52:30,792 --> 00:52:33,802
If you want to be with me
the way I want then fine...

327
00:52:33,958 --> 00:52:37,881
If not, stay at home with
your father the doctor.

328
00:52:43,958 --> 00:52:45,677
By the way ma'am, the mirror.

329
00:52:45,833 --> 00:52:49,342
When are you going to understand
that all men are the same?

330
00:52:49,708 --> 00:52:51,628
You just don't listen, do you?

331
00:52:51,792 --> 00:52:53,960
Now he wants you to do things his way.

332
00:52:54,333 --> 00:52:57,628
You've always been this stubborn.

333
00:52:57,792 --> 00:53:00,968
You deserve it...
Now he wants you to do things his way

334
00:53:01,125 --> 00:53:04,965
and if you want to stoop to
his level, it's your own fault.

335
00:53:05,125 --> 00:53:08,336
By the way, ma'am, the Range Rover
has a very special advantage.

336
00:53:08,500 --> 00:53:11,215
It's got this calm reaction,
you would hardly feel these

337
00:53:11,375 --> 00:53:13,094
small jumps we're feeling right now.

338
00:54:15,583 --> 00:54:19,839
Whose signature is this?

339
00:54:26,792 --> 00:54:31,793
When you don't go to school,
where do you go?

340
00:54:32,833 --> 00:54:36,128
I'm asking you.

341
00:54:39,375 --> 00:54:44,258
You were absent for 17 days.
Where do you go?

342
00:54:56,542 --> 00:54:58,627
Read.

343
00:55:11,750 --> 00:55:16,502
What's that? I can't hear you.

344
00:55:17,542 --> 00:55:20,043
She...

345
00:55:23,417 --> 00:55:27,968
makes the things...

346
00:57:50,542 --> 00:57:54,927
I'm sorry the cab broke down
and I couldn't give you a ride.

347
00:57:56,292 --> 00:57:59,551
Don't worry about it.

348
00:57:59,708 --> 00:58:02,968
I was having a bad day anyway.

349
00:58:03,125 --> 00:58:06,384
Why, what happened?

350
00:58:07,750 --> 00:58:09,835
My fianc�.

351
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:12,466
I've been trying for 3 months to tell him

352
00:58:12,625 --> 00:58:15,754
that it's not working out
and he's not getting it.

353
00:58:17,083 --> 00:58:20,841
Me too, I just got out
of a relationship that

354
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:24,709
has been suffocating me
for the past 5 years.

355
00:58:27,583 --> 00:58:30,713
Now seriously, isn't the engagement
period the time

356
00:58:30,875 --> 00:58:34,004
when you decide if someone
is right for you or not.

357
00:58:34,833 --> 00:58:37,381
Of course.

358
00:58:40,167 --> 00:58:42,086
I feel like there's something wrong.

359
00:58:42,250 --> 00:58:45,213
This isn't the person that
I want to spend my life with.

360
00:58:45,542 --> 00:58:46,751
Ever since we got engaged,

361
00:58:46,917 --> 00:58:50,211
I'm not allowed to go outwith
my girlfriends without his permission.

362
00:58:50,417 --> 00:58:56,302
I'm not allowed to talk to the neighbours
or even open the door if he isn't around.

363
00:58:57,833 --> 00:59:00,511
I'm sick of it.

364
00:59:07,167 --> 00:59:09,798
The best thing to do is to ignore him.

365
00:59:10,125 --> 00:59:12,342
Eventually he'll get it.

366
00:59:13,958 --> 00:59:15,049
I don't think so.

367
00:59:15,208 --> 00:59:18,254
I've been trying that for
the last 3 months.

368
00:59:28,458 --> 00:59:31,385
That's him knocking on the door.

369
00:59:32,792 --> 00:59:33,799
Who?

370
00:59:36,250 --> 00:59:37,376
My fianc�.

371
00:59:37,542 --> 00:59:40,339
Who else have I been talking about?

372
00:59:42,875 --> 00:59:45,506
What is he doing here?

373
00:59:45,667 --> 00:59:50,585
I told him a hundred times
not to come without calling first.

374
01:01:22,792 --> 01:01:27,710
Where is the extra electrical plug
you told me about?

375
01:04:23,792 --> 01:04:26,091
No, this is not Youssef.

376
01:04:26,250 --> 01:04:28,335
Who's this?

377
01:04:28,542 --> 01:04:32,844
Man, how many times did I tell you
not to give my number out?

378
01:04:33,000 --> 01:04:36,591
It's the accountant from the hospital.

379
01:04:37,458 --> 01:04:38,715
<i>Yes p</i>

380
01:04:39,917 --> 01:04:41,884
Yes, it's ready.

381
01:04:43,542 --> 01:04:46,836
Sorry for being a bit late.

382
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:50,299
So when does the cashier close?

383
01:04:51,375 --> 01:04:54,718
Don't worry, I'll be there before that.

384
01:04:56,583 --> 01:04:59,878
What do you mean I'll lose my appointment?

385
01:05:01,125 --> 01:05:04,918
I said I'll be there in a bit.

386
01:05:07,583 --> 01:05:11,293
Wow, you were able to get
500 Dinars that quickly!

387
01:05:12,167 --> 01:05:14,549
I sold a jeep for 120 thousand dinars.

388
01:05:14,750 --> 01:05:17,879
After it was sitting there
getting old for 6 months.

389
01:05:21,333 --> 01:05:24,296
I'm sure they'll take me back after this.

390
01:05:24,542 --> 01:05:26,710
I feel like things are getting better.

391
01:05:26,875 --> 01:05:28,676
I can feel it.

392
01:05:29,167 --> 01:05:30,589
That's good.

393
01:05:31,083 --> 01:05:33,466
How's Imad?

394
01:05:36,500 --> 01:05:39,215
Imad doesn't know how to read.

395
01:05:39,375 --> 01:05:43,713
So why don't you go see
Dalal and sort it out?

396
01:05:44,167 --> 01:05:49,381
Didn't you say a year ago that you
wouldn't really care if you see her.

397
01:05:51,208 --> 01:05:55,380
Or maybe you're afraid of getting weak
like you used to during college days.

398
01:05:56,917 --> 01:05:59,251
Enough man! It's been 5 years.

399
01:05:59,417 --> 01:06:01,633
After this surgery,
you should start a new life.

400
01:06:01,792 --> 01:06:04,126
Don't forget that you're still free.

401
01:06:04,292 --> 01:06:09,257
Unlike me. I've been married twice already
and not once did my heart skip a beat.

402
01:07:17,833 --> 01:07:20,879
Where have you been all this time?

403
01:07:21,042 --> 01:07:24,834
You don't want to buy a cell phone?

404
01:07:39,833 --> 01:07:42,927
Congratulations on the garden.

405
01:07:43,208 --> 01:07:46,503
It's really nice.

406
01:07:53,542 --> 01:07:58,009
Are you here to congratulate
me on the garden?

407
01:08:00,292 --> 01:08:05,257
No. I'm not here for that.

408
01:08:11,625 --> 01:08:14,173
Imad is...

409
01:08:30,167 --> 01:08:35,468
Yes, my love. No, he's still working
on it, but I told him.

410
01:08:37,625 --> 01:08:40,422

411

<i>No, no. Don't worry I'm ready.</i>

413

414
01:08:50,875 --> 01:08:52,713
<i>OK, bye.</i>

415
01:09:21,042 --> 01:09:24,087
Imad wants a dog for
his birthday this year.

416
01:09:25,000 --> 01:09:26,884
Do you want share the cost?

417
01:09:28,375 --> 01:09:30,544
How much is it?

418
01:09:31,250 --> 01:09:32,672
500 dinars.

419
01:09:32,833 --> 01:09:36,176
What kind of a dog costs 500 dinars?

420
01:09:38,458 --> 01:09:40,924
That's the price,
do you want to help or not?

421
01:09:48,917 --> 01:09:50,920
I don't have the money.

422
01:09:51,208 --> 01:09:52,548
Of course, you don't.

423
01:09:52,708 --> 01:09:55,386
Dalal, don't talk to me like that.

424
01:10:34,875 --> 01:10:38,632
Do you have the time to raise the boy?

425
01:10:47,708 --> 01:10:49,628
Are you coming here
to place blame?

426
01:10:50,208 --> 01:10:52,294
Your son has failed 6 subjects.

427
01:10:52,458 --> 01:10:56,168
How many times have I said we should
put him in a private school...

428
01:10:56,333 --> 01:10:57,969
I've told you a thousand times,

429
01:10:58,125 --> 01:11:00,840
a stranger is not paying
for my son! Understood?

430
01:11:14,208 --> 01:11:17,717
As you like, you are free to decide.

431
01:11:21,208 --> 01:11:24,420
But if I ever hear that you took Imad

432
01:11:24,583 --> 01:11:28,044
to a single one of your poker games...

433
01:11:28,208 --> 01:11:31,089
it will be the last time you see him.

434
01:11:31,500 --> 01:11:36,300
Dalal, have you forgotten
how I bought you the apartment?

435
01:11:36,458 --> 01:11:39,006
And have you forgotten
how you lost everything?

436
01:11:39,167 --> 01:11:42,876
Dalal, I didn't come here
to get upset and fight.

437
01:11:45,208 --> 01:11:47,543
And I'm not here to blame anyone.

438
01:11:47,708 --> 01:11:52,592
My only concern now is my son's future.

439
01:12:04,458 --> 01:12:07,883
Are you okay? - It's nothing.

440
01:12:16,583 --> 01:12:19,298
What's this?

441
01:12:21,417 --> 01:12:26,086
This is the money I've been
saving for his university.

442
01:12:34,792 --> 01:12:38,300
Youssef, what's wrong? Sit down.

443
01:12:44,333 --> 01:12:46,834
Do you need a doctor? - No I don't

444
01:12:47,250 --> 01:12:48,720
No need.

445
01:12:49,625 --> 01:12:52,505
Tomorrow, I have a small surgery.

446
01:12:52,667 --> 01:12:56,045
Why didn't you say anything?

447
01:12:58,958 --> 01:13:02,585
Put him in a private school nearby.

448
01:13:03,792 --> 01:13:08,378
With the money left,
hire a private teacher.

449
01:13:09,458 --> 01:13:12,836
To teach him how to read
so he can go to high school.

450
01:14:46,667 --> 01:14:47,923
Here is 200 dinars.

451
01:14:48,083 --> 01:14:50,584
And these are the 300 dinars
of fines from last year.

00:16:32,259 --> 00:16:34,294
You're not in physical pain
anymore.

380
00:16:34,361 --> 00:16:36,396
Have you been doing
the tapping thing

381
00:16:36,463 --> 00:16:37,932
that that one shrink
taught you?

382
00:16:37,998 --> 00:16:40,100
Remember?
For anxiety and stress,

383
00:16:40,167 --> 00:16:41,970
and it calms you down
on the...

384
00:16:42,035 --> 00:16:43,705
-eyes, and then the lips.
-Mom!

385
00:16:43,771 --> 00:16:45,372
[Diane] Or play your piano.
That always cheers you up.

386
00:16:45,439 --> 00:16:47,140
I don't wanna talk
about this, please.

387
00:16:47,207 --> 00:16:49,409
I have the worst headache!
Can you just stop?

388
00:16:49,476 --> 00:16:52,346
Can you call the doctors
and help me, please?

389
00:16:52,412 --> 00:16:54,181
Which one? Patel?
He said no more.

390
00:16:54,248 --> 00:16:56,651
Okay, well, fuck Patel.
Fuck Patel!

391
00:16:56,718 --> 00:16:58,485
How about Goldberg, or...

392
00:16:58,553 --> 00:17:00,187
or Fong?

393
00:17:00,254 --> 00:17:01,890
-Allie...
-Please, Mom.

394
00:17:01,956 --> 00:17:03,357
-Just call 'em. Just help me.
-You're being a little...

395
00:17:03,423 --> 00:17:04,926
-No.
-Just help me, please.

396
00:17:04,993 --> 00:17:06,159
Guess what?
They all said ""no.""

397
00:17:06,226 --> 00:17:08,061
Patel. Goldberg.
Fong. Rosenberg.

398
00:17:08,128 --> 00:17:09,998
Okay, well, I'll try Vromen.
He loves me.

399
00:17:10,063 --> 00:17:11,933
Vromen is an orthodontist.

400
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,601
Yeah, but he used to
flirt with me

401
00:17:13,668 --> 00:17:15,637
when his fingers were really
deep inside my mouth,

402
00:17:15,703 --> 00:17:18,006
and it was very inappropriate,
and so, he really owes me one.

403
00:17:18,071 --> 00:17:19,908
Allie, I don't like
how you're acting.

404
00:17:19,974 --> 00:17:21,308
You know what?
Enough is enough.

405
00:17:21,375 --> 00:17:22,911
You gotta get out
of this living room,

406
00:17:22,977 --> 00:17:24,378
take off your pajamas,

407
00:17:24,444 --> 00:17:26,280
and get your ass,
and go get a job.

408
00:17:26,346 --> 00:17:27,615
I'm sick of this crap.

409
00:17:27,682 --> 00:17:29,684
As if you have any right

410
00:17:29,751 --> 00:17:31,953
lecturing me
on medicating myself.

411
00:17:32,020 --> 00:17:33,588
What is that supposed to mean?

412
00:17:33,655 --> 00:17:36,390
It means, Mom, you're such
a fucking hypocrite!

413
00:17:36,456 --> 00:17:39,259
You don't think that I clock
how many Xanax you take?

414
00:17:39,326 --> 00:17:41,395
Or how many glasses of wine
you drink?

415
00:17:41,461 --> 00:17:43,397
You think I'm just a zombie
that doesn't notice anything,

416
00:17:43,463 --> 00:17:46,166
but I notice
fucking everything! I see you.

417
00:17:46,233 --> 00:17:49,604
So, can I have my pills,
please?

418
00:17:49,671 --> 00:17:52,040
You're not listening.
There's no more.

419
00:17:52,105 --> 00:17:53,675
[breathes heavily]

420
00:17:59,246 --> 00:18:01,148
[Diane] You get
right back here,

421
00:18:01,214 --> 00:18:02,717
-you little brat!
-No!

422
00:18:02,784 --> 00:18:05,185
What in the hell do you think
you are doing?

423
00:18:05,252 --> 00:18:06,721
Get out of there!

424
00:18:06,788 --> 00:18:08,155
-Get out of there!
-[Allison] Get off me!

425
00:18:08,221 --> 00:18:09,824
-No! Get out of there!
-Let go!

426
00:18:09,891 --> 00:18:11,693
-[Diane] What are you doing?
-No! Are they in here?

427
00:18:11,759 --> 00:18:14,161
-[Diane] Get back! Cut it out!
-You are hurting me!

428
00:18:14,227 --> 00:18:15,563
[Diane] Stop it!

429
00:18:15,630 --> 00:18:17,497
-Stop it! Put that back!
-[grunts] Mom!

430
00:18:18,566 --> 00:18:19,466
No.

431
00:18:19,534 --> 00:18:21,201
-Open the door.
-No.

432
00:18:21,268 --> 00:18:22,369

-Stop it! Stop it.

-No.

-Give me those... Ow.

-[Diane] Ow! Ow, ow, ow, ow.

438

No, no, no, no, no, no.

442
00:18:40,287 --> 00:18:42,456
Mama, no! Please. No!

443
00:18:44,391 --> 00:18:46,594
Why the fuck did you do that?

444
00:18:46,661 --> 00:18:47,729
I'm in pain!

445
00:18:47,795 --> 00:18:49,097
I don't give a shit!

446
00:18:49,162 --> 00:18:50,230
Your daughter
is in actual pain!

447
00:18:50,297 --> 00:18:51,566
I don't give a shit!

448
00:18:51,633 --> 00:18:55,235

-ALLISON: Leave me alone.
-You come back here.

453
00:19:04,478 --> 00:19:05,445
-ALLISON: Leave me alone.
-I'm gonna grab your...

454

[arguing continues]

455
00:19:06,981 --> 00:19:08,549
[Allison]
Leave me the fuck alone!

456
00:19:08,616 --> 00:19:09,917
[Diane] I'm not gonna leave you
the fuck alone,

457
00:19:09,984 --> 00:19:10,918
-you little brat.
-Ugh!

[mellow music playing]

459
00:19:15,790 --> 00:19:17,324

-[Diane] Where are you going?

461
00:19:19,226 --> 00:19:21,294
Leave me alone!

Fuck! [sighs]

468
00:19:45,753 --> 00:19:47,487
So you're the Ryan
that's been talking to Damien?

469
00:19:47,555 --> 00:19:49,157
Get the fuck outta my face.

470
00:19:49,222 --> 00:19:50,658
See, you talk to people
like that, bitch,

471
00:19:50,725 --> 00:19:52,225
that's why you have
no fucking friends.

472
00:19:52,292 --> 00:19:53,628
Why are you
hitting on me, huh?

473
00:19:53,695 --> 00:19:55,328
Uh, I'm not the one
named ""Ryan.""

474
00:19:55,395 --> 00:19:57,165
It's a fucking dyke's name.
You a dyke?

475
00:19:57,230 --> 00:19:58,966
-Only when I fuck your mother.
-Oh, at least I have a mother.

476
00:20:02,335 --> 00:20:03,971
What the fuck
did you just say to me?

477
00:20:04,772 --> 00:20:06,206
Hey!

478
00:20:06,273 --> 00:20:09,409
Stay away from Damien,
you fucking whore.

479
00:20:10,178 --> 00:20:11,179
Hey!

480
00:20:11,244 --> 00:20:13,147

You're both out. Red card.

486
00:20:22,590 --> 00:20:24,058
[Daniel] Ryan,
what the hell was that?

487
00:20:24,125 --> 00:20:25,593
[huffs] I quit.

488
00:20:25,660 --> 00:20:27,662
[tearfully] I quit.
I hate this fucking game.

489
00:20:27,729 --> 00:20:29,897
Why? Because you got
in a fight?

490
00:20:29,964 --> 00:20:31,733
Come on, that's not you.

491
00:20:31,799 --> 00:20:34,068
You're tough.
You're not a quitter.

492
00:20:34,135 --> 00:20:37,105
-She made fun of Mom.
-What?

493
00:20:37,171 --> 00:20:39,473
She said,
""At least I have a mom.""

494
00:20:42,110 --> 00:20:43,745
Well, fuck her.

495
00:20:47,314 --> 00:20:48,583
Well...

496
00:20:49,650 --> 00:20:52,186
And what kind of a punch
was that?

497
00:20:52,252 --> 00:20:54,222
You throw this hard right hook

498
00:20:54,287 --> 00:20:57,357
and then you leave yourself
wide open for the jab.

499
00:20:58,226 --> 00:20:59,961
We're gonna have to work
on that.

Hi.

503
00:21:18,980 --> 00:21:21,314
I'm here to get
a prescription refilled.

Last name, Johnson.
Birthday, August 24th.

505
00:21:24,252 --> 00:21:26,154
Okay. For which medication?

506
00:21:26,220 --> 00:21:29,257
Uh... The Oxy. OxyContin.

507
00:21:29,322 --> 00:21:31,391
It says here
you are out of refills.

508
00:21:31,458 --> 00:21:33,861
I see you've been on them
for over a year now.

509
00:21:33,928 --> 00:21:35,963
Your doctor's probably trying
to wean you off of them.

510
00:21:36,030 --> 00:21:38,465
As I'm sure you know,
they can be very addictive.

511
00:21:38,533 --> 00:21:40,601
Oh, really?
I hadn't fucking heard that.

512
00:21:42,302 --> 00:21:43,370
Sorry.

513
00:21:43,436 --> 00:21:45,405
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

What? No.

Let me go get you a bandage.

522
00:22:02,455 --> 00:22:04,457
I don't need
a fucking bandage. It's fine.

523
00:22:08,461 --> 00:22:09,730
Then take this.

524
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:14,735
Oh, my goodness.
Thank you so much. Thank you.

525

00:24:32,573 --> 00:24:34,976
I, uh, got a new gal.

554
00:24:35,042 --> 00:24:37,845
Well, I gotta get her number.
[laughs]

555
00:24:37,912 --> 00:24:39,146
Okay.

556
00:24:39,213 --> 00:24:41,949
Oh, I was so happy
that you reached out.

557
00:24:42,016 --> 00:24:44,919
Because you weren't responding
to any of my texts.

558
00:24:44,986 --> 00:24:47,021
Of course, I wanted
to give you your space,

559
00:24:47,088 --> 00:24:48,589
but I was worried.

560
00:24:48,656 --> 00:24:50,157
-[waiter] Hi, good morning.
-Hey!

561
00:24:50,224 --> 00:24:51,625
Can I get you anything?

562
00:24:51,692 --> 00:24:54,562
Uh, yeah. Can I please get
a Jack and Coke?

563
00:24:54,996 --> 00:24:56,731
Uh...

564
00:24:56,797 --> 00:24:59,300
Sorry, our bar doesn't
actually open until 11:00.

565
00:24:59,367 --> 00:25:00,868
Oh.

566
00:25:00,935 --> 00:25:03,938
Uh, okay. In that case,
I'll get a black coffee.

567
00:25:04,005 --> 00:25:06,007
-Oat milk latte.
-You got it.

568
00:25:09,243 --> 00:25:11,545
So, how's, how's work?

569
00:25:11,612 --> 00:25:12,847
You're still at Purdue, right?

570
00:25:12,913 --> 00:25:14,548
-Still repping Purdue.
-Yeah.

571
00:25:14,615 --> 00:25:16,117
You'd think it would've been
a shit show

572
00:25:16,183 --> 00:25:17,585
because of the bankruptcy
and all the lawsuits.

573
00:25:17,651 --> 00:25:19,420
-Mm.
-But, between you and me,

574
00:25:19,487 --> 00:25:21,288
my numbers
have actually increased.

575
00:25:21,355 --> 00:25:22,690
Wow.

576
00:25:22,757 --> 00:25:25,793
My bonus last quarter
was insane.

577
00:25:25,860 --> 00:25:28,129
-It sells itself. [chuckles]
-Yeah.

578
00:25:28,195 --> 00:25:29,397
Karl Marx was wrong.

579
00:25:29,463 --> 00:25:31,432
Turns out
the opiate of the masses

580
00:25:31,499 --> 00:25:32,501
is opium.

581
00:25:32,566 --> 00:25:34,568
[both chuckle]

582
00:25:37,304 --> 00:25:38,439
Anyway.

583
00:25:38,507 --> 00:25:39,740
How are you doing?

584
00:25:39,807 --> 00:25:41,442
When are you going back
to work?

585
00:25:41,510 --> 00:25:42,676
[smacks lips] Listen,
I'm just gonna cut right to it

586
00:25:42,743 --> 00:25:44,011
because you're my friend

587
00:25:44,078 --> 00:25:45,613
and I know
you're gonna understand.

588
00:25:45,679 --> 00:25:46,981
Um...

589
00:25:47,882 --> 00:25:50,551
I'm still in a lot of pain.

590
00:25:50,618 --> 00:25:52,153
Oh, Allie...

591
00:25:52,219 --> 00:25:56,057
I know, and my docs
are cutting my Oxy scripts

592
00:25:56,123 --> 00:25:58,492
because everyone's
really freaked out

593
00:25:58,559 --> 00:26:00,061
about addiction these days.

594
00:26:00,127 --> 00:26:01,729
Uh... [hesitates]

595
00:26:01,796 --> 00:26:04,298
So, I was wondering
if it would be possible...

596
00:26:04,365 --> 00:26:06,200
Allie, please tell me
you didn't invite me

597
00:26:06,267 --> 00:26:08,836
to breakfast
to hit me up for pills.

598
00:26:09,236 --> 00:26:10,404
No.

599
00:26:10,471 --> 00:26:12,006
-No, no, no, no, no.
-[sighs]

600
00:26:12,073 --> 00:26:14,408
It's just until I can get in,
and see my docs.

601
00:26:14,475 --> 00:26:16,343
Um, because my fucking mother,

602
00:26:16,410 --> 00:26:19,613
she threw my last refill
into the toilet, so...

603
00:26:20,114 --> 00:26:21,248
No way.

604
00:26:21,315 --> 00:26:23,150
Are you fucking
with me right now?

605
00:26:23,217 --> 00:26:24,785
No.

606
00:26:24,852 --> 00:26:26,555
If you have a problem,
you need to get some help.

607
00:26:26,654 --> 00:26:28,889
I can help you
find the right rehab.

608
00:26:28,956 --> 00:26:31,125
Please don't hand me
a pamphlet.

609
00:26:31,192 --> 00:26:32,793
I already have one.

610
00:26:32,860 --> 00:26:34,795
Well, then find them
on the street if you have to.

611
00:26:34,862 --> 00:26:36,831
Every dive bar
in this town's got a guy

612
00:26:36,897 --> 00:26:39,166
with a pharmacy
in his front pocket.

613
00:26:39,233 --> 00:26:41,102
You know, Becka,

614
00:26:42,103 --> 00:26:44,371
I really didn't want
to do this.

615
00:26:46,207 --> 00:26:47,274
But...

616
00:26:49,009 --> 00:26:50,644
there's a handful of things

617
00:26:50,711 --> 00:26:53,781
that happened
at your bachelorette party

618
00:26:53,848 --> 00:26:57,251
that I'm pretty sure
you want to be kept private.

619
00:26:57,318 --> 00:27:00,988
Allison, are you trying
to blackmail me for OxyContin?

620
00:27:01,055 --> 00:27:03,057
I'm just asking you for help.

621
00:27:03,958 --> 00:27:06,327
Like, as a friend.

622
00:27:07,995 --> 00:27:10,331
But you did blow that dancer.
[chuckles]

623
00:27:11,298 --> 00:27:12,766
It happened for a second.

624
00:27:12,833 --> 00:27:15,836
I know, I know.
But you did it, and I saw.

625
00:27:16,637 --> 00:27:17,671
It never went in my mouth.

626
00:27:17,738 --> 00:27:19,406
It was in your mouth.

627
00:27:19,473 --> 00:27:21,308
It was in your mouth.

628
00:27:21,375 --> 00:27:22,776
Past the tip.

629
00:27:23,545 --> 00:27:26,147
Past the fucking tip.

630
00:27:26,947 --> 00:27:28,682
Allie, you need help.

631
00:27:29,683 --> 00:27:31,152
Destroy my life
if you have to.

632
00:27:31,218 --> 00:27:34,788
But for the love of God,
get some fucking help!

633
00:27:34,855 --> 00:27:36,357
Okay, bye.
Fuck you.

634
00:27:36,423 --> 00:27:37,958
Fuck you!

635
00:27:42,663 --> 00:27:43,731
[grunts]

636
00:27:43,797 --> 00:27:46,100
Uh... I don't...
Oh, fuck.

637
00:27:46,167 --> 00:27:48,202
[sighs]

638
00:27:48,269 --> 00:27:49,970
I don't have any money.
I'm really sorry.

639
00:27:50,037 --> 00:27:51,472
I can't pay for those.

640
00:27:51,540 --> 00:27:53,841
That's okay. Take it.

641
00:27:53,908 --> 00:27:56,010
I mixed in a little tequila
for you.

642
00:28:00,515 --> 00:28:01,916
[slurps]

643
00:28:04,485 --> 00:28:05,986
That's disgusting.

644
00:28:07,388 --> 00:28:08,389
Thank you.

645
00:28:11,258 --> 00:28:14,061
[woman] <i>Mr. Adams,</i>
<i>we really wanna do</i>

646
00:28:14,128 --> 00:28:16,430
<i>everything we can</i>
<i>to help Ryan.</i>

647
00:28:18,465 --> 00:28:20,301
But she needs to take
some responsibility

648
00:28:20,367 --> 00:28:22,102
for her behavior.

649
00:28:22,169 --> 00:28:25,406
That girl does not listen
to a thing I say.

650
00:28:26,941 --> 00:28:28,375
To be honest,

651
00:28:28,442 --> 00:28:30,077
I was hoping
you were calling me in here

652
00:28:30,144 --> 00:28:32,079
to give me some advice.

653
00:28:33,682 --> 00:28:35,282
I need help.

654
00:28:35,349 --> 00:28:37,284
[man] It's just that
we're a public school.

655
00:28:37,351 --> 00:28:40,421
We have 2,000 kids
to look after.

656
00:28:40,487 --> 00:28:42,156
We don't have the bandwidth

657
00:28:42,223 --> 00:28:44,626
to micromanage her in ways
that she deserves and needs.

658
00:28:44,693 --> 00:28:46,427
So, what are you saying?

659
00:28:47,662 --> 00:28:48,963
I will give her
an extra strike

660
00:28:49,029 --> 00:28:51,298
because of the circumstances.

661
00:28:51,365 --> 00:28:53,234
But if she doesn't tone down
her language

662
00:28:53,300 --> 00:28:54,768
with her teachers

663
00:28:54,835 --> 00:28:56,904
and gets into one more fight,

664
00:28:57,672 --> 00:28:59,139
we'll have to expel her.

665
00:29:18,359 --> 00:29:19,493
[chair scraps]

666
00:29:20,761 --> 00:29:23,764
Hi, can I get
a double tequila, please?

667
00:29:31,539 --> 00:29:32,540
Allison.

668
00:29:33,508 --> 00:29:35,776
Yo, I know you.

669
00:29:36,711 --> 00:29:37,911
It's Mark.

670
00:29:38,680 --> 00:29:39,748
Yeah, hey.

671
00:29:39,813 --> 00:29:41,482
Yeah.

672
00:29:41,549 --> 00:29:44,184
I haven't seen you
since high school.

673
00:29:44,251 --> 00:29:46,755
This is Diego.
You remember Diego?

674
00:29:46,820 --> 00:29:48,122
-Hey.
-[Diego] Hey.

675
00:29:49,223 --> 00:29:50,759
You just having
a little breakfast?

676
00:29:50,824 --> 00:29:53,827
Uh... Um... I just...

677
00:29:55,095 --> 00:29:56,997
I just needed
to get out of the house.

678
00:29:57,064 --> 00:29:59,066
[chuckles] Yeah, I feel that.

679
00:29:59,133 --> 00:30:01,435
I heard what happened to you.
The accident.

680
00:30:01,503 --> 00:30:02,771
Saw it in the <i>Star Ledger.</i>
Sorry.

681
00:30:02,836 --> 00:30:04,371
What happened?

682
00:30:04,438 --> 00:30:05,472
[Diego] She was in that
accident on the turnpike.

683
00:30:05,540 --> 00:30:06,940
Two people died.

684
00:30:07,007 --> 00:30:08,842
Holy shit.

685
00:30:09,644 --> 00:30:11,178
That was you.

686
00:30:12,146 --> 00:30:13,914
Oh, bro.

687
00:30:13,981 --> 00:30:15,883
That would've fucked me up.

688
00:30:15,949 --> 00:30:17,318
It wasn't my fault.

689
00:30:17,384 --> 00:30:19,987
Yeah, I'm sure.
But, like, still...

690
00:30:25,660 --> 00:30:26,860
[Mark] Damn.

691
00:30:29,798 --> 00:30:33,200
[exhales sharply] Hey, can I
have another one, please?

692
00:30:34,234 --> 00:30:35,570
You having a tough day?

693
00:30:36,771 --> 00:30:38,238
Just a day.

694
00:30:39,541 --> 00:30:41,776
I just wanna get as far away
from here as possible.

695
00:30:41,842 --> 00:30:43,110
Yo, there's this app,

696
00:30:43,177 --> 00:30:44,345
it tells you
the exact opposite

697
00:30:44,411 --> 00:30:46,280
of where you are
on the globe is.

698
00:30:46,347 --> 00:30:48,349
That's where you should go.
I'll look it up for you.

699
00:30:48,415 --> 00:30:51,018
[Mark] Yo, that's how I feel
every fuckin' day of my life.

700
00:30:51,085 --> 00:30:53,354
I can't seem to escape
this town.

701
00:30:53,420 --> 00:30:55,289
It's like there's
a force field around it

702
00:30:55,356 --> 00:30:56,658
or something.

703
00:30:56,725 --> 00:30:59,561
Like, some people know
how to get outta here.

704
00:30:59,627 --> 00:31:01,261
But the rest of us,

705
00:31:01,328 --> 00:31:02,797
we just keep banging our heads
up against the glass.

706
00:31:02,863 --> 00:31:04,932
It's Perth. That's the city

707
00:31:04,998 --> 00:31:06,835
on the other side of the globe
from here.

708
00:31:06,900 --> 00:31:08,503
You should go to Perth.

709
00:31:08,570 --> 00:31:11,372
I don't have enough money
to get to Perth,

710
00:31:11,438 --> 00:31:12,774
but thank you.

711
00:31:12,841 --> 00:31:14,975
Aren't you engaged
to Nathan Adams?

712
00:31:15,943 --> 00:31:17,679
I was, yeah.

713
00:31:17,746 --> 00:31:20,314
He was an amazing running back
in high school.

714
00:31:20,381 --> 00:31:21,915
He used to run
every fucking play.

715
00:31:21,982 --> 00:31:23,083
-You remember him, Mark?
-[Mark] Yeah.

716
00:31:23,150 --> 00:31:24,485
[Diego] Every fucking play,

717
00:31:24,552 --> 00:31:25,986
they'd come
on the PA system like,

718
00:31:26,053 --> 00:31:27,354
""Nathan Adams,
the ball carrier.

719
00:31:27,421 --> 00:31:29,289
""Nathan Adams,
the ball carrier.""

720
00:31:29,356 --> 00:31:31,024
He was the whole fucking team.
You remember him, Mark?

721
00:31:31,091 --> 00:31:32,926
Yeah, I remember him.

722
00:31:32,993 --> 00:31:34,361
Isn't he deaf?

723
00:31:34,428 --> 00:31:37,898
Uh... In one ear. Since birth.

724
00:31:37,965 --> 00:31:39,466
Wow, that's impressive

725
00:31:39,534 --> 00:31:40,835
that he could be, like,
that good, you know?

726
00:31:40,901 --> 00:31:42,537
And half deaf.

727
00:31:42,604 --> 00:31:44,037
So you're, like, single?

728
00:31:44,104 --> 00:31:46,641
[Mark chuckles] Yo.
Shut the fuck up, Diego.

729
00:31:46,708 --> 00:31:49,176
What? You think
she's gonna date you?

730
00:31:49,243 --> 00:31:50,944
Where are you gonna take her?
You live with your mom.

731
00:31:51,011 --> 00:31:53,815
[chuckles] God damn.

732
00:31:53,882 --> 00:31:55,215
Allison, I'm sorry.

733
00:31:55,282 --> 00:31:58,051
My fucking friend
has no tact at all.

734
00:31:58,118 --> 00:32:00,622
[chuckles]
We're not used to having

735
00:32:00,688 --> 00:32:03,558
pretty girls such as yourself
come in here.

736
00:32:03,625 --> 00:32:05,359
So, you gotta excuse his

737
00:32:05,426 --> 00:32:07,194
lack of decor.

738
00:32:09,396 --> 00:32:10,565
Decorum.

739
00:32:11,432 --> 00:32:12,499
What?

740
00:32:13,601 --> 00:32:15,804
""Decor"" is

741
00:32:15,870 --> 00:32:20,107
the Bud Light lamp
above my head.

742
00:32:20,974 --> 00:32:23,678
""Decorum"" is his behavior.

743
00:32:25,179 --> 00:32:27,615
Neither is currently ideal.

744
00:32:28,883 --> 00:32:31,151
[men cheering]

745
00:32:32,186 --> 00:32:34,254
Hey, can I ask you
something, like,

746
00:32:35,122 --> 00:32:36,658
between us old friends?

747
00:32:36,724 --> 00:32:39,059
You weren't our friend.
You were popular.

748
00:32:39,126 --> 00:32:41,428
-You were a bitch, actually.
-All right. Diego.

749
00:32:43,030 --> 00:32:45,834
That's old shit.
Right, Allison?

750
00:32:45,900 --> 00:32:48,202
We're past that.
We're grown-ups.

751
00:32:48,268 --> 00:32:51,138
Those of us stuck behind
this force field,

752
00:32:51,205 --> 00:32:54,107
-we gotta stick together.
-[Allison] Yeah.

753
00:32:54,174 --> 00:32:58,278
Um, do you know
where I could get some Oxy?

754
00:32:58,345 --> 00:32:59,914
[chuckling] God damn, girl.

755
00:32:59,980 --> 00:33:02,049
No foreplay. No nothing.

756
00:33:02,115 --> 00:33:05,219
No ""How are you?
How's your family?""

757
00:33:05,285 --> 00:33:07,020
No, we don't fuck with pills.

758
00:33:07,755 --> 00:33:08,989
I remember in high school

759
00:33:09,056 --> 00:33:11,091
you were the guys
that could, like,

760
00:33:11,793 --> 00:33:13,093
get anything.

761
00:33:13,160 --> 00:33:15,162
And now you're just
buttering us up.

762
00:33:16,430 --> 00:33:18,465
I don't have any money.

763
00:33:18,533 --> 00:33:21,034
How are you gonna pay
for that tequila?

764
00:33:21,101 --> 00:33:23,571
I hadn't got that far yet.
[sighs]

765
00:33:23,638 --> 00:33:25,740
-Is that Rolex real?
-Wait a second.

766
00:33:26,641 --> 00:33:28,275
Wait. Allie Johnson.

767
00:33:28,342 --> 00:33:31,478
Miss lovely Allie Johnson.
[grunts]

768
00:33:32,379 --> 00:33:34,448
You just stroll in here.

769
00:33:34,516 --> 00:33:36,383
[chuckling] You got no money.

770
00:33:36,450 --> 00:33:38,786
And you expect us
to get you Oxy?

771
00:33:38,853 --> 00:33:41,756
For free, and then you want us
to pay for your drink.

772
00:33:43,190 --> 00:33:44,759
Why the fuck would we do that?

773
00:33:46,126 --> 00:33:47,695
Nostalgia?

774
00:33:48,730 --> 00:33:50,330
Old friends?

775
00:33:50,397 --> 00:33:51,833
You thought you were
such hot shit in high school.

776
00:33:51,900 --> 00:33:52,901
You're no
fucking different now.

777
00:33:52,967 --> 00:33:54,502
All right. Shut up.

778
00:33:54,969 --> 00:33:56,136
Sorry.

779
00:33:56,203 --> 00:33:59,607
This guy. No decorum.

780
00:33:59,674 --> 00:34:00,775
No, he's right.

781
00:34:02,242 --> 00:34:04,746
I didn't think I was better
than you. I knew it.

782
00:34:05,680 --> 00:34:07,515
I looked down
on guys like you.

783
00:34:08,917 --> 00:34:11,586
I thought
you were Jersey trash

784
00:34:11,653 --> 00:34:14,522
that would never be able
to make it out of town.

785
00:34:15,289 --> 00:34:17,090
[snorts, laughs]

786
00:34:17,792 --> 00:34:19,192
Fucking bitch.

787
00:34:19,259 --> 00:34:21,295
But now you're sitting here

788
00:34:21,896 --> 00:34:23,363
right beside us

789
00:34:23,430 --> 00:34:26,099
and you're looking for a fix.

790
00:34:26,166 --> 00:34:27,735
A favor.

791
00:34:27,802 --> 00:34:30,170
The favor is a fix.

792
00:34:31,405 --> 00:34:33,575
-You're a fucking junkie now.
-No, I'm not.

793
00:34:33,641 --> 00:34:35,643
-You're a fucking junkie.
-No.

794
00:34:35,710 --> 00:34:37,077
-[Mark] Yeah, you are.
-Yeah, you are.

795
00:34:37,144 --> 00:34:38,245
Come on.
You're a fuckin' junkie.

796
00:34:38,312 --> 00:34:39,681
No. I'm not like you.

797
00:34:39,747 --> 00:34:41,214
Allie Johnson,

798
00:34:41,281 --> 00:34:43,350
you're so much more
like who you think we are

799
00:34:43,417 --> 00:34:45,218
than we actually are.

800
00:34:46,688 --> 00:34:49,189
Come on.
Say it, say it, say it.

801
00:34:49,256 --> 00:34:51,025
""I'm a fucking junkie.""
You might like it.

802
00:34:51,091 --> 00:34:52,627
Fuck you. It's a pill.

803
00:34:52,694 --> 00:34:55,997
It's heroin
in a pretty little dress.

804
00:34:56,064 --> 00:34:57,765
I thought you were
the nice one.

805
00:34:59,067 --> 00:35:01,736
Why don't you say it?
Say... Say,

806
00:35:02,469 --> 00:35:04,739
""I'm a fucking junkie,""

807
00:35:04,806 --> 00:35:07,609
and then I'll get you whatever
you want. Anything.

808
00:35:08,810 --> 00:35:12,212
Say it. Just, like,
just come out with it.

809
00:35:12,279 --> 00:35:13,615
I'm currently reliant...

810
00:35:13,681 --> 00:35:16,784
No, that's not
what I fucking said.

811
00:35:16,851 --> 00:35:19,654
You sneaky little bitch.
That's not what I fucking said.

812
00:35:19,721 --> 00:35:21,089
-Is that what I said?
-No.

813
00:35:21,188 --> 00:35:23,190
That is not what I said.

814
00:35:24,659 --> 00:35:27,227
Say you're a fuckin' junkie.
Look at me.

815
00:35:27,294 --> 00:35:28,596
Look at me!

816
00:35:29,429 --> 00:35:32,232
Look me in the eyes, and say,

817
00:35:32,299 --> 00:35:35,603
""I'm a fucking junkie.""

818
00:35:35,670 --> 00:35:37,137
Say it!

819
00:35:41,042 --> 00:35:42,777
I'm a fucking junkie.

820
00:35:46,914 --> 00:35:48,181
Good girl.

821
00:35:50,384 --> 00:35:51,919
Beth, I got these tequilas.

822
00:35:53,186 --> 00:35:55,422
I'm sorry
for raising my voice.

823
00:35:55,489 --> 00:35:56,758
We're just catching up.

824
00:35:57,457 --> 00:35:58,960
Allie, this is Beth.

825
00:35:59,027 --> 00:36:00,995
She's divine. She's the best.

826
00:36:01,062 --> 00:36:03,397
[soft music playing]

827
00:36:08,335 --> 00:36:09,804
That's not Oxy.

828
00:36:10,605 --> 00:36:11,773
Same shit.

829
00:36:24,786 --> 00:36:26,821
[coughs hoarsely]

830
00:36:27,722 --> 00:36:28,723
[inhales sharply]

831
00:36:30,958 --> 00:36:32,060
[exhales]

832
00:36:32,126 --> 00:36:34,327
[breathing heavily]

833
00:36:37,131 --> 00:36:38,700
[vomits]

834
00:36:38,766 --> 00:36:40,333
[groaning]

835
00:36:50,745 --> 00:36:52,345
Thank you.
Ooh, she just walked in.

836
00:36:53,480 --> 00:36:54,916
Oh, my God.
I was so worried about you.

837
00:36:54,982 --> 00:36:56,216
Where were you?

838
00:36:56,283 --> 00:36:58,986
-I'm so sorry.
-Oh, babe, oh.

839
00:36:59,053 --> 00:37:00,922
-I'm sorry.
-Uh-huh. No...

840
00:37:00,988 --> 00:37:02,489
I need help.

841
00:37:02,557 --> 00:37:03,858
I know. I never should have

842
00:37:03,925 --> 00:37:05,760
flushed those pills
down the toilet.

843
00:37:05,827 --> 00:37:07,962
I had no right. I'm so sorry.
I was just so worried.

844
00:37:08,029 --> 00:37:09,163
Can you help me, please, Mama?

845
00:37:09,229 --> 00:37:10,965
Yes, yes, I already did.

846
00:37:11,032 --> 00:37:12,800
Here, I got these from Linda.

847
00:37:12,867 --> 00:37:14,502
She's the woman
who works next to me

848
00:37:14,569 --> 00:37:16,236
in the toy kiosk at the mall.

849
00:37:16,303 --> 00:37:17,905
Her doctor gave them to her

850
00:37:17,972 --> 00:37:19,507
after she got punched
in the face by a shoplifter,

851
00:37:19,574 --> 00:37:20,675
but she said
she didn't need them.

852
00:37:20,742 --> 00:37:22,110
She swore by the neck brace.

853
00:37:22,176 --> 00:37:23,678
But you need 'em, honey.
So here.

854
00:37:23,745 --> 00:37:26,413
That right there is a gift
from Linda, okay?

855
00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:28,082
And we can worry
about kicking it later.

856
00:37:28,149 --> 00:37:29,650
Let's not rush things.

857
00:37:29,717 --> 00:37:31,586
What matters the most
is that you're home safe.

858
00:37:31,652 --> 00:37:34,956
Oh, babe. [kisses]
Oh, my baby.

859
00:37:39,660 --> 00:37:40,828
Hey, Ry?

860
00:37:40,895 --> 00:37:42,730
[muffled music playing
on speaker]

861
00:37:42,797 --> 00:37:44,699
Got Chinese food!

862
00:37:45,533 --> 00:37:47,802
I got sweet and sour chicken,

863
00:37:47,869 --> 00:37:50,872
beef with broccoli,
steamed rice.

864
00:37:51,438 --> 00:37:52,640
Where are ya?

865
00:37:53,174 --> 00:37:54,609
Hey, Ry?

866
00:37:55,810 --> 00:37:56,944
Ryan!

867
00:37:57,011 --> 00:37:58,513
[hip-hop music playing
on speaker]

868
00:37:58,579 --> 00:38:00,748
[gasps] What the...
Daniel, get out!

869
00:38:00,815 --> 00:38:02,216
-[boy whimpering]
-Hey. Hey!

870
00:38:02,282 --> 00:38:03,851
[boy] Okay. Whoa, whoa! Okay.

871
00:38:03,918 --> 00:38:05,820
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Calm down!
It's not what you think.

872
00:38:05,887 --> 00:38:08,256
I'm pretty sure it is
what I think. How old are you?

873
00:38:08,355 --> 00:38:09,590
Daniel! Get off of him.

874
00:38:09,657 --> 00:38:10,892
Shut up!

875
00:38:10,958 --> 00:38:12,492
I asked you a question, boy.
How old are you?

876
00:38:12,560 --> 00:38:14,629
-I'm 20.
-She's 16, and I'm an ex-cop.

877
00:38:14,695 --> 00:38:16,296
Looks like you picked
the wrong girl.

878
00:38:16,363 --> 00:38:17,464
You're choking him!

879
00:38:17,532 --> 00:38:19,133
She said she was 18 online.

880
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:21,836
If I ever catch you
near my granddaughter again,

881
00:38:21,903 --> 00:38:23,604
I'm gonna rip
your fucking dick off

882
00:38:23,671 --> 00:38:25,305
and shove it down your throat.
You feel me?

883
00:38:25,372 --> 00:38:27,008
[gasping] Yes, sir. Yes.

884
00:38:27,074 --> 00:38:28,643
Get the fuck out of here.

885
00:38:28,709 --> 00:38:31,012
Yes, sir.
Uh, I need my clothes.

886
00:38:31,078 --> 00:38:33,948
They're in my house.
They're my clothes now.

887
00:38:34,015 --> 00:38:35,348
Run away!

888
00:38:37,450 --> 00:38:38,553
[Ryan] Daniel!

889
00:38:38,619 --> 00:38:40,755
Get out of my fucking room!

890
00:38:40,822 --> 00:38:42,023
What the fuck?

891
00:38:42,089 --> 00:38:43,791
[loudly] Hey, look, everybody!

892
00:38:43,858 --> 00:38:46,426
Statutory rapist
from Williamsburg!

893
00:38:46,493 --> 00:38:47,862
I need my keys!

894
00:38:47,929 --> 00:38:50,865
Oh, his keys! His keys!
Look at him!

895
00:38:50,932 --> 00:38:54,367
He's scrambling to his car!
Statutory rapist!

896
00:38:54,434 --> 00:38:55,770
Hey, Belinda,

897
00:38:55,837 --> 00:38:57,939
I found this fool in bed
with my Ryan.

898
00:38:58,005 --> 00:39:00,041
She said...
She said she was 18 online.

899
00:39:00,107 --> 00:39:01,676
You're a fuckboy.

900
00:39:01,742 --> 00:39:03,611
He's a fuckboy! That's what
the kids call them!

901
00:39:03,678 --> 00:39:06,280
Get out of
our neighborhood, fuckboy!

902
00:39:06,346 --> 00:39:07,715
[grunting] Okay. Okay!

903
00:39:07,782 --> 00:39:08,983
[Belinda]
Get out of here, fuckboy!

904
00:39:09,050 --> 00:39:10,051
All right! All right!

905
00:39:10,117 --> 00:39:11,552

She's suffering, Nathan.

1078
00:49:09,116 --> 00:49:10,350
Broken.

1079
00:49:11,051 --> 00:49:12,186
Lost.

1080
00:49:12,252 --> 00:49:14,622
You're the one who blamed her!

1081
00:49:15,723 --> 00:49:17,024
I stood by her!

1082
00:49:17,090 --> 00:49:20,227
Yeah, until she left your ass.

1083
00:49:20,294 --> 00:49:23,832
Sorry. Sorry, that came out
harsher than I meant.

1084
00:49:23,898 --> 00:49:25,867
I have to catch the train.

1085
00:49:25,934 --> 00:49:27,367
[Daniel] Please, Nathan.

1086
00:49:28,035 --> 00:49:30,137
I need help.

1087
00:49:30,204 --> 00:49:33,207
Ryan asked me to come by
and say ""hi"" to you.

1088
00:49:34,041 --> 00:49:35,442
And I did.

1089
00:49:36,711 --> 00:49:37,712
Okay.

1090
00:49:40,481 --> 00:49:41,549
Hi.

1091
00:49:53,227 --> 00:49:55,563
[playing classical music]

1092
00:50:00,467 --> 00:50:03,370
<i>-Best first date ever.</i>
<i>-I heard that.</i>

1093
00:50:09,611 --> 00:50:11,044
[Allison laughing]

1094
00:50:16,985 --> 00:50:20,287
[Daniel] <i>I used to drink</i>
<i>whiskey until I blacked out.</i>

1095
00:50:21,421 --> 00:50:23,691
Wake up the next morning
to find out

1096
00:50:24,626 --> 00:50:27,261
what I had done,
who I had been.

1097
00:50:29,697 --> 00:50:30,765
[chuckles]

1098
00:50:33,001 --> 00:50:34,802
My father was a drunk.

1099
00:50:37,539 --> 00:50:42,042
He beat me
right up to the day he died.

1100
00:50:44,278 --> 00:50:48,081
And I vowed I would never
lay a hand on my children.

1101
00:50:50,117 --> 00:50:51,586
And I didn't...

1102
00:50:53,621 --> 00:50:55,255
while I was sober.

1103
00:50:57,992 --> 00:50:59,661
But in the blackness...

1104
00:51:03,096 --> 00:51:07,301
I always denied because
I really couldn't remember.

1105
00:51:08,870 --> 00:51:10,738
Sometimes there'd be a bruise.

1106
00:51:12,607 --> 00:51:16,109
""Oh, you must have
fallen down.

1107
00:51:16,176 --> 00:51:18,412
""I'm your daddy.
I would never hurt you.""

1108
00:51:19,847 --> 00:51:22,482
August 11th, '99...

1109
00:51:25,520 --> 00:51:30,290
I woke up on my front porch to
the sound of church bells...

1110
00:51:33,027 --> 00:51:34,762
and an ice cream truck.

1111
00:51:35,797 --> 00:51:37,632
So, I knew it was Sunday.

1112
00:51:37,699 --> 00:51:42,235
First thing
I saw was my captain

1113
00:51:43,236 --> 00:51:45,607
standing over me,

1114
00:51:45,673 --> 00:51:48,543
poking me in the ribs
with his nightstick.

1115
00:51:51,779 --> 00:51:53,280
An ambulance.

1116
00:51:54,716 --> 00:51:58,720
My son, Nathan,
sitting in the back,

1117
00:52:00,054 --> 00:52:01,589
bleeding from the head.

1118
00:52:02,724 --> 00:52:05,627
Medics had bought him
a popsicle.

1119
00:52:07,862 --> 00:52:09,764
Turns out that... [sighs]

1120
00:52:11,766 --> 00:52:13,635
in the blackness...

1121
00:52:17,105 --> 00:52:20,173
I had beat him so bad

1122
00:52:20,240 --> 00:52:23,544
that he lost the hearing
in his right ear.

1123
00:52:23,611 --> 00:52:24,646
Forever.

1124
00:52:25,780 --> 00:52:29,216
And to this day,
every time I see him,

1125
00:52:29,282 --> 00:52:32,854
I beg for his forgiveness.

1126
00:52:34,221 --> 00:52:36,456
It's just a little dance
we do.

1127
00:52:37,692 --> 00:52:39,393
A mere formality.

1128
00:52:41,194 --> 00:52:42,864
Because we both know...

1129
00:52:45,533 --> 00:52:48,368
that there are some things
that are just

1130
00:52:49,871 --> 00:52:51,839
impossible to forgive.

1131
00:52:55,843 --> 00:53:01,248
I do believe
even God knows that.

1132
00:53:08,321 --> 00:53:10,858
When I was a cop,
I used to eat here every day.

1133
00:53:11,826 --> 00:53:13,594
Free coffee refills.

1134
00:53:16,263 --> 00:53:17,464
You hungry?

1135
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:20,200
No.

1136
00:53:20,802 --> 00:53:21,803
[Daniel] Hmm.

1137
00:53:24,204 --> 00:53:26,574
Funny, the things
we stop caring about.

1138
00:53:28,442 --> 00:53:30,410
I used to want to travel.

1139
00:53:31,713 --> 00:53:34,082
I would leaf through
<i>National Geographic</i>

1140
00:53:34,148 --> 00:53:36,084
and dog-ear
all of the exotic places

1141
00:53:36,150 --> 00:53:38,553
I would visit once I retired.

1142
00:53:41,189 --> 00:53:43,157
Never do that now.

1143
00:53:43,256 --> 00:53:45,960
-You still could.
-No, no. I couldn't.

1144
00:53:50,832 --> 00:53:56,771
I wasn't drunk,
or on anything, by the way.

1145
00:53:57,605 --> 00:53:58,606
What?

1146
00:53:59,841 --> 00:54:02,375
When I saw you the other day
at the meeting,

1147
00:54:03,711 --> 00:54:07,782
I instantly got worried
that you may have thought

1148
00:54:07,849 --> 00:54:10,952
that I was drinking
or on drugs

1149
00:54:11,018 --> 00:54:12,687
on the day of the accident,
and I wasn't.

1150
00:54:12,754 --> 00:54:15,489
I was sober.
It wasn't my fault.

1151
00:54:16,858 --> 00:54:19,259
I have every report
ever written

1152
00:54:19,326 --> 00:54:21,328
committed to memory.

1153
00:54:21,829 --> 00:54:22,897
Right.

1154
00:54:25,166 --> 00:54:26,333
So, you know that it was

1155
00:54:26,399 --> 00:54:27,902
the backhoe guy's fault,
Alvarez.

1156
00:54:27,969 --> 00:54:29,871
I don't wanna get
into that all right now.

1157
00:54:29,937 --> 00:54:31,539
Okay, yeah, you're right.

1158
00:54:36,110 --> 00:54:39,046
Nathan said that he was deaf
since birth.

1159
00:54:40,347 --> 00:54:41,816
He never told you?

1160
00:54:42,950 --> 00:54:45,485
Maybe he wanted me
to like you.

1161
00:54:46,921 --> 00:54:48,656
I doubt that.

1162
00:54:51,993 --> 00:54:56,230
I thought that raising Ryan
would offer me the chance

1163
00:54:56,296 --> 00:54:58,966
to be a better father
than I ever was.

1164
00:54:59,867 --> 00:55:01,434
Shit.

1165
00:55:01,502 --> 00:55:04,404
I'm in way over my head.

1166
00:55:04,471 --> 00:55:07,608
I got one of those audiobooks
from the library.

1167
00:55:07,675 --> 00:55:09,010
<i>How to Talk to a Teen.</i>

1168
00:55:09,076 --> 00:55:10,978
[chuckles] Oh, yeah?

1169
00:55:11,045 --> 00:55:12,513
How's that working out?

1170
00:55:12,580 --> 00:55:15,216
-Well, it's from the '80s...
-[laughs]

1171
00:55:15,283 --> 00:55:16,684
It's on a cassette.

1172
00:55:16,751 --> 00:55:17,752
Right.

1173
00:55:17,819 --> 00:55:19,486
Its advice is,

1174
00:55:20,555 --> 00:55:22,322
""Chaperone a dance.""

1175
00:55:22,723 --> 00:55:24,457
[laughs]

1176
00:55:25,927 --> 00:55:28,129
""Chaperone a dance.""

1177
00:55:28,196 --> 00:55:29,797
I just caught her having sex

1178
00:55:29,864 --> 00:55:32,499
with a boy
who looked like a man.

1179
00:55:34,602 --> 00:55:36,704
A dance would be delightful.

1180
00:55:37,805 --> 00:55:39,974
Can I give you some advice

1181
00:55:40,775 --> 00:55:42,977
from a former teenage girl?

1182
00:55:44,612 --> 00:55:46,413
She's gonna have sex.

1183
00:55:47,582 --> 00:55:50,718
And nothing you say
is gonna change that.

1184
00:55:52,887 --> 00:55:55,223
Just make sure
she's on birth control.

1185
00:55:55,289 --> 00:55:56,356
-Birth control?
-Yeah.

1186
00:55:56,423 --> 00:55:58,726
She's 16!

1187
00:55:58,793 --> 00:56:01,128
No, we'll be going
the abstinence route.

1188
00:56:02,196 --> 00:56:03,598
No offense, Daniel,

1189
00:56:03,664 --> 00:56:06,499
but, uh, there's a knot
in your logic.

1190
00:56:07,668 --> 00:56:09,003
You're trying to solve
a problem

1191
00:56:09,070 --> 00:56:11,038
by looking
in the other direction.

1192
00:56:14,407 --> 00:56:16,344
I could talk to her
if you want me to.

1193
00:56:16,409 --> 00:56:18,112
Oh, well, no thanks.

1194
00:56:18,179 --> 00:56:19,780
-It's okay. Of course.
-That's not appropriate.

1195
00:56:19,847 --> 00:56:21,349
I don't even know
why I just said that.

1196
00:56:21,414 --> 00:56:22,850
-I'm sorry.
-No, it's okay.

1197
00:56:22,917 --> 00:56:24,151
It's just that
I don't think that it's...

1198
00:56:24,218 --> 00:56:25,853
I just felt the need,

1199
00:56:27,021 --> 00:56:30,358
um, the instinct
to help in some way.

1200
00:56:31,158 --> 00:56:32,793
It's the least I could do.

1201
00:56:40,234 --> 00:56:42,169
I don't know how to do this.

1202
00:56:43,170 --> 00:56:44,138
What?

1203
00:56:44,972 --> 00:56:46,173
Start all over.

1204
00:56:48,009 --> 00:56:49,510
How do you do it?

1205
00:56:50,511 --> 00:56:52,013
[Daniel] Takes work.

1206
00:56:54,815 --> 00:56:57,985
-Can I tell you a secret?
-Sure.

1207
00:57:02,790 --> 00:57:05,159
I'm not sure I have the will.

1208
00:57:27,315 --> 00:57:29,917
What does <i>""amor fati""</i> mean?

1209
00:57:31,385 --> 00:57:32,653
[Daniel sighs]

1210
00:57:33,654 --> 00:57:35,556
Certain things are private.

1211
00:57:36,489 --> 00:57:38,559
Do you think I'm fucked up?

1212
00:57:39,694 --> 00:57:41,929
Are you high right now?

1213
00:57:43,164 --> 00:57:44,464
No.

1214
00:57:45,599 --> 00:57:47,568
I was a cop for 40 years.

1215
00:57:47,635 --> 00:57:49,570
I was an addict for 50.

1216
00:57:50,771 --> 00:57:53,040
So, I'm gonna ask you again.

1217
00:57:54,208 --> 00:57:55,843
Are you high right now?

1218
00:57:56,644 --> 00:57:58,012
Well, I...

1219
00:57:59,680 --> 00:58:01,382
I broke a pill in half.

1220
00:58:01,449 --> 00:58:02,950
So, half.

1221
00:58:04,618 --> 00:58:07,154
Yes, I think
you're fucked up, Allison.

1222
00:58:10,091 --> 00:58:11,559
Not half.

1223
00:58:12,226 --> 00:58:13,894
All fucked up.

1224
00:58:13,961 --> 00:58:16,063
Do you think
I'll ever pull out of this?

1225
00:58:17,531 --> 00:58:23,170
I mean, like, maybe one day
I might be the kind of person

1226
00:58:24,538 --> 00:58:26,073
that people want
their granddaughter

1227
00:58:26,140 --> 00:58:28,109
to hang out with?

1228
00:58:28,175 --> 00:58:29,910
I have no idea.

1229
00:58:31,545 --> 00:58:32,947
Me neither.

1230
00:58:35,616 --> 00:58:38,085
[soft country music playing]

1231
00:58:47,995 --> 00:58:50,965
Can I have
my phone back, please?

1232
00:58:51,032 --> 00:58:54,068
I'm running out of ideas
on how to handle you, Ryan.

1233
00:58:55,069 --> 00:58:56,570
Grandpa,
everybody at my age has sex.

1234
00:58:56,637 --> 00:58:58,239
It's, like, not a big deal.

1235
00:58:58,305 --> 00:59:00,007
I know it was different
when you were younger,

1236
00:59:00,074 --> 00:59:02,877
but that's just, like,
not how it is anymore.

1237
00:59:06,647 --> 00:59:09,116
[smacks lips] Well,
let me ask you something.

1238
00:59:15,289 --> 00:59:16,323
Are you...

1239
00:59:18,726 --> 00:59:20,995
Are you using

1240
00:59:21,662 --> 00:59:24,065
any protection?

1241
00:59:24,131 --> 00:59:25,733
Oh, my God!

1242
00:59:25,800 --> 00:59:28,102
I am so not gonna talk about
this with my grandfather.

1243
00:59:28,169 --> 00:59:30,337
How the hell
do you think I feel?

1244
00:59:32,606 --> 00:59:34,141
[both sigh]

1245
00:59:34,208 --> 00:59:36,777
-I know you're upset.
-I'm not upset.

1246
00:59:36,844 --> 00:59:38,212
Maybe you should go back

1247
00:59:39,080 --> 00:59:40,515
and see that therapist again.

1248
00:59:40,581 --> 00:59:41,982
No. I just

1249
00:59:42,850 --> 00:59:45,586
want my phone back.

1250
00:59:45,653 --> 00:59:48,756
I don't have any friends
at Columbia

1251
00:59:48,823 --> 00:59:51,025
and I want to

1252
00:59:51,092 --> 00:59:53,961
hang onto the few I still have
on Long Beach Island.

1253
00:59:55,029 --> 00:59:56,764
How come
you can't make friends?

1254
00:59:56,831 --> 00:59:58,732
I've been through a lot
this year.

1255
00:59:59,333 --> 01:00:00,334
[Daniel] Hmm.

1256
01:00:01,368 --> 01:00:03,904
And nobody really understands.

1257
01:00:04,872 --> 01:00:07,608
They try. Some, but...

1258
01:00:08,375 --> 01:00:09,844
I mean, it's fake.

1259
01:00:09,910 --> 01:00:11,946
Don't you think
most people are so fake?

1260
01:00:13,080 --> 01:00:15,983
I would probably say
""duplicitous.""

1261
01:00:16,784 --> 01:00:18,052
What does that mean?

1262
01:00:18,719 --> 01:00:20,287
Fake.

1263
01:00:20,354 --> 01:00:21,655
[chuckles]

1264
01:00:23,390 --> 01:00:24,892
I'm on your side.

1265
01:00:26,660 --> 01:00:27,895
I know.

1266
01:00:28,462 --> 01:00:29,897
Tell you what.

1267
01:00:29,964 --> 01:00:32,800
You can have your phone back

1268
01:00:32,867 --> 01:00:36,704
if you promise to start taking
birth control pills.

1269
01:00:36,770 --> 01:00:38,906
Ugh! Oh, my God! Daniel!

1270
01:00:38,973 --> 01:00:40,040
Grandpa!

1271
01:00:40,741 --> 01:00:41,942
[sighs]

1272
01:00:42,676 --> 01:00:43,978
Grandpa.

1273
01:00:45,112 --> 01:00:48,215
Is it a deal?
I'll make the appointment.

1274
01:00:49,750 --> 01:00:52,119
Fine. Fine.

1275
01:00:52,186 --> 01:00:53,487
I just

1276
01:00:53,555 --> 01:00:56,790
never want to talk to you
about sex ever again.

1277
01:00:57,791 --> 01:01:00,060
Oh, really?

1278
01:01:00,928 --> 01:01:02,796
'Cause I just love this shit.

1279
01:01:09,336 --> 01:01:11,338
Have you ever been
on campus before?

1280
01:01:11,405 --> 01:01:12,907
Not since I was a kid.

1281
01:01:12,973 --> 01:01:14,643
I used to do swim meets here.

1282
01:01:14,708 --> 01:01:16,177
-Oh, yeah?
-Yeah.

1283
01:01:16,243 --> 01:01:17,878
-You were a swimmer?
-[chuckling] Uh, yeah.

1284
01:01:17,945 --> 01:01:20,281
Well, I was 12, but yeah,
I was pretty good.

1285
01:01:20,347 --> 01:01:22,617
I still have all the trophies
and the ribbons.

1286
01:01:22,683 --> 01:01:24,586
-That's cool.
-Mmm.

1287
01:01:24,653 --> 01:01:27,721
-What stroke?
-Mostly freestyle.

1288
01:01:28,822 --> 01:01:30,224
Why'd you stop?

1289
01:01:30,925 --> 01:01:34,061
Um, my dad left.

1290
01:01:34,128 --> 01:01:36,931
Yeah, it was kinda the thing
that we used to do together.

1291
01:01:36,997 --> 01:01:39,466
He would cheer so loud
I could hear him underwater.

1292
01:01:39,534 --> 01:01:41,001
[chuckles]

1293
01:01:41,068 --> 01:01:43,003
Seemed kind of pointless
to do it without him.

1294
01:01:44,071 --> 01:01:46,807
-Where'd he go?
-Ohio.

1295
01:01:47,875 --> 01:01:49,511
Started a whole new family
in Ohio.

1296
01:01:49,578 --> 01:01:50,945
Wow.

1297
01:01:51,011 --> 01:01:53,747
He has 10-year-old twins.
Yeah.

1298
01:01:53,814 --> 01:01:55,816
I don't know
if they swim or not, though.

1299
01:01:55,883 --> 01:01:58,252
Oh, man. I am always
just amazed at people

1300
01:01:58,319 --> 01:02:00,921
who can, like, up and leave
their kids like that.

1301
01:02:00,988 --> 01:02:02,223
[Allison] Mmm.

1302
01:02:02,289 --> 01:02:03,625
I just don't know
how you could,

1303
01:02:03,692 --> 01:02:06,393
like, fucking sleep at night.

1304
01:02:06,460 --> 01:02:10,464
For so long, I thought
that I'd done something wrong.

1305
01:02:10,532 --> 01:02:14,235
Like, it was my fault,
or I'd let him down.

1306
01:02:15,369 --> 01:02:18,038
And then I just realized,

1307
01:02:18,105 --> 01:02:21,475
I don't know, maybe
some people just aren't good.

1308
01:02:21,543 --> 01:02:22,843
[Simone] Hmm.

1309
01:02:24,044 --> 01:02:26,247
It's kinda like he, like,
restarted a level

1310
01:02:26,313 --> 01:02:28,816
in a video game
with a fresh life.

1311
01:02:28,882 --> 01:02:31,218
-[both laugh]
-That's exactly what he did!

1312
01:02:31,285 --> 01:02:35,222
He packed up the car,
and left his Rolex

1313
01:02:35,289 --> 01:02:37,958
in the attic of my dollhouse,

1314
01:02:38,025 --> 01:02:39,860
and he drove away.

1315
01:02:43,297 --> 01:02:44,666
Hey, let's sit
for a second, okay?

1316
01:02:44,733 --> 01:02:46,367
-Yeah, yeah.
-[clears throat]

1317
01:02:47,901 --> 01:02:51,539
Uh... So, I'll sponsor you.

1318
01:02:51,606 --> 01:02:54,475
-Okay.
-But, um,

1319
01:02:54,542 --> 01:02:56,844
you gotta start
taking this shit seriously.

1320
01:02:58,012 --> 01:03:00,515
You can't keep coming
to meetings high.

1321
01:03:00,582 --> 01:03:02,116
What? [chuckles]

1322
01:03:04,785 --> 01:03:06,521
How did you know?

1323
01:03:06,588 --> 01:03:07,821
[laughs]

1324
01:03:07,888 --> 01:03:10,457
Uh, because I was you.

1325
01:03:10,525 --> 01:03:13,794
And I've helped
dozens of women who were you.

1326
01:03:14,962 --> 01:03:18,999
And some beat it,
and some are dead.

1327
01:03:21,670 --> 01:03:23,070
But, you know,

1328
01:03:24,104 --> 01:03:26,307
if you want my time,
you gotta commit.

1329
01:03:26,373 --> 01:03:27,941
Because I have a toddler
so I just

1330
01:03:28,008 --> 01:03:29,511
-don't have time for bullshit.
-Yeah.

1331
01:03:29,577 --> 01:03:32,614
No, I do. I... I...
I really wanna beat it.

1332
01:03:32,681 --> 01:03:35,650
Then I want you to do
90 meetings in 90 days.

1333
01:03:35,717 --> 01:03:37,284
-Wow.
-Yeah.

1334
01:03:37,351 --> 01:03:40,187
And, um, we're gonna
get you started on step one.

1335
01:03:41,255 --> 01:03:42,222
Okay.

1336
01:03:43,424 --> 01:03:44,559
Okay.

1337
01:03:44,626 --> 01:03:48,128
Also, enough hiding out, man.

1338
01:03:48,195 --> 01:03:49,564
It's time you shared
with the group.

1339
01:03:51,633 --> 01:03:53,834
-All right.
-Uh...

1340
01:03:56,136 --> 01:04:02,376
[nervously] Hi, I'm Allison,
and I'm addicted to, uh,

1341
01:04:03,712 --> 01:04:05,079
pills.

1342
01:04:05,145 --> 01:04:07,414
[group] Hi, Allison.

1343
01:04:07,481 --> 01:04:08,550
[Allison] Uh...

1344
01:04:09,950 --> 01:04:12,052
Sorry. Can I start again?

1345
01:04:12,119 --> 01:04:14,421
I've never done this before,
and I'm nervous.

1346
01:04:14,488 --> 01:04:15,557
You got it.

1347
01:04:16,691 --> 01:04:18,425
[breathes deeply]

1348
01:04:20,094 --> 01:04:25,065
Hi, I'm Allison,
and I'm an addict.

1349
01:04:25,132 --> 01:04:27,234
[group] Hi, Allison.

1350
01:04:30,371 --> 01:04:31,506
I...

1351
01:04:33,708 --> 01:04:34,908
Um...

1352
01:04:37,846 --> 01:04:39,514
I was the driver

1353
01:04:40,881 --> 01:04:42,851
of a car

1354
01:04:42,916 --> 01:04:44,952
that was in
a really bad accident.

1355
01:04:47,955 --> 01:04:49,456
Two people died.

1356
01:04:52,960 --> 01:04:54,395
The woman was...

1357
01:04:57,998 --> 01:05:01,536
The woman was about to be
my sister-in-law.

1358
01:05:05,305 --> 01:05:08,208
We were on our way to try on
my wedding dresses.

1359
01:05:10,745 --> 01:05:12,446
[shudders]

1360
01:05:12,514 --> 01:05:13,581
And then we weren't.

1361
01:05:14,982 --> 01:05:16,383
It wasn't my fault. [sighs]

1362
01:05:17,719 --> 01:05:21,488
I wasn't on drugs or booze,
or drunk, or anything.

1363
01:05:23,558 --> 01:05:24,692
But, uh...

1364
01:05:35,035 --> 01:05:39,039
[voice breaking]
Surviving that day was, is...

1365
01:05:42,109 --> 01:05:44,011
the most painful thing

1366
01:05:44,077 --> 01:05:46,146
I will ever
have to live through.

1367
01:05:48,382 --> 01:05:51,051
[sniffles] I got hurt, too.

1368
01:05:51,853 --> 01:05:53,621
They put a hole in my head.

1369
01:05:54,656 --> 01:05:56,457
And, um, [sniffles]

1370
01:05:56,524 --> 01:05:58,225
that helped because
at least I had something

1371
01:05:58,292 --> 01:05:59,727
I could blame the pain on.

1372
01:06:02,329 --> 01:06:03,731
But then that healed...

1373
01:06:06,634 --> 01:06:08,202
and I was still hurting.

1374
01:06:09,970 --> 01:06:11,138
And I guess that's why
I didn't realize

1375
01:06:11,205 --> 01:06:13,140
how bad it was because to me...

1376
01:06:13,207 --> 01:06:15,643
[breathes shakily]

1377
01:06:15,710 --> 01:06:17,211
I was still in so much pain.

1378
01:06:17,277 --> 01:06:20,380
-[shuddering]
-[rubbing stomach]

1379
01:06:27,287 --> 01:06:30,457
I was, um, prescribed them
for physical pain,

1380
01:06:30,525 --> 01:06:32,993
and they really helped
with that. They really did.

1381
01:06:37,130 --> 01:06:39,734
But they made me numb.
Blissfully numb.

1382
01:06:45,205 --> 01:06:47,107
Without them I want to die.

1383
01:06:48,408 --> 01:06:50,310
[sniffles] Every day.

1384
01:06:53,715 --> 01:06:56,718
I've never said that
out loud before. [sobs]

1385
01:06:59,888 --> 01:07:01,021
Um...

1386
01:07:02,624 --> 01:07:05,660
I've never really faced
reality without them.

1387
01:07:06,493 --> 01:07:07,962
[sniffling]

1388
01:07:08,028 --> 01:07:10,097
And I don't know if I'll be
able to handle what I see,

1389
01:07:10,163 --> 01:07:13,601
but I'm here to try.

1390
01:07:18,238 --> 01:07:19,741
Okay. That's it. [sniffles]

1391
01:07:21,141 --> 01:07:23,578
That's it. [sighing heavily]

1392
01:07:27,180 --> 01:07:28,516
What happens now?

1393
01:07:29,851 --> 01:07:34,254
[breathing heavily]

1394
01:07:36,891 --> 01:07:39,661
[toy train horn tooting]

1395
01:07:44,766 --> 01:07:46,133
You made all of this?

1396
01:07:47,334 --> 01:07:51,039
Uh, I assembled it
and designed it.

1397
01:07:51,104 --> 01:07:52,840
Yeah.

1398
01:07:52,907 --> 01:07:56,578
You see,
the houses come as a kit.

1399
01:07:56,644 --> 01:07:59,547
You just assemble them
and paint them...

1400
01:07:59,614 --> 01:08:02,349
Schoolhouse,
I built from scratch.

1401
01:08:06,486 --> 01:08:09,991
Hey, there are two kids
making out back here.

1402
01:08:10,058 --> 01:08:11,693
-That's me.
-[chuckles]

1403
01:08:12,627 --> 01:08:14,696
-You were handsome.
-[laughs]

1404
01:08:15,128 --> 01:08:16,296
And tiny.

1405
01:08:17,497 --> 01:08:21,435
Yeah, my very first kiss
behind the schoolhouse.

1406
01:08:22,971 --> 01:08:24,539
Olivia Williams.

1407
01:08:26,239 --> 01:08:28,743
It was fall.
Tip of her nose was cold.

1408
01:08:28,810 --> 01:08:29,978
[chuckles]

1409
01:08:30,044 --> 01:08:31,746
Little runny.

1410
01:08:31,813 --> 01:08:35,382
She stood on tiptoe.
Tasted like bubble gum.

1411
01:08:36,350 --> 01:08:37,284
[Allison] Is that
who you married?

1412
01:08:37,351 --> 01:08:39,286
No! No, no.

1413
01:08:39,353 --> 01:08:43,156
No, she dumped me the next day
for Charlie Cook.

1414
01:08:43,223 --> 01:08:46,393
-Oh.
-He smoked Camels.

1415
01:08:46,460 --> 01:08:50,098
And drove
a Buick Riviera Roadmaster.

1416
01:08:50,163 --> 01:08:52,466
So, is this all inspired
by your life?

1417
01:08:53,101 --> 01:08:54,301
Kinda.

1418
01:08:55,268 --> 01:08:57,170
Supposed to be South Orange.

1419
01:08:58,238 --> 01:08:59,473
I grew up here.

1420
01:09:00,842 --> 01:09:02,543
I was a cop in Newark.

1421
01:09:03,377 --> 01:09:04,846
I've always lived here.

1422
01:09:07,015 --> 01:09:08,215
Who's the soldier?

1423
01:09:08,883 --> 01:09:10,150
[Daniel] That's me.

1424
01:09:10,217 --> 01:09:12,654
Day I got home from Vietnam.

1425
01:09:13,855 --> 01:09:16,289
That other little figure there
is my father.

1426
01:09:16,356 --> 01:09:19,627

to pick me up.

and the microphone.

There's a microphone?

-Yeah. Yeah.
-You good?

1950
01:36:11,472 --> 01:36:12,707
I'm fine. I need a drink.

1951
01:36:12,773 --> 01:36:13,807
-But I'm fine.
-Yes.

1952

Allie!

1956
01:36:23,917 --> 01:36:26,086
Why the fuck
did you just do that?

1957
01:36:26,153 --> 01:36:28,122
I thought it was gonna
make you happy.

1958
01:36:28,188 --> 01:36:31,158
You thought
that would make me happy?

1959
01:36:31,225 --> 01:36:32,960
-[Ryan] Yeah!
-Are you insane?

1960
01:36:33,027 --> 01:36:35,095
Hi! Can I please get, um...
Hey, I'm sorry.

1961
01:36:35,162 --> 01:36:37,865
Could I just get a glass
of tequila, please?

1962
01:36:37,931 --> 01:36:39,433
Fuck, I can't breathe.

1963
01:36:39,501 --> 01:36:40,801
-Ryan, I can't fucking breathe!
-Calm down.

1964
01:36:40,868 --> 01:36:42,202
Calm down, okay? I'm sorry.

1965
01:36:42,269 --> 01:36:44,305
You fucking did that
on purpose!

1966
01:36:44,371 --> 01:36:45,939
You did that to hurt me, right?

1967
01:36:46,006 --> 01:36:47,509
Is that what you did?
Yeah, you did.

1968
01:36:47,575 --> 01:36:49,476
-Just admit it. Yes, you did!
-No, I didn't!

1969
01:36:49,544 --> 01:36:50,878
-You did that
on fucking purpose!
-No, I didn't!

1970

You guys sounded so good!

1974
01:37:00,154 --> 01:37:01,955
You're gonna be so famous!

1975
01:37:02,022 --> 01:37:04,526
I know. I really have to savor
my anonymity.

1976
01:37:04,592 --> 01:37:08,495
Hey, we're gonna go to this
party over in Williamsburg.

1977
01:37:08,563 --> 01:37:10,164
You guys wanna come?

1978
01:37:11,432 --> 01:37:13,434
[sighs] Fuck, yeah, whatever.
Let's go!

1979
01:37:13,501 --> 01:37:14,602
I need to get outta here.

[whooping]

1981
01:37:20,841 --> 01:37:22,644
Do you have the time?

-[cell phone chiming]
-Yeah.

1983
01:37:28,048 --> 01:37:30,117
Hey, Danny. Everything okay?

1984
01:37:30,184 --> 01:37:33,921
I can't find Ryan.
I've tried everything.

1985
01:37:33,987 --> 01:37:37,891
Anyway, my mind
can't help but wonder if...

1986
01:37:37,958 --> 01:37:40,094
Well, if you've seen Allison
or not.

1987
01:37:40,160 --> 01:37:43,297
Uh, no, I haven't, but I can
text her if you want.

1988
01:37:43,364 --> 01:37:44,833
Well, I've tried texting
both of them,

1989
01:37:44,898 --> 01:37:46,333
but neither one is answering.

1990
01:37:46,400 --> 01:37:47,502
What's wrong?

1991
01:37:47,569 --> 01:37:49,303
Daniel can't find
his granddaughter.

1992
01:37:49,370 --> 01:37:51,171
Um, well, if he pays for
the phone, he can just log

1993
01:37:51,238 --> 01:37:52,940
into the account,
and use Find My Phone.

1994
01:37:53,006 --> 01:37:55,209
Yeah. Daniel, do you know
what Find My Phone is?

1995
01:37:55,275 --> 01:37:56,811
No, what the hell is that?

Allie, this is Jarvis. He has
the stuff you asked for.

2003
01:38:33,914 --> 01:38:35,282
Hey!

2004
01:38:35,349 --> 01:38:36,917
I don't have any thirties,
just dope.

2005
01:38:36,984 --> 01:38:40,120
Uh, yeah, okay.
Yeah, whatever you have.

2006

Can you spot me?

-I'll pay you back, I promise.
-Uh, okay, all right.

2008

Don't worry about it.

2018
01:39:27,034 --> 01:39:29,771
Can we just stop for a second?

2019
01:39:29,838 --> 01:39:31,071
Where is my phone?

[cell phone continues ringing]

2021
01:39:33,207 --> 01:39:35,075
I think I'm gonna throw up.

What the fuck!

2023
01:39:40,314 --> 01:39:42,684
She's in the fucking city!

2024
01:39:42,750 --> 01:39:44,686
She's in fucking Williamsburg!

2025
01:39:44,752 --> 01:39:46,754
Okay, Daniel, wait.
I'm gonna come pick you up.

2026

I don't want you to do
something you're gonna regret.

I'm gonna kill
that motherfucker.

2028

worried about. I'm on my way.

She won't answer.

It's your grandpa,
open the door.

2051

Open the door, baby.

This is family business.

Don't do this.

2067

I told you to stay away
from her!

Who the fuck are you

2096
01:43:04,619 --> 01:43:05,953
to be talking
about protecting somebody?

I was... I was trying to help.

2099
01:43:09,957 --> 01:43:11,559
I was... I was trying to...

2100
01:43:12,426 --> 01:43:13,528
I was trying to make it right.

2101
01:43:13,594 --> 01:43:15,295
Let me tell you something.

2102
01:43:15,997 --> 01:43:17,431
You will never ever

2103
01:43:17,497 --> 01:43:19,667
be able to fix the things
you've done to me.

2104
01:43:20,802 --> 01:43:21,869
You hear me?

2105
01:43:22,537 --> 01:43:24,204
I want my life back.

2106
01:43:24,271 --> 01:43:25,640
I want my child back.

2107
01:43:26,507 --> 01:43:29,443
My baby, my... Molly.

2108
01:43:30,511 --> 01:43:32,113
You took my baby away from me!

2109
01:43:32,180 --> 01:43:33,380
Dad! Enough.

2110
01:43:33,447 --> 01:43:34,849
Nah, it's okay.

2111
01:43:36,651 --> 01:43:37,652
Say it.

2112
01:43:38,986 --> 01:43:40,555
Shit, I wanted to hate you.

2113

But I stopped myself.

2114
01:43:45,560 --> 01:43:48,963
And when you walked into
that meeting, I thought...

2115
01:43:49,964 --> 01:43:52,200
This is God testing me.

2116
01:43:52,265 --> 01:43:56,504
This is proof of a higher power

2117
01:43:56,571 --> 01:43:58,906
testing me in this church.

if he could break me.

00:04:27,934 --> 00:04:30,687
- Okay, thank you miss Summer
and this is-

39
00:04:30,728 --> 00:04:31,938
- PJ, my fiancee.

40
00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:33,439
He's going to help out.

41
00:04:33,481 --> 00:04:34,357
Stop it.

42
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:35,692
- Yeah, good helper.

43
00:04:35,733 --> 00:04:37,819
Uh, and this is Darryl who, like
you,

44
00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:39,779
is new to the ways of fright!

45
00:04:39,821 --> 00:04:41,364
- Hey Bart.
- Hey Darryl.

46
00:04:41,406 --> 00:04:42,949
- We know each other from physi-

47
00:04:43,032 --> 00:04:43,866
- My peeps!

48
00:04:43,950 --> 00:04:45,493
Welcome to Scare Zone year
three!

49
00:04:45,576 --> 00:04:46,786
Now, the first thing we do,

50
00:04:46,828 --> 00:04:48,579
to welcome the newest
members of our scream team,

51
00:04:48,621 --> 00:04:49,998
is sacrifice a virgin!

52
00:04:52,166 --> 00:04:53,710
- Hey!

53
00:04:53,751 --> 00:04:54,794
- Look.

54
00:04:55,461 --> 00:04:57,338
You were scared, huh?

55
00:04:57,380 --> 00:04:58,339
You pussy.

56
00:04:58,381 --> 00:04:59,632
And now a tour of this year's
attraction:

57
00:04:59,716 --> 00:05:01,092
""Scare Zone Three: The
Psycho-Splatter

58
00:05:01,134 --> 00:05:02,760
Raw-topsy Slaughter Dungeon"".

59
00:05:02,844 --> 00:05:03,636
- Yeah man!

60
00:05:03,678 --> 00:05:05,638
- All right follow me, kiddies.

61
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:08,349
Ah, what you, no, no, no.

62
00:05:08,391 --> 00:05:09,350
That's the gift shop.

63
00:05:09,392 --> 00:05:11,185
Okay that's where we end.

64
00:05:11,227 --> 00:05:12,603
This is where we start.

65
00:05:12,645 --> 00:05:13,730
Yeah, over here, yeah!

66
00:05:13,771 --> 00:05:14,897
Okay, why don't you
just stick close to me.

67
00:05:14,981 --> 00:05:15,940
- All right.
- All right?

68
00:05:15,982 --> 00:05:16,983
You're lookin' like you rode in

69
00:05:17,025 --> 00:05:18,067
on the short bus or somethin'.

70
00:05:18,109 --> 00:05:18,860
Come on, guys.

71
00:05:23,239 --> 00:05:24,324
- Excellent.

72
00:05:24,365 --> 00:05:25,199
Pablo!

73
00:05:25,241 --> 00:05:26,284
Donde esta

74
00:05:26,367 --> 00:05:28,328
the remote control?

75
00:05:28,369 --> 00:05:29,454
Fantastic.

76
00:05:29,495 --> 00:05:30,288
All right, good,

77
00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:31,873
let's see how we're doing.

78
00:05:33,499 --> 00:05:35,543
Brilliant!

79
00:05:35,626 --> 00:05:36,919
- Bravo Mr. Peters.

80
00:05:37,462 --> 00:05:39,756
- Ah-heh, that is fantastic.

81
00:05:42,717 --> 00:05:43,760
- I'm sorry, what?

82
00:05:43,801 --> 00:05:45,136
- Ah, no, it's very
good, it's very good eh?

83
00:05:45,178 --> 00:05:46,220
- All right, yeah, yeah, yeah.

84
00:05:46,304 --> 00:05:47,597
- So I pulse them through in
like

85
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:49,640
six to eight at a time, no conga
line,

86
00:05:49,682 --> 00:05:51,017
we want to separate
them into little clumps

87
00:05:51,059 --> 00:05:53,019
that way you can get
them to shit themselves.

88
00:05:53,061 --> 00:05:54,437
- Heh, that's right if they see

89
00:05:54,479 --> 00:05:56,105
you coming there's no surprise.

90
00:05:56,147 --> 00:05:57,982
- Boys and ghouls, meet the
owner

91
00:05:58,066 --> 00:06:00,276
and creator, the Duke of
Dementia,

92
00:06:00,318 --> 00:06:02,528
Scare Zone's own Sir Oliver
Peters!

93
00:06:02,570 --> 00:06:04,322
- Yeah, just Oliver will be
fine.

94
00:06:04,405 --> 00:06:06,074
- Hey man, good, I'm glad I ran
into you.

95
00:06:06,115 --> 00:06:07,200
You know I've got that
appointment-

96
00:06:08,409 --> 00:06:09,535
- And the newbies need to get
a tour from the man Oliver.

97
00:06:09,619 --> 00:06:10,536
- All right.

98
00:06:10,578 --> 00:06:11,371
Okay.

99
00:06:11,454 --> 00:06:12,455
Go!

100
00:06:12,497 --> 00:06:13,998
- All right, kids, scare ya
later.

101
00:06:14,082 --> 00:06:15,792
Don't touch!

102
00:06:15,875 --> 00:06:16,751
Don't touch.

103
00:06:16,793 --> 00:06:17,585
Excuse me!

104
00:06:17,627 --> 00:06:18,961
Excuse me, thank you, thank you.

105
00:06:19,045 --> 00:06:21,172
- All right, let's go
over to the next scene.

106
00:06:21,255 --> 00:06:22,548
There's more room in there.

107
00:06:24,384 --> 00:06:25,426
Voila!

108
00:06:26,469 --> 00:06:27,428
Ha-ha!

109
00:06:27,512 --> 00:06:29,222
Welcome my pretties on your

110
00:06:29,263 --> 00:06:30,890
next stop on the scare zone
tour:

111
00:06:30,973 --> 00:06:34,852
The Lair of the Slutty
Cannibal Vampiress Wench.

112
00:06:34,894 --> 00:06:36,312
Now, this poor fellow here is

113
00:06:36,354 --> 00:06:39,690
one of the vampiress's victims!

114
00:06:41,484 --> 00:06:44,445
He came directly from the
Camden dungeon of tortures.

115
00:06:44,487 --> 00:06:45,863
The first time Prince Harry saw

116
00:06:45,905 --> 00:06:48,199
this gag he 'bout shit himself.

117
00:06:48,282 --> 00:06:49,200
You.

118
00:06:49,283 --> 00:06:50,410
- Margo.
- Perfect!

119
00:06:50,493 --> 00:06:52,328
You could work this room, all
right?

120
00:06:52,412 --> 00:06:57,667
You are a slutty blood sucking
vampire seeking victims.

121
00:06:57,708 --> 00:06:58,918
Now, let me hear you hiss!

122
00:06:59,001 --> 00:07:00,253
- Hiss?
- Yep.

123
00:07:00,294 --> 00:07:01,838
- Uh, hisssss.

124
00:07:04,340 --> 00:07:07,844
- Okay, uh, let me hear you, a,
shriek!

125
00:07:07,927 --> 00:07:09,637
- Um, ahhhh.

126
00:07:09,679 --> 00:07:12,098
- Well, she's got the slutty
part down.

127
00:07:12,140 --> 00:07:12,890
- Shut up Trace!

128
00:07:12,932 --> 00:07:13,724
- No, no, no, no, no.

129
00:07:13,808 --> 00:07:14,600
It's not a problem.

130
00:07:14,684 --> 00:07:15,726
Come forth.

131
00:07:15,810 --> 00:07:16,644
- Um.
- C'mon.

132
00:07:16,686 --> 00:07:17,603
This is what will work for you,

133
00:07:17,645 --> 00:07:18,813
this is a shaker can.

134
00:07:21,774 --> 00:07:24,694
Okay, you come out of
the shadows, all right?

135
00:07:24,777 --> 00:07:26,279
And then, yee-ahhh!

136
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:28,114
It jars them pretty good.

137
00:07:28,156 --> 00:07:28,865
- Cool!

138
00:07:28,906 --> 00:07:31,033
Mind if I-
- Oh, yeah.

139
00:07:33,703 --> 00:07:34,787
All right, all right, all right,

140
00:07:34,829 --> 00:07:35,872
settle down, whoa!

141
00:07:35,955 --> 00:07:36,747
Settle down, champ.

142
00:07:36,789 --> 00:07:37,623
What's your name?

143
00:07:37,707 --> 00:07:38,833
- Tyler.
- Of course it is.

144
00:07:38,916 --> 00:07:40,918
I've got a job for you
and the skinny fellow

145
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:42,211
in a big scene down the hall.

146
00:07:42,253 --> 00:07:43,337
Moving on!

147
00:07:44,046 --> 00:07:45,173
- Hey Bart, Tyler's pretty

148
00:07:45,256 --> 00:07:47,633
good with that shaker
can, lots of practice.

149
00:07:48,676 --> 00:07:50,219
And you get to work with him!
- Oh, great.

150
00:07:50,261 --> 00:07:51,929
Thanks, dick-weed.

151
00:07:56,267 --> 00:07:57,268
- Okay here we come,

152
00:07:57,351 --> 00:07:58,895
comin' in, comin in, comin' in,
comin' in.

153
00:07:58,936 --> 00:08:00,104
Over there, over there, very
nice.

154
00:08:00,188 --> 00:08:01,355
Now before the big scene, our
guests

155
00:08:01,439 --> 00:08:04,442
must pass through the lye vat
dungeon.

156
00:08:04,525 --> 00:08:06,360
- What's a lye vat?

157
00:08:06,777 --> 00:08:09,197
- Yeah, lye was used in powder
form

158
00:08:09,238 --> 00:08:11,032
for cleaning hides,
chemically burning away

159
00:08:11,115 --> 00:08:12,742
the hair and the fat, yada,
yada, yada.

160
00:08:12,783 --> 00:08:15,244
But it also came in handy
if you were a serial killer

161
00:08:15,286 --> 00:08:17,955
trying to hide the stench of
your victims.

162
00:08:18,039 --> 00:08:19,665
- Gross.
- And you are?

163
00:08:19,707 --> 00:08:20,791
- Uh, Jake Jacobs.

164
00:08:20,833 --> 00:08:21,626
- Spectacular.

165
00:08:21,667 --> 00:08:22,752
Come over here.

166
00:08:22,793 --> 00:08:24,629
Now you will be in this part
of the slaughter dungeon

167
00:08:24,670 --> 00:08:26,547
wielding your bloody ax.

168
00:08:26,631 --> 00:08:28,299
You'll be dressed in a mask and
jump suit

169
00:08:28,341 --> 00:08:29,425
like your friend there.

170
00:08:29,509 --> 00:08:30,593
- Okay, ohh.

171
00:08:30,676 --> 00:08:32,595
Heavier than I thought.
- Yeah, that's

172
00:08:32,637 --> 00:08:33,930
because it's real.

173
00:08:34,013 --> 00:08:34,931
- Okay.
- Okay.

174
00:08:34,972 --> 00:08:36,891
Do you know how much a good
quality

175
00:08:36,933 --> 00:08:38,768
fake plastic ax costs?

176
00:08:38,809 --> 00:08:39,769
Damn right it's real!

177
00:08:39,852 --> 00:08:41,103
It's cheaper and it lasts
longer.

178
00:08:41,187 --> 00:08:43,272
The blade is not the
sharpest thing in the world,

179
00:08:43,314 --> 00:08:46,067
but it could hurt like hell
if you chop somebody with it.

180
00:08:46,150 --> 00:08:50,363
So, you hold it like this, and
threaten!

181
00:08:50,404 --> 00:08:51,322
All right?

182
00:08:51,405 --> 00:08:56,410
Now don't, let anybody grab it
from you.

183
00:09:01,123 --> 00:09:01,791
- Okay.

184
00:09:01,832 --> 00:09:03,042
- Good, okay, moving on.

185
00:09:03,084 --> 00:09:04,085
Chop chop!

186
00:09:04,126 --> 00:09:07,129
- Oh god it's real.
- Okay sexy man is crazy!

187
00:09:07,838 --> 00:09:09,298
- This is sweet.

188
00:09:09,966 --> 00:09:10,883
- I don't know.

189
00:09:10,967 --> 00:09:12,093
I think this Oliver guy knows a
little

190
00:09:12,176 --> 00:09:13,427
too much about hacking and
killing-

191
00:09:13,511 --> 00:09:15,513
- Yeah, and he's got plans
for ""the skinny fellow"".

192
00:09:15,555 --> 00:09:16,305
Chop chop!

193
00:09:24,605 --> 00:09:25,565
- Ha-ha!

194
00:09:25,606 --> 00:09:27,066
New for this year:

195
00:09:27,108 --> 00:09:29,318
The Raw-topsy Zone where, as you

196
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:31,571
can see, a number of hellish
morticians

197
00:09:31,612 --> 00:09:32,947
are watching a victim getting

198
00:09:32,989 --> 00:09:34,865
sliced up on the autopsy table.

199
00:09:34,907 --> 00:09:36,450
Now, sitting among the statues,

200
00:09:36,534 --> 00:09:40,663
looking just like the
dummies will be Tyler and-

201
00:09:40,705 --> 00:09:41,497
- Bart.

202
00:09:41,539 --> 00:09:42,373
- Bingo!

203
00:09:42,456 --> 00:09:44,000
You'll be frozen just like the
rest,

204
00:09:44,083 --> 00:09:47,128
and then you leap up and
boo-yah!

205
00:09:47,211 --> 00:09:49,380
You scream at unsuspecting
mazers.

206
00:09:49,422 --> 00:09:51,382
Now, you don't want to blow
your voice out, all right?

207
00:09:51,424 --> 00:09:53,467
So scream a couple of
times, and then other times

208
00:09:53,551 --> 00:09:57,597
you can use this aluminum
bat to hit the railing.

209
00:09:58,180 --> 00:09:59,557
Just don't hit anybody.

210
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:02,184
Remember, you scare fast then
pull back.

211
00:10:02,268 --> 00:10:04,937
You don't want some macho
creep punching you out.

212
00:10:04,979 --> 00:10:05,980
Dangerous.

213
00:10:06,063 --> 00:10:07,148
- Somebody takes a swing
at me and he's going down!

214
00:10:07,231 --> 00:10:08,691
- No, no, no Tyler.

215
00:10:08,774 --> 00:10:10,693
We do not slug the paying
guests.

216
00:10:10,735 --> 00:10:13,654
- Yeah, we're not supposed
to touch them at all, right?

217
00:10:13,696 --> 00:10:14,530
- That's right.

218
00:10:14,572 --> 00:10:15,239
No touchy.

219
00:10:15,323 --> 00:10:16,115
Too much liability.

220
00:10:16,157 --> 00:10:17,783
However we, the actors,

221
00:10:17,867 --> 00:10:20,119
can interact physically with
each other.

222
00:10:20,161 --> 00:10:22,705
- Tyler's all yours.
- For example, Summer

223
00:10:22,788 --> 00:10:25,583
here will play a live
victim getting sliced up

224
00:10:25,666 --> 00:10:26,751
by some mad doctor.

225
00:10:26,792 --> 00:10:29,003
You see, he amputates her leg

226
00:10:29,086 --> 00:10:30,546
while she's still squirming.

227
00:10:30,588 --> 00:10:32,173
It's a good gag.

228
00:10:32,214 --> 00:10:33,924
- Oh and I could be your doctor.

229
00:10:34,717 --> 00:10:36,093
Check this out!

230
00:10:36,135 --> 00:10:37,553
- No, PJ.

231
00:10:37,637 --> 00:10:38,387
No, Oliver.

232
00:10:38,471 --> 00:10:39,597
I told you, I'm helping you

233
00:10:39,639 --> 00:10:40,848
open this thing and then
we're going to Vegas

234
00:10:40,931 --> 00:10:42,475
to get married like you
promised.

235
00:10:42,516 --> 00:10:43,809
Right, honey?

236
00:10:44,977 --> 00:10:47,647
- Summer, could I talk to
you over here for a moment?

237
00:10:53,694 --> 00:10:54,820
- Look, I know you want to

238
00:10:54,904 --> 00:10:57,114
get the hell out of here
and start your new life

239
00:10:57,156 --> 00:10:58,574
with prince charming-

240
00:10:58,616 --> 00:10:59,992
- Awesome!

241
00:11:00,034 --> 00:11:01,661
- Excellent choice by the way.

242
00:11:01,744 --> 00:11:03,704
But I really need you here.

243
00:11:03,746 --> 00:11:04,580
- No you don't.

244
00:11:04,622 --> 00:11:05,790
You've got Claire, okay?

245
00:11:05,873 --> 00:11:07,166
I need to get out of my parent's
house.

246
00:11:07,249 --> 00:11:09,126
So we're getting married
this weekend as planned.

247
00:11:09,168 --> 00:11:10,503
- Look, open for me this Friday.

248
00:11:10,586 --> 00:11:13,130
If you can stay for Saturday and
Sunday

249
00:11:13,214 --> 00:11:15,675
I will make the honeymoon really
special.

250
00:11:15,716 --> 00:11:19,345
Come on you're the only
seasoned performer I've got.

251
00:11:20,930 --> 00:11:22,431
- All right I'll open for you
Friday

252
00:11:22,515 --> 00:11:25,768
and I'll talk to PJ about this
weekend.

253
00:11:25,810 --> 00:11:26,894
- Fair enough.

254
00:11:26,936 --> 00:11:29,855
Let's show the others
where they'll be stationed.

255
00:11:29,939 --> 00:11:31,524
And we are walking-

256
00:11:33,651 --> 00:11:36,404
- Oh, Tracy.
- Uh, I didn't do that-

257
00:11:38,406 --> 00:11:39,532
Oh my God I'm gonna puke!

258
00:11:39,615 --> 00:11:43,119
- What makes this smell?
- My own secret recipe.

259
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:46,288
- Why hello.
- Ugh that's bad.

260
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:49,583
That is so cool.

261
00:11:52,294 --> 00:11:54,004
- And we're walking.

262
00:11:54,463 --> 00:11:56,924
Okay good, come on, everyone
through the body bag room.

263
00:11:57,007 --> 00:11:58,718
I've turned the AC up in here to
turn this

264
00:11:58,759 --> 00:12:00,428
sucker into a freezer.

265
00:12:00,469 --> 00:12:02,346
Now, to the doll hall!

266
00:12:09,437 --> 00:12:10,688
Ha-ha!

267
00:12:10,730 --> 00:12:13,357
Isn't this fantastic!

268
00:12:13,399 --> 00:12:15,151
All right, and who's left?

269
00:12:15,192 --> 00:12:15,985
- Me.

270
00:12:16,026 --> 00:12:16,777
Darryl.

271
00:12:16,819 --> 00:12:17,528
- Bonanza!

272
00:12:17,570 --> 00:12:19,238
You will be in this zone

273
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:20,865
which was last year's big hit.

274
00:12:20,906 --> 00:12:24,577
It's entitled Dies and Dolls.

275
00:12:24,618 --> 00:12:25,953
You'll be dressed just as you
are,

276
00:12:25,995 --> 00:12:29,206
freaking people out with
your blood stained machete.

277
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:32,543
You know this still is my
favorite room.

278
00:12:32,626 --> 00:12:34,503
Every child's nightmare lives in
the eyes

279
00:12:34,545 --> 00:12:36,839
of these lifeless beings.

280
00:12:37,757 --> 00:12:40,134
I've been collecting them for
years.

281
00:12:40,676 --> 00:12:43,929
Years and years.

282
00:12:43,971 --> 00:12:44,722
- Yahhhh!

283
00:12:48,934 --> 00:12:49,685
You!

284
00:12:49,727 --> 00:12:50,644
You are-

285
00:12:50,686 --> 00:12:51,604
- Tracy!

286
00:12:51,645 --> 00:12:52,480
- Superlative!

287
00:12:52,521 --> 00:12:53,731
In this zone you will be a fresh

288
00:12:53,814 --> 00:12:55,483
victim wearing a wedding
dress and veil working up

289
00:12:55,524 --> 00:12:57,443
and down these stairs.

290
00:12:57,485 --> 00:12:58,778
Yes, you are a recent victim.

291
00:12:58,861 --> 00:13:01,614
Uh, you're turning vampire,
holding the bat-baby

292
00:13:01,697 --> 00:13:04,116
that you just gave bloody birth
to

293
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:06,619
via the old monkey-wrench
cesarean.

294
00:13:06,702 --> 00:13:07,661
- Oh my god.

295
00:13:07,703 --> 00:13:09,121
Can't I just get like

296
00:13:09,163 --> 00:13:10,915
a, shakey-up can?

297
00:13:10,956 --> 00:13:11,791
- No.

298
00:13:11,874 --> 00:13:14,418
No, you show people your mutated
newborn.

299
00:13:14,502 --> 00:13:16,629
Sir Oliver!

300
00:13:16,670 --> 00:13:19,048
It's ready!
- Ha-ha!

301
00:13:19,131 --> 00:13:21,258
Now, we are in for a treat!

302
00:13:25,012 --> 00:13:27,640
Ah, hello Jesus.

303
00:13:27,681 --> 00:13:28,432
- No, no, no.

304
00:13:28,474 --> 00:13:29,308
""Hey-Zu"".

305
00:13:29,391 --> 00:13:30,142
- Ex-scusi.

306
00:13:31,685 --> 00:13:32,436
I'm sorry, what?

307
00:13:32,478 --> 00:13:33,646
- It, it's ready.

308
00:13:33,729 --> 00:13:34,480
It's ready!

309
00:13:34,563 --> 00:13:35,314
- Ah ha-ha!

310
00:13:35,356 --> 00:13:36,315
Buen provetcho!

311
00:13:36,357 --> 00:13:38,651
And now welcome to the insanity

312
00:13:38,692 --> 00:13:41,195
of the Psycho Strobelight Room!

313
00:13:51,163 --> 00:13:52,039
Heh-heh-heh.

314
00:13:52,081 --> 00:13:53,165
Good!

315
00:13:53,207 --> 00:13:57,044
As usual, I will be in the
finale area,

316
00:13:57,127 --> 00:13:59,213
playing the pumpkin carver,

317
00:13:59,296 --> 00:14:02,174
scaring people shitless with

318
00:14:02,925 --> 00:14:05,052
Bloody Molly my trademarked

319
00:14:05,094 --> 00:14:06,720
signature patent pending gas
powered

320
00:14:06,804 --> 00:14:08,722
two cycle 20-inch chainsaw.

321
00:14:08,764 --> 00:14:11,559
Now, this is where I
break one of my own rules,

322
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:13,769
and only I can do it.

323
00:14:13,811 --> 00:14:14,854
Bart.

324
00:14:14,895 --> 00:14:15,688
Come here.

325
00:14:25,406 --> 00:14:26,323
You see?

326
00:14:26,365 --> 00:14:28,325
I locked the chain on,
so no chain no pain.

327
00:14:28,367 --> 00:14:30,995
Just a hell of a lot
of vibration and noise.

328
00:14:31,036 --> 00:14:32,037
Grazie, Hymie.

329
00:14:32,121 --> 00:14:33,622
Now, I wouldn't normally
touch anybody with it,

330
00:14:33,664 --> 00:14:35,207
but if there's some complete ass

331
00:14:35,291 --> 00:14:37,543
acting too cool in front of his
friends,

332
00:14:37,626 --> 00:14:40,337
I might feel the need
to give him a gut check,

333
00:14:40,421 --> 00:14:41,380
like ol' Bart there.

334
00:14:41,463 --> 00:14:43,841
Now add to this the smoke
machines,

335
00:14:43,883 --> 00:14:45,217
lots of light and sound effects,

336
00:14:45,301 --> 00:14:47,595
the strobe room, the chainsaw
finale,

337
00:14:47,636 --> 00:14:50,931
yada, yada, yada, we happily
freak out the customers

338
00:14:51,015 --> 00:14:52,600
who happily scamper into the

339
00:14:52,641 --> 00:14:54,268
gift shop to spend more money!

340
00:14:55,185 --> 00:14:56,478
Jesus!

341
00:14:56,562 --> 00:14:57,605
No, no, no,
""Hey-Zu"".

342
00:14:57,646 --> 00:14:58,480
- No, no, no.

343
00:14:58,522 --> 00:14:59,231
Whatever.

344
00:14:59,273 --> 00:15:00,232
What the hell was that?

345
00:15:06,906 --> 00:15:07,698
De nada.

346
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:08,782
Okay, uh, right.

347
00:15:08,824 --> 00:15:10,159
You go into the gift
shop and wait for Claire.

348
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:11,368
She'll give you your costumes

349
00:15:11,410 --> 00:15:14,079
and talk makeup for
anybody who needs help.

350
00:15:14,121 --> 00:15:15,623
Say that again but slower.

351
00:15:18,208 --> 00:15:19,627
- Yeah I've been coming
here the past few years.

352
00:15:19,668 --> 00:15:21,337
He's only open three
nights but at 10 bucks

353
00:15:21,378 --> 00:15:22,379
a head he makes a killing.

354
00:15:22,463 --> 00:15:23,339
- Oh, dude,

355
00:15:23,380 --> 00:15:24,465
I heard he used to manage a
house

356
00:15:24,506 --> 00:15:25,716
of horrors wax museum in London,

357
00:15:25,799 --> 00:15:27,051
but he got busted for
using real blood or a real

358
00:15:27,134 --> 00:15:28,344
corpse or something.

359
00:15:28,385 --> 00:15:29,511
- No, no!

360
00:15:29,553 --> 00:15:31,055
I heard he killed a goat live
just to watch people react.

361
00:15:31,138 --> 00:15:32,222
- Bullshit.

362
00:15:32,264 --> 00:15:33,515
- Yeah, no he got fired and
went to prison for, like,

363
00:15:33,599 --> 00:15:34,350
animal cruelty or something.

364
00:15:34,433 --> 00:15:35,351
- Oh no, no.

365
00:15:35,434 --> 00:15:36,477
I heard he went to
prison because he killed

366
00:15:36,518 --> 00:15:37,353
a boney, pasty virgin.

367
00:15:37,394 --> 00:15:38,854
- Oh, shut up asswipe.

368
00:15:41,690 --> 00:15:45,819
- Ooh, shopping!

369
00:15:45,903 --> 00:15:48,405
Oh, I wonder if we get, like,
half-off.

370
00:16:06,799 --> 00:16:08,133
- Who's the slut?

371
00:16:12,012 --> 00:16:13,055
Perfect.

372
00:16:13,764 --> 00:16:17,226
All right I designed this look
for you

373
00:16:17,768 --> 00:16:21,188
with this make-up illustration
you can work from.

374
00:16:21,271 --> 00:16:23,273
Your costume's over there, go
try it on

375
00:16:23,357 --> 00:16:25,943
and I'll help you with the
makeup later.

376
00:16:27,027 --> 00:16:28,779
The bride?

377
00:16:28,821 --> 00:16:30,030
Bat-boy's mother?

378
00:16:31,699 --> 00:16:33,242
I didn't design the dress.

379
00:16:33,325 --> 00:16:34,326
- Thank God.

380
00:16:34,410 --> 00:16:37,246
- Bought it at a consignment
shop, but it works.

381
00:16:37,329 --> 00:16:40,916
And your makeup needs to be more
defined.

382
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,668
Okay, we need to be able
to see it behind the veil.

383
00:16:42,751 --> 00:16:44,795
Why don't you slip that on, try
it out.

384
00:16:44,837 --> 00:16:45,879
- Great.

385
00:16:45,963 --> 00:16:47,589
- Dummies?
- Yo!

386
00:16:48,340 --> 00:16:50,175
- I mean morticians.

387
00:16:50,801 --> 00:16:53,804
You guys need to look just
like the mortician dummi-

388
00:16:57,599 --> 00:16:59,101
- Sorry.
- Costumes are over there,

389
00:16:59,184 --> 00:17:03,731
and I made boy-friendly
makeup directions for you.

390
00:17:03,772 --> 00:17:05,065
- Yes!

391
00:17:05,107 --> 00:17:06,191
- Makeup is with your costumes

392
00:17:06,275 --> 00:17:07,484
and we don't have a lot of room
in here

393
00:17:07,568 --> 00:17:09,862
so we put on our makeup here in
the shop.

394
00:17:09,945 --> 00:17:12,156
We rigged up a curtained
off changing area,

395
00:17:12,197 --> 00:17:14,742
it has one bench and one mirror-

396
00:17:15,784 --> 00:17:18,078
- Whoa!
- That's for the girls.

397
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:21,040
Boys just use the shop mirror.

398
00:17:23,667 --> 00:17:25,669
Masked psychos?

399
00:17:27,254 --> 00:17:30,132
I see you have your costume
already.

400
00:17:30,174 --> 00:17:31,258
Fit okay?

401
00:17:32,092 --> 00:17:32,885
- Yeah.

402
00:17:32,926 --> 00:17:34,136
Great.

403
00:17:34,178 --> 00:17:35,888
- And your mask, it's up there.

404
00:17:36,305 --> 00:17:39,433
There's lots of welder's gloves
and a mechanic jump suit,

405
00:17:39,475 --> 00:17:42,102
just pick ones that fit.

406
00:17:42,144 --> 00:17:43,062
Summer?

407
00:17:43,103 --> 00:17:44,855
I have your hospital
gown and doctor scrubs

408
00:17:44,938 --> 00:17:47,232
for PJ if Oliver can talk you
two into-

409
00:17:47,274 --> 00:17:48,275
- Claire, I don't know.

410
00:17:48,358 --> 00:17:50,235
Okay, we're leaving town to get
married.

411
00:17:54,156 --> 00:17:55,199
- Need a dress?

412
00:18:02,706 --> 00:18:03,791
- I look like a doctor.

413
00:18:18,847 --> 00:18:19,890
Perverts!

414
00:18:56,093 --> 00:18:57,052
- So, Claire,

415
00:18:57,094 --> 00:18:58,762
what part do you play?

416
00:18:58,804 --> 00:19:01,223
- Yeah, 'cause I really like
your costume.

417
00:19:01,306 --> 00:19:02,224
- Yeah.
- No.

418
00:19:02,307 --> 00:19:04,434
I stay here and work the gift
shop.

419
00:19:04,518 --> 00:19:08,355
Spider gets their money going
in, I get 'em going out.

420
00:19:08,897 --> 00:19:11,984
All right remember everybody,
today Spider

421
00:19:12,025 --> 00:19:14,611
rehearses you, but tomorrow
night we open.

422
00:19:14,653 --> 00:19:15,404
All right?

423
00:19:15,445 --> 00:19:16,238
Any questions?

424
00:19:16,321 --> 00:19:17,030
- Uh, yeah.

425
00:19:17,072 --> 00:19:18,699
Uh, who breaks us?

426
00:19:18,782 --> 00:19:19,658
- No breaks.

427
00:19:19,741 --> 00:19:21,285
- What?
- Look.

428
00:19:21,326 --> 00:19:22,452
We're open from seven p.m.

429
00:19:22,536 --> 00:19:23,954
until the last guest goes
through.

430
00:19:23,996 --> 00:19:25,414
All right, that's usually
'till, like midnight

431
00:19:25,497 --> 00:19:27,374
on the first two nights
and two a.m. on Halloween.

432
00:19:27,416 --> 00:19:28,458
- What if I have to pee?

433
00:19:28,542 --> 00:19:29,418
- Then pee!

434
00:19:29,459 --> 00:19:31,086
There's a toilet right there.

435
00:19:31,128 --> 00:19:32,754
And that's for everybody.

436
00:19:32,796 --> 00:19:34,631
- Okay, where do I smoke?

437
00:19:34,715 --> 00:19:36,008
- Out the back door in the
alley.

438
00:19:36,091 --> 00:19:38,427
Look, just duck out, do
whatever it is you need to do.

439
00:19:38,468 --> 00:19:39,803
No one in the maze is going to
say

440
00:19:39,887 --> 00:19:41,638
""Hey, there's supposed to
be a psycho killer here"".

441
00:19:41,722 --> 00:19:45,350
Well, except maybe some
of our regulars. You!

442
00:19:45,392 --> 00:19:46,476
You were here last year, right?

443
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:48,103
- Uh, I only went though seven
times.

444
00:19:48,187 --> 00:19:49,771
Not like some of those
no-lifes who go through

445
00:19:49,813 --> 00:19:51,273
10 times a night if they can.

446
00:19:51,315 --> 00:19:52,441
- Yeah, 'cause you have a life.

447
00:19:52,482 --> 00:19:53,734
- Anyway, if you have to

448
00:19:53,775 --> 00:19:56,111
take a break just get back to
your post quickly so people

449
00:19:56,153 --> 00:19:56,987
get their money's worth.

450
00:19:57,029 --> 00:19:59,198
It's only three nights.

451
00:19:59,239 --> 00:20:00,407
You'll survive.

452
00:20:00,490 --> 00:20:01,617
And if we do good business,

453
00:20:01,658 --> 00:20:03,827
Oliver takes care of us with
nice bonuses.

454
00:20:03,911 --> 00:20:05,495
That's why I'm here.

455
00:20:05,579 --> 00:20:07,706
- I'm gonna need some help!

456
00:20:08,290 --> 00:20:09,166
- All right.

457
00:20:09,208 --> 00:20:12,002
Uh, boys, go see what Oliver
needs.

458
00:20:12,044 --> 00:20:13,253
And then everybody report to
Spider

459
00:20:13,337 --> 00:20:15,005
after lunch for rehearsals.

460
00:20:15,088 --> 00:20:16,131
Tyler!
- Yeah!

461
00:20:16,215 --> 00:20:19,426
- Every evening one person
has to come in an hour

462
00:20:19,468 --> 00:20:20,802
early to help Spider and Oliver

463
00:20:20,844 --> 00:20:22,137
prep the house for our guests.

464
00:20:22,221 --> 00:20:23,680
And you're up first.

465
00:20:23,764 --> 00:20:25,557
So, tomorrow at six.

466
00:20:25,599 --> 00:20:28,393
- I'll be here at five!
- Whatever.

467
00:20:30,479 --> 00:20:31,855
- High as you can there, Pablo.

468
00:20:31,939 --> 00:20:33,941
- Didn't this used to
be like, a Dollar Store?

469
00:20:33,982 --> 00:20:35,692
- No, it was a porno shop.

470
00:20:35,776 --> 00:20:37,903
- No way!
- Yeah!

471
00:20:37,945 --> 00:20:38,820
Douche!

472
00:20:38,904 --> 00:20:40,155
- You know actually this entire
attraction

473
00:20:40,197 --> 00:20:43,325
can fit into two pod containers.

474
00:20:43,367 --> 00:20:44,076
Yeah!

475
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:45,035
It takes me, Spider and half

476
00:20:45,077 --> 00:20:46,203
a dozen man-power guys.

477
00:20:46,286 --> 00:20:48,538
We can put the whole thing
up in a couple of days.

478
00:20:48,622 --> 00:20:51,250
Actually, Pablo, can you
get your men together?

479
00:20:51,291 --> 00:20:52,542
Uh, todos juntos?

480
00:20:52,626 --> 00:20:53,460
- Ah, si si.

481
00:20:57,881 --> 00:20:58,882
- Bellissimo.

482
00:20:58,966 --> 00:21:00,509
I'll tell ya, the biggest pain
in the ass

483
00:21:00,592 --> 00:21:03,428
is getting this sign up so hola
muchachos.

484
00:21:03,470 --> 00:21:06,390
Un, dos, trio!

485
00:21:11,645 --> 00:21:12,854
- ""Prepare to be scared.

486
00:21:12,896 --> 00:21:14,690
Scare Zone Three this weekend!""

487
00:21:14,731 --> 00:21:16,108
Who comes up with this?

488
00:21:16,149 --> 00:21:17,067
- Oliver does.

489
00:21:17,109 --> 00:21:18,318
Keeps all this stuff in storage,

490
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:20,404
pulls it out once a
year and does his thing.

491
00:21:20,445 --> 00:21:21,571
- Hey, how do you think he makes

492
00:21:21,613 --> 00:21:23,407
that toilet scene smell so bad?

493
00:21:23,490 --> 00:21:24,950
- Ah he shits in the pots and
waits

494
00:21:24,992 --> 00:21:25,951
for the mold to grow.

495
00:21:25,993 --> 00:21:27,077
- No way!

496
00:21:27,119 --> 00:21:28,036
- Ha!

497
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:29,371
Jeez Bart, I don't know,
maybe he uses old socks

498
00:21:29,454 --> 00:21:31,415
or fertilizer or something.

499
00:21:31,456 --> 00:21:33,250
What do you think about Claire?

500
00:21:33,292 --> 00:21:34,001
- Freak.

501
00:21:34,042 --> 00:21:35,085
Goth gone wild.

502
00:21:35,127 --> 00:21:37,212
- I don't know, man,
awful smart to be a freak.

503
00:21:37,254 --> 00:21:38,422
Talented too.

504
00:21:38,463 --> 00:21:39,464
- Freak.

505
00:21:39,506 --> 00:21:42,634
""The Psycho-splatter
Raw-topsy Slaughter Dungeon.""

506
00:21:43,593 --> 00:21:45,387
- Shit mother!

507
00:22:04,364 --> 00:22:05,198
- Damn!

508
00:22:05,282 --> 00:22:06,616
Maybe I shouldn't have come so
early.

509
00:22:14,124 --> 00:22:14,791
Hey!

510
00:22:14,875 --> 00:22:15,625
I'm here to-

511
00:22:59,169 --> 00:22:59,878
- What?

512
00:22:59,961 --> 00:23:01,463
- Uh, I think they're ready.

513
00:23:01,505 --> 00:23:03,048
Can we open early?

514
00:23:03,090 --> 00:23:03,799
- No.

515
00:23:03,882 --> 00:23:04,549
Hell no man!

516
00:23:04,633 --> 00:23:05,550
Tyler never showed.

517
00:23:05,592 --> 00:23:06,593
Me and Oliver had to open

518
00:23:06,676 --> 00:23:08,678
this whole damn place by
ourselves.

519
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:09,805
Shithead.

520
00:23:10,597 --> 00:23:11,640
Hold on.

521
00:23:13,225 --> 00:23:14,267
All right, you can go in now.

522
00:23:14,351 --> 00:23:14,976
Go!

523
00:23:15,018 --> 00:23:16,686
Go-go-go hurry up!

524
00:23:20,565 --> 00:23:21,566
All right you pussy worms!

525
00:23:21,608 --> 00:23:22,567
You ready to get freaked out?

526
00:23:22,609 --> 00:23:23,819
Yeah!

527
00:23:23,902 --> 00:23:26,279
- Are you ready for some blood
and guts?

528
00:23:26,321 --> 00:23:27,239
Yeah!

529
00:23:27,322 --> 00:23:28,615
- Then get ready for Scare Zone
Three:

530
00:23:28,698 --> 00:23:31,284
The Psycho-splatter
Raw-topsy Slaughter Dungeon!

531
00:23:31,326 --> 00:23:33,912
Yeah!

532
00:23:33,954 --> 00:23:35,497
- Opening in just 10 minutes!

533
00:23:37,958 --> 00:23:39,000
- Yeah.

534
00:23:39,543 --> 00:23:40,502
Hey, no masks in the maze.

535
00:23:40,585 --> 00:23:41,503
You guys know that!

536
00:23:41,545 --> 00:23:42,337
- Oh, no-no-no.

537
00:23:42,379 --> 00:23:43,505
Sorry Spidey.

538
00:23:43,547 --> 00:23:45,173
- Oh, hey freaky geeky.

539
00:23:45,215 --> 00:23:47,050
How've you been, man?

540
00:23:47,134 --> 00:23:49,678
Wow, you guys startin' to
multiply now.

541
00:23:50,137 --> 00:23:51,179
It was just the two of you
comin'

542
00:23:51,263 --> 00:23:52,222
in the last couple of years

543
00:23:52,264 --> 00:23:53,432
over and over and over again.

544
00:23:53,473 --> 00:23:54,474
I mean not that I mind.

545
00:23:54,516 --> 00:23:55,767
I like that you guys have no
life.

546
00:23:55,851 --> 00:23:56,935
Ha!

547
00:23:57,018 --> 00:23:58,145
As is our tradition,

548
00:23:58,228 --> 00:24:00,355
we have the winner of our
promotional Scare Zone

549
00:24:00,439 --> 00:24:02,899
T-shirt contest officially

550
00:24:02,941 --> 00:24:04,067
to our chamber of horrors!

551
00:24:04,151 --> 00:24:05,318
Yeah, baby!

552
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:08,238
Woo-hoo!

553
00:24:12,075 --> 00:24:13,452
- It's open!

554
00:24:15,662 --> 00:24:17,956
- Thank you Miss Amber!

555
00:24:21,209 --> 00:24:22,419
All right boys, you know the
score,

556
00:24:22,461 --> 00:24:24,254
move inside to my podium and
wait there

557
00:24:24,337 --> 00:24:27,215
until I give the signal we're
open and I snatch your money.

558
00:24:27,299 --> 00:24:28,258
Ha!

559
00:24:30,552 --> 00:24:33,138
Excuse me, excuse me
out of the way please.

560
00:24:33,180 --> 00:24:36,433
Hey, man, Scare Zone 2, Dies &
Dolls, man.

561
00:24:36,475 --> 00:24:37,309
I love loyalty.

562
00:24:37,350 --> 00:24:38,810
That's good, that's good stuff.

563
00:24:38,894 --> 00:24:40,770
- Yeah, hey, when's Oliver going
to offer

564
00:24:40,812 --> 00:24:44,816
an unlimited admissions pass
for the regular customers.

565
00:24:44,858 --> 00:24:45,775
- Heh-heh.

566
00:24:45,817 --> 00:24:47,027
Why would he do that?

567
00:24:47,068 --> 00:24:49,154
You guys are stupid enough
to pay 10 bucks every time.

568
00:24:49,196 --> 00:24:50,906
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!

569
00:24:50,989 --> 00:24:51,823
Hi Claire!

570
00:24:53,742 --> 00:24:55,118
- We're good to go.

571
00:24:55,202 --> 00:24:57,579
- All right guys now remember no
masks,

572
00:24:57,621 --> 00:24:59,915
no smoking, no cameras!

573
00:24:59,998 --> 00:25:01,500
No checks, no credit cards.

574
00:25:01,541 --> 00:25:02,667
Just cash, baby.

575
00:25:02,751 --> 00:25:03,835
All right my fellow zonies!

576
00:25:03,919 --> 00:25:06,129
Scare Zone Three is now open for
business!

577
00:25:13,345 --> 00:25:14,596
- Raar!

578
00:25:14,638 --> 00:25:15,680
Shit!

579
00:25:37,827 --> 00:25:38,912
- Ah yes.

580
00:25:40,205 --> 00:25:41,039
- Help me!

581
00:25:50,465 --> 00:25:51,591
- Help me.

582
00:25:51,633 --> 00:25:52,592
Help me.

583
00:25:52,634 --> 00:25:53,635
Stop it!

584
00:25:53,677 --> 00:25:54,761
Help me.

585
00:26:03,770 --> 00:26:04,563
- Yah!

586
00:26:04,604 --> 00:26:05,647
Haaaa!

587
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:18,535
- All clear?

588
00:26:18,577 --> 00:26:19,869
Front door locked?

589
00:26:19,953 --> 00:26:23,415
All right, that is it for the
night!

590
00:26:26,167 --> 00:26:29,004
So we did pretty good for
the first night, right guys?

591
00:26:29,045 --> 00:26:30,797
Everybody got their costumes
hung up?

592
00:26:30,839 --> 00:26:31,715
Claire will pay everybody

593
00:26:31,756 --> 00:26:32,841
and let everybody out.

594
00:26:32,882 --> 00:26:35,093
Spider and I will close up the
attraction.

595
00:26:35,135 --> 00:26:37,596
Thank you for a great first
night.

596
00:26:37,679 --> 00:26:41,266
Claire, give everybody an extra
60 clams.

597
00:26:42,309 --> 00:26:43,226
Spider!

598
00:26:43,268 --> 00:26:44,352
Oliver!

599
00:26:44,436 --> 00:26:45,812
- Bullshit.

600
00:26:45,854 --> 00:26:47,814
This is why I'm leaving.

601
00:26:47,856 --> 00:26:48,773
I hate this town.

602
00:26:48,815 --> 00:26:49,858
This job is killing me.

603
00:26:49,941 --> 00:26:51,234
I'm in desperate need of a spa
treatment.

604
00:26:51,276 --> 00:26:52,736
- Hey, an extra 60 bucks isn't
ba-

605
00:26:52,819 --> 00:26:54,738
- And before I get home to
my goddamn parents' house

606
00:26:54,779 --> 00:26:56,781
where I'm living to try and
save money, horn dog over here

607
00:26:56,823 --> 00:26:59,242
is going to want to hump me up
one side and down the other.

608
00:26:59,326 --> 00:27:01,411
Of course I want him to so there
goes half

609
00:27:01,494 --> 00:27:04,414
the money we just made on a
cheap hotel.

610
00:27:04,456 --> 00:27:05,665
- We can do it in the car!

611
00:27:05,749 --> 00:27:07,125
- We are so out of here
tomorrow, Peege.

612
00:27:07,167 --> 00:27:10,920
- Um, tomorrow you're opening.

613
00:27:10,962 --> 00:27:11,796
- What?

614
00:27:11,838 --> 00:27:13,506
- Yeah, Spider has his
appointment,

615
00:27:13,590 --> 00:27:14,633
Oliver's not in 'till seven,

616
00:27:14,674 --> 00:27:15,717
you're the only one that knows
how

617
00:27:15,759 --> 00:27:17,177
to run the smoke machines.

618
00:27:17,260 --> 00:27:18,970
- Oh my God!

619
00:27:19,012 --> 00:27:19,846
- Thanks, Summer!

620
00:27:19,929 --> 00:27:21,556
""Thanks, Summer.""

621
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:23,391
- What happened to
Amber the T-shirt pixie?

622
00:27:23,475 --> 00:27:26,144
- Oh, she's waiting for you in
the car.

623
00:27:26,186 --> 00:27:26,895
Bart!

624
00:27:26,978 --> 00:27:27,812
I'm kidding.

625
00:27:27,896 --> 00:27:29,105
Amber is only here for the
opening

626
00:27:29,147 --> 00:27:32,317
and then she goes to
her regular ""night"" job!

627
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:33,485
- Ohhhhhh.
- Get it.

628
00:27:33,526 --> 00:27:35,654
- Well, that just leaves
me, Tracy and Margo!

629
00:27:35,737 --> 00:27:38,031
Hey you guys want to hit
Denny's?

630
00:27:38,823 --> 00:27:39,949
- Sure.

631
00:27:39,991 --> 00:27:40,992
- Uh, Darryl?

632
00:27:41,034 --> 00:27:43,411
Can you stay a sec and help me
count cash?

633
00:27:43,453 --> 00:27:44,371
Sure.

634
00:27:44,454 --> 00:27:46,998
- Have fun with Edwina
Scissorhands.

635
00:27:52,712 --> 00:27:55,090
- Is this a lot of money for day
one?

636
00:27:58,927 --> 00:28:01,221
You're pretty fast with that
calculator.

637
00:28:01,262 --> 00:28:03,473
Did you learn that at school
or...

638
00:28:12,899 --> 00:28:14,025
Classic.

639
00:28:14,067 --> 00:28:15,276
- He's scared.
- That was awesome!

640
00:28:15,318 --> 00:28:17,529
- That was better than last
year.

641
00:28:18,697 --> 00:28:21,449
I'll never get tired of that
one.

642
00:28:29,416 --> 00:28:31,668
- Hey, boner!
- Shut up!

643
00:28:31,751 --> 00:28:34,337
Man, if I hear one more ""boner""
line.

644
00:28:34,379 --> 00:28:35,505
- I don't know if this is worth

645
00:28:35,547 --> 00:28:36,464
an extra 40 bucks, man.

646
00:28:36,506 --> 00:28:37,799
We could get killed out here.

647
00:28:37,882 --> 00:28:41,177
Hey, I liked flagging
parked cars a lot better.

648
00:28:41,219 --> 00:28:42,303
- What?

649
00:28:42,345 --> 00:28:45,473
- I said I had an amazing night
counting money with Claire.

650
00:28:45,515 --> 00:28:46,725
- Yeah, sure you did.

651
00:28:46,808 --> 00:28:47,892
- Oh, we talked and laughed

652
00:28:47,976 --> 00:28:50,603
and she told me about her
family.

653
00:28:50,687 --> 00:28:51,396
- Yeah, who?

654
00:28:51,438 --> 00:28:52,647
The Addams Family?

655
00:28:54,524 --> 00:28:56,234
- Yeah!

656
00:28:56,276 --> 00:28:56,985
Look, man.

657
00:28:57,026 --> 00:28:58,611
She's a freak all right?

658
00:28:58,653 --> 00:29:00,363
- All right, a freak that can
add.

659
00:29:00,405 --> 00:29:02,157
Why are you focusing on her
when you know we can have

660
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:04,951
Margo's mangoes and Tracy's
tangerines!

661
00:29:06,745 --> 00:29:09,789
- Ah man, fu, was that a beer
bottle?

662
00:29:09,831 --> 00:29:10,999
- Shit mother!

663
00:29:14,836 --> 00:29:16,004
- Will you just stop?

664
00:29:16,045 --> 00:29:17,088
- What?

665
00:29:18,548 --> 00:29:19,632
- Stop it!

666
00:29:27,474 --> 00:29:30,393
Peege, can you hand me
another liter of fluid?

667
00:29:33,104 --> 00:29:36,524
- You know, I'd much rather be
giving you my bodily fluids.

668
00:29:36,608 --> 00:29:39,027
- That's sweet, honey,
but haven't you had enough

669
00:29:39,068 --> 00:29:39,944
of me by now?

670
00:29:40,862 --> 00:29:41,738
I'll could never get enough of
you.

671
00:29:41,821 --> 00:29:42,781
You are my-

672
00:29:42,822 --> 00:29:44,115
- Don't say it.

673
00:29:44,157 --> 00:29:45,200
- You are my-

674
00:29:45,241 --> 00:29:46,743
- Don't say it!

675
00:29:51,289 --> 00:29:52,207
Big boy.

676
00:29:52,248 --> 00:29:53,124
Come on.

677
00:29:53,166 --> 00:29:53,958
To the table.

678
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:54,834
To the table!

679
00:29:54,876 --> 00:29:55,627
Come on!

680
00:29:57,170 --> 00:29:59,088
Take your shirt off, take your
shirt off!

681
00:29:59,172 --> 00:30:00,423
Take it off!

682
00:30:06,638 --> 00:30:07,597
No, stop.
- What?

683
00:30:07,639 --> 00:30:09,265
- Stop, stop.

684
00:30:33,331 --> 00:30:34,499
- There.

685
00:30:34,541 --> 00:30:35,625
I got him.

686
00:30:37,752 --> 00:30:39,712
- I have to finish opening.

687
00:30:39,754 --> 00:30:41,172
- Ahhh, c'mon Summer!

688
00:30:41,256 --> 00:30:44,300
- I have to turn on the
lights and the sound.

689
00:30:44,342 --> 00:30:45,677
Get your shirt!

690
00:30:53,059 --> 00:30:55,770
Where's the frickin' audio?

691
00:30:57,939 --> 00:30:58,648
PJ!

692
00:30:58,690 --> 00:30:59,941
Stop playing with the chainsaw!

693
00:31:02,318 --> 00:31:02,986
PJ!

694
00:31:03,027 --> 00:31:04,362
Knock it off!

695
00:31:11,202 --> 00:31:12,370
PJ!

696
00:31:12,453 --> 00:31:13,037
PJ?

697
00:31:13,121 --> 00:31:15,123
What the fuck are...

698
00:31:22,130 --> 00:31:23,381
PJ?

699
00:31:23,464 --> 00:31:24,465
PJ!

700
00:31:51,284 --> 00:31:52,243
Scare Zone!

701
00:31:52,327 --> 00:31:53,244
Scare Zone!

702
00:31:53,328 --> 00:31:54,078
Scare Zone!

703
00:31:54,162 --> 00:31:54,913
Scare Zone!

704
00:31:54,996 --> 00:31:55,747
Scare Zone!

705
00:31:55,830 --> 00:31:56,581
Scare Zone!

706
00:31:56,664 --> 00:31:57,457
Scare Zone!

707
00:32:24,025 --> 00:32:24,859
Open!

708
00:32:24,901 --> 00:32:25,693
Open!

709
00:32:25,735 --> 00:32:26,736
Open!

710
00:32:26,819 --> 00:32:28,905
- Will you shut up!

711
00:32:28,947 --> 00:32:30,990
Oh shut up, calm down.

712
00:32:31,074 --> 00:32:33,284
We're not even open for
another half an hour.

713
00:32:33,368 --> 00:32:35,161
- Can't you open a little
earlier?

714
00:32:35,203 --> 00:32:36,204
Yeah!

715
00:32:36,287 --> 00:32:38,122
- I'm a little busy in here!

716
00:32:38,164 --> 00:32:42,877
Let me find something to
entertain you until we open.

717
00:32:45,380 --> 00:32:46,172
- No!

718
00:32:46,255 --> 00:32:46,965
No!

719
00:32:53,262 --> 00:32:54,305
Help me!

720
00:32:55,348 --> 00:32:56,724
Help me!

721
00:33:09,487 --> 00:33:11,072
- That was awesome!

722
00:33:12,782 --> 00:33:14,200
Do it again!

723
00:33:14,283 --> 00:33:15,410
Do it again!

724
00:33:15,493 --> 00:33:16,786
Do it again!

725
00:33:16,869 --> 00:33:17,996
Do it again!

726
00:33:18,079 --> 00:33:19,330
Do it again!

727
00:33:21,457 --> 00:33:23,835
- Hey man, why do I have to do
this again?

728
00:33:23,876 --> 00:33:24,627
It's PJ's turn!

729
00:33:24,669 --> 00:33:25,753
- PJ's gone, all right?

730
00:33:25,837 --> 00:33:26,838
You keep them happy.

731
00:33:26,921 --> 00:33:28,089
I've got to finish opening the
place up.

732
00:33:28,172 --> 00:33:29,590
- Wait, wait, wait, wait!
- What?

733
00:33:29,674 --> 00:33:30,883
- PJ's gone?

734
00:33:30,925 --> 00:33:31,843
And Summer too?

735
00:33:31,926 --> 00:33:32,885
- Yeah man gone and eloped!

736
00:33:32,927 --> 00:33:33,678
Something.

737
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:34,804
I don't know.

738
00:33:34,846 --> 00:33:36,222
Look, they opened the
place and apparently split.

739
00:33:36,264 --> 00:33:37,557
Okay, good luck to 'em, good
riddance.

740
00:33:37,640 --> 00:33:39,851
Go out there and keep
this crowd from rioting!

741
00:33:39,892 --> 00:33:40,977
Go, be a man!

742
00:33:55,158 --> 00:33:56,409
- I'm all by myself in here!

743
00:33:56,492 --> 00:33:58,870
First no Tyler, now no Summer
and PJ!

744
00:33:58,953 --> 00:34:00,455
- Relax my little mortician,

745
00:34:00,496 --> 00:34:03,249
Oliver Peters has it all sorted.

746
00:34:03,291 --> 00:34:04,834
At least for tonight.

747
00:34:04,876 --> 00:34:08,504
Ta-ta-da-ta-ta-ta-taaaa!

748
00:34:08,546 --> 00:34:09,464
Behold!

749
00:34:09,547 --> 00:34:12,967
An international twist
to our tortuous tale!

750
00:34:46,793 --> 00:34:48,377
Hey!

751
00:34:58,638 --> 00:34:59,722
- Darryl!

752
00:35:00,431 --> 00:35:02,558
You can come in now.

753
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:03,392
C'mon man go.

754
00:35:03,476 --> 00:35:05,770
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go.

755
00:35:09,398 --> 00:35:10,483
All right people, we're ready

756
00:35:10,525 --> 00:35:12,276
for you if your ready for a boo!

757
00:35:15,029 --> 00:35:16,614
As I was saying, no masks,

758
00:35:16,656 --> 00:35:18,407
no smoking, no...

759
00:35:18,449 --> 00:35:21,244
Hey, what are you three, what?

760
00:35:21,327 --> 00:35:23,663
You three bong turds
trying to get us shut down?

761
00:35:23,704 --> 00:35:26,165
- You got a problem with it,
""mon""?

762
00:35:27,041 --> 00:35:27,834
- Oh, no baby.

763
00:35:27,917 --> 00:35:29,085
I love the devil's lettuce.

764
00:35:29,710 --> 00:35:31,129
I also like my job.

765
00:35:31,212 --> 00:35:33,714
So, basically what I'm
trying to say here is

766
00:35:33,756 --> 00:35:35,049
nobody gets in until these three

767
00:35:35,133 --> 00:35:37,677
puff-puff mother-fuckers are out
of here!

768
00:35:37,718 --> 00:35:38,553
Smoke on that!

769
00:35:38,594 --> 00:35:40,304
- Hey, hey, shut the fuck up!

770
00:35:40,388 --> 00:35:42,223
- Get out of here assholes!

771
00:35:42,265 --> 00:35:43,766
- Kiss my ass, bitch!

772
00:35:43,808 --> 00:35:45,393
- Who you callin' bitch, bitch?

773
00:35:45,476 --> 00:35:48,729
- What are you looking
at you big Sasquatch?

774
00:35:48,771 --> 00:35:50,106
- Bye-bye boys.

775
00:35:50,148 --> 00:35:51,190
Toodles!

776
00:35:52,066 --> 00:35:53,985
And now my pretties,

777
00:35:54,026 --> 00:35:55,695
Scare Zone Three is open

778
00:35:55,736 --> 00:35:57,363
for the second night of fright!

779
00:35:57,405 --> 00:35:58,197
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!

780
00:36:03,244 --> 00:36:04,996
- Ha-ha-ha-ha-ah.

781
00:36:07,373 --> 00:36:09,625
I love Halloween.

782
00:36:15,381 --> 00:36:16,424
- Whoa!

783
00:36:21,387 --> 00:36:22,138
- Shit!

784
00:36:22,180 --> 00:36:23,264
- Ha-haaa.

785
00:36:34,358 --> 00:36:36,194
- Hey, I hate 20s!

786
00:36:40,072 --> 00:36:42,241
- Okay, that's the real dummy
there.

787
00:36:42,283 --> 00:36:43,409
This light is out.

788
00:36:43,451 --> 00:36:46,579
That guy used to be a girl,
and this is a fake leg!

789
00:36:57,340 --> 00:37:00,968
- Oh, what the hell happened to
this?

790
00:37:01,510 --> 00:37:02,762
- Who want's a beer?

791
00:37:04,555 --> 00:37:08,643
To the best ""day two"" in
the history of Scare Zone!

792
00:37:08,684 --> 00:37:09,936
Cheers!

793
00:37:09,977 --> 00:37:11,062
- We couldn't do any better
unless

794
00:37:11,103 --> 00:37:12,647
we were actually killing people.

795
00:37:13,481 --> 00:37:15,024
That would pack 'em in.

796
00:37:15,066 --> 00:37:16,609
- It actually would, you know.

797
00:37:19,445 --> 00:37:20,947
- Okay Claire.

798
00:37:20,988 --> 00:37:22,531
You're gonna freak out these
kids.

799
00:37:22,615 --> 00:37:24,992
Look, you guys did great
tonight.

800
00:37:25,034 --> 00:37:27,912
The spirits of the dead are with
us.

801
00:37:27,995 --> 00:37:28,704
- Whooooooo!

802
00:37:28,746 --> 00:37:29,830
- I would like everybody

803
00:37:29,872 --> 00:37:32,291
to take an extra 100
bones out of the till.

804
00:37:32,333 --> 00:37:34,377
Okay, Spider, let's go and close
up.

805
00:37:34,418 --> 00:37:35,628
Oh, I'm gonna need some extra
help

806
00:37:35,711 --> 00:37:37,546
with a broken window and wall
facade.

807
00:37:37,588 --> 00:37:38,714
I need two guys to hold it in

808
00:37:38,798 --> 00:37:41,175
place while we nail gun it to
the wall.

809
00:37:42,301 --> 00:37:44,428
It'll only take about 10
minutes.

810
00:37:44,971 --> 00:37:46,222
I'll throw in another 20 bucks.

811
00:37:46,305 --> 00:37:47,348
- I'm in.
- There you go.

812
00:37:47,431 --> 00:37:48,474
- No, uh, Oliver, you've been
great.

813
00:37:48,516 --> 00:37:49,767
You don't have to pay us.

814
00:37:49,809 --> 00:37:50,643
- Hey!

815
00:37:50,726 --> 00:37:51,560
Shut your pie hole.

816
00:37:51,602 --> 00:37:52,853
I could use the ""dinero"".

817
00:37:52,895 --> 00:37:53,604
- Heh-heh.

818
00:37:53,646 --> 00:37:54,605
Tonight I can afford it.

819
00:37:54,689 --> 00:37:55,690
- He can afford it.
- Let's go.

820
00:37:55,731 --> 00:37:56,732
- Let's go.
- Shut up.

821
00:37:56,816 --> 00:37:58,567
- Shut up.
- Stop tryin' to be me!

822
00:37:58,651 --> 00:38:00,528
- Tracy, you've got to
help me with my make-up,

823
00:38:00,569 --> 00:38:02,822
last time I about took
out a whole eyelash.

824
00:38:02,863 --> 00:38:04,365
- Okay, hang on a sec.

825
00:38:09,412 --> 00:38:10,496
Okay.

826
00:38:10,538 --> 00:38:11,539
Let's go!

827
00:38:11,622 --> 00:38:13,165
- Sexy.
- Yeah.

828
00:38:15,042 --> 00:38:17,378
- Senorita Claire, tell
Senor Oliver that we will not

829
00:38:17,461 --> 00:38:19,839
be performing for this job
tomorrow.

830
00:38:19,880 --> 00:38:21,924
He's too, como se dice?

831
00:38:22,008 --> 00:38:23,384
- Cheap!
- Cheap.

832
00:38:26,637 --> 00:38:29,223
- So, you need help again
counting?

833
00:38:31,142 --> 00:38:32,184
Okay.

834
00:38:38,107 --> 00:38:41,485
So it looks like Summer
and PJ really went for it.

835
00:38:41,527 --> 00:38:43,029
Yep, took the plunge.

836
00:38:43,070 --> 00:38:44,739
- They're dead.

837
00:38:44,780 --> 00:38:45,740
- What?

838
00:38:45,781 --> 00:38:46,824
- Dead.

839
00:38:48,034 --> 00:38:51,537
Any relationship that is
purely physical is death.

840
00:38:53,414 --> 00:38:55,374
They're just going to be a
statistic.

841
00:38:55,416 --> 00:38:56,459
- Well I hear today that two out

842
00:38:56,542 --> 00:38:58,461
of three divorces end in
marriage.

843
00:38:58,502 --> 00:39:00,129
- Not that death is bad.

844
00:39:00,212 --> 00:39:03,716
Death of a relationship, of the
spirit,

845
00:39:04,925 --> 00:39:06,344
death of the body.

846
00:39:07,219 --> 00:39:08,929
I saw a dead body once.

847
00:39:11,515 --> 00:39:14,310
Have you ever seen a
real dead body, Darryl?

848
00:39:15,019 --> 00:39:17,855
- Well, I saw my granddad's
ashes,

849
00:39:17,897 --> 00:39:20,775
it was kind of dusty.
- I was 11.

850
00:39:22,234 --> 00:39:25,112
I was riding my bike down Old
Camp Road

851
00:39:26,739 --> 00:39:30,493
when I saw, up ahead, this dust
cloud.

852
00:39:31,744 --> 00:39:35,289
As I came closer I saw that a
truck

853
00:39:35,331 --> 00:39:38,250
had run off the road
and slammed into a tree.

854
00:39:41,337 --> 00:39:42,421
That was okay.

855
00:39:42,463 --> 00:39:43,589
Kind of cool.

856
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:49,845
But further away in the grass
is what was really great.

857
00:39:52,348 --> 00:39:56,185
There was a boy, about my age.

858
00:39:56,227 --> 00:39:57,603
Blonde like me.

859
00:39:58,604 --> 00:40:00,439
He was lying in the grass.

860
00:40:01,982 --> 00:40:04,402
Not moving, not breathing.

861
00:40:05,945 --> 00:40:09,073
He must have been sitting
in the bed of the truck.

862
00:40:09,782 --> 00:40:12,827
Who knows how high or how hard
he hit?

863
00:40:14,245 --> 00:40:17,748
But now he was on his back, eyes
open,

864
00:40:17,832 --> 00:40:19,333
looking at the sky.

865
00:40:21,669 --> 00:40:23,129
Still.

866
00:40:23,170 --> 00:40:24,255
At peace.

867
00:40:25,589 --> 00:40:26,590
- Sorry.

868
00:40:26,632 --> 00:40:27,675
- Why?

869
00:40:29,135 --> 00:40:31,303
It was beautiful.

870
00:40:31,345 --> 00:40:33,139
And I was there.

871
00:40:35,224 --> 00:40:36,600
No one was around.

872
00:40:39,270 --> 00:40:43,190
I reached out, touched his face.

873
00:40:46,026 --> 00:40:47,486
Touched his lips.

874
00:40:50,906 --> 00:40:55,286
Then a car came down the
road and stopped to help.

875
00:40:55,786 --> 00:40:57,246
It ruined our moment.

876
00:41:00,416 --> 00:41:03,669
That's the closest I've ever
come to really knowing a boy.

877
00:41:05,129 --> 00:41:06,714
Claire, uh, we have
a, uh, we have a question.

878
00:41:06,755 --> 00:41:08,007
- Oh my god there's this,

879
00:41:08,090 --> 00:41:09,341
there's this phat Halloween
party that we want to go to.

880
00:41:09,425 --> 00:41:10,593
We want to go, like, and we-

881
00:41:10,676 --> 00:41:11,886
- And, look we just want
to leave in our costumes.

882
00:41:11,927 --> 00:41:12,887
- So, we'll see you there, okay?

883
00:41:12,928 --> 00:41:13,971
- Did you just invite her?

884
00:41:14,763 --> 00:41:16,599
- Bye ladies of the night!

885
00:41:21,979 --> 00:41:26,484
All right, well, I wish Summer
and PJ the best I guess.

886
00:41:26,525 --> 00:41:31,322
- Darryl, you seem like a nice
guy.

887
00:41:33,157 --> 00:41:35,242
Don't be like the rest of them.

888
00:41:36,202 --> 00:41:38,370
Don't force yourself on them.

889
00:41:39,872 --> 00:41:43,584
Don't, don't guilt and chide

890
00:41:43,626 --> 00:41:46,295
and force yourself on...

891
00:41:48,130 --> 00:41:49,882
Pretty little blonde.

892
00:41:49,924 --> 00:41:51,884
Come here, pretty little blonde.

893
00:41:51,926 --> 00:41:54,470
Bring your red lips over here.

894
00:41:59,683 --> 00:42:00,851
Black lips.

895
00:42:01,769 --> 00:42:02,895
Black hair.

896
00:42:02,937 --> 00:42:03,938
I'm dead.

897
00:42:04,396 --> 00:42:08,609
I'm not your plaything now, I'm
dead.

898
00:42:08,651 --> 00:42:09,693
Dead!

899
00:42:13,364 --> 00:42:16,158
- Okay, I'm officially creeped
out.

900
00:42:16,200 --> 00:42:17,743
Maybe you should relax.

901
00:42:20,037 --> 00:42:22,540
- Sometimes the haze is so
thick,

902
00:42:24,208 --> 00:42:27,878
the only way I can remind
myself I'm still in this world

903
00:42:29,046 --> 00:42:30,965
is with the pleasure of pain.

904
00:42:32,550 --> 00:42:36,929
Makes me feel good when
I'm in control of my pain.

905
00:42:39,473 --> 00:42:40,724
I like that.

906
00:42:43,727 --> 00:42:47,398
I've never let anyone watch me
before,

907
00:42:50,401 --> 00:42:52,736
but I like you Darryl.

908
00:43:02,913 --> 00:43:05,332
I've been working on this one.

909
00:43:12,256 --> 00:43:13,924
This is our secret.

910
00:43:28,439 --> 00:43:30,357
Makes me feel good.

911
00:43:40,618 --> 00:43:42,202
- Shit, what was that?

912
00:43:42,244 --> 00:43:44,121
- You'd better go see.

913
00:43:52,713 --> 00:43:53,714
- Holy shit!

914
00:43:53,797 --> 00:43:55,299
Can we not perform a simple

915
00:43:55,341 --> 00:43:57,760
task without this juvenile
Tom-fuckery!

916
00:43:57,843 --> 00:44:00,137
- I don't know what
happened, it just shot back

917
00:44:00,179 --> 00:44:01,096
or exploded or something.

918
00:44:01,138 --> 00:44:02,222
I, I don't know.

919
00:44:02,264 --> 00:44:02,973
- Hey man.

920
00:44:03,015 --> 00:44:04,058
Put the mother fuckin',

921
00:44:04,141 --> 00:44:05,434
Jake, put the motherfuckin' nail
gun down.

922
00:44:05,476 --> 00:44:06,602
- Put it down!

923
00:44:06,644 --> 00:44:08,729
Spider, I'm gonna need your
shirt.

924
00:44:08,812 --> 00:44:09,855
- Oh, yeah.

925
00:44:09,938 --> 00:44:12,358
- Darryl, unplug the compressor
before it blows again.

926
00:44:14,943 --> 00:44:15,694
Damn!

927
00:44:15,736 --> 00:44:18,489
- Oh, for fuck's sake!

928
00:44:19,198 --> 00:44:20,324
And don't you touch the nail.

929
00:44:20,407 --> 00:44:21,867
We're going to let the doctors
remove it.

930
00:44:21,909 --> 00:44:22,618
C'mon.

931
00:44:22,660 --> 00:44:23,577
Let's get him out of here.

932
00:44:23,619 --> 00:44:24,953
- I still get my 20 bucks?

933
00:44:25,037 --> 00:44:26,705
- Yeah, I'd rather pay that

934
00:44:26,747 --> 00:44:29,124
than for the tetanus
shots you're gonna need.

935
00:44:29,208 --> 00:44:34,421
- Ah, shit mother!
- C'mon you assholes!

936
00:45:00,572 --> 00:45:02,074
- Suck my balls, Scare Zone.

937
00:45:02,157 --> 00:45:03,367
Ha-ha-ha-ha!

938
00:45:03,951 --> 00:45:05,119
- What are you doing, bro?

939
00:45:05,202 --> 00:45:06,495
I told you she takes the
cash when she leaves, man.

940
00:45:06,578 --> 00:45:08,163
- I know that, I was just
checking.

941
00:45:08,205 --> 00:45:09,081
- You guys suck.

942
00:45:09,123 --> 00:45:10,916
Let's tag this this shit-hole.

943
00:45:10,958 --> 00:45:12,126
Yeehaw!

944
00:45:12,167 --> 00:45:14,878
- Yeah, suck my balls!

945
00:45:15,963 --> 00:45:20,759
Oh, no, no, no. Check this out.
- Whatcha got? Look at this.

946
00:45:20,801 --> 00:45:22,636
Whoooooo!

947
00:45:23,220 --> 00:45:25,639
- Hey, how 'bout this man?

948
00:45:32,938 --> 00:45:35,941
- Oh shit.
- Oh my God.

949
00:45:43,657 --> 00:45:46,910
Yeah!

950
00:45:50,080 --> 00:45:51,623
- He's paying for this.

951
00:46:14,104 --> 00:46:17,191
- What an ass.
- He so tagged you, man.

952
00:46:17,649 --> 00:46:19,610
- Let's just go back this way.

953
00:46:20,569 --> 00:46:21,361
Holy shit!

954
00:46:21,403 --> 00:46:23,238
Look at this toilet over here!

955
00:46:23,822 --> 00:46:25,157
It's so lifelike.

956
00:46:25,199 --> 00:46:26,450
- ""Lifelike?""

957
00:46:28,160 --> 00:46:32,414
- Whichever asshole threw me
in here, is going to get, ahhh!

958
00:46:36,543 --> 00:46:38,796
C'mon bro, this is not,

959
00:46:42,382 --> 00:46:43,550
who's that?

960
00:46:51,350 --> 00:46:52,768
- It's not real.

961
00:47:02,653 --> 00:47:04,321
What have we got over here, man?

962
00:47:04,363 --> 00:47:05,656
- No idea.

963
00:47:07,199 --> 00:47:09,409
- Please, please, please!

964
00:47:15,374 --> 00:47:17,334
- What's that dip-shit up to
now?

965
00:47:17,376 --> 00:47:18,961
- Where the hell are we?

966
00:47:24,842 --> 00:47:26,343
- Where's that prick at?

967
00:47:26,385 --> 00:47:27,553
- Hey, we gotta get out of here.

968
00:47:27,594 --> 00:47:28,470
This is bullshit.

969
00:47:28,512 --> 00:47:30,430
- Just go check down that way.

970
00:47:32,307 --> 00:47:33,100
- Fuck it.

971
00:47:33,141 --> 00:47:33,892
I'm gone.

972
00:47:33,934 --> 00:47:35,060
And I've got the car keys.

973
00:47:35,143 --> 00:47:37,187
I don't give a rat's ass
about you piss heads.

974
00:47:39,106 --> 00:47:40,482
- Douche bag.

975
00:47:46,446 --> 00:47:49,199
Fuck man, where're you at?

976
00:47:49,283 --> 00:47:50,284
Hey!

977
00:47:50,951 --> 00:47:51,660
Hey!

978
00:47:53,704 --> 00:47:54,997
C'mon man!

979
00:47:55,789 --> 00:47:57,541
Stop dickin' around!

980
00:48:24,693 --> 00:48:26,778
Bart, honey, can you
get that?

981
00:48:26,820 --> 00:48:29,656
- Sorry mom, I'm injured.

982
00:48:31,408 --> 00:48:34,202
- Yes can I, uh, help you?

983
00:48:34,244 --> 00:48:35,579
- Yes ma'am, I'm Darryl Myers

984
00:48:35,621 --> 00:48:37,581
from the Scare Zone attraction.

985
00:48:37,623 --> 00:48:39,333
Is Bart home?

986
00:48:39,416 --> 00:48:40,918
- Well hello ""Darryl Myers"",

987
00:48:41,001 --> 00:48:44,713
Yes Bart is home, you know
my poor boy he's just-

988
00:48:44,796 --> 00:48:46,006
- Excuse me.

989
00:48:47,299 --> 00:48:48,634
Um, thank you for,

990
00:48:48,675 --> 00:48:50,552
uh, cleaning my pipes.

991
00:48:51,094 --> 00:48:53,180
Well, let me see what you have
there.

992
00:48:53,221 --> 00:48:55,390
Oh, how sweet.

993
00:48:55,432 --> 00:48:57,184
Well, let me just take these
from you

994
00:48:57,267 --> 00:48:59,227
and get them in some water.

995
00:49:01,355 --> 00:49:03,857
Can I get you anything to drink?

996
00:49:07,277 --> 00:49:08,320
Oh Bart!

997
00:49:08,362 --> 00:49:09,404
You have company!

998
00:49:09,446 --> 00:49:10,530
I thought I
was supposed to hang out

999
00:49:10,572 --> 00:49:12,032
with dad next weekend!

1000
00:49:12,115 --> 00:49:13,075
- No, dear.

1001
00:49:13,158 --> 00:49:16,119
It's your little friend
from the scary house.

1002
00:49:16,161 --> 00:49:18,205
He came to see how you're doing.

1003
00:49:18,246 --> 00:49:19,373
- I'm in too much pain!

1004
00:49:19,456 --> 00:49:21,124
Tell 'em to go away.

1005
00:49:21,750 --> 00:49:22,668
- Hello, Bart!

1006
00:49:22,751 --> 00:49:25,379
Heh, nice set up you big
bullshit artist.

1007
00:49:25,420 --> 00:49:26,880
- Close the door.

1008
00:49:26,964 --> 00:49:29,466
- Nice sheets.
- Close the door!

1009
00:49:31,385 --> 00:49:32,678
Don't screw it for me, man.

1010
00:49:32,719 --> 00:49:34,763
It's the first time in five
years my mom's sucked up to me.

1011
00:49:34,846 --> 00:49:37,975
- Looked like your mom was
suckin' up to the plumber.

1012
00:49:38,016 --> 00:49:39,476
- Funny, fag!

1013
00:49:39,559 --> 00:49:41,019
Yeah, check out this set-up.

1014
00:49:41,061 --> 00:49:41,979
This is sweet!

1015
00:49:42,020 --> 00:49:43,188
- Yeah, if you're seven.

1016
00:49:43,271 --> 00:49:45,649
- I'm taking this for
as long a ride as I, oh!

1017
00:49:45,691 --> 00:49:46,858
I love this part.

1018
00:49:54,408 --> 00:49:55,867
Hey, hey, hey!

1019
00:49:58,537 --> 00:49:59,454
- Sorry, Bart.

1020
00:49:59,538 --> 00:50:00,789
You and your ""man-gina"" need to
get out

1021
00:50:00,872 --> 00:50:03,500
of bed and help me with
today's marketing blitz.

1022
00:50:03,583 --> 00:50:04,543
- ""Marketing blitz?""

1023
00:50:04,626 --> 00:50:06,670
What are you, an ad agency
executive?

1024
00:50:06,753 --> 00:50:10,215
- I need this money and Oliver
needs everyone in tonight.

1025
00:50:10,298 --> 00:50:11,591
- Excuse me.

1026
00:50:11,633 --> 00:50:12,801
Fatally injured.

1027
00:50:12,843 --> 00:50:14,928
- Fatal means dead,
genius, and you're lifting

1028
00:50:15,012 --> 00:50:16,388
your arm just fine.

1029
00:50:18,056 --> 00:50:21,226
C'mon, it's one more night.

1030
00:50:22,394 --> 00:50:23,770
- I get it.

1031
00:50:23,854 --> 00:50:24,938
You need me.

1032
00:50:25,439 --> 00:50:27,274
You can't go on without me.

1033
00:50:27,983 --> 00:50:30,694
I am Scare Zone.

1034
00:50:31,111 --> 00:50:33,530
But I can't hand out fliers.

1035
00:50:33,572 --> 00:50:34,614
Injured.

1036
00:50:35,615 --> 00:50:36,616
- Fine.

1037
00:50:36,658 --> 00:50:39,745
We're not actually ""handing
out"" flyers this time.

1038
00:50:43,165 --> 00:50:44,207
- Hey ladies!

1039
00:50:44,249 --> 00:50:46,001
""Scare Zone!""

1040
00:51:04,311 --> 00:51:06,313
Scare Zone!

1041
00:51:06,897 --> 00:51:08,065
Scare Zone!

1042
00:51:09,483 --> 00:51:10,400
- You're terrible.

1043
00:51:28,376 --> 00:51:30,003
- Tonight's the last night.

1044
00:51:30,045 --> 00:51:30,962
- Scare Zone!

1045
00:51:31,004 --> 00:51:32,047
Come check it out, you'll love
it!

1046
00:51:32,089 --> 00:51:34,091
- Yeah happy hallo-weeny!

1047
00:51:34,132 --> 00:51:35,092
Thanks!

1048
00:51:35,175 --> 00:51:36,301
- Dude, they're so hot.
- They were hot.

1049
00:51:36,384 --> 00:51:37,302
- I'm going to go meet them.

1050
00:51:37,344 --> 00:51:38,470
- No, no, no.

1051
00:51:38,512 --> 00:51:39,221
Dude.

1052
00:51:39,304 --> 00:51:40,222
We gotta go.

1053
00:51:40,263 --> 00:51:41,264
C'mon!

1054
00:51:51,399 --> 00:51:56,988
Oliver?

1055
00:52:19,177 --> 00:52:19,803
Jake!

1056
00:52:19,886 --> 00:52:20,846
What the fuck, man!

1057
00:52:20,929 --> 00:52:22,222
- The back door was open, man,
my bad.

1058
00:52:22,264 --> 00:52:23,348
- What'cha doing here?

1059
00:52:23,390 --> 00:52:25,058
- Oliver told me to come help
you set up.

1060
00:52:25,142 --> 00:52:26,184
- Oh he tell you but he don't
tell me?

1061
00:52:26,226 --> 00:52:28,061
Ain't this about a bitch.

1062
00:52:28,812 --> 00:52:30,105
Look, I'm glad you're
here, I need your help.

1063
00:52:30,188 --> 00:52:31,481
I've got an appointment
downtown.

1064
00:52:31,523 --> 00:52:32,190
- Heh.

1065
00:52:32,232 --> 00:52:33,150
An ""appointment"" right?

1066
00:52:33,191 --> 00:52:34,025
Heh-heh.

1067
00:52:34,067 --> 00:52:35,277
- Yes an appointment I've got to
meet

1068
00:52:35,360 --> 00:52:36,528
my parole officer is that okay
with you?

1069
00:52:36,570 --> 00:52:37,737
Can you focus?

1070
00:52:37,779 --> 00:52:38,613
Focus!

1071
00:52:38,697 --> 00:52:39,990
Look, first thing I need you to
do is

1072
00:52:40,073 --> 00:52:42,075
take this and put it back
where I found it, okay?

1073
00:52:42,159 --> 00:52:43,410
Now I've got to set up this damn
dummy

1074
00:52:43,493 --> 00:52:45,328
because those Spanish
assholes didn't show up,

1075
00:52:45,370 --> 00:52:47,247
so you go finish filling
up the fog machine,

1076
00:52:47,330 --> 00:52:48,915
then go turn on the sound
system,

1077
00:52:48,957 --> 00:52:50,000
but turn it to the knob with the

1078
00:52:50,083 --> 00:52:51,084
little piece of tape on it, then
go

1079
00:52:51,126 --> 00:52:52,169
turn on the strobe lights,

1080
00:52:52,252 --> 00:52:53,545
oh and fill the bat baby up with
water

1081
00:52:53,628 --> 00:52:55,046
and if you're looking
for something else to do,

1082
00:52:55,088 --> 00:52:57,048
you can finish this
list, do everything on it

1083
00:52:57,090 --> 00:53:00,886
then after your done, wait for
Oliver or Claire because uh,

1084
00:53:00,927 --> 00:53:03,305
uh, I ain't givin' you my keys.

1085
00:53:03,346 --> 00:53:04,097
Okay?

1086
00:53:04,181 --> 00:53:04,973
Ya got that?

1087
00:53:05,015 --> 00:53:06,099
- Got it.

1088
00:53:06,141 --> 00:53:07,601
- Now, Oliver's going to be
pissy 'cause I'm not here.

1089
00:53:07,642 --> 00:53:10,187
Don't let him take it out on
you, okay?

1090
00:53:10,228 --> 00:53:10,979
- 10-4.

1091
00:53:11,062 --> 00:53:12,147
- Yeah, ""10-4"" wonder bread.

1092
00:53:12,230 --> 00:53:13,940
Just go turn on the lye vat.

1093
00:53:14,024 --> 00:53:14,983
Go.

1094
00:53:15,025 --> 00:53:15,901
Go-go-go-go-go.

1095
00:53:15,942 --> 00:53:16,693
Go, go!

1096
00:53:16,735 --> 00:53:19,779
Can you speed? Urgency, yes, go.

1097
00:53:25,160 --> 00:53:26,661
Spanish people don't show up.

1098
00:53:26,703 --> 00:53:31,833
Bitches are supposed to like
work.

1099
00:54:17,545 --> 00:54:19,381
What kind of shit?

1100
00:54:41,111 --> 00:54:42,153
Oh shit!

1101
00:54:47,033 --> 00:54:48,285
Ahhhh, what?

1102
00:55:25,447 --> 00:55:26,614
- Ho-ho-ho!

1103
00:55:38,251 --> 00:55:39,711
- Welcome to ""A Christmas to
Remember""

1104
00:55:39,794 --> 00:55:41,796
where it's Christmas 364 days a
year!

1105
00:55:41,880 --> 00:55:43,631
That's right every day but what,
what?

1106
00:55:43,673 --> 00:55:44,382
Christmas!

1107
00:55:44,424 --> 00:55:45,550
So, how can I help you?

1108
00:55:45,592 --> 00:55:50,180
- I'm looking for Claire, I'm
her brother.

1109
00:55:50,221 --> 00:55:51,222
- Brother, huh?

1110
00:55:51,264 --> 00:55:52,682
Funny, I don't see the family
resemblance.

1111
00:55:52,766 --> 00:55:55,310
'Course I guess you don't
put on the black lipstick

1112
00:55:55,393 --> 00:55:57,979
and the funny make-up
'till after midnight, huh?

1113
00:55:58,063 --> 00:55:59,898
Sandy, have you seen Miss
Claire?

1114
00:55:59,939 --> 00:56:00,732
Hang on honey,

1115
00:56:00,815 --> 00:56:01,775
I'll be right down.

1116
00:56:01,858 --> 00:56:05,278
- So, what's Claire's brother's
name?

1117
00:56:05,320 --> 00:56:06,821
- Me?

1118
00:56:07,697 --> 00:56:08,490
Darryl.

1119
00:56:08,573 --> 00:56:09,866
- Oh, really, what a
coinky-dink.

1120
00:56:09,908 --> 00:56:12,243
I've got an elf around here
named Darryl someplace.

1121
00:56:12,285 --> 00:56:14,621
- I didn't know Claire had a
brother,

1122
00:56:14,662 --> 00:56:16,164
she never mentioned a brother.

1123
00:56:16,247 --> 00:56:18,875
But, she's not a big talker.

1124
00:56:18,958 --> 00:56:21,086
You'll find her right
back there by gift wrap.

1125
00:56:21,169 --> 00:56:22,504
- Thank you.

1126
00:56:29,344 --> 00:56:30,220
Hey Claire.

1127
00:56:30,303 --> 00:56:32,555
- Oh, hey, what are you doing
here?

1128
00:56:32,597 --> 00:56:33,681
- You told me to come he-

1129
00:56:33,723 --> 00:56:35,016
- Shhhh!

1130
00:56:35,058 --> 00:56:38,103
Oh, you have a note from mom!

1131
00:56:38,978 --> 00:56:40,230
That is bad.

1132
00:56:40,271 --> 00:56:42,315
Oh, I'm glad you came.

1133
00:56:42,357 --> 00:56:44,526
Um, Sandy,

1134
00:56:44,567 --> 00:56:45,485
Sandy.

1135
00:56:45,568 --> 00:56:47,612
You know it looks like
our mom is really sick

1136
00:56:47,654 --> 00:56:52,409
and I'm gonna to leave
early to, um, care for her.

1137
00:56:52,492 --> 00:56:54,911
- You said your mother's dead,
dear.

1138
00:56:56,496 --> 00:56:58,665
No our, our mam is sick.

1139
00:56:58,706 --> 00:57:01,251
That's what we call our
grandmother.

1140
00:57:01,292 --> 00:57:02,085
- Yeah.

1141
00:57:02,127 --> 00:57:02,877
""Mam"".

1142
00:57:02,919 --> 00:57:04,129
- I'm really sorry Mrs. Kane,

1143
00:57:04,212 --> 00:57:06,089
I really have to leave right
now.

1144
00:57:06,131 --> 00:57:08,133
You know, to get to, mam.

1145
00:57:08,174 --> 00:57:09,551
- I understand, dear.

1146
00:57:09,634 --> 00:57:12,220
So, I'll see you tomorrow
morning at 10.

1147
00:57:12,262 --> 00:57:13,721
It's a big day!

1148
00:57:13,805 --> 00:57:16,057
- Okay, I wouldn't miss it.

1149
00:57:16,099 --> 00:57:16,933
- Mam.

1150
00:57:17,016 --> 00:57:18,184
- The holiday shopping season
starts

1151
00:57:18,268 --> 00:57:20,353
the day after Halloween now, you
know!

1152
00:57:20,395 --> 00:57:21,646
Toodles!

1153
00:57:21,729 --> 00:57:22,897
- Whoo-hoo!

1154
00:57:24,524 --> 00:57:26,818
Oh, get me out of here!

1155
00:57:27,610 --> 00:57:28,445
Ha.

1156
00:57:28,528 --> 00:57:30,488
Ya think vampires and zombies
are scary?

1157
00:57:30,530 --> 00:57:31,990
Those people are scary!

1158
00:57:32,490 --> 00:57:34,868
- I thought you worked at a
funeral home.

1159
00:57:34,951 --> 00:57:36,578
- Who told you that?

1160
00:57:36,619 --> 00:57:37,662
- Nobody.

1161
00:57:37,704 --> 00:57:39,581
- No I've worked for the
Kanes for, like, four years

1162
00:57:39,664 --> 00:57:42,250
and they still creep me out.

1163
00:57:42,292 --> 00:57:43,168
- I dunno.

1164
00:57:43,251 --> 00:57:44,669
They seemed like, ""Really nice
people"".

1165
00:57:44,752 --> 00:57:46,254
Thanks for
getting me out of there,

1166
00:57:46,337 --> 00:57:48,756
I'm running out of
excuses to cut out early.

1167
00:57:48,798 --> 00:57:50,592
You confused them good.

1168
00:57:50,633 --> 00:57:52,927
- Hey, I'm just glad you called.

1169
00:57:52,969 --> 00:57:54,512
Is your car in the shop?

1170
00:57:54,554 --> 00:57:55,763
- I don't drive.

1171
00:57:55,805 --> 00:57:57,390
- Well how do you get around?

1172
00:57:57,432 --> 00:57:58,600
- I usually walk.

1173
00:57:58,641 --> 00:58:01,811
- This place is, like, 20
blocks from the strip mall.

1174
00:58:01,895 --> 00:58:04,355
- Or I'll bum a ride or
hitchhike.

1175
00:58:05,023 --> 00:58:07,150
- Isn't that a little dangerous?

1176
00:58:10,069 --> 00:58:10,987
- No.

1177
00:58:11,029 --> 00:58:11,738
- Shit!

1178
00:58:11,779 --> 00:58:12,697
Put that away!

1179
00:58:12,739 --> 00:58:14,491
Can't you carry, like, a can of
mace

1180
00:58:14,532 --> 00:58:16,075
or a taser or something?

1181
00:58:16,117 --> 00:58:18,536
- Mace doesn't stop them,
it just blinds them.

1182
00:58:18,578 --> 00:58:20,580
Tasers you gotta keep charged.

1183
00:58:20,663 --> 00:58:21,956
It's not practical.

1184
00:58:23,208 --> 00:58:24,209
- Good point.

1185
00:58:24,292 --> 00:58:26,419
- Oliver keeps a taser
charged and ready to go

1186
00:58:26,461 --> 00:58:28,588
underneath the cash
register at the gift shop,

1187
00:58:28,671 --> 00:58:32,759
but I'll stick with sexy Sadie,
thank you.

1188
00:58:34,344 --> 00:58:35,512
- She's named her gun.

1189
00:58:35,595 --> 00:58:37,055
Heh.

1190
00:58:37,096 --> 00:58:37,931
- Oh, turn here.

1191
00:58:37,972 --> 00:58:39,057
Turn here!

1192
00:58:47,398 --> 00:58:48,483
Stop here.

1193
00:58:54,531 --> 00:58:57,867
- How did I know this was
going to end at a cemetery?

1194
00:59:03,748 --> 00:59:04,457
Claire?

1195
00:59:13,841 --> 00:59:15,134
This isn't funny.

1196
00:59:18,179 --> 00:59:19,305
I knew it was you.

1197
00:59:19,389 --> 00:59:22,308
I just wanted to see what
you looked like laughing.

1198
00:59:22,350 --> 00:59:23,893
- Don't get used to it.

1199
00:59:24,561 --> 00:59:26,354
Let me show you something.

1200
00:59:34,988 --> 00:59:36,406
- God damn it.

1201
00:59:36,906 --> 00:59:40,785
- Darryl, I'd like you to meet
someone.

1202
00:59:42,912 --> 00:59:45,206
- Mary Elisabeth Landers.

1203
00:59:45,290 --> 00:59:46,124
- Hey, hey!

1204
00:59:46,165 --> 00:59:46,791
Buddy.

1205
00:59:46,874 --> 00:59:47,834
What are you doin'?

1206
00:59:47,875 --> 00:59:48,876
Do you know those kids over
there?

1207
00:59:48,918 --> 00:59:51,004
Are you listening to me?

1208
00:59:51,045 --> 00:59:52,171
- Your mother?

1209
00:59:52,213 --> 00:59:53,339
- No.

1210
00:59:53,381 --> 00:59:54,257
- Not your mother.

1211
00:59:54,299 --> 00:59:59,345
- No, my mother is, quite alive.

1212
00:59:59,470 --> 01:00:00,847
- Hello, ass-wipe,

1213
01:00:00,930 --> 01:00:02,640
I'm talkin' to you!

1214
01:00:09,480 --> 01:00:11,065
- No, she's my aunt.

1215
01:00:11,149 --> 01:00:12,692
My mother's sister.

1216
01:00:13,943 --> 01:00:16,487
Nothing exotic killed her, just
cancer.

1217
01:00:17,363 --> 01:00:19,490
But I wanted you to meet her.

1218
01:00:20,033 --> 01:00:21,618
You remind me a lot of her.

1219
01:00:30,293 --> 01:00:31,461
Hey Aunt Mare,

1220
01:00:33,087 --> 01:00:35,131
I'd like you to meet Darryl.

1221
01:00:46,267 --> 01:00:48,978
- Hello, Ms. Landers, how are
you?

1222
01:00:49,520 --> 01:00:51,898
- She can't talk to
you Darryl, she's dead.

1223
01:00:51,939 --> 01:00:52,732
- I know.

1224
01:01:01,574 --> 01:01:02,742
- You know, she was the only
person

1225
01:01:02,825 --> 01:01:05,370
that ever brought me a Christmas
present.

1226
01:01:05,453 --> 01:01:07,413
Every year she would bring me
something

1227
01:01:07,497 --> 01:01:09,707
and wrap it so beautifully.

1228
01:01:15,213 --> 01:01:17,298
She pretty much raised me 'till
I was 10.

1229
01:01:24,013 --> 01:01:26,015
My Aunt Mare kept me from harm.

1230
01:01:29,477 --> 01:01:30,353
Then she died.

1231
01:01:42,240 --> 01:01:45,785
One year she got me this snow
globe.

1232
01:01:48,329 --> 01:01:50,415
It was one of those real glass
ones,

1233
01:01:50,456 --> 01:01:53,626
not like the plastic
ones you see at the mall.

1234
01:01:54,585 --> 01:01:57,088
It had this whole little village
in it.

1235
01:01:59,716 --> 01:02:02,176
That became a great tool for my
mom.

1236
01:02:03,136 --> 01:02:06,597
She could just raise it up
and threaten to smash it.

1237
01:02:09,183 --> 01:02:11,602
She finally made good on that
threat.

1238
01:02:16,107 --> 01:02:20,611
Darryl, I really appreciate you

1239
01:02:21,320 --> 01:02:25,032
trying to strike up a
conversation
with me two nights ago.

1240
01:02:27,076 --> 01:02:30,163
- Hey, I'm sorry you lost
somebody

1241
01:02:30,204 --> 01:02:32,081
that you cared so much about.

1242
01:02:32,749 --> 01:02:35,668
It seems like things went
all down hill after that.

1243
01:02:36,169 --> 01:02:38,713
You seem to be fighting a lot of
demons.

1244
01:02:41,132 --> 01:02:43,342
- I was just a cute little
blonde

1245
01:02:43,426 --> 01:02:45,845
no one could keep their hands
off of.

1246
01:02:45,928 --> 01:02:49,307
- And, as a friend, albeit a new
friend,

1247
01:02:50,141 --> 01:02:51,601
I want to say something.

1248
01:02:53,144 --> 01:02:54,479
Go ahead.

1249
01:02:56,189 --> 01:03:00,276
- Be goth, carry guns
and hum strange tunes,

1250
01:03:01,235 --> 01:03:03,696
but you shouldn't be hurting
yourself.

1251
01:03:03,738 --> 01:03:05,573
You deserve better than that.

1252
01:03:06,157 --> 01:03:09,786
Get a tattoo and let the
professional hurt you!

1253
01:03:13,080 --> 01:03:15,583
- That could probably take some
therapy.

1254
01:03:16,751 --> 01:03:17,919
- Think about it.

1255
01:03:18,961 --> 01:03:22,548
Now, ready to go hack,

1256
01:03:22,590 --> 01:03:24,550
maim, bludgeon and slaughter
ourselves

1257
01:03:24,634 --> 01:03:26,427
to the delight of thousands?

1258
01:03:26,469 --> 01:03:27,261
- Yippie!

1259
01:03:27,303 --> 01:03:29,555
Ha-ha.

1260
01:03:29,597 --> 01:03:30,723
Bye Aunt Mare.

1261
01:03:32,225 --> 01:03:33,726
Happy Halloween.

1262
01:03:36,813 --> 01:03:39,816
- So I suppose you like ""How
the Grinch Stole Christmas""?

1263
01:03:39,857 --> 01:03:40,733
- Love it!

1264
01:03:40,817 --> 01:03:41,984
- And your favorite movie of all
time,

1265
01:03:42,026 --> 01:03:43,152
the ""Nightmare Before
Christmas""?

1266
01:03:43,236 --> 01:03:44,570
- Now you're getting me hot!

1267
01:03:53,538 --> 01:03:57,333
Chug, chug, chug,
chug, chug!

1268
01:04:16,727 --> 01:04:21,899
Let us in, let us
in, let us in, let us in!

1269
01:04:25,111 --> 01:04:26,153
- Uhhhh.

1270
01:04:27,613 --> 01:04:28,781
Oh, where the hell is Spider?

1271
01:04:28,865 --> 01:04:30,533
- Oh, how many times are
you going to say that?

1272
01:04:30,616 --> 01:04:32,243
- Well, where the hell is
Spider?

1273
01:04:32,326 --> 01:04:34,579
- He told me that he was coming
back.

1274
01:04:34,620 --> 01:04:36,330
- Did he say when?

1275
01:04:36,998 --> 01:04:37,832
Sorry.

1276
01:04:37,915 --> 01:04:39,083
Sorry Jake I know it's not your
fault.

1277
01:04:39,125 --> 01:04:40,668
Thanks for getting the place
open.

1278
01:04:40,710 --> 01:04:41,627
Okay.

1279
01:04:41,669 --> 01:04:43,212
I will work Spider's
line and take the cash.

1280
01:04:43,254 --> 01:04:43,963
- Oh good!

1281
01:04:44,005 --> 01:04:44,839
Here's your cash bags.

1282
01:04:44,922 --> 01:04:45,756
- Thank you.

1283
01:04:45,798 --> 01:04:47,341
Wait, Darryl come here.

1284
01:04:47,425 --> 01:04:48,426
If I'm going to cover for
Spider,

1285
01:04:48,467 --> 01:04:49,886
you have to cover for me.

1286
01:04:49,927 --> 01:04:53,764
I am entrusting you with
the chainsaw finale.

1287
01:04:53,806 --> 01:04:54,682
- Why me?

1288
01:04:54,724 --> 01:04:56,392
- Claire recommended you.

1289
01:04:57,643 --> 01:04:58,394
- Yeah.

1290
01:04:58,436 --> 01:04:59,103
I'm there!

1291
01:04:59,186 --> 01:05:00,021
Show me what to do.

1292
01:05:00,062 --> 01:05:01,063
- Nothing to it.

1293
01:05:01,105 --> 01:05:02,189
Here's the throttle,
this is the chain lock.

1294
01:05:02,231 --> 01:05:03,399
Now, keep that lock on.

1295
01:05:03,482 --> 01:05:05,526
Without that lock on you
could level a fucking forest.

1296
01:05:05,568 --> 01:05:06,819
So, for tonight, lock on.

1297
01:05:06,861 --> 01:05:07,528
Okay?

1298
01:05:07,570 --> 01:05:08,487
Now, try and rev her up.

1299
01:05:08,529 --> 01:05:09,614
Jam it there between your knees,

1300
01:05:09,655 --> 01:05:11,824
pull that cord as hard as you
can.

1301
01:05:13,159 --> 01:05:14,243
Straight up.

1302
01:05:15,411 --> 01:05:17,288
- Put a bit of mustard on it.

1303
01:05:18,247 --> 01:05:19,665
Ha ha ha ha!

1304
01:05:19,707 --> 01:05:20,666
And off!

1305
01:05:20,750 --> 01:05:23,794
Good, you have earned the orange
mask.

1306
01:05:23,878 --> 01:05:24,754
But don't get cocky.

1307
01:05:24,795 --> 01:05:25,838
I don't want you trying to bury

1308
01:05:25,922 --> 01:05:27,006
that thing into somebody's
stomach.

1309
01:05:27,048 --> 01:05:28,799
Just chase them around with it.

1310
01:05:28,841 --> 01:05:29,634
Good.

1311
01:05:29,675 --> 01:05:30,426
Okay.

1312
01:05:30,468 --> 01:05:31,594
Everyone, take your positions!

1313
01:05:35,514 --> 01:05:36,724
Let us in!

1314
01:05:36,766 --> 01:05:37,850
Let us in!

1315
01:05:37,892 --> 01:05:38,726
Let us in!

1316
01:05:38,768 --> 01:05:40,144
Let us in!

1317
01:05:40,186 --> 01:05:41,228
- Shut up!

1318
01:05:41,270 --> 01:05:42,396
Shut up!

1319
01:05:42,438 --> 01:05:43,481
Shut up!

1320
01:05:44,482 --> 01:05:45,608
- Hey Oliver!

1321
01:05:45,691 --> 01:05:46,567
Hey, where's Spidey?

1322
01:05:46,609 --> 01:05:47,944
You too cheap to pay him?

1323
01:05:48,027 --> 01:05:51,739
- How do you know he's not
in there somewhere, huh?

1324
01:05:51,781 --> 01:05:53,658
Waiting for you!

1325
01:05:55,076 --> 01:05:56,035
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha.

1326
01:05:56,077 --> 01:05:59,205
Let the slaughter begin!

1327
01:06:02,541 --> 01:06:05,419
Get in you date-less wonders!

1328
01:06:38,327 --> 01:06:41,872
- Everybody get batty, bloody
birth!

1329
01:06:48,379 --> 01:06:49,547
- And pull.

1330
01:06:52,341 --> 01:06:53,175
- Oh man.

1331
01:06:53,259 --> 01:06:56,053
Oh my god.
- This is disgusting.

1332
01:07:25,624 --> 01:07:27,334
- Would ya, would ya hurry up!

1333
01:07:27,376 --> 01:07:28,419
- All right, all right,

1334
01:07:28,502 --> 01:07:30,838
I'm here now I've got a
shit-load of tens.

1335
01:07:31,338 --> 01:07:33,174
Have a nice scare.

1336
01:07:33,257 --> 01:07:34,091
- Oliver.
- Yeah.

1337
01:07:34,133 --> 01:07:35,051
- I've got to go to work.

1338
01:07:35,134 --> 01:07:36,302
- Oh okay, save me a table.

1339
01:07:36,343 --> 01:07:37,386
I'll be there at two.

1340
01:07:37,470 --> 01:07:38,679
- Gotta pinch a loaf!
- What?

1341
01:07:38,763 --> 01:07:40,890
- Yeah, I've got to drop
the kids off at the pool!

1342
01:07:40,973 --> 01:07:41,724
- Hurry up!

1343
01:07:42,641 --> 01:07:44,643
- Damn!
- Ha, ha, ha, ha!

1344
01:08:01,327 --> 01:08:03,037
- Awesome!
- That was sick!

1345
01:08:03,120 --> 01:08:06,123
- That bloody guy coming
from the wall was new!

1346
01:08:07,041 --> 01:08:08,250
- Everything okay?

1347
01:08:09,126 --> 01:08:09,794
- Great!

1348
01:08:09,835 --> 01:08:10,753
I just have to 'go' bad.

1349
01:08:10,795 --> 01:08:11,670
- Oh, there's someone in there.

1350
01:08:12,546 --> 01:08:14,090
Oh, me next!

1351
01:08:14,673 --> 01:08:17,093
- Hey, I wouldn't go
in there if I were you.

1352
01:08:17,176 --> 01:08:20,012
- Man, I gotta do this
fast and get back at it.

1353
01:08:20,096 --> 01:08:21,430
Uh, no time for airing out!

1354
01:08:21,472 --> 01:08:22,681
Heads up!

1355
01:08:23,682 --> 01:08:26,727
- If I'm not back in three
hours, call the cops!

1356
01:09:02,179 --> 01:09:04,431
- Back to slice and dice!

1357
01:09:04,473 --> 01:09:05,516
Heh, heh, heh.

1358
01:09:14,483 --> 01:09:16,569
- Oh my gosh it's all wet in
there.

1359
01:09:16,652 --> 01:09:20,072
- You've have blood all over
you.

1360
01:09:20,156 --> 01:09:21,490
- So do you!

1361
01:09:41,969 --> 01:09:43,470
- Hey, you found my axe-

1362
01:09:53,814 --> 01:09:55,900
- Dad, this is so fake.

1363
01:10:12,082 --> 01:10:14,877
- Uh, that's stupid.
- Not even scary.

1364
01:10:14,919 --> 01:10:17,588
- Try scaring somebody next
time.

1365
01:10:21,217 --> 01:10:23,219
This had better not
stain.

1366
01:10:23,302 --> 01:10:24,720
- I think it's just like
invisible ink.

1367
01:10:24,762 --> 01:10:27,097
I think it will just
disappear after a few minutes.

1368
01:10:27,139 --> 01:10:28,599
- Oh, I don't think so.

1369
01:10:28,641 --> 01:10:29,600
Look at this.

1370
01:10:29,642 --> 01:10:32,228
- Maybe it's cherry juice or
something.

1371
01:10:35,522 --> 01:10:38,275
- Oh God, it tastes like blood.

1372
01:10:38,859 --> 01:10:39,860
- Back off!

1373
01:10:39,902 --> 01:10:41,779
That bitch's been
following us the whole way.

1374
01:10:41,862 --> 01:10:43,322
Get a life!

1375
01:10:43,364 --> 01:10:44,490
- What's going on?

1376
01:10:44,531 --> 01:10:45,866
- I don't know, there's
something wrong with Tracy.

1377
01:10:45,950 --> 01:10:47,117
- Is she hurt or sick?
- I don't know,

1378
01:10:47,159 --> 01:10:49,203
I can't tell with this damn
costume.

1379
01:10:50,537 --> 01:10:53,457
- Oh Jesus, she's been stabbed!

1380
01:10:53,499 --> 01:10:55,626
- I think I'm going to be sick.

1381
01:11:02,508 --> 01:11:05,261
- Someone just got stabbed!

1382
01:11:05,344 --> 01:11:07,513
- Excellent!
- Let's go.

1383
01:11:07,554 --> 01:11:08,973
- Whoa-whoa, wait!

1384
01:11:10,015 --> 01:11:11,183
Ladies and gentlemen,

1385
01:11:11,225 --> 01:11:13,352
just a slight technical
snafu, I will be right back.

1386
01:11:13,394 --> 01:11:16,563
I will be right back.

1387
01:11:17,273 --> 01:11:18,315
Shit.

1388
01:11:19,233 --> 01:11:22,111
- Heh, yeah, this blows chunks,
dude.

1389
01:11:24,196 --> 01:11:26,949
- Hey sexy, you want to suck on
this?

1390
01:11:39,712 --> 01:11:40,754
- Ummm.

1391
01:11:41,797 --> 01:11:42,798
- I don't know, I don't know.

1392
01:11:42,840 --> 01:11:43,924
The only thing I can think is,

1393
01:11:44,008 --> 01:11:45,050
we have this chair that shoots
blades

1394
01:11:45,092 --> 01:11:46,510
through a dummy's chest.

1395
01:11:47,011 --> 01:11:48,887
No, I, I know it's Halloween
and you've been getting

1396
01:11:48,971 --> 01:11:52,224
a lot of crank calls, but
I'm telling you this is real.

1397
01:11:52,308 --> 01:11:53,058
Just hurry.

1398
01:11:53,142 --> 01:11:54,601
Just hurry!

1399
01:11:54,643 --> 01:11:55,352
- Okay.

1400
01:11:55,394 --> 01:11:56,603
I'm calling this a night.

1401
01:11:56,645 --> 01:11:57,479
I'm going to-

1402
01:11:57,521 --> 01:11:58,480
- There's a big fight outside!

1403
01:11:58,522 --> 01:12:00,607
- Son of a bitch!

1404
01:12:00,691 --> 01:12:02,818
I'll go break it up and
wait for the paramedics.

1405
01:12:02,860 --> 01:12:04,778
- I'm okay, I've got
pressure on the wound.

1406
01:12:04,820 --> 01:12:05,863
- Okay.

1407
01:12:05,904 --> 01:12:08,032
Claire, you've got to get
everybody out of that maze.

1408
01:12:21,170 --> 01:12:22,379
- Shit!

1409
01:12:22,421 --> 01:12:23,464
- What's going on?

1410
01:12:25,549 --> 01:12:26,759
- Please move to the exits.

1411
01:12:26,800 --> 01:12:28,469
Thank you.

1412
01:12:28,510 --> 01:12:29,595
- Boo!

1413
01:12:29,636 --> 01:12:30,429
This place sucks!

1414
01:12:30,471 --> 01:12:31,347
I want my money back.

1415
01:12:31,388 --> 01:12:32,473
- Please move to the exit.

1416
01:12:32,556 --> 01:12:34,224
Oliver will refund your
admission outside.

1417
01:12:34,266 --> 01:12:35,017
Asshole.

1418
01:12:35,059 --> 01:12:36,143
Thank you!

1419
01:12:37,728 --> 01:12:39,521
The exit is that way.

1420
01:12:42,358 --> 01:12:44,777
- Oh, man, this place is
so much more effective

1421
01:12:44,818 --> 01:12:46,070
with music and lights.

1422
01:12:46,153 --> 01:12:47,363
Hi!

1423
01:12:47,404 --> 01:12:48,072
Claire!

1424
01:12:48,113 --> 01:12:49,156
- Oh, sorry about this.

1425
01:12:49,198 --> 01:12:50,199
Look you'll get your money back.

1426
01:12:50,240 --> 01:12:51,283
Please just move to the-

1427
01:12:59,792 --> 01:13:01,627
- Look, I said we're closed.

1428
01:13:01,668 --> 01:13:03,712
- I don't think you understand.

1429
01:13:03,796 --> 01:13:08,050
We came all the way across
town and stood in line

1430
01:13:08,092 --> 01:13:10,386
for two goddamn hours!

1431
01:13:10,469 --> 01:13:11,553
- Calm down.

1432
01:13:11,595 --> 01:13:12,262
Hold on.

1433
01:13:12,304 --> 01:13:13,138
We've had an accident.

1434
01:13:13,222 --> 01:13:14,056
- Oww, shit.

1435
01:13:14,139 --> 01:13:15,182
- We're waiting for an
ambulance.

1436
01:13:15,224 --> 01:13:16,058
Oh, I don't have time for this.

1437
01:13:16,100 --> 01:13:16,850
Where's Claire?

1438
01:13:16,892 --> 01:13:17,726
- I don't know.

1439
01:13:17,768 --> 01:13:18,852
- I'll be right back.

1440
01:13:18,936 --> 01:13:21,438
- Uh, I, I'm going to
wait for the ambulance.

1441
01:13:22,898 --> 01:13:24,608
- Two fuckin' hours!

1442
01:13:26,360 --> 01:13:27,444
- Claire?

1443
01:13:32,616 --> 01:13:34,076
Oh my God.

1444
01:13:34,118 --> 01:13:35,577
Claire.

1445
01:13:35,619 --> 01:13:36,662
Claire!

1446
01:13:37,830 --> 01:13:39,081
- Oh Claire.

1447
01:13:39,790 --> 01:13:41,708
Sweet, sweet Claire

1448
01:13:44,628 --> 01:13:45,963
- Have you seen Claire?

1449
01:13:46,004 --> 01:13:46,672
- No.

1450
01:13:46,713 --> 01:13:47,506
Is the ambulance here?

1451
01:13:47,589 --> 01:13:48,424
- I don't think so.

1452
01:13:48,507 --> 01:13:49,466
Bart and Margo are outside.

1453
01:13:49,508 --> 01:13:51,260
I'm going to call the police.

1454
01:13:53,095 --> 01:13:54,054
Where's Sparks Malloy?

1455
01:13:54,096 --> 01:13:56,932
- What?
- My fucking taser!

1456
01:13:59,226 --> 01:14:01,228
- Don't get up!

1457
01:14:01,311 --> 01:14:02,479
Don't move!

1458
01:14:04,231 --> 01:14:05,816
Just lie there.

1459
01:14:05,899 --> 01:14:09,278
That's right, just lie like in
death.

1460
01:14:09,361 --> 01:14:10,362
Lie.

1461
01:14:18,537 --> 01:14:19,830
Hah!

1462
01:14:19,913 --> 01:14:21,790
That's you, Claire.

1463
01:14:22,332 --> 01:14:23,792
That's my Claire.

1464
01:14:24,793 --> 01:14:25,627
I did it for you.

1465
01:14:25,669 --> 01:14:28,755
I, I did this all for you!

1466
01:14:30,716 --> 01:14:31,467
Yes!

1467
01:14:31,508 --> 01:14:32,843
Claire!

1468
01:14:32,885 --> 01:14:34,845
Yes, you wanted this.

1469
01:14:34,887 --> 01:14:35,596
This!

1470
01:14:35,637 --> 01:14:37,764
And I've come for you.

1471
01:14:37,806 --> 01:14:39,057
I know all about you.

1472
01:14:39,099 --> 01:14:43,729
I know, I know how you love
death!

1473
01:14:43,770 --> 01:14:47,566
I know how it, it thrills you...

1474
01:14:47,649 --> 01:14:49,985
like it thrills me!

1475
01:14:50,694 --> 01:14:56,325
It took me three years of
watching you and practicing.

1476
01:14:59,620 --> 01:15:00,996
And you, you,

1477
01:15:03,457 --> 01:15:05,375
you taught me how to cut.

1478
01:15:09,129 --> 01:15:12,216
We'd watch you on those
long quiet afternoons

1479
01:15:12,299 --> 01:15:15,928
when you didn't think anyone was
looking.

1480
01:15:15,969 --> 01:15:20,349
You didn't see us, but we saw
you.

1481
01:15:21,433 --> 01:15:23,644
We'd lean up to the glass

1482
01:15:23,685 --> 01:15:26,897
between the branches and the
boxes.

1483
01:15:27,731 --> 01:15:29,483
And we'd watch you through

1484
01:15:29,525 --> 01:15:31,652
the Christmas window.

1485
01:15:34,363 --> 01:15:35,989
- Yes, right away please.

1486
01:15:36,615 --> 01:15:39,910
Well, I think we have a
dangerous situation here.

1487
01:15:40,869 --> 01:15:42,371
Yes, I think so.

1488
01:15:42,454 --> 01:15:45,749
Look, one was wounded
and another was killed.

1489
01:15:45,791 --> 01:15:47,376
- What's going on, Oliver?

1490
01:15:47,417 --> 01:15:49,044
- Just get the cops here.

1491
01:15:49,086 --> 01:15:50,546
I don't know what's going on.

1492
01:15:50,587 --> 01:15:52,214
Don't go in there!

1493
01:15:52,297 --> 01:15:53,799
Jake's dead.

1494
01:15:53,840 --> 01:15:54,841
- What?

1495
01:15:54,883 --> 01:15:55,759
Where's Claire?

1496
01:15:55,801 --> 01:15:56,718
- I don't know.

1497
01:15:56,760 --> 01:15:57,761
I sent her in to get everybody
out-

1498
01:15:57,803 --> 01:15:59,805
- The ambulance is here!

1499
01:15:59,846 --> 01:16:01,473
- Darryl, don't do it.

1500
01:16:01,515 --> 01:16:02,599
They're here for Tracy.

1501
01:16:02,641 --> 01:16:04,518
The police are on their
way, let them do it.

1502
01:16:04,560 --> 01:16:05,686
- Claire is in there!

1503
01:16:05,769 --> 01:16:08,522
- Something else is in
there and it killed Jake.

1504
01:16:08,564 --> 01:16:09,731
You're a kid in a costume.

1505
01:16:09,773 --> 01:16:11,108
What are you gonna do?

1506
01:16:13,485 --> 01:16:15,112
- I'm going after Claire!

1507
01:16:17,281 --> 01:16:19,491
- You know what's funny, Claire?

1508
01:16:19,533 --> 01:16:21,785
You cut to feel alive.

1509
01:16:22,828 --> 01:16:23,662
I cut to kill!

1510
01:16:25,038 --> 01:16:28,041
I used to try to cut to feel
alive, I,

1511
01:16:28,625 --> 01:16:31,753
I would cut, and I'd cut, and
I'd

1512
01:16:31,837 --> 01:16:34,464
cut and I would cut,

1513
01:16:34,506 --> 01:16:38,093
but it never felt good

1514
01:16:38,135 --> 01:16:39,261
till I met you.

1515
01:16:41,346 --> 01:16:42,389
And I watched how you

1516
01:16:42,431 --> 01:16:44,850
did yourself so lovingly.

1517
01:16:45,767 --> 01:16:48,312
You inspired me so.

1518
01:16:49,521 --> 01:16:53,275
And I grew to love you so much.

1519
01:16:55,360 --> 01:16:57,988
I had to have you be a part of
me.

1520
01:16:58,655 --> 01:17:00,449
To show my devotion.

1521
01:17:01,617 --> 01:17:02,784
My devotion.

1522
01:17:02,868 --> 01:17:04,453
My devotion.

1523
01:17:05,370 --> 01:17:07,414
The pleasure of pain, right?

1524
01:17:07,497 --> 01:17:12,669
The pleasure of pain,
the pleasure. I did this

1525
01:17:12,711 --> 01:17:13,670
for you, Claire!

1526
01:17:25,140 --> 01:17:26,224
- Claire?

1527
01:17:27,726 --> 01:17:28,727
- Not you!

1528
01:17:28,769 --> 01:17:29,853
Not you, Claire!

1529
01:17:29,936 --> 01:17:32,689
Don't be like all the rest
of them, a squealing pig!

1530
01:17:34,232 --> 01:17:36,902
Oh, Claire, don't be scared.

1531
01:17:36,943 --> 01:17:38,654
I'm here to fulfill your wish.

1532
01:17:38,737 --> 01:17:40,322
I'm going to take you away from
here.

1533
01:17:40,364 --> 01:17:42,866
And the best part, the best
part?

1534
01:17:42,949 --> 01:17:44,326
I'm coming with you!

1535
01:17:44,910 --> 01:17:47,204
Now that I've proven my
worthiness to you,

1536
01:17:47,287 --> 01:17:51,333
I need to do for you what you
could not do for yourself.

1537
01:17:51,917 --> 01:17:53,877
- Claire!
- Darryl!

1538
01:17:54,711 --> 01:17:55,796
- Claire!

1539
01:18:01,176 --> 01:18:06,264
- Now my darling, it is time
for me to drain you dry.

1540
01:18:08,141 --> 01:18:09,851
Claire!

1541
01:18:09,893 --> 01:18:12,229
- Then open my veins.

1542
01:18:12,270 --> 01:18:13,063
- Claire!

1543
01:18:16,942 --> 01:18:18,026
- Ahhhhh!

1544
01:18:18,485 --> 01:18:20,362
You're not a part of this!

1545
01:18:23,365 --> 01:18:29,162
And then we will live together
in the eternal orgy of hell!

1546
01:18:41,174 --> 01:18:42,050
- Claire!

1547
01:18:44,219 --> 01:18:46,012
I'll be right back.

1548
01:19:21,298 --> 01:19:22,215
Claire.

1549
01:19:41,067 --> 01:19:42,319
- Come here!

1550
01:20:15,393 --> 01:20:17,020
- Stupid.

1551
01:20:17,062 --> 01:20:18,104
Stupid.

1552
01:20:21,316 --> 01:20:22,359
Stupid!

1553
01:20:25,070 --> 01:20:27,280
You ruined everything!

1554
01:20:29,616 --> 01:20:31,743
You ruined my moment!

1555
01:20:36,581 --> 01:20:37,666
It's okay.

1556
01:20:40,210 --> 01:20:41,878
Don't worry.

1557
01:20:41,962 --> 01:20:42,712
I'll be sure to tell

1558
01:20:42,796 --> 01:20:44,381
Claire all about th-

1559
01:20:55,976 --> 01:20:57,602
- Oliver!

1560
01:20:57,644 --> 01:20:58,687
Oliver!

1561
01:21:06,319 --> 01:21:08,572
- God damn it!

1562
01:21:08,613 --> 01:21:09,656
Darryl!

1563
01:21:11,616 --> 01:21:13,743
- I'm okay, I'm okay.

1564
01:21:15,996 --> 01:21:17,247
- Was it just him?

1565
01:21:19,040 --> 01:21:21,585
- That thing was living back
there!

1566
01:21:21,668 --> 01:21:23,169
He killed, he killed Spider.

1567
01:21:23,211 --> 01:21:24,588
He killed all of them because of
me.

1568
01:21:25,589 --> 01:21:27,048
- It's okay, it's okay.

1569
01:21:28,466 --> 01:21:29,843
The police are here.

1570
01:21:29,885 --> 01:21:31,761
They're gonna sort everything
ou-

1571
01:21:36,600 --> 01:21:37,392
- No!

1572
01:21:37,475 --> 01:21:38,226
No!

1573
01:22:04,586 --> 01:22:07,881
- Excuse me, I'm looking for-
- Hey Darryl.

1574
01:22:13,261 --> 01:22:16,056
- Hey, how are you?

1575
01:22:16,097 --> 01:22:17,140
- Good.

1576
01:22:18,683 --> 01:22:20,060
Good.

1577
01:22:20,101 --> 01:22:21,311
- You look great.

1578
01:22:21,811 --> 01:22:23,897
- Still working on those demons.

1579
01:22:24,898 --> 01:22:26,983
- Sorry you had to come
back to work so soon.

1580
01:22:27,025 --> 01:22:28,151
- Oh, me too.

1581
01:22:28,193 --> 01:22:30,403
Therapy's expensive for a girl!

1582
01:22:30,445 --> 01:22:32,906
- Selfishly, I'm glad you're
back.

1583
01:22:33,490 --> 01:22:36,284
- God, Darryl, where
were you 10 years ago?

1584
01:22:37,786 --> 01:22:40,789
You know, my psychoanalysis
revealed

1585
01:22:40,830 --> 01:22:43,041
that I have a clinical ""3M""
issue

1586
01:22:43,083 --> 01:22:44,376
when it comes to relationships.

1587
01:22:44,417 --> 01:22:47,337
Apparently I deeply believe
that all I can attract are

1588
01:22:47,379 --> 01:22:49,589
maniacs, molesters and monsters.

1589
01:22:51,883 --> 01:22:56,638
But hiding and disguising
myself didn't seem to help.

1590
01:22:56,721 --> 01:22:59,599
And, it's just going to take a
while

1591
01:22:59,641 --> 01:23:00,725
before I can shake the feeling

1592
01:23:00,767 --> 01:23:04,312
that I bring out the worst in
men.

1593
01:23:04,354 --> 01:23:05,480
- I understand.

1594
01:23:06,064 --> 01:23:07,190
Take your time.

1595
01:23:08,441 --> 01:23:10,860
When you're ready, give me call.

1596
01:23:14,489 --> 01:23:16,866
Merry Christmas, Claire.

1597
01:27:17,482 --> 01:27:18,608
- Get lost!

1598
01:27:18,650 --> 01:27:20,235
Except you in the back, the hot
one.

1599
01:27:20,276 --> 01:27:21,110
Come here.

1600
01:27:21,194 --> 01:27:22,737
A little bit closer.

1601
01:27:22,779 --> 01:27:23,905
That's right.

00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:57,670
The kebab guy said they're dealing
in the loo or the stairwell.

2
00:01:57,880 --> 00:01:59,950
Ruedi and I'll come from the front,
you guys cover the back.

3
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:47,678
Hey, Carol, today's my lucky day!

4
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:52,075
Won three francs in the lotto, went to
the thrift store and what'd I find?

5
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:54,589
René Botteron from FC Zurich!

6
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:57,630
- Come on, let's do something fab.
- Yeah.

7
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,833
Let's go score some dope.
The good stuff.

8
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:04,237
Yeah, but they've got Dragan locked up
and the stuff on the street is shit...

9
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:06,519
Know something better?

10
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:16,712
Things okay? Long time, no see.

11
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:18,040
Carol, we got to go.

12
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:20,429
Wait. Who's got the
best dope these days?

13
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:24,159
Baby, I've gone straight.
I'm a mailman. See?

14
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:26,396
Forget it, he ain't got anything.
Let's go.

15
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,753
So you're not the king
of the street anymore?

16
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:32,834
The coolest Yugo?

17
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:35,759
I'm not a Yugo!
I'm Swiss-Albanian.

18
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:40,393
Forget him and let me take care of it.

19
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:41,749
Awesome.

20
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:47,756
Kind of a retard
but he's got hot connections.

21
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:10,918
The mailman there. Do we know him?

22
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:13,318
Why would I know any mailmen?

23
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:29,273
Want to get going?

24
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:30,999
Let's wait a bit.

25
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:37,593
Hey, look: ""May and
Analannabelle""...

26
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:40,750
I get it: ""Anal-Annabelle!
New and hot""

27
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:42,951
in Zurich. ""She really is new.""

28
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:47,233
Got to check her out.
By the way: What's up with Vera?

29
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:51,872
You back together, or is she still
doing it with that other guy?

30
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:02,433
Nice piece of tin they gave you.

31
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:04,198
You know who it belongs to?

32
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:08,551
Us, you know. The taxpayers!

33
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:19,029
- So where is it?
- Man,

34
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:21,920
I'm not a dealer. But a guy
I know will be here in a sec.

35
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:22,750
Give me the money

36
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:24,589
You think I'm dumb?

37
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:27,394
Man, I'm doing you a huge favor here
and you're getting all worked up.

38
00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:30,108
Don't you get all worked up. You'll
get your money when the guy comes.

39
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:31,389
Easy, man.

40
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:40,434
That guy there!

41
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:42,593
The one with the hairdo.

42
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:45,270
Ain't that the Albanian, Berisha?

43
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:49,915
All Albanians are named Berisha.

44
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,797
But that's really him!

45
00:05:57,880 --> 00:06:01,236
Go in! Come on, go inside...

46
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:04,549
Oh, forget it,

47
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:06,478
he never goes in.

48
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:07,914
Fucking shit!

49
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:10,310
Well then, let's just grab
another of his boys

50
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:12,511
and ship him back to Yugoland.

51
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:17,555
Hey, Beko! Still at the post office?

52
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:25,195
He's inside.
It's one of Berisha's guys!

53
00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:27,871
Fuck the post office.

54
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:31,110
Can you do me a favor?

55
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:35,954
I promised the girl something.

56
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:40,677
We told you you should
get in with us, but you

57
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:45,476
listened to your mother. Now don't
you tell me the post office is shit.

58
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:51,514
Wait here.

59
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:56,314
There's four of them.
Two junkies, a mailman and a Yugo.

60
00:06:56,520 --> 00:06:57,873
Cover the back and wait for us.

61
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:08,752
- Good day, City Police!
- Everyone stay calm.

62
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:10,473
Hands on the table!

63
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:15,593
- Piss off! Fucking cop! Let go!
- Hey! Let her go!

64
00:07:17,640 --> 00:07:19,631
Damn it, we're not here for you!

65
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:21,353
Fuck you! I'm not going with you!

66
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:30,475
The cops!

67
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:52,195
Damn it!

68
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:54,431
Have you lost it?
Just standing around?

69
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,673
I said cover the back!
What was that shit?

70
00:07:57,880 --> 00:08:00,110
Fucking bullshit! You bastard!

71
00:08:38,920 --> 00:08:40,194
Damn!

72
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:51,679
What do we have here?

73
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:54,031
Him again! What do I know?

74
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:01,192
What do you know about the other guy?

75
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:03,596
Berisha? Is he the boss
of the one who just split?

76
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:06,075
What do you want?
All Albanians are named Berisha.

77
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:07,709
This guy!

78
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:11,631
Man, I'm Beko. I know them all.

79
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:13,239
- But not that one.
- Don't lie to me!

80
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:15,749
Why are you asking me then?
Ain't you the super cop?

81
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:20,236
Listen up, Beko:
It's a jungle out there.

82
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:22,237
The big fish eat up the small ones.

83
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:24,396
Unless you're a piranha.
And that you're not!

84
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:27,313
Man, what's this whole fish thing?

85
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:31,917
Reported for theft, assault... You're
one of Berisha's dealers. Just admit it.

86
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:34,236
Man, no way!
Everyone fucks up a little

87
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:35,759
when they're young.

88
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,353
But those times are over.

89
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:39,240
I went to school in Switzerland!

90
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:41,515
Am I supposed to lie
and say I'm not working

91
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:43,711
at the post office?
- You got in my way, man.

92
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:46,200
That's aiding and abetting. Got it?

93
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:48,668
That'll get you at
least one night in jail.

94
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:52,350
If I don't go to work tonight, my boss
won't just see me as the foreigner.

95
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:53,959
I'll be the lawbreaking foreigner.

96
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:55,719
Uh, Dani...

97
00:09:55,960 --> 00:09:59,157
Could you give his mom a quick call
and check that out with his employer?

98
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:04,877
Liens, liens, liens...

99
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:08,397
How can a junkie like you
be stuck with so many liens?

100
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:10,995
Hey, it's not my fault.

101
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:16,393
You know, once I had a
real cool bicycle workshop,

102
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:21,639
with super exclusive bikes. And then
they just took it all away from me.

103
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:27,954
Fuck! But you know what?

104
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:32,078
- I'm going to get it back again.
- You always buy your dope from Beko?

105
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:34,714
Definitely not.

106
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:40,236
Carol and I only went in there
because... Galatassaray was playing.

107
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:48,352
Is she your girlfriend?

108
00:10:52,760 --> 00:10:53,715
Yeah.

109
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:58,631
Man, I'm not a dealer.

110
00:10:58,960 --> 00:11:00,951
But that junkie chick,
she's totally hot.

111
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:05,159
Don't you think? She's a bit doped up,
but act a little nice, and then...

112
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:09,756
Did you know Beko's keen on Carol?

113
00:11:13,520 --> 00:11:14,748
Well... why not?

114
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:19,116
Beko's a happening guy,
always got a good supply...

115
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:21,595
But he just took the cash,
and then you guys showed up!

116
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:29,916
And who'd he get the dope from?

117
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:33,152
How should I know.

118
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:37,036
From the Albanian.

119
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:43,475
Why do you want to lock up Beko?

120
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:47,435
If he's with them, we need him out
there so we can shadow him.

121
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:50,313
With him alone, you don't stand
a chance with the prosecutor.

122
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:10,959
- Going cold turkey?
- You crazy?

123
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:13,357
Look, not a single one!

124
00:12:13,640 --> 00:12:15,312
And how about the ecstasy tabs?

125
00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:19,552
Him again.
That's personal consumption.

126
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:21,595
I want out of here!

127
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:27,472
Fuck you

128
00:12:27,560 --> 00:12:29,312
We've got a problem with you.

129
00:12:29,560 --> 00:12:31,391
Man, can't you read!

130
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:35,120
We have to send you back
to Oberkirch Reform School.

131
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:36,599
You've run
away three times.

132
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:38,474
Shit, man!

133
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:41,954
I'm getting thrown in the reformatory.
I'll hang myself in there!

134
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:44,390
But hanging out in dealer joints,
that's okay?

135
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:46,511
None of your business. Fuck you.

136
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,831
What put you in reform school?

137
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:55,595
Stole a piece of candy.
Should I scream again?

138
00:12:56,600 --> 00:12:58,272
If it does you good...

139
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:20,757
From my end, you can go.

140
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:23,113
You crazy?

141
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:25,557
Oberkirch is bullshit.

142
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:34,680
Can't you just totally
delete my record?

143
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:35,157
Get lost!

144
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:50,434
Damn it!

145
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:08,279
And? You guys happy?

146
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:14,870
10 grams of heroin, no dealer,
a little Albanian in jail

147
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:17,835
and a bungled job. And you, Marco,

148
00:14:18,040 --> 00:14:19,393
what a screw-up!

149
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:21,875
You're the one who was so gung-ho!

150
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:23,513
That kind of thing can happen.

151
00:14:23,720 --> 00:14:27,429
No! It doesn't happen to me! Know why?
'Cause I take this shit seriously!

152
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:29,830
Calm down. The lake beat guy's coming.

153
00:14:30,040 --> 00:14:33,874
Fuck the lake beat guy!
This place is nothing but crap!

154
00:14:38,040 --> 00:14:40,349
Beat Schuppisser from the lake police.

155
00:14:42,040 --> 00:14:43,951
""Asked to switch to narcotics.""

156
00:14:44,440 --> 00:14:46,670
""You can learn a lot from Strähl""

157
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:49,075
but remember:
I'm in charge here,

158
00:14:49,280 --> 00:14:50,315
not him.

159
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:53,879
- Hello.
- Good luck!

160
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:55,394
Ruedi. Break a leg.

161
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:58,116
And here's our little Strähl!

162
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:02,668
Is that necessary?

163
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:05,796
I figured if he can survive you,

164
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:08,231
then he'll survive the job.

165
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:10,599
Goodbye then.

166
00:15:12,520 --> 00:15:14,909
A guy's got a private life too,
you know.

167
00:15:18,840 --> 00:15:21,912
And there's no dealing
after six either, right?

168
00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:57,037
- Come on, give me a little too.
- Why don't you ask Fritz?

169
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:00,995
Please, give me a little bit.

170
00:16:01,280 --> 00:16:02,838
I don't have any more.

171
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:21,356
Come on, let's go or they'll
lock us up.

172
00:16:21,560 --> 00:16:24,791
Yeah, come on, René.
Fritz has got ecstasy at home.

173
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,309
This constant oppression
is killing me.

174
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:29,351
Really don't have any more?

175
00:16:31,520 --> 00:16:32,475
Hey Anz...

176
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:37,509
Shit, Anz is totally out.

177
00:16:46,920 --> 00:16:49,150
- Don't you want to share?
- Hey! You nuts?

178
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:52,558
We outsiders have got to stick
together.

179
00:16:57,680 --> 00:16:59,113
Fucking wild!

180
00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:00,748
A grenade.

181
00:17:01,160 --> 00:17:02,559
A hand grenade.

182
00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:06,948
Let me see.

183
00:17:07,320 --> 00:17:11,074
Don't worry,
he's done that to me before too.

184
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:12,998
Let me see the grenade.

185
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:16,835
- No, leave it alone or it'll go off.
- Come on, let me see!

186
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:45,593
Hey, Flaky,

187
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:50,592
did you leave the lake
'cause you don't like fish?

188
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:53,520
No, I just want to be
where things are happening

189
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:54,873
and where I can help people.

190
00:17:58,760 --> 00:18:00,751
With us narcs, ain't much happening.

191
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:04,310
We mainly deal with garbage.

192
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:09,473
I prefer fish. Piranhas.

193
00:18:10,520 --> 00:18:12,192
They eat the garbage.

194
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:17,512
Come on, I'll show you.

195
00:18:28,920 --> 00:18:30,751
What're you looking for? I'm all out.

196
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:37,188
And what's that?

197
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:40,479
- That's just personal consumption.
- Nope.

198
00:18:41,240 --> 00:18:44,550
To consume that you have to tell me
who's Berisha's new man.

199
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:47,080
Hey, leave me alone,
I don't know.

200
00:18:47,080 --> 00:18:48,991
It's way dangerous
with these Albanians.

201
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:53,078
But you locked up René today.

202
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:55,828
- Didn't you find his hand grenade?
- Grenade?

203
00:18:56,280 --> 00:18:57,156
Don't fuck with me!

204
00:18:57,360 --> 00:18:59,669
Dangerous having a grenade around!

205
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:02,314
Just imagine what could happen.

206
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:05,796
The idiot doesn't know anything.
Let's go.

207
00:19:06,120 --> 00:19:07,960
Uh, but... don't we have
to do something

208
00:19:07,960 --> 00:19:09,951
if there's a grenade
going 'round the scene?

209
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:12,200
Listen, Flaky.

210
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:15,317
Join the UN peacekeepers
if you want to hunt grenades.

211
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:17,875
We narcs have more
important stuff to do.

212
00:19:38,040 --> 00:19:40,190
The guy there with the hairdo.

213
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:42,359
That's Berisha.

214
00:19:43,160 --> 00:19:44,229
The pig...

215
00:19:45,640 --> 00:19:46,789
Lives around here,

216
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:50,680
two kids, a big fat wife, a big fat
Mercedes and a big fat business.

217
00:19:50,680 --> 00:19:51,590
And we only manage

218
00:19:51,800 --> 00:19:53,756
to nab his errand boys
with a few grams.

219
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:55,758
Damn it!

220
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:02,518
So what do we do now?

221
00:20:03,320 --> 00:20:04,070
Nothing!

222
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:09,678
No mobile, no telephone, no bank
account. He never touches the dope.

223
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:12,633
And we don't know where he
stashes his big deliveries.

224
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:16,435
Why don't we just collect the few grams we
get from his boys until it's a few kilos

225
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:19,074
and then throw it in his car
and arrest him?

226
00:20:26,360 --> 00:20:27,270
Mr. Brunner?

227
00:20:28,040 --> 00:20:29,678
Yes, sir, everything's okay.

228
00:20:52,440 --> 00:20:54,556
Come on, let's do a Smarties oracle.

229
00:20:55,400 --> 00:20:58,073
And then we'll go out
and do some ecstasy.

230
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:12,434
Okay, I'll shake up the Smarties, then
you take the first five without looking

231
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:14,279
and that's your future...

232
00:21:14,760 --> 00:21:15,636
Such bullshit...

233
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:17,393
Take five without looking.

234
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:23,433
Awesome!

235
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:27,634
Three green. Green's for professional
success, and you just got three.

236
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:31,837
Purple is for wild times
and red for love...

237
00:21:33,880 --> 00:21:36,440
Swallow them or it won't work.

238
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,753
- Now what?
- Are you stupid? You know...

239
00:21:45,040 --> 00:21:46,553
Professional success.

240
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:49,430
Your dream's going to come true.

241
00:21:50,520 --> 00:21:53,876
You'll pay back your debts and
reopen your bike workshop,

242
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:56,120
but this time much
cooler than before,

243
00:21:56,120 --> 00:21:58,588
and everyone'll want the
<<René special>> bike.

244
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:03,592
Wild times: That's obvious, 'cause
we're going out to do some ecstasy.

245
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:06,188
And love.

246
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:11,835
- Because it's all with me.
- You don't even believe that yourself.

247
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:16,310
But you swallowed them.
It's already happened!

248
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:21,195
You're the best thing
that ever happened to me.

249
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:32,152
What's up? You upset?

250
00:22:32,920 --> 00:22:35,878
Did you have to tell Brunner
about this hand grenade?

251
00:22:37,080 --> 00:22:38,832
You're starting to piss me off!

252
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:10,315
Heinz!

253
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:13,792
- Come on in!
- You think this is the right apartment?

254
00:23:14,600 --> 00:23:16,431
I didn't hear you ring.

255
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:19,195
You got the money?

256
00:23:31,480 --> 00:23:33,357
Let's just cuddle!

257
00:23:35,720 --> 00:23:36,709
Fuck.

258
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:42,873
You're so boring, you and your heroin.
If we'd only left.

259
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:46,835
What's the matter? What'd I do wrong?

260
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:49,639
- Police! Stay calm!
- Man,

261
00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:51,637
you again, fucking cop! Get lost!

262
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:54,513
- Where's this fucking hand grenade?
- Damn it, we don't have one.

263
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:55,948
Where is it?

264
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:59,676
- Come on, this is pissing me off.
- Go fuck your grenade!

265
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:03,078
Fucking bastard!

266
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:06,073
Are you crazy?
That's totally dangerous!

267
00:24:11,800 --> 00:24:12,710
You fucking bastard!

268
00:24:27,920 --> 00:24:29,512
Stop or I'll jump!

269
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:37,112
You fucking bastard!

270
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:47,838
So what made that junkie
jump out the window?

271
00:24:48,040 --> 00:24:49,439
How should I know?

272
00:24:50,120 --> 00:24:51,792
Because junkies are a bit stupid?

273
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:56,188
Listen! Wehrli said you threw him
out of the window. And Schuppisser

274
00:24:56,480 --> 00:24:57,480
saw him flying as well.

275
00:24:57,480 --> 00:24:59,357
You can screw
Schuppisser for all I care

276
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:03,195
Whatever. Another complaint
against you is one too many.

277
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:06,634
You're suspended.

278
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:11,240
And if Wehrli sticks
by his statement,

279
00:25:11,240 --> 00:25:13,708
that's the nail in
the coffin for your career.

280
00:25:15,280 --> 00:25:18,192
You don't mean to say you believe
the junkie and not me?

281
00:25:18,680 --> 00:25:22,195
Listen, Strähl... It doesn't
matter who I believe.

282
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:25,790
You've got to protect people and
not throw them out of the window or

283
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:27,115
let them jump out!

284
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:34,036
What's the matter with you anyway?

285
00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:37,395
Dr. Arbenz didn't help any?

286
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:41,873
Dr. Arbenz is a shit for brains
doctor.

287
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:46,676
You'll never manage without me!

288
00:25:49,120 --> 00:25:51,793
Never heard we help
each other out around here?

289
00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:54,514
Did you just let your colleagues
at the lake drown too?

290
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:56,517
Leave him alone! It's not his fault.

291
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:06,473
You know how much

292
00:27:06,680 --> 00:27:09,752
Strähl would have to pay me in damages
if we were in the States?

293
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:14,351
Then I'd already be
general importer for Cannondale...

294
00:27:14,600 --> 00:27:16,591
- You insane? Damn!
- Hey, what's the problem?

295
00:27:16,800 --> 00:27:18,950
- You stupid fucking junkie!
- Man! Let him go, fucking cop!

296
00:27:19,160 --> 00:27:21,230
Yeah! Thanks to you,
I'm fully disabled!

297
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:24,000
Go now and retract
your false statement.

298
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:26,357
If you'll pay me damages.

299
00:27:26,600 --> 00:27:28,431
You insane? You're coming with me!

300
00:27:28,680 --> 00:27:32,753
Here's a totally whacked ex-drug cop
beating up an innocent victim.

301
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:36,151
And on top of that,
he's a pill addict!

302
00:27:37,040 --> 00:27:38,439
Fucking junkie!

303
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:42,913
- Fuck you! You're not a real cop anyway!
- Yeah!

304
00:27:43,320 --> 00:27:45,390
And I want damages!

305
00:28:57,880 --> 00:28:59,233
Where are you going?

306
00:28:59,480 --> 00:29:00,913
Where do you think? To work!

307
00:29:01,400 --> 00:29:04,278
But you've got night shift.
And you've hardly slept!

308
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:06,559
Now I'm on day shift.

309
00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:09,920
- Since when?
- Since today.

310
00:29:13,560 --> 00:29:15,039
Did they say something
about the police?

311
00:29:15,240 --> 00:29:18,915
Leave me alone! I didn't do anything
and my boss trusts me.

312
00:29:19,680 --> 00:29:21,716
How could they manage without me?

313
00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:24,679
My son...

314
00:29:26,120 --> 00:29:28,190
I'm so proud of you, Beko

315
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:30,711
Let me go, Mama. Got to leave.

316
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:33,474
Be careful.
Don't overdo it with work!

317
00:29:36,800 --> 00:29:38,950
What do you want from us, Beko?

318
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:42,955
""Did we tell you:
""Go work at the Swiss Post""?""

319
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:44,519
We didn't.

320
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:49,155
But you didn't listen to us.

321
00:29:49,720 --> 00:29:51,790
You listened to your mother.

322
00:29:54,120 --> 00:29:56,680
And now they've kicked you out.

323
00:29:59,120 --> 00:30:00,189
You know Winkelried?

324
00:30:00,440 --> 00:30:02,396
Who's that? A cop?

325
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:05,078
You fucking us over?

326
00:30:06,200 --> 00:30:08,634
Calm down. He's dead.

327
00:30:09,880 --> 00:30:13,714
Back in school, I learned
he really helped Switzerland.

328
00:30:14,400 --> 00:30:17,073
In war, he threw himself
at the spears of the enemies.

329
00:30:17,720 --> 00:30:18,914
You understand?

330
00:30:19,720 --> 00:30:22,518
Switzerland is still around.
And he's a hero.

331
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:31,159
Am I not your Winkelried? Haven't I
earned a job with you guys?

332
00:30:36,360 --> 00:30:38,191
Don't screw up, okay?

333
00:30:39,120 --> 00:30:41,236
Hey! I'm Beko! I never screw up.

334
00:30:49,040 --> 00:30:50,029
Sugar, coke.

335
00:30:52,280 --> 00:30:53,679
Sugar, coke.

336
00:30:59,640 --> 00:31:00,760
- What do you want?

337
00:31:00,760 --> 00:31:03,433
- What do I want?
It's still my apartment too.

338
00:31:06,280 --> 00:31:08,589
I need the car
and the key's still here.

339
00:31:08,840 --> 00:31:10,990
- You're not getting it.
- Goddamnit!

340
00:31:11,560 --> 00:31:13,835
The car still belongs to both of us!

341
00:31:14,160 --> 00:31:16,276
So Patrick doesn't have a car?

342
00:31:19,760 --> 00:31:21,432
That's not fair!

343
00:31:22,040 --> 00:31:26,750
How did I stand it with you for so long?
You and your fucking job!

344
00:32:13,240 --> 00:32:14,673
Damn it!

345
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:36,672
Since I saw you the last time,

346
00:32:37,080 --> 00:32:39,116
a lot's happened to you, eh?

347
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:42,392
Now you're already out?

348
00:32:42,680 --> 00:32:44,830
No, I just lost them.

349
00:32:45,480 --> 00:32:47,277
Mr. Strähl. You're not

350
00:32:47,480 --> 00:32:50,870
the only police officer unable to
cope with his job.

351
00:32:51,120 --> 00:32:54,237
This continual pressure, this misery...
Not everyone can handle it.

352
00:32:54,760 --> 00:32:58,878
It's important to admit when
the job isn't right anymore.

353
00:32:59,880 --> 00:33:01,996
You should think about that sometime.

354
00:33:04,360 --> 00:33:05,759
Clean things up in your life!

355
00:33:05,960 --> 00:33:08,030
Damn it, there's nothing to clean up!

356
00:33:08,440 --> 00:33:11,193
Mr. Strähl, it's like this:

357
00:33:11,400 --> 00:33:14,278
You're trembling,
you smell like alcohol...

358
00:33:14,760 --> 00:33:17,115
- Looks like cold turkey.
- You prescribed this crap!

359
00:33:18,040 --> 00:33:22,238
You know, it's impossible to
tell in advance if someone's

360
00:33:22,440 --> 00:33:26,558
predisposed towards addiction, and
only a small percentage will ever...

361
00:33:26,760 --> 00:33:28,796
You're just a shit for brains doctor!

362
00:33:30,600 --> 00:33:33,797
Did you hear that? That was
the junkie in you talking.

363
00:33:34,120 --> 00:33:35,075
Idiot!

364
00:33:35,520 --> 00:33:37,238
Hey! You can't do that!

365
00:33:53,040 --> 00:33:54,519
It's Strähl!

366
00:33:58,840 --> 00:34:00,478
You look like shit.

367
00:34:01,080 --> 00:34:02,069
Thanks

368
00:34:03,160 --> 00:34:04,673
Want a bite?

369
00:34:07,560 --> 00:34:10,597
Otherwise? Things okay?
What're you doing the whole day?

370
00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:14,589
Taking a little break.
Thinking about my future.

371
00:34:17,480 --> 00:34:20,313
You know, it makes me sick.
You can really piss a guy off,

372
00:34:20,520 --> 00:34:22,909
but it was also a lot of
fun sometimes.

373
00:34:23,840 --> 00:34:26,400
Check it out, you can see
right up her privates.

374
00:34:27,400 --> 00:34:29,550
Beat wouldn't have found that amusing.

375
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:32,030
So?

376
00:34:32,360 --> 00:34:33,679
You guys making progress?

377
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:37,677
You know the Yugo mailman we nabbed
in the kebab place...

378
00:34:37,880 --> 00:34:41,156
Brunner's got him under surveillance
now. Just like you always said.

379
00:34:41,680 --> 00:34:44,672
You know, Beat thinks it's a blast.
He likes doing that, you know...

380
00:34:45,920 --> 00:34:47,353
But, um, this Berisha...

381
00:34:47,720 --> 00:34:51,156
I'm telling you: Slippery as an eel.
Little Beat doesn't have a chance there.

382
00:34:51,400 --> 00:34:52,958
Well, I got to get going.

383
00:34:55,360 --> 00:34:58,989
Hey, if I can help you out or
anything, just give a ring, okay?

384
00:35:04,680 --> 00:35:07,069
Hi there! Strähl from the City Police!

385
00:35:09,880 --> 00:35:11,393
Just great.

386
00:35:12,240 --> 00:35:14,151
That's the fifth time today I've heard
that.

387
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:16,789
Suddendly everyone's with
the police, fire department

388
00:35:17,080 --> 00:35:18,752
or security service.

389
00:35:20,040 --> 00:35:21,837
Can I see your badge?

390
00:35:45,080 --> 00:35:46,718
Hey, Anz, over here!

391
00:35:49,640 --> 00:35:50,629
Goal!

392
00:35:55,200 --> 00:35:56,553
That's a foul!

393
00:36:00,440 --> 00:36:01,316
I let that one

394
00:36:01,520 --> 00:36:04,717
in on purpose. You know,
because of the grenade.

395
00:36:16,520 --> 00:36:17,635
Shit, what do you want?

396
00:36:17,880 --> 00:36:19,233
Make a statement. Now.

397
00:36:21,120 --> 00:36:23,156
What do I get in exchange?

398
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:30,955
And what else?

399
00:36:37,520 --> 00:36:38,555
And what else?

400
00:36:53,680 --> 00:36:56,440
Hey, Zurich-Basel there.
Definitely not 1.

401
00:36:56,440 --> 00:36:57,793
Zurich forever, man.

402
00:36:58,000 --> 00:36:59,194
You got to stay true

403
00:36:59,400 --> 00:37:02,790
to your principles.
- Make an X by 2. Zurich never wins.

404
00:37:03,160 --> 00:37:04,309
Hey, are you crazy?

405
00:37:05,720 --> 00:37:07,119
Man. Okay.

406
00:37:11,680 --> 00:37:15,195
Basel, that fucked up
chemical industry shit!

407
00:37:20,200 --> 00:37:21,997
That makes 356.20.

408
00:37:30,080 --> 00:37:31,798
Thanks very much.

409
00:37:34,680 --> 00:37:37,831
Thank you. I've got a good feeling.

410
00:37:38,280 --> 00:37:40,714
- And what do we do now?
- Now?

411
00:37:43,280 --> 00:37:46,317
- Nothing.
- Fuck yourself up the ass.

412
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:50,718
You go straight to the police station
and retract your false statement!

413
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:53,355
There's a case of bribery going on
here!

414
00:37:53,680 --> 00:37:54,908
That enough for a

415
00:37:55,120 --> 00:37:57,315
false statement at the police station?
- So cool!

416
00:37:57,520 --> 00:38:00,671
Listen, if I'm supposed to say I just
jumped out of the window, then you've

417
00:38:00,880 --> 00:38:04,316
got to give me a lot more than this
here. A half-kilo. Minimum.

418
00:38:14,160 --> 00:38:15,798
Yes, Herbert here.

419
00:38:18,160 --> 00:38:20,960
I'm in the World Bar
and have got a runaway here.

420
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:22,871
Can you come pick her up?
Thanks.

421
00:38:26,160 --> 00:38:28,240
Zurich City Police,
everything under control.

422
00:38:28,240 --> 00:38:29,309
You're such a bastard!

423
00:38:29,720 --> 00:38:31,551
Goddamn asshole!

424
00:38:32,040 --> 00:38:35,237
Leave her alone. Or you can forget
the statement, just so you know.

425
00:38:35,480 --> 00:38:38,631
Listen: Now you go to the station and
if I don't hear from you in three hours,

426
00:38:38,840 --> 00:38:42,355
your sweetheart is headed to
Oberkirch. Got it? Here's my number.

427
00:38:44,360 --> 00:38:47,033
- Hey, you can't do that!
- Let Carol go!

428
00:38:47,240 --> 00:38:49,196
I can break her arm too.

429
00:38:51,440 --> 00:38:54,000
Shit, you can't do that!

430
00:38:58,680 --> 00:39:00,716
You know where you have to go, right?

431
00:39:04,560 --> 00:39:08,269
You're an unbelievably
fucked up asshole!

432
00:39:09,040 --> 00:39:12,635
This is kidnapping!
You're totally nuts, man!

433
00:39:15,840 --> 00:39:17,432
You still there?

434
00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:30,795
Hallo?

435
00:39:38,200 --> 00:39:40,236
Not hoarse yet?

436
00:39:40,520 --> 00:39:42,988
Stupid question.
That's not my biggest problem, eh?

437
00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:45,908
Your biggest problem
is your boyfriend.

438
00:39:47,360 --> 00:39:49,635
Someday I'll pay you back for this.

439
00:39:56,360 --> 00:39:57,998
Yes? René? All done?

440
00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:01,678
Yeah, it all went really well.
I've got a good feeling about it.

441
00:40:01,960 --> 00:40:03,359
And who'd you give the statement to?

442
00:40:05,120 --> 00:40:07,111
Right, same as last time: To Brunner!

443
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:08,953
He's not even there!

444
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:12,511
What, not there? How should
I know why he was there!

445
00:40:13,200 --> 00:40:16,988
Just go and make a statement. Don't play
around with Carol and no bullshit stories.

446
00:40:18,040 --> 00:40:19,189
Fuck!

447
00:40:19,480 --> 00:40:21,391
You've got until nine.

448
00:40:30,320 --> 00:40:32,709
Brunner always leaves work at six!

449
00:40:35,920 --> 00:40:38,388
But I think René is on his way now.

450
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:42,470
Hey... Can't you untie me now?

451
00:40:48,560 --> 00:40:50,630
Fritz, can I ask you something?

452
00:40:53,240 --> 00:40:56,869
If you had to choose
between betraying your dream

453
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:00,719
or the best thing
that ever happened to you...

454
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:05,278
Well, in any case, betrayal is the most
fucked up shit. Gotta go take a piss.

455
00:41:11,640 --> 00:41:14,552
- Fritz. What time is it?
- About seven.

456
00:42:01,520 --> 00:42:03,238
You're a total sicko.

457
00:42:04,600 --> 00:42:07,751
No normal person goes through this
crap just to become a cop again.

458
00:42:08,040 --> 00:42:09,109
Shut up.

459
00:42:18,320 --> 00:42:19,992
Are you all doped up?

460
00:42:25,720 --> 00:42:27,199
Hands off that and shut up!

461
00:42:27,440 --> 00:42:31,513
Pills are total shit. You get no
kicks but you're still addicted.

462
00:42:31,960 --> 00:42:33,313
You've got super cold hands.

463
00:42:33,520 --> 00:42:35,272
Just shut up.

464
00:42:35,640 --> 00:42:37,760
If I've got to sit
around in your shitty car,

465
00:42:37,760 --> 00:42:39,512
then at least I
can talk when I want.

466
00:42:39,720 --> 00:42:42,029
If you don't shut up right now,
then I'm driving you to Oberkirch!

467
00:42:42,240 --> 00:42:44,674
And then? Huh?
You can forget your fucking job!

468
00:42:45,360 --> 00:42:46,560
René's making his statement!

469
00:42:46,560 --> 00:42:48,994
I don't care where you are as
long as it's not with him.

470
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:52,910
Fuck you!

471
00:42:58,520 --> 00:42:59,839
Damn it! Stop!

472
00:43:02,720 --> 00:43:05,154
Let go or I'll swallow all your pills!

473
00:43:05,360 --> 00:43:06,395
Cut out the shit!

474
00:43:21,520 --> 00:43:22,748
Fuck you!

475
00:43:31,760 --> 00:43:33,239
Stupid bitch. Damn it!

476
00:44:03,120 --> 00:44:05,918
Shit. I overslept yesterday.

477
00:44:09,040 --> 00:44:10,598
You're such an idiot.

478
00:44:12,680 --> 00:44:16,559
You say you love me,
but heroin's the only thing you love.

479
00:44:32,560 --> 00:44:33,629
What's wrong now?

480
00:44:33,840 --> 00:44:37,435
Sore from playing soccer.

481
00:44:40,120 --> 00:44:41,553
Was it bad?

482
00:44:42,880 --> 00:44:44,518
Just leave me alone.

483
00:44:47,040 --> 00:44:48,678
I'm really glad you're back.

484
00:44:49,480 --> 00:44:52,950
But you know... actually
we're really damn lucky.

485
00:44:53,320 --> 00:44:56,517
- Now Strähl's got to pay!
- Just shut up!

486
00:44:59,440 --> 00:45:01,874
You're such a fucking asshole!

487
00:45:31,760 --> 00:45:32,795
Hello?

488
00:45:33,120 --> 00:45:36,396
You know what?
If you want to be a cop again,

489
00:45:36,600 --> 00:45:38,750
bring me that half-kilo of heroin!

490
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:42,151
Otherwise, instead of saying
I jumped out the window myself,

491
00:45:42,360 --> 00:45:44,476
I'll say you kidnapped Carol!

492
00:46:42,680 --> 00:46:45,240
Strähl! Now that's a nice surprise!

493
00:46:48,880 --> 00:46:50,632
Hey, Ruedi, you know

494
00:46:50,840 --> 00:46:52,512
you said you'd help me out.

495
00:46:54,160 --> 00:46:55,957
Want a bite?

496
00:46:58,520 --> 00:46:59,748
Shoot!

497
00:47:12,440 --> 00:47:13,634
Honeybunny, uh,

498
00:47:13,960 --> 00:47:16,872
give us a second to talk.
We'll pick back up in a minute.

499
00:47:24,720 --> 00:47:29,475
Listen, Strähl... there's no way I can
give you a half-kilo heroin. And what for?

500
00:47:29,880 --> 00:47:33,759
But it's no big deal for you. You'll get it
back in 12 hours, and nobody'll notice.

501
00:47:34,440 --> 00:47:35,395
Okay, but...

502
00:47:36,760 --> 00:47:39,832
But you're a total wacko
who ought to be in therapy.

503
00:47:40,920 --> 00:47:44,356
I mean, the drugs you had
stashed in your desk...

504
00:47:44,760 --> 00:47:49,709
I took a look at the package inserts...
only real psychos eat that kind of stuff.

505
00:47:51,280 --> 00:47:53,316
Listen, have you gone completely nuts?

506
00:47:55,160 --> 00:47:59,073
Don't take it personally but why don't
you go fishing in your little Amazon

507
00:47:59,280 --> 00:48:00,918
and spare me this shit.

508
00:49:06,880 --> 00:49:11,317
Just quickly: Sorry.
I overreacted a little there and...

509
00:49:12,200 --> 00:49:14,111
I think you're doing a good job.

510
00:49:14,400 --> 00:49:15,958
It's not so tough.

511
00:49:16,160 --> 00:49:18,879
I've been watching this Beko guy
for ages. He deals and deals,

512
00:49:19,080 --> 00:49:22,914
but you never catch Berisha with the
dope. Being a narc is really pretty shitty.

513
00:49:24,560 --> 00:49:28,075
Remember your joke about Berisha?
Putting the dope in his Mercedes?

514
00:49:30,480 --> 00:49:31,674
That's a good one.

515
00:49:32,400 --> 00:49:33,833
Let's do it.

516
00:49:39,720 --> 00:49:42,712
I'll give you a call when
I know something.

517
00:50:16,280 --> 00:50:18,271
So, where's your connection?

518
00:50:21,520 --> 00:50:23,829
Hey, Carol, have you seen Beko?

519
00:50:24,040 --> 00:50:25,553
We need something.

520
00:50:26,760 --> 00:50:29,115
Hey, Carol, you won't believe it!
I fucked over that Strähl guy.

521
00:50:29,320 --> 00:50:32,198
Spare me your crap.

522
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:36,195
What now? Who's got something?

523
00:50:38,520 --> 00:50:40,078
You guys into pills?

524
00:51:06,680 --> 00:51:07,874
Strähl, City Police.

525
00:51:08,080 --> 00:51:10,275
I want to help your son
but he doesn't want to be helped!

526
00:51:10,480 --> 00:51:11,515
Don't believe him.

527
00:51:12,080 --> 00:51:13,957
Why does he need help from the police?

528
00:51:14,720 --> 00:51:16,233
My son works at the post office!

529
00:51:17,920 --> 00:51:20,275
We found this on him.
That's heroin.

530
00:51:20,600 --> 00:51:22,113
And that's not from the post office.

531
00:51:23,680 --> 00:51:24,874
It's not true!

532
00:51:30,960 --> 00:51:32,075
Listen, Mrs. Mussafr.

533
00:51:32,440 --> 00:51:34,317
We're planning a big hit
against the drug mafia.

534
00:51:34,600 --> 00:51:36,875
Your son could be
of great help to us.

535
00:51:38,960 --> 00:51:41,474
- Then he wouldn't have to go to prison?
- No.

536
00:51:42,160 --> 00:51:44,549
If he shows us where he got this from,
he doesn't have anything to worry about.

537
00:51:44,800 --> 00:51:46,358
They're going to kill me!

538
00:51:48,480 --> 00:51:50,311
Will you be able
to protect my son?

539
00:51:52,040 --> 00:51:54,634
I promise, Mrs. Mussafr.

540
00:52:02,760 --> 00:52:06,912
Take the laundry with you if you have
to do it in the middle of the night,

541
00:52:07,280 --> 00:52:10,636
or I'll call building management.
But they won't do anything.

542
00:52:11,080 --> 00:52:13,310
You've got to do it all yourself.

543
00:52:16,680 --> 00:52:18,318
Who does this basement belong to?

544
00:52:18,880 --> 00:52:20,711
No idea. I couldn't give a shit.

545
00:52:26,920 --> 00:52:28,876
Man, you trying to fuck with me.
Where's the rest?

546
00:52:29,120 --> 00:52:30,394
Think they tell me anything?

547
00:52:31,400 --> 00:52:33,550
That guy with Berisha brings it here?

548
00:52:33,800 --> 00:52:34,755
Hoxha?

549
00:52:36,280 --> 00:52:37,395
Yes.

550
00:52:44,400 --> 00:52:46,550
Shit. I don't know
anything about this.

551
00:52:48,680 --> 00:52:52,559
Listen: Just keep going like nothing
happened. Leave Berisha to me.

552
00:52:53,920 --> 00:52:55,399
Just don't screw me, okay?

553
00:53:05,840 --> 00:53:08,752
Hey, watch out.
That junk makes you fat!

554
00:53:11,160 --> 00:53:14,072
I don't know. Only retards
break in at a cop's place.

555
00:53:14,280 --> 00:53:15,713
Perhaps that's the
good thing about it.

556
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:19,390
Yeah, you know, no one expects it
and that's what makes it totally easy.

557
00:53:19,720 --> 00:53:22,075
Are you guys wimps
or do you want to break in?

558
00:53:45,920 --> 00:53:48,673
Strähl's nuts. He's got a piranha.

559
00:53:48,920 --> 00:53:50,069
So where are these pills?

560
00:53:50,400 --> 00:53:52,391
Man, that's what we've got to find.

561
00:53:54,880 --> 00:53:56,677
Everybody take a room.

562
00:54:00,320 --> 00:54:01,309
Let me do this.

563
00:54:03,320 --> 00:54:04,753
Hey, I know how it works.

564
00:54:05,120 --> 00:54:06,678
Yeah, but let's hurry.

565
00:54:06,880 --> 00:54:09,075
Those are my keys. Leave me alone!

566
00:54:09,280 --> 00:54:10,554
Boys, I've got it.

567
00:54:13,120 --> 00:54:14,553
That's all?

568
00:54:15,120 --> 00:54:16,348
Where's René?

569
00:54:24,960 --> 00:54:26,678
Come here!

570
00:54:26,960 --> 00:54:28,951
Hey, don't screw around.
We got to get going.

571
00:54:29,240 --> 00:54:30,878
It doesn't matter anymore.

572
00:54:32,040 --> 00:54:33,792
You off your rocker?

573
00:54:38,080 --> 00:54:39,035
Goal.

574
00:54:40,040 --> 00:54:41,359
- Yeah, thanks.
- There.

575
00:54:42,120 --> 00:54:43,519
13 right.

576
00:54:44,520 --> 00:54:46,476
120,000 francs!

577
00:54:48,800 --> 00:54:50,279
- Goal!
- Goal!

578
00:54:52,600 --> 00:54:54,431
It's all just like you said.

579
00:54:56,720 --> 00:54:58,517
And now I'm going to stop doping.

580
00:54:59,920 --> 00:55:01,876
And open up a bike workshop.

581
00:55:02,960 --> 00:55:04,313
The two of us...

582
00:55:07,800 --> 00:55:11,156
- Damn it, what's...
- Shit. Why didn't we get out of here!

583
00:55:11,840 --> 00:55:13,592
Fucking mess! Dammit!

584
00:55:13,800 --> 00:55:17,031
Don't worry. I'll tell him I don't
want anything from him anymore.

585
00:55:17,240 --> 00:55:19,390
- Lowlife shitheads. Fuck!
- Strähl...

586
00:55:19,640 --> 00:55:21,949
You guys insane? Where are my pills?

587
00:55:22,280 --> 00:55:24,840
Something I wanted to tell you...

588
00:55:28,680 --> 00:55:29,669
What's that?

589
00:55:37,080 --> 00:55:38,433
Shit...

590
00:55:39,640 --> 00:55:41,392
- Double bingo!
- But you wanted to...

591
00:55:41,600 --> 00:55:42,999
- Down to the station.
- Let me go!

592
00:55:43,200 --> 00:55:45,350
- Let him go!
- Damn it! That's enough!

593
00:55:53,920 --> 00:55:55,638
Shit, I'll do it.

594
00:56:04,360 --> 00:56:06,999
Shit, René, I don't
have a good feeling

595
00:56:07,240 --> 00:56:10,232
- Why? It'll be fine.
- Just shut the fuck up and go!

596
00:56:13,280 --> 00:56:14,315
Okay...

597
00:56:30,600 --> 00:56:32,830
You probably don't want
to take that in?

598
00:56:33,320 --> 00:56:35,231
Just don't screw up.

599
00:56:43,440 --> 00:56:47,149
Next time you see me,
I'm going to be starting a new life.

600
00:57:05,120 --> 00:57:06,235
That's for you,

601
00:57:07,640 --> 00:57:08,470
sweetheart.

602
00:57:30,600 --> 00:57:31,999
Sugar, coke...

603
00:57:50,800 --> 00:57:52,119
What's up, boss?

604
00:57:58,920 --> 00:58:00,592
You screwed up.

605
00:58:01,320 --> 00:58:03,117
I didn't do anything!

606
00:58:03,360 --> 00:58:06,272
Shut up! Just give us back
what you stole from us!

607
00:58:30,960 --> 00:58:34,509
Somehow we always end up sitting
in the car waiting for René.

608
00:58:40,480 --> 00:58:42,516
What's taking him so long?

609
00:58:48,200 --> 00:58:50,589
You going to give him the dope
when he comes back?

610
00:58:51,280 --> 00:58:52,429
Would you give it to him?

611
00:58:58,600 --> 00:58:59,953
I'll go have a look.

612
00:59:03,280 --> 00:59:06,955
Did a junkie come in here two hours
ago wanting to make a statement?

613
00:59:07,520 --> 00:59:08,953
Ever seen a junkie

614
00:59:09,160 --> 00:59:11,037
wanting to make a statement?

615
01:00:51,520 --> 01:00:54,239
Why don't ya get lost
if you don't like it!

616
01:01:01,120 --> 01:01:02,235
Where is he?

617
01:01:04,920 --> 01:01:06,990
Shit, did they lock him up?

618
01:01:12,880 --> 01:01:14,199
He's dead.

619
01:01:17,320 --> 01:01:19,754
The idiot had to go to the loo first.

620
01:01:31,160 --> 01:01:32,479
Don't call him an idiot.

621
01:01:40,360 --> 01:01:41,793
Shit.

622
01:01:45,080 --> 01:01:46,638
Damn.

623
01:01:49,920 --> 01:01:53,549
He's such an asshole...
such a retard...

624
01:03:50,240 --> 01:03:52,117
What's the matter with you?

625
01:03:53,600 --> 01:03:55,670
Why are you never taking the phone?

626
01:04:45,760 --> 01:04:48,558
Shit. He'd really wanted to
set up his bike workshop again.

627
01:04:51,000 --> 01:04:53,958
And now that he came so close...

628
01:05:06,320 --> 01:05:07,639
He won.

629
01:05:11,000 --> 01:05:12,353
13 for 13.

630
01:05:18,320 --> 01:05:21,710
Fucking hell!
Why wasn't he more careful?

631
01:05:29,440 --> 01:05:31,271
He'd never have quit.

632
01:05:32,440 --> 01:05:34,556
You've got no fucking clue, jerk-off!

633
01:06:04,720 --> 01:06:06,597
Can I have some of your heroin?

634
01:06:26,800 --> 01:06:28,028
Want some too?

635
01:06:33,080 --> 01:06:34,718
You haven't got any more pills.

636
01:08:31,920 --> 01:08:33,399
Not hungry?

637
01:08:39,760 --> 01:08:41,637
Junkies never get hungry either.

638
01:08:53,800 --> 01:08:56,951
Fuck, Vera.
What is it this time?

639
01:08:57,160 --> 01:08:58,195
Stressed out?

640
01:08:59,560 --> 01:09:01,835
Sorry, boys, I'd love to
offer you a beer,

641
01:09:02,040 --> 01:09:05,077
but today's really inconvenient.
- You handling her okay?

642
01:09:05,600 --> 01:09:07,556
Don't you want to introduce
your new babe?

643
01:09:07,840 --> 01:09:09,592
You see, I'm busy. Beat it!

644
01:09:09,800 --> 01:09:12,439
- Are we supposed to put up with that?
- Shit! Carol! Put it away!

645
01:09:13,480 --> 01:09:15,000
Goddamn, Strähl!
What's going on here!

646
01:09:15,000 --> 01:09:16,718
Now you're doing it
with this junkie babe?

647
01:09:28,080 --> 01:09:29,832
Calm down, man!

648
01:09:32,800 --> 01:09:35,314
Damn it, don't act so bloody stupid!

649
01:09:48,440 --> 01:09:51,193
Don't leave me hanging here!

650
01:09:52,000 --> 01:09:53,433
What do you want anyway?

651
01:09:54,840 --> 01:09:55,909
You guys nuts?

652
01:09:56,920 --> 01:09:59,559
Brunner said you'd been
acting weird lately.

653
01:10:00,080 --> 01:10:01,638
And know what? He's right.

654
01:10:02,040 --> 01:10:05,271
Know what?
Brunner can just suck my dick!

655
01:10:05,600 --> 01:10:08,114
And what about the
dead junkie in the loo?

656
01:10:08,320 --> 01:10:10,788
About the prescription
slips from Arbenz?

657
01:10:11,000 --> 01:10:12,831
And what happened to this one?

658
01:10:16,880 --> 01:10:17,869
Shit!

659
01:10:19,120 --> 01:10:20,394
What was that?

660
01:10:21,560 --> 01:10:25,314
The big fish eat the little ones,
unless you're a piranha.

661
01:10:26,440 --> 01:10:27,793
This one's not even dangerous.

662
01:10:33,240 --> 01:10:34,434
Did you get this from her?

663
01:10:40,520 --> 01:10:42,078
Will you just shut up!

664
01:10:42,280 --> 01:10:45,033
How can you stand it with her?
Does she scream in bed like that too?

665
01:10:46,920 --> 01:10:50,549
I would have never thought one of us
would sink so low. Not even Strähl.

666
01:10:51,400 --> 01:10:55,393
Listen. You and me, we don't
let our colleagues drown,

667
01:10:55,800 --> 01:10:57,438
even if they are total loonies and

668
01:10:57,640 --> 01:11:00,393
want to catch a disease between
the legs of a babe like that.

669
01:11:00,960 --> 01:11:02,075
We'll just tell Brunner

670
01:11:02,280 --> 01:11:03,952
the girl had the dope.

671
01:11:04,200 --> 01:11:07,476
And there's no way this Arbenz shit's
going to land you in jail.

672
01:11:08,000 --> 01:11:12,278
You can't do this. Strähl,
tell me you won't do this.

673
01:11:19,280 --> 01:11:21,350
Fuck. Now I'm getting locked up.

674
01:11:29,120 --> 01:11:31,236
Go! And don't let 'em catch you.
I'll take care of this!

675
01:11:31,440 --> 01:11:33,271
- Damn! Son of a bitch!
- Fuck, Strähl!

676
01:11:33,480 --> 01:11:34,754
Have you lost it? Goddamn...

677
01:11:34,960 --> 01:11:37,554
Go ahead and run! Just wait
until Strähl puts the bite on you!

678
01:11:40,320 --> 01:11:41,833
So did that make you feel better?

679
01:11:42,400 --> 01:11:44,630
Do you have to always
screw up everything?

680
01:11:55,600 --> 01:11:57,795
Strähl, damn it! Come on, pick up!

681
01:12:08,640 --> 01:12:10,551
That's him! That's the officer!

682
01:12:10,720 --> 01:12:11,789
Shit.

683
01:12:14,320 --> 01:12:16,356
Strähl, help! They're
going to kill me!

684
01:12:16,680 --> 01:12:18,272
And now? What're you gonna do?

685
01:12:22,960 --> 01:12:25,394
Hey Beko, sorry,
can you just quickly...

686
01:12:28,600 --> 01:12:31,910
Thanks, but sorry,
I'm really in a hurry.

687
01:12:35,720 --> 01:12:36,596
Hello.

688
01:12:47,720 --> 01:12:51,156
Can't do this one. It's much too much.
Can't pay that out.

689
01:12:51,920 --> 01:12:54,275
You have to mail it in and
then they'll send you the money.

690
01:12:56,640 --> 01:12:58,358
But I need the dough right now.

691
01:12:58,640 --> 01:13:00,870
- Sorry, I can't pay out that much...
- But I need the dough right now!

692
01:13:01,080 --> 01:13:02,399
Sorry.

693
01:13:02,680 --> 01:13:04,477
Those are the rules.
I can't pay it out.

694
01:13:04,680 --> 01:13:05,590
Damn!

695
01:13:12,320 --> 01:13:15,153
Do you have a connection who can
trade a 120,000 lotto ticket

696
01:13:15,360 --> 01:13:16,634
for 80,000?

697
01:13:17,040 --> 01:13:18,075
Fast and in cash?

698
01:13:20,680 --> 01:13:21,874
Come on!

699
01:13:23,840 --> 01:13:25,637
Um... is an hour fast enough for you?

700
01:13:52,720 --> 01:13:54,836
Fuck you

701
01:14:04,160 --> 01:14:06,196
- You want to fuck us over?
- No!

702
01:14:06,400 --> 01:14:09,198
- She ain't getting money from us!
- No! We'll take the ticket from her!

703
01:14:11,360 --> 01:14:14,079
The ticket'll get you 120,000 francs.

704
01:14:14,280 --> 01:14:15,474
And then we're even.

705
01:14:23,800 --> 01:14:25,836
But if the girl fucks up,

706
01:14:26,040 --> 01:14:27,758
then you're both in trouble!

707
01:14:55,520 --> 01:14:58,353
I used to think you
were a good police officer.

708
01:15:01,480 --> 01:15:03,436
But this here is like kindergarten.

709
01:15:06,080 --> 01:15:08,560
And if you simply don't answer
the charges by Mrs. Mussafr

710
01:15:08,560 --> 01:15:09,595
and the others, then...

711
01:15:10,520 --> 01:15:12,078
then things look grim.

712
01:15:23,280 --> 01:15:25,920
Admit it! You stole
heroin from Mr. Mussafr,

713
01:15:25,920 --> 01:15:28,388
and there you really
picked on a weak one!

714
01:15:28,640 --> 01:15:30,995
And now he's got
the Albanians after him!

715
01:15:34,880 --> 01:15:35,880
And you don't remember

716
01:15:35,880 --> 01:15:38,519
why you stole the prescription
slips from Dr. Arbenz either.

717
01:15:39,640 --> 01:15:43,110
And then you didn't have anything to do
with the dead junkie in the bathroom.

718
01:15:47,800 --> 01:15:51,918
Well, I really don't see any other possibility
than to call in the prosecutor's office.

719
01:15:56,280 --> 01:15:58,840
Then what? What'll you tell them?

720
01:15:59,960 --> 01:16:02,952
That I stole a half-kilo
heroin from Beko?

721
01:16:03,400 --> 01:16:05,868
And where'd a small-time street dealer

722
01:16:06,080 --> 01:16:07,280
get a half-kilo of heroin?

723
01:16:07,280 --> 01:16:09,748
And anyway, you guys are
trailing Beko day and night.

724
01:16:10,360 --> 01:16:11,720
You never noticed anything?

725
01:16:11,720 --> 01:16:14,359
And you think the prosecutor's
going to believe you?

726
01:16:14,560 --> 01:16:16,710
Or believe a mom of
someone with a record?

727
01:16:17,160 --> 01:16:18,560
Do you still have it together or what?

728
01:16:18,560 --> 01:16:20,278
Don't you have anything
better to do? Know what?

729
01:16:20,480 --> 01:16:22,994
This is and always will be
a fucking lousy outfit, damn it!

730
01:16:24,880 --> 01:16:25,835
Sorry,

731
01:16:27,200 --> 01:16:29,077
Flaky Beat said Beko is

732
01:16:29,280 --> 01:16:31,316
out with another Albanian.

733
01:16:32,320 --> 01:16:33,753
And he said... I don't know,

734
01:16:33,960 --> 01:16:37,157
it doesn't make sense... he said
they'd picked up something at a kiosk,

735
01:16:37,360 --> 01:16:39,430
something with the lottery.

736
01:16:39,640 --> 01:16:42,200
And your babe was with them too.

737
01:16:46,560 --> 01:16:47,515
Shit. Know what?

738
01:16:47,800 --> 01:16:50,268
Go ahead and do whatever
you want with your prosecutor.

739
01:16:55,760 --> 01:16:59,912
- Hey, baby. Now show me the ticket.
- Now first you show me the 80,000.

740
01:17:00,280 --> 01:17:01,599
The girl's here.

741
01:17:01,840 --> 01:17:02,875
You idiot, what're you waiting for?

742
01:17:03,080 --> 01:17:05,878
You're always screwing up. Kill
her off and bring me the money!

743
01:17:06,080 --> 01:17:07,195
He's got the money.

744
01:17:11,040 --> 01:17:12,837
You got something?

745
01:17:14,520 --> 01:17:15,794
Sorry, Anz, not now.

746
01:17:16,040 --> 01:17:18,440
Then what're you doing
with that guy there?

747
01:17:18,440 --> 01:17:19,589
Hey, you guys crazy?

748
01:17:19,800 --> 01:17:21,836
Come on, now we're doing business.

749
01:17:24,440 --> 01:17:25,793
Get the ticket from her!

750
01:17:26,080 --> 01:17:27,832
What's this? Where's the cash?

751
01:17:30,920 --> 01:17:32,797
Give me the ticket and it'll be fine.

752
01:17:35,720 --> 01:17:37,278
The money, damn it!

753
01:17:37,560 --> 01:17:38,788
What is this shit?

754
01:17:39,040 --> 01:17:40,314
Or we're going up in smoke.

755
01:17:44,480 --> 01:17:45,993
Hey! Are you guys crazy?

756
01:17:49,760 --> 01:17:52,274
Get the ticket from her!
Come on, do it!

757
01:18:30,400 --> 01:18:31,799
Freeze!

758
01:18:40,280 --> 01:18:41,599
What are you doing here? Get lost!

759
01:18:41,960 --> 01:18:45,555
In a sec. But first let's do
that joke with Berisha's

760
01:18:45,760 --> 01:18:47,637
Mercedes.
- Have you lost it, man?

761
01:18:47,840 --> 01:18:50,559
You want to just fish around a little
or really catch one?

762
01:18:52,600 --> 01:18:54,511
Soon you'll be rid of Berisha too.

763
01:18:55,120 --> 01:18:56,917
Well, yeah, you said that before.

764
01:18:57,160 --> 01:18:59,958
Give me an hour.
And you take a look in the trunk.

765
01:19:22,880 --> 01:19:26,156
We could have easily kept
some dope for ourselves.

766
01:19:26,880 --> 01:19:30,316
A little less would have still
kept the guy in jail long enough.

767
01:19:32,800 --> 01:19:34,711
Too late now.

768
01:19:39,520 --> 01:19:41,750
Do you know the Smarties oracle?

769
01:19:43,480 --> 01:19:46,711
The first five you take
will tell you the future.

770
01:19:56,360 --> 01:19:58,191
And what does that mean now?

771
01:19:59,080 --> 01:20:01,469
Red's for love,
purple for wild times

772
01:20:02,120 --> 01:20:03,997
and brown for shit.

773
01:20:12,960 --> 01:20:15,349
Now you've got to eat them,
otherwise it won't work.

774
01:20:23,000 --> 01:20:24,274
So cool.

00:02:59,303 --> 00:03:01,263
I'll take the suitcases
to the bedroom.

2
00:03:01,305 --> 00:03:03,390
I thought you could stay
in the room that was mine

3
00:03:03,432 --> 00:03:05,017
and I'll stay
in your grandfather's.

4
00:03:05,058 --> 00:03:06,185
All right?

5
00:03:45,475 --> 00:03:48,352
THE SEVENTH SEAL

6
00:04:12,252 --> 00:04:14,003
- Thank you so much.
- You're welcome.

7
00:04:20,133 --> 00:04:23,553
Excuse me,
you are from the church, right?

8
00:04:24,388 --> 00:04:26,265
Are you new around here?

9
00:04:26,307 --> 00:04:27,517
I just arrived.

10
00:04:27,558 --> 00:04:29,018
- What's your name?
- Raquel.

11
00:04:29,268 --> 00:04:30,353
And you?

12
00:04:30,395 --> 00:04:31,895
- I'm Ana Helena.
- And I'm Laura.

13
00:04:32,313 --> 00:04:33,857
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

14
00:04:33,898 --> 00:04:37,152
Do you know if there is any other
activity besides the ones on the wall?

15
00:04:37,943 --> 00:04:38,945
Yes.

16
00:04:39,195 --> 00:04:42,157
We do many activities
to spread God's word.

17
00:04:42,407 --> 00:04:44,908
We have a service,
that is actual led by my mom.

18
00:04:44,950 --> 00:04:47,328
We have a group cell
at my house.

19
00:04:47,662 --> 00:04:49,205
Have you been touched by God?

20
00:04:49,913 --> 00:04:51,665
Yes, a little... I am new to this.

21
00:04:52,667 --> 00:04:53,752
So it's worth it.

22
00:04:53,793 --> 00:04:56,420
I think so too.
Then you meet everybody.

23
00:04:58,172 --> 00:04:59,257
Ok.

24
00:04:59,298 --> 00:05:00,675
I'll get your number, ok?

25
00:05:00,717 --> 00:05:02,968
I felt something interesting
about you.

26
00:06:00,485 --> 00:06:02,737
ANA HELENA ADDED YOU
TO THE GROUP ""YOUTH MINISTRY”

27
00:06:02,778 --> 00:06:04,738
GIRLS, THIS IS RAQUEL.

28
00:06:04,780 --> 00:06:06,615
WELCOME!

29
00:06:07,283 --> 00:06:09,827
RAQUEL, WE WANT TO TAKE YOU
SOMEWHERE TOMORROW. CAN YOU COME?

30
00:06:09,868 --> 00:06:11,745
BRING YOUR SWIMSUIT!

31
00:06:36,937 --> 00:06:38,022
Wow.

32
00:09:53,383 --> 00:09:54,635
Help!

33
00:12:21,740 --> 00:12:24,618
Darling, are you all right?

34
00:12:29,248 --> 00:12:30,665
You are too hot.

35
00:12:31,875 --> 00:12:33,627
Are you feeling well?

36
00:12:34,795 --> 00:12:37,130
Do you want me to prepare
something for you, maybe a tea?

37
00:12:37,923 --> 00:12:39,007
No.

38
00:12:42,678 --> 00:12:46,140
- Can I turn off the light?
- Don't, leave it on.

39
00:12:48,767 --> 00:12:49,810
Rest now.

40
00:12:53,438 --> 00:12:54,523
Good night.

41
00:13:10,915 --> 00:13:13,500
God is thirsty for healing.

42
00:13:13,542 --> 00:13:16,670
And we go, like:
opening our path, opening our path.

43
00:13:16,712 --> 00:13:20,007
Because our path is illuminated.
Our path is the word of God.

44
00:13:20,048 --> 00:13:23,260
- We have a direction. Am I right?
- Amen!

45
00:13:23,302 --> 00:13:28,182
In Matthew 26:41,
""Watch and pray.

46
00:13:28,223 --> 00:13:30,475
So that you will not fall
into temptation.""

47
00:13:31,435 --> 00:13:33,603
Do you know what that means,
brothers?

48
00:13:34,313 --> 00:13:38,317
That even though we're being watchful,
Evil will want to prevail.

49
00:13:38,692 --> 00:13:41,820
The power of Satan.
The force of darkness.

50
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:43,947
The power of the serpent.

51
00:13:43,988 --> 00:13:46,242
But we have the power of light.

52
00:13:46,992 --> 00:13:50,203
Which is much stronger
than any other force.

53
00:13:50,245 --> 00:13:54,040
And we will use that.
We will use this against Evil.

54
00:13:54,082 --> 00:13:56,752
That's right, my daughter!
That's right!

55
00:13:57,085 --> 00:13:59,338
- And I want an amen!
- Amen!

56
00:13:59,380 --> 00:14:02,090
- And I want Glory!
- Glory!

57
00:14:08,722 --> 00:14:11,142
Don't cut it into rings.
Cut into small squares.

58
00:14:11,725 --> 00:14:12,852
- It's better.
- Ok.

59
00:14:15,980 --> 00:14:18,982
We have to take advantage of this
situation to the fullest, my daughter.

60
00:14:19,858 --> 00:14:21,985
We can't suffer
any loss from this. At all.

61
00:14:23,237 --> 00:14:24,780
I invited some friends.

62
00:14:25,363 --> 00:14:26,407
You did?

63
00:14:27,532 --> 00:14:29,493
How nice! Which friends?

64
00:14:30,618 --> 00:14:32,120
Some people from the church.

65
00:14:34,498 --> 00:14:36,167
Oh, from the church...

66
00:14:38,293 --> 00:14:41,338
Dad, people from the church
also do groceries, right?

67
00:14:41,380 --> 00:14:43,548
I know. That's right.
It's all right.

68
00:14:46,010 --> 00:14:47,135
But...

69
00:14:49,137 --> 00:14:51,432
Don't talk too much
to these people, okay?

70
00:14:53,267 --> 00:14:54,768
Why? They are cool.

71
00:14:55,685 --> 00:14:56,770
Okay, they're cool.

72
00:14:56,812 --> 00:14:59,022
But college friends
can also be nice.

73
00:14:59,648 --> 00:15:01,400
By the way,
how's this matter going?

74
00:15:01,650 --> 00:15:04,152
I don't know yet, dad,
but I'm looking into it.

75
00:15:06,030 --> 00:15:09,700
It's good to think about this.
Think about your future.

76
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:13,078
Cut this one too?
Very tiny, okay?

77
00:15:20,710 --> 00:15:22,087
- Did it light up?
- Yes.

78
00:15:27,802 --> 00:15:30,387
- Hello, Elisa!
- How are you doing, Dulcidio?

79
00:15:30,428 --> 00:15:32,263
Let me do it. Go down a bit.

80
00:15:32,305 --> 00:15:33,348
Wait, look!

81
00:15:33,723 --> 00:15:35,183
I think it's cute.

82
00:15:35,808 --> 00:15:36,935
Do it on Raquel.

83
00:15:36,977 --> 00:15:37,978
Come here.

84
00:15:43,567 --> 00:15:45,693
We love using it as makeup,
you know?

85
00:15:46,570 --> 00:15:48,613
Did you see how well
they are getting along?

86
00:15:49,823 --> 00:15:51,617
- Yes, that's true.
- Yes.

87
00:15:52,702 --> 00:15:56,830
Hermes, you can count on us
for anything you need.

88
00:15:57,080 --> 00:15:59,290
Because this period
of transition is not easy.

89
00:15:59,333 --> 00:16:00,417
Thank you, Elisa.

90
00:16:00,458 --> 00:16:04,380
I think about Raquel...
After everything that happened to Vera.

91
00:16:09,843 --> 00:16:14,348
We are made of love

92
00:16:15,348 --> 00:16:16,600
I think he is cute.

93
00:16:17,475 --> 00:16:19,227
I think he is cute, and hot...

94
00:16:19,268 --> 00:16:21,355
What is this, Laura?
God is watching.

95
00:16:21,980 --> 00:16:24,107
As for Raquel...
She is watching nothing, see?

96
00:16:25,608 --> 00:16:27,360
- What?
- Gustavo.

97
00:16:29,863 --> 00:16:31,907
His family owns
Monte's Newspaper.

98
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:33,908
Yes, Monte's Newspaper.

99
00:16:34,242 --> 00:16:36,745
- That only prints bad news.
- Liar.

100
00:16:38,163 --> 00:16:39,498
There's nothing to it.

101
00:16:39,540 --> 00:16:41,380
It only runs here
and another couple of cities.

102
00:16:41,417 --> 00:16:43,377
Oh yeah? God is watching.

103
00:16:58,142 --> 00:16:59,308
Vera!

104
00:17:03,522 --> 00:17:06,150
- André, now I can't talk.
- Wait. Let me talk.

105
00:17:06,192 --> 00:17:09,528
I'm trying to talk to you
and you don't answer me.

106
00:17:10,278 --> 00:17:12,131
I don't answer because
I don't want to talk to you.

107
00:17:12,155 --> 00:17:13,365
But I'm your boyfriend!

108
00:17:13,407 --> 00:17:15,783
You're not my boyfriend, André.
We broke up!

109
00:17:17,160 --> 00:17:18,412
Open that door!

110
00:17:38,682 --> 00:17:39,850
Genesis.

111
00:17:40,933 --> 00:17:42,060
Corinthians.

112
00:17:43,437 --> 00:17:45,063
Proverbs. Hosea.

113
00:17:45,438 --> 00:17:47,148
Deuteronomy. Judges.

114
00:17:47,190 --> 00:17:48,317
Raquel.

115
00:18:13,467 --> 00:18:18,097
Savior
The special name for our Lord

116
00:18:18,138 --> 00:18:22,308
Savior ow ow ow
The special name for your Love

117
00:18:22,350 --> 00:18:27,188
Savior
The special name for our Lord

118
00:18:27,230 --> 00:18:32,110
Savior
The special name for your Love

119
00:18:32,527 --> 00:18:36,990
Now I know why God sent me
and why he sent you too

120
00:18:37,740 --> 00:18:39,075
to this place,

121
00:18:39,117 --> 00:18:40,327
to this suffering.

122
00:18:40,368 --> 00:18:42,787
This is all part of God's plan.

123
00:18:43,163 --> 00:18:45,748
We are not lost men, Assos.

124
00:18:46,167 --> 00:18:49,127
Our lives are not insignificant.

125
00:18:49,168 --> 00:18:53,673
We have a mission to accomplish,
which cannot be done anywhere else.

126
00:18:53,923 --> 00:18:55,883
Oh, my brothers!

127
00:18:55,925 --> 00:18:59,137
How glad I am to live with you.

128
00:19:00,013 --> 00:19:02,265
Because that's God's plan.

129
00:19:02,307 --> 00:19:04,392
I'll write it all down.

130
00:19:26,415 --> 00:19:29,918
Hey, we're going to have a party
at the Church. Want to come?

131
00:19:32,545 --> 00:19:33,588
Raquel?

132
00:19:34,422 --> 00:19:36,048
- Raquel?
- What?

133
00:19:39,218 --> 00:19:41,555
- Oh, sorry.
- Okay, I'll clean it.

134
00:20:01,492 --> 00:20:06,830
WHO WROTE THE WORD OF GOD?

135
00:20:10,958 --> 00:20:12,920
To the woman, he said,

136
00:20:12,962 --> 00:20:16,840
I will greatly multiply
your grief and your conception,

137
00:20:20,260 --> 00:20:22,845
and with grief
you will bear children;

138
00:20:23,347 --> 00:20:28,227
and your desire shall be for your husband,
and he shall rule over you.

139
00:20:32,605 --> 00:20:34,398
And the head of Christ is God...

140
00:20:34,733 --> 00:20:37,818
But the woman
is the glory of man.

141
00:20:37,860 --> 00:20:42,657
Now, as the Church
submits to Christ,

142
00:20:43,367 --> 00:20:47,662
so also wives should submit
to their husbands in everything.

143
00:20:49,288 --> 00:20:52,875
Ephesians 5:24.

144
00:20:59,548 --> 00:21:01,385
I'm not doing well these days,
you know?

145
00:21:02,260 --> 00:21:04,930
But it's okay.
I think she was right.

146
00:21:05,805 --> 00:21:07,975
I mean, she must be right.
I guess...

147
00:21:08,017 --> 00:21:09,392
- Hi.
- What happened?

148
00:21:09,433 --> 00:21:11,937
You know that model contest
that I said I was going to do?

149
00:21:12,520 --> 00:21:14,397
- I passed.
- Wow, how cool.

150
00:21:14,898 --> 00:21:17,608
But then the pastor said
that I better not go.

151
00:21:17,650 --> 00:21:19,778
Yeah, Pietra.
Because this is not for you.

152
00:21:20,278 --> 00:21:23,323
- That is not a serious profession.
- But what's the problem?

153
00:21:23,698 --> 00:21:26,158
- You will stray from the path.
- But why?

154
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:28,537
Laura has some news.

155
00:21:28,953 --> 00:21:30,747
- If you don't tell, I will!
- What?

156
00:21:30,788 --> 00:21:33,250
- Come on Laura, tell us!
- Don't need to gossip about it!

157
00:21:33,292 --> 00:21:35,043
- What is it?
- Tell us!

158
00:21:35,918 --> 00:21:37,170
We got engaged.

159
00:21:37,545 --> 00:21:38,672
- Really?
- Yes.

160
00:21:38,713 --> 00:21:39,882
Damn, congratulations!

161
00:21:39,923 --> 00:21:41,298
- Thanks.
- Thank you.

162
00:21:41,342 --> 00:21:43,260
The pastor gave the blessing
and everything.

163
00:21:43,302 --> 00:21:45,428
Now the challenge
is to wait for the wedding.

164
00:21:46,430 --> 00:21:47,472
Congratulations.

165
00:21:49,182 --> 00:21:50,183
That's so cool.

166
00:21:50,725 --> 00:21:51,727
Thank you.

167
00:21:53,228 --> 00:21:54,228
Tamar.

168
00:21:57,107 --> 00:21:59,192
How many people
have you brought to the church?

169
00:22:01,110 --> 00:22:03,947
I always try to bring
people in, Anice.

170
00:22:03,988 --> 00:22:06,115
How come you never succeed?

171
00:22:06,700 --> 00:22:10,078
- That's offensive.
- Jesus brought twelve, remember?

172
00:22:10,370 --> 00:22:11,705
But I am not Jesus!

173
00:22:12,455 --> 00:22:17,460
But we, as a church, must
seek that, to be like Jesus.

174
00:22:17,835 --> 00:22:18,837
Yeah, right.

175
00:22:19,503 --> 00:22:20,630
Laura, you go...

176
00:22:22,215 --> 00:22:23,258
Oh, God...

177
00:22:24,592 --> 00:22:26,135
What's your biggest fear?

178
00:22:28,597 --> 00:22:30,223
My biggest fear?

179
00:22:30,848 --> 00:22:33,643
- C'mon, Laura!
- Calm down, I'm thinking!

180
00:22:35,853 --> 00:22:37,230
Of a car running over me.

181
00:22:38,857 --> 00:22:41,275
- Is that your biggest fear?
- It is, why?

182
00:22:42,777 --> 00:22:45,197
Okay,
I just hope this isn't a lie.

183
00:22:45,238 --> 00:22:47,073
Because the universe conspires!

184
00:22:47,115 --> 00:22:48,325
Oh, really?

185
00:22:48,367 --> 00:22:50,618
I thought it was something
more interesting.

186
00:22:51,368 --> 00:22:55,707
The end of times, Lucifer,
spiders, something like that.

187
00:22:55,748 --> 00:22:58,042
- Well, it's my fear..
- Uhhh...

188
00:23:01,547 --> 00:23:03,423
Why did you come to Monte Megido?

189
00:23:06,510 --> 00:23:08,178
Because my father was born here.

190
00:23:10,805 --> 00:23:12,223
No, what she meant was...

191
00:23:12,265 --> 00:23:15,643
What happened
for you to come here?

192
00:23:16,018 --> 00:23:18,230
She already answered,
her father was born here.

193
00:23:18,272 --> 00:23:20,523
Okay, why did you come back?

194
00:23:23,025 --> 00:23:25,945
- We wanted to start over.
- Start over what?

195
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:29,365
You never wanted
to start anything over?

196
00:23:29,407 --> 00:23:31,200
It's your turn to answer, Raquel.

197
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:33,995
I already answered,
we came to start over.

198
00:23:34,037 --> 00:23:36,498
Yeah, she already answered.
Now she asks the question.

199
00:23:36,540 --> 00:23:37,582
Fine.

200
00:23:40,168 --> 00:23:41,168
Ana Helena.

201
00:23:43,547 --> 00:23:46,550
Do you believe in everything
that is written in the Bible?

202
00:23:47,300 --> 00:23:49,677
Everything written
in the Bible is divine.

203
00:23:49,718 --> 00:23:50,720
Go, Suzana.

204
00:23:53,973 --> 00:23:54,892
Your turn, Tamar.

205
00:23:54,933 --> 00:23:58,812
But do you think
we should be submissive?

206
00:23:59,062 --> 00:24:00,105
We who?

207
00:24:00,688 --> 00:24:01,690
Women.

208
00:24:04,233 --> 00:24:07,695
For you to understand what the Bible
says about the woman being submissive,

209
00:24:08,197 --> 00:24:12,325
you first have to understand
what true submission is.

210
00:24:12,950 --> 00:24:15,745
And submission is a rule
for every Christian.

211
00:24:17,955 --> 00:24:21,960
But it was a book written many years ago
and was written only by men.

212
00:24:22,002 --> 00:24:24,587
There were many writers,
but the authorship is from God.

213
00:24:24,628 --> 00:24:25,713
Yes.

214
00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:27,715
Ok, but...

215
00:24:27,757 --> 00:24:32,470
What's in the Bible
is much more than just written words.

216
00:24:33,597 --> 00:24:35,723
God speaks in parables.

217
00:24:36,348 --> 00:24:38,477
Behind each word is a message.

218
00:24:38,518 --> 00:24:43,232
And that message is only deciphered
if you've contact with the Holy Spirit.

219
00:24:43,482 --> 00:24:49,070
Do you believe that women
brought death and sin to Earth

220
00:24:49,112 --> 00:24:50,738
because it's written like that?

221
00:24:52,032 --> 00:24:54,450
Raquel, you already asked
a lot of questions.

222
00:24:54,492 --> 00:24:55,743
It's against the rules.

223
00:24:56,160 --> 00:24:57,870
What rules? Who wrote the rules?

224
00:24:58,538 --> 00:24:59,622
Me.

225
00:24:59,663 --> 00:25:01,123
- Ana Helena!
- Wow!

226
00:25:02,250 --> 00:25:04,627
I think the Bible
should be revised.

227
00:25:08,507 --> 00:25:09,632
Revised?

228
00:25:11,508 --> 00:25:14,012
Yes, if it has been rewritten
so many times,

229
00:25:14,053 --> 00:25:16,055
why would it be
any different now?

230
00:25:24,522 --> 00:25:26,650
I advise you to pray.

231
00:26:08,817 --> 00:26:10,610
ARE YOU OKAY?

232
00:26:11,568 --> 00:26:12,945
YES...

233
00:26:16,573 --> 00:26:21,495
I AGREE WITH YOU.
AND IT'S NOT JUST ME...

234
00:26:29,503 --> 00:26:34,883
WHAT IF WE START A NEW GROUP?

235
00:26:38,472 --> 00:26:40,515
WHAT ABOUT THE CELL?

236
00:26:41,725 --> 00:26:44,352
IT WILL BE DIFFERENT.

237
00:26:47,605 --> 00:26:50,025
BUT DID YOU DECIDE THAT NOW?

238
00:26:50,858 --> 00:26:52,860
I THINK THAT...

239
00:27:04,038 --> 00:27:08,377
I'VE BEEN RECEIVING SIGNS.

240
00:29:04,867 --> 00:29:05,910
Hi, Elisa.

241
00:29:06,493 --> 00:29:07,787
Hi, Raquel. How are you?

242
00:29:08,037 --> 00:29:09,122
May I help you?

243
00:29:09,663 --> 00:29:11,457
Coffee. Do you have it?

244
00:29:11,498 --> 00:29:14,002
- There.
- Oh. Thank you.

245
00:29:30,560 --> 00:29:31,643
All set.

246
00:29:47,660 --> 00:29:49,787
- Need bags?
- No, thank you.

247
00:29:50,913 --> 00:29:52,957
So... I was worried.

248
00:29:54,292 --> 00:29:55,418
There you go.

249
00:29:59,547 --> 00:30:01,423
- Thank you!
- No problem.

250
00:30:02,425 --> 00:30:03,425
Hi.

251
00:30:04,552 --> 00:30:06,553
And the grocery store
is doing well, right?

252
00:30:07,055 --> 00:30:08,055
Yeah.

253
00:30:08,932 --> 00:30:10,808
It's good to think
about that too.

254
00:30:12,102 --> 00:30:14,187
- Come back soon.
- Good afternoon.

255
00:30:45,468 --> 00:30:46,593
Do you wanna talk?

256
00:30:48,470 --> 00:30:49,513
Talk about what?

257
00:30:52,225 --> 00:30:53,267
I don't know.

258
00:30:55,102 --> 00:30:57,105
There's something bothering you?

259
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:18,627
Raquel, I'm worried.

260
00:31:20,753 --> 00:31:21,795
Why?

261
00:31:29,137 --> 00:31:30,305
You know, darling...

262
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:35,768
Unfortunately, I no longer
have the bookstore.

263
00:31:38,395 --> 00:31:44,027
And not only I don't have the bookstore,
many debts appeared in its place.

264
00:31:46,528 --> 00:31:48,657
So our life depends on this.

265
00:31:50,950 --> 00:31:54,662
It depends on this city,
these people.

266
00:31:55,830 --> 00:31:57,415
We have a home here.

267
00:31:57,457 --> 00:32:03,087
We have a store that can
rebalance us financially.

268
00:32:07,550 --> 00:32:09,052
That's what we have, Raquel.

269
00:32:11,428 --> 00:32:12,680
I have no other option.

270
00:32:15,308 --> 00:32:16,600
You need to help me.

271
00:32:19,562 --> 00:32:20,980
I will help you, dad.

272
00:32:24,442 --> 00:32:25,485
That's good!

273
00:32:26,943 --> 00:32:27,987
That's good!

274
00:32:33,117 --> 00:32:34,202
And...

275
00:32:36,495 --> 00:32:38,707
There is also something
you need to know.

276
00:32:40,625 --> 00:32:43,377
We're in a small country town.

277
00:32:44,587 --> 00:32:49,008
Here, when you tell someone
you've heard or seen something,

278
00:32:49,967 --> 00:32:54,138
that person will tell another,
that will tell another...

279
00:32:55,222 --> 00:32:57,350
And suddenly, everyone is
talking about you.

280
00:33:00,268 --> 00:33:02,855
And depending on the way
as the story goes,

281
00:33:02,897 --> 00:33:05,900
you lose control
of what they say.

282
00:33:09,028 --> 00:33:12,490
You don't want people to be talking
about us out there, do you?

283
00:33:16,618 --> 00:33:19,372
So you have to be careful with
what you say, my daughter.

284
00:33:22,875 --> 00:33:25,462
Vera, if you think
that I'll just leave here,

285
00:33:25,503 --> 00:33:26,962
you can forget about that, ok?

286
00:33:27,003 --> 00:33:30,132
André, please, go away!
There is no one here!

287
00:33:30,173 --> 00:33:32,843
Did you cheat on me
with that bastard?

288
00:33:32,885 --> 00:33:34,262
Are you completely crazy?

289
00:33:36,305 --> 00:33:38,850
Dad, pick up! Please, pick up!

290
00:33:38,892 --> 00:33:40,142
André is here.

291
00:33:40,560 --> 00:33:43,645
He's completely out of control.
He jumped the front gate!

292
00:33:43,897 --> 00:33:45,898
I'll burn this house down!

293
00:33:45,940 --> 00:33:47,543
He said he's going
to set the house on fire.

294
00:33:47,567 --> 00:33:49,253
If you're with someone else,
just tell me...

295
00:33:49,277 --> 00:33:50,903
I'm not seeing anyone! Enough!

296
00:33:51,153 --> 00:33:53,131
- I want to see him face to face.
- There's no one here!

297
00:33:53,155 --> 00:33:55,408
- There is...
- Stop!

298
00:34:19,223 --> 00:34:21,892
First we start identifying
the verses, right?

299
00:34:21,933 --> 00:34:23,578
CIRCLE OF RENOVATION
Which we will comment on.

300
00:34:23,602 --> 00:34:27,063
Then we cut them
and organize according to the Books.

301
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:30,527
We take blank sheets,
we glue these sections,

302
00:34:30,568 --> 00:34:33,278
and we comment below
with our observations.

303
00:34:33,320 --> 00:34:34,822
- Cool.
- Ok?

304
00:34:35,615 --> 00:34:38,575
Deuteronomy 22:20.

305
00:34:39,118 --> 00:34:41,412
""If, however, the charge is true

306
00:34:41,453 --> 00:34:44,373
and no proof of the young
woman's virginity can be found,

307
00:34:44,707 --> 00:34:48,335
she shall be brought to the door
of her father's house...

308
00:34:48,377 --> 00:34:52,340
and there the men of her town
shall stone her to death.""

309
00:34:53,382 --> 00:34:55,885
Judges 19:24.

310

and his concubine.

00:34:59,597 --> 00:35:01,348
I will bring them out to you now,

for all who do so are abomination
unto the Lord thy God.""

and her impurity
is upon her flesh,

324
00:35:41,805 --> 00:35:44,767
her monthly period
will last seven days,

325
00:35:45,142 --> 00:35:48,395

THE DAUGHTERS OF MARY MAGDALENE

NEW MESSAGE FROM ANA HELENA

344
00:37:47,807 --> 00:37:50,100
RAQUEL, ARE YOU COMING
TO THE SERVICE TODAY?

345
00:37:50,142 --> 00:37:51,560
IT WILL BE IMPORTANT TO YOU.

346
00:37:53,520 --> 00:37:54,855
In Apocalypse

347
00:37:54,897 --> 00:37:57,400
22:18-19,

348
00:37:57,775 --> 00:37:59,902
""For I say to every man

349
00:37:59,943 --> 00:38:03,780
to whose ears have come the words
of this prophet's book.

350
00:38:03,822 --> 00:38:06,783
If any man makes
an addition to them,

351
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:09,203
God will put on him

352
00:38:09,578 --> 00:38:13,290
the punishments
which are in this book.""

353
00:38:13,665 --> 00:38:18,378
And that's why, my friends,
for that and exactly for that,

354
00:38:18,420 --> 00:38:23,342
that when someone comes,
calling herself a prophet,

355
00:38:24,052 --> 00:38:29,473
it's very important that we analyze
these words according to the Bible.

356
00:38:29,807 --> 00:38:32,142
To see if it's true
or if it's false.

357
00:38:32,183 --> 00:38:34,145
Because it is our guide,
am I right?

358
00:38:34,187 --> 00:38:36,063
It is our guide. Amen!

359
00:38:36,605 --> 00:38:39,400
Now I want to ask you something.

360
00:38:39,442 --> 00:38:41,902
And I want to see who will know
how to answer me.

361
00:38:41,943 --> 00:38:44,280
What happens

362
00:38:44,322 --> 00:38:48,325
to those who insist
on false prophecies?

363
00:38:49,077 --> 00:38:50,703
- What happens?
- Sinners!

364
00:38:50,745 --> 00:38:54,207
Apocalypse 22:18-19.

365
00:38:54,498 --> 00:38:58,668
God will punish these people.

366
00:38:58,710 --> 00:39:00,337
There's no way out of it!

367
00:39:01,088 --> 00:39:02,840
There is no excuse!

368
00:39:03,382 --> 00:39:05,718
Because, in the Bible, it says:

369
00:39:06,343 --> 00:39:09,097
""Every tree that does not
bear good fruit

370
00:39:09,138 --> 00:39:12,348
is cut down
and thrown into the fire.""

371
00:39:13,600 --> 00:39:16,103
- I want an Amen!
- Amen!

372
00:39:16,353 --> 00:39:17,605
Praise God!

373
00:39:24,362 --> 00:39:26,238
Hermes, I really need
to talk to you.

374
00:39:27,238 --> 00:39:28,990
Sorry, Elisa,
it's just that I'm a little...

375
00:39:29,032 --> 00:39:30,158
Is Raquel there?

376
00:39:30,993 --> 00:39:33,120
- No, she's not.
- I will not take too long.

377
00:39:33,620 --> 00:39:34,997
I promise. It will be fast.

378
00:39:55,433 --> 00:39:56,643
Look at this, Hermes.

379
00:40:03,317 --> 00:40:04,693
Do you know what this is?

380
00:40:04,943 --> 00:40:06,028
No.

381
00:40:06,653 --> 00:40:10,323
That's where your daughter is taking
a lot of teenagers.

382
00:40:10,657 --> 00:40:12,910
Taking the girls
to the middle of this bush.

383
00:40:12,952 --> 00:40:14,453
Without any security.

384
00:40:15,453 --> 00:40:16,997
Have you wondered
what could happen?

385
00:40:17,038 --> 00:40:19,500
Someone may appear there.
The things they can do to them.

386
00:40:19,542 --> 00:40:21,668
And they're praying
for God knows which devil.

387
00:40:22,962 --> 00:40:24,297
And who told you that?

388
00:40:24,713 --> 00:40:26,673
It doesn't matter who told me.

389
00:40:26,923 --> 00:40:29,302
It doesn't matter,
the whole church already knows.

390
00:40:29,343 --> 00:40:33,055
And then they keep questioning me
because they know that I know you.

391
00:40:35,432 --> 00:40:37,935
Ok, Elisa.
I'll see what this is about.

392
00:40:38,977 --> 00:40:41,980
Pietra is dating a boy
that nobody knows who it is.

393
00:40:42,482 --> 00:40:45,150
Tamar is missing classes
almost every day.

394
00:40:45,192 --> 00:40:47,570
And everyone is missing
church too, right, Elisa?

395
00:40:47,987 --> 00:40:50,322
Oh Hermes, please.

396
00:40:51,448 --> 00:40:54,327
Try to put yourself in these parents'
shoes, at least once in your life.

397
00:40:54,827 --> 00:40:56,453
We don't know what
they are doing there,

398
00:40:56,495 --> 00:40:58,872
if they are making rituals,
sacrifices...

399
00:40:59,748 --> 00:41:00,833
Look...

400
00:41:01,250 --> 00:41:03,210
You have to do something.

401
00:41:04,127 --> 00:41:07,422
This girl is going to get
in trouble.

402
00:41:07,463 --> 00:41:08,882
I'm warning you!

403
00:41:10,968 --> 00:41:12,385
Is this a threat?

404
00:41:45,502 --> 00:41:46,878
Hey, girls!

405
00:41:47,253 --> 00:41:48,380
Hi, Elisa.

406
00:41:48,755 --> 00:41:50,007
You came!

407
00:41:51,633 --> 00:41:52,760
Good!

408
00:41:57,388 --> 00:41:59,015
We are just passing by.

409
00:42:00,267 --> 00:42:01,560
Are you okay?

410
00:42:01,893 --> 00:42:03,895
- Yes.
- Yes...

411
00:42:07,398 --> 00:42:08,567
To sweeten your day.

412
00:42:20,662 --> 00:42:21,663
Here.

413
00:42:33,300 --> 00:42:34,427
Let's make a toast!

414
00:42:37,553 --> 00:42:38,597
Want some?

415
00:42:42,558 --> 00:42:43,602
You have to drink it!

416
00:42:43,935 --> 00:42:44,937
Fine.

417
00:42:50,442 --> 00:42:54,530
DJ Robinho, pump the beat
To get the crowd jumping

418
00:42:54,572 --> 00:42:57,783
Only who is a Christian
Only who is a Christian

419
00:42:57,825 --> 00:43:02,037
Jump from one side to the other
And clap your hands

420
00:43:02,078 --> 00:43:05,540
Only who is a Christian
Only who is a Christian

421
00:43:05,582 --> 00:43:09,210
Only who is a Christian
Only who is a Christian

422
00:43:12,463 --> 00:43:16,552
Because Jesus freed me
To live a new story

423
00:43:16,593 --> 00:43:20,305
I'm free to have fun
Prejudice isn't my thing

424
00:43:20,347 --> 00:43:23,975
Whichever beat
Because God created it all

425
00:44:20,282 --> 00:44:23,493
Only who is a Christian
Only who is a Christian

426
00:44:23,535 --> 00:44:27,538
Jump from one side to the other
And clap your hands

427
00:44:27,580 --> 00:44:31,252
Only who is a Christian
Only who is a Christian

428
00:44:31,293 --> 00:44:34,337
Only who is a Christian
Only who is a Christian

429
00:45:00,738 --> 00:45:04,452
But if you mess around with me, young girl
I won't look

430
00:45:04,493 --> 00:45:08,038
If you mess around with me, young girl
I won't look

431
00:45:08,080 --> 00:45:11,917
Because I'm anointed
I got the oil

432
00:45:11,958 --> 00:45:15,462
Because I'm anointed
I got the oil

433
00:45:15,503 --> 00:45:19,173
Don't mess with me Don't come

434
00:45:19,215 --> 00:45:22,427
There's no legality
I'm consecrated

435
00:45:22,468 --> 00:45:26,598
I'm over watching
I'm in that way

436
00:45:26,640 --> 00:45:30,310
I stopped the abuses
Cut the hype

437
00:45:30,352 --> 00:45:33,605
I'm telling you
Hear me out, girl

438
00:45:33,647 --> 00:45:38,110
Those who are easy
Have no value in this life

439
00:45:38,152 --> 00:45:41,070
Whoever say
The flesh is weak, listen

440
00:45:41,113 --> 00:45:44,992
If the problem is weakness
Sin is not vitamin

441
00:45:45,033 --> 00:45:48,745
But if you mess around with me, young girl
I won't look

442
00:45:48,787 --> 00:45:52,373
If you mess around with me, young girl
I won't look

443
00:45:52,415 --> 00:45:56,128
Because I'm anointed
I got the oil

444
00:45:56,170 --> 00:45:59,632
Because I'm anointed
I got the oil

445
00:46:02,633 --> 00:46:05,012
Sorry to ruin the mood, guys.

446
00:46:05,678 --> 00:46:08,307
But I have something
very important to say.

447
00:46:08,890 --> 00:46:12,143
One thing that can save
the souls of all of you.

448
00:46:13,145 --> 00:46:14,353
The Evil.

449
00:46:14,395 --> 00:46:16,523
Evil does not appear to be bleak.

450
00:46:17,690 --> 00:46:18,900
Macabre.

451
00:46:19,652 --> 00:46:21,903
It doesn't look like a monster.

452
00:46:23,405 --> 00:46:25,198
Evil has beauty.

453
00:46:26,825 --> 00:46:28,535
Evil is manipulative.

454
00:46:30,828 --> 00:46:33,290
That person who lets Evil in,

455
00:46:34,792 --> 00:46:36,252
that person needs help.

456
00:46:36,293 --> 00:46:38,920
Now, if she denies help,

457
00:46:43,175 --> 00:46:45,968
if she denies it, there is nothing
that we can do.

458
00:46:46,803 --> 00:46:48,305
It's very dangerous.

459
00:46:50,182 --> 00:46:52,308
We can't let them...

460
00:46:52,935 --> 00:46:54,812
Let them destroy us!

461
00:46:57,230 --> 00:46:59,065
Now, my question is:

462
00:46:59,440 --> 00:47:01,902
What do we do with all this evil?

463
00:47:01,943 --> 00:47:04,487
What do we do
with these evil angels?

464
00:47:07,323 --> 00:47:10,202
Laura!
Don't let her do this, Laura.

465
00:47:10,577 --> 00:47:11,578
Laura!

466
00:47:12,703 --> 00:47:13,955
Don't let her!

467
00:47:14,998 --> 00:47:17,083
She's doubting our faith!

468
00:47:17,333 --> 00:47:20,087
I never doubted anyone's faith.

469
00:47:20,587 --> 00:47:23,840
- Liar.
- Why am I lying? I never doubted.

470
00:47:23,882 --> 00:47:25,133
Stop this.

471
00:47:25,467 --> 00:47:26,677
Go away!

472
00:47:26,718 --> 00:47:28,970
I believe in God too!

473
00:47:29,012 --> 00:47:32,182
- Out!
- Out!

474
00:47:32,223 --> 00:47:34,100
I'm also from the Church!

475
00:47:34,142 --> 00:47:35,685
- Get out of here!
- Get out!

476
00:47:35,727 --> 00:47:36,978
Go away!

477
00:47:37,020 --> 00:47:39,313
Guys, I never wanted
to doubt anyone!

478
00:47:39,355 --> 00:47:42,442
I never wanted to doubt anyone's faith!
I'm also from the Church!

479
00:47:42,483 --> 00:47:43,693
- Get out of here!
- Get out!

480
00:47:43,735 --> 00:47:47,238
I believe in God!
I believe in Jesus, guys! Please!

481
00:47:54,037 --> 00:47:57,415
I'm writing it for the Good!
For the Good, guys!

482
00:47:58,375 --> 00:48:01,753
I also believe in Jesus!
I'm writing it for women!

483
00:48:02,003 --> 00:48:03,255
Go away!

484
00:48:18,437 --> 00:48:22,065
She is not one of us!

485
00:48:41,918 --> 00:48:44,212
Timothy 2:18.

486
00:48:53,680 --> 00:48:54,807
Help!

487
00:49:00,062 --> 00:49:04,942
TAMAR
OF COURSE SHE SEES THINGS, GUYS!

488
00:49:13,075 --> 00:49:14,117
Raquel?

489
00:49:15,952 --> 00:49:16,995
What happened?

490
00:49:19,580 --> 00:49:20,957
- Raquel, my daughter?
- Mom?

491
00:49:21,333 --> 00:49:23,752
No, no. It's me, your father.

492
00:49:24,377 --> 00:49:26,087
What are you feeling, Raquel?

493
00:49:27,505 --> 00:49:28,882
Raquel, talk to me.

494
00:49:31,843 --> 00:49:33,345
No, Raquel. No, no...

495
00:49:33,845 --> 00:49:35,972
It is not time for that now.

496
00:49:37,515 --> 00:49:39,852
We will write everything again.

497
00:49:59,245 --> 00:50:00,872
The exams are all normal.

498
00:50:02,290 --> 00:50:05,252
In addition to what you already told me,
Raquel, any other discomfort?

499
00:50:11,508 --> 00:50:12,883
What can this be?

500
00:50:13,760 --> 00:50:17,138
Look, she organizes her thoughts
in an absolutely logical way.

501
00:50:17,388 --> 00:50:20,683
I have no way of giving you an accurate
diagnosis with so little observation.

502
00:50:22,893 --> 00:50:25,938
I wanted to show you something.

503
00:50:27,398 --> 00:50:28,525
What is this?

504
00:50:29,067 --> 00:50:30,360
It's just a notebook!

505
00:50:30,402 --> 00:50:32,528
I know it's a notebook,
and what's inside?

506
00:50:48,587 --> 00:50:50,338
Do you have anything
to tell me about this?

507
00:50:54,843 --> 00:50:56,928
How come not, Raquel?
I think you do.

508
00:51:03,477 --> 00:51:08,565
She lost her mother in a very violent
way and the two were very close.

509
00:51:09,565 --> 00:51:13,403
At the time I thought it was good
for her to find strength in faith,

510
00:51:13,445 --> 00:51:15,030
in a religion that is...

511
00:51:15,072 --> 00:51:18,575
But then she started
doing some weird things...

512
00:51:21,578 --> 00:51:24,205
Look, it would be very important
that you do therapy.

513
00:51:26,708 --> 00:51:29,962
Doctor, I'm sorry.
Raquel did therapy for a while.

514
00:51:30,253 --> 00:51:31,253
And...

515
00:51:31,838 --> 00:51:34,925
Anyway, wouldn't there be
something parallel to therapy?

516
00:51:34,967 --> 00:51:37,218
Something more immediate?
Because...

517
00:51:38,470 --> 00:51:39,637
I don't know what to do.

518
00:52:12,628 --> 00:52:14,797
()

519
00:52:18,677 --> 00:52:20,262
WHO IS IT?

520
00:52:33,192 --> 00:52:35,193
YOU DON'T KNOW?

521
00:52:37,528 --> 00:52:38,780
NO.

522
00:52:44,660 --> 00:52:46,580
AREN'T YOU THE PROPHET?

523
00:52:53,795 --> 00:52:56,673
I NEVER SAID I WAS A PROPHET.

524
00:53:11,187 --> 00:53:12,688
I'LL GIVE YOU A HINT...

525
00:53:12,730 --> 00:53:14,942
WE ALREADY KNOW EACH OTHER.

526
00:53:15,192 --> 00:53:17,235
WHAT DO YOU WANT?

527
00:53:28,747 --> 00:53:30,373
TO TALK.

528
00:53:35,712 --> 00:53:39,465
I CAN'T TALK NOW.

529
00:53:41,508 --> 00:53:44,137
TELL ME, WHAT DO YOU WANT?

530
00:54:00,403 --> 00:54:02,405
THE POSSESSED GIRL
FROM MONTE MEGIDO

531
00:54:12,623 --> 00:54:14,875
Heretic! Liar!

532
00:54:15,293 --> 00:54:17,920
Liar! Witch!

533
00:54:18,253 --> 00:54:21,298
- We don't want you here!
- You are bringing the darkness!

534
00:54:38,525 --> 00:54:40,152
SHE CAME TO CURSE THE CITY.

535
00:54:40,193 --> 00:54:41,610
SHE HAD A VISION!

536
00:54:41,653 --> 00:54:43,363
LET'S PRAY FOR HER SOUL!

537
00:54:43,405 --> 00:54:45,032
SHE MUST BE SICK...

538
00:54:45,073 --> 00:54:47,033
SHE OPENED
THE DOORS FOR THE EVIL!

539
00:54:48,033 --> 00:54:53,457
HER NAME IS
RAQUEL HERNANDES REIS.

540
00:54:54,290 --> 00:54:55,292
Witch!

541
00:55:53,725 --> 00:55:59,313
- Where is he?
- Where is who?

542
00:55:59,355 --> 00:56:02,567
- Where is he?
- What are you talking about, André?

543
00:56:02,608 --> 00:56:04,693
- You're crazy!
- Confess it already!

544
00:56:04,735 --> 00:56:08,363
André, please. Go away!
Go away, there is no one here!

545
00:56:08,407 --> 00:56:11,408
No! Let me go.
Let me go, André! Let me go!

546
00:56:16,247 --> 00:56:19,500
Go away! Get out of here!
Get out!

547
00:56:20,252 --> 00:56:22,212
Help... Help me.

548
00:56:22,253 --> 00:56:23,880
Police emergency line.

549
00:56:23,922 --> 00:56:27,217
Officer, please!
Send help! I beg you, please!

550
00:56:27,258 --> 00:56:29,593
My mother's ex-boyfriend
is very nervous!

551
00:56:29,635 --> 00:56:31,262
Ok, he's nervous.

552
00:56:31,678 --> 00:56:33,097
And what is the occurrence?

553
00:56:33,138 --> 00:56:35,850
Please, officer.
He's assaulting her!

554
00:56:35,892 --> 00:56:36,977
Give me your address.

555
00:56:37,018 --> 00:56:38,978
- I'll go check your room!
- No, you don't, André!

556
00:56:39,020 --> 00:56:41,272
I can't talk anymore!
I can't talk anymore!

557
00:56:58,540 --> 00:56:59,540
Yes?

558
00:56:59,790 --> 00:57:01,083
- Hi, Hermes!
- Hi.

559
00:57:01,417 --> 00:57:02,543
Is Raquel around?

560
00:57:03,168 --> 00:57:04,295
No. Raquel's not here.

561
00:57:05,297 --> 00:57:09,675
- We know she's here.
- Nope. I'm saying she's not here.

562
00:57:12,428 --> 00:57:13,805
I already said she isn't here.

563
00:57:13,847 --> 00:57:15,432
Can we wait here for her then?

564
00:57:15,848 --> 00:57:19,310
Unfortunately, no.
Can you, please, excuse me?

565
00:57:20,728 --> 00:57:21,728
Ok?

566
00:57:22,188 --> 00:57:23,438
Have a good day.

567
00:57:33,700 --> 00:57:35,827
We are concerned about Raquel.

568
00:57:36,743 --> 00:57:40,748
I appreciate your concern,
but she has already started treatment.

569
00:57:41,707 --> 00:57:43,835
But what happened, Hermes...

570
00:57:44,710 --> 00:57:46,503
I know this is none
of our business.

571
00:57:47,380 --> 00:57:52,010
The truth is that some things, Hermes,
need another type of treatment.

572
00:57:52,385 --> 00:57:54,095
Because they are
not common things.

573
00:57:54,137 --> 00:57:56,680
They are things
of a spiritual nature.

574
00:57:56,722 --> 00:57:59,225
Sorry, Elisa.
I don't believe in this.

575
00:58:00,142 --> 00:58:02,312
We can think
in a more symbolic way.

576
00:58:02,353 --> 00:58:04,730
It's so simple what
I'm talking about, Hermes.

577
00:58:05,105 --> 00:58:07,608
Look, there are those
who work for Good.

578
00:58:07,650 --> 00:58:09,235
There are those
who work for Evil.

579
00:58:09,985 --> 00:58:13,363
Because they are being
dominated by that force.

580
00:58:14,657 --> 00:58:17,952
I really appreciate your concern.

581
00:58:17,993 --> 00:58:19,037
Just one thing.

582
00:58:20,037 --> 00:58:22,248
Do you know the Ritual of Healing
and Deliverance?

583
00:58:24,292 --> 00:58:26,293
Sorry, but I'm not interested.

584
00:58:26,752 --> 00:58:28,505
Come on, Hermes,
we're already here.

585
00:58:28,755 --> 00:58:32,258
I think you could pay
a little attention, it won't hurt.

586
00:58:37,430 --> 00:58:38,932
Okay, what is it about?

587
00:58:41,642 --> 00:58:45,145
When we realize that there is
something wrong with a person,

588
00:58:46,522 --> 00:58:49,400
a change in behavior,
a change in their eyes,

589
00:58:49,942 --> 00:58:51,152
in the soul,

590
00:58:53,905 --> 00:58:56,032
it could be that this
comes from another place.

591
00:58:56,407 --> 00:58:58,283
Of the other side.

592
00:58:58,577 --> 00:59:00,160
A dark side.

593
00:59:02,830 --> 00:59:04,415
It's very dangerous.

594
00:59:05,040 --> 00:59:07,043
You don't want that for Raquel,
do you?

595
00:59:08,085 --> 00:59:10,838
Sorry, but I don't understand
what you're talking about.

596
00:59:12,548 --> 00:59:14,508
Raquel needs to be exorcised.

597
00:59:14,550 --> 00:59:17,553
It's not exactly that,
that's not the word.

598
00:59:17,970 --> 00:59:20,770
Raquel went to the doctor because
this is the treatment that I believe,

599
00:59:20,807 --> 00:59:23,058
and this is the treatment she's
going to do for now.

600
00:59:24,435 --> 00:59:27,855
So I ask you to please
respect our decision,

601
00:59:28,188 --> 00:59:29,523
and don't look for us again.

602
00:59:29,565 --> 00:59:31,608
We can take this evil away
from Raquel!

603
00:59:32,943 --> 00:59:33,987
Please!

604
00:59:36,948 --> 00:59:39,533
Hermes, the enemy might be
using her.

605
00:59:39,575 --> 00:59:41,577
And you are responsible.

606
00:59:41,827 --> 00:59:44,080
- Excuse me.
- You will regret it.

607
00:59:44,330 --> 00:59:45,957
Get out of my house, please?

608
01:00:19,365 --> 01:00:20,492
What happened?

609
01:00:31,418 --> 01:00:32,670
I was at home.

610
01:00:35,005 --> 01:00:36,382
With Gustavo.

611
01:00:38,258 --> 01:00:40,302
We were watching a movie.

612
01:00:43,430 --> 01:00:45,767
And then we started
to kiss and...

613
01:00:47,643 --> 01:00:50,187
He put his hand under my skirt.

614
01:00:52,273 --> 01:00:53,648
I didn't want it.

615
01:00:56,777 --> 01:00:58,153
I started to scream.

616
01:01:00,030 --> 01:01:01,532
Telling him to stop.

617
01:01:03,200 --> 01:01:04,702
But he continued.

618
01:01:08,538 --> 01:01:10,542
My brother came home.

619
01:01:12,043 --> 01:01:14,212
Gustavo started shouting at me.

620
01:01:15,422 --> 01:01:17,215
Calling me a slut.

621
01:01:19,592 --> 01:01:22,803
Telling my brother that
he had caught me with another guy.

622
01:01:23,805 --> 01:01:25,557
My brother believed him.

623
01:01:28,600 --> 01:01:30,227
My father came home,

624
01:01:32,355 --> 01:01:33,815
and started to beat me.

625
01:01:37,818 --> 01:01:38,987
I ran away.

626
01:02:32,998 --> 01:02:34,250
Am I bothering you?

627
01:02:43,508 --> 01:02:44,510
Laura.

628
01:02:51,392 --> 01:02:53,018
I came here to apologize to you.

629
01:02:57,022 --> 01:02:59,150
I don't know what happened
to me that day.

630
01:03:02,195 --> 01:03:03,403
Let's go home.

631
01:03:03,822 --> 01:03:04,905
I'll take you.

632
01:03:09,452 --> 01:03:10,578
I regret that.

633
01:03:17,668 --> 01:03:18,920
Come with me?

634
01:03:20,672 --> 01:03:22,047
We can talk about it.

635
01:03:29,055 --> 01:03:30,932
No, Laura. Stop it.

636
01:03:33,350 --> 01:03:34,810
Come back with me, please?

637
01:03:35,352 --> 01:03:36,603
Let me go. I won't go.

638
01:03:42,568 --> 01:03:44,320
- Laura!
- She said she won't go.

639
01:03:46,072 --> 01:03:47,198
You're fucked.

640
01:03:48,867 --> 01:03:51,118
Witch. Motherfucker.

641
01:04:13,223 --> 01:04:15,433
Your call is being forwarded
to voicemail

642
01:04:15,475 --> 01:04:17,353
and is subject to a charge
after the signal.

643
01:04:19,480 --> 01:04:20,607
Take care.

644
01:04:21,357 --> 01:04:22,358
Bye.

645
01:05:51,572 --> 01:05:52,615
Good morning.

646
01:05:58,203 --> 01:05:59,330
Go to hell!

647
01:06:01,207 --> 01:06:02,684
- What is this?
- You are not welcome here.

648
01:06:02,708 --> 01:06:04,543
This is no place for profanity!

649
01:06:04,585 --> 01:06:05,585
Are you crazy?

650
01:06:05,837 --> 01:06:07,003
Go away from here!

651
01:06:07,253 --> 01:06:08,672
- Hell!
- Get off here!

652
01:06:08,713 --> 01:06:11,342
You are not welcome here!
Out of here! Go away!

653
01:06:11,883 --> 01:06:13,552
Out! Leave us alone!

654
01:06:13,593 --> 01:06:15,345
- Get out!
- Hell!

655
01:06:15,888 --> 01:06:17,432
Leave! You are not welcome here!

656
01:06:17,473 --> 01:06:19,017
You are taking our peace away!

657
01:06:33,363 --> 01:06:37,535
SATANIC CULT IN THE CITY
OF MONTE MEGIDO DEFIES THE BIBLE

658
01:06:43,165 --> 01:06:46,377
HERETIC BITCH!

659
01:07:35,467 --> 01:07:36,552
Raquel!

660
01:07:38,845 --> 01:07:40,055
Raquel, come here!

661
01:07:48,230 --> 01:07:49,898
You called
the police emergency line.

662
01:07:49,940 --> 01:07:52,568
At the moment
all our attendants are busy.

663
01:07:53,443 --> 01:07:54,487
Shit!

664
01:07:56,947 --> 01:07:58,198
Who did this?

665
01:08:17,383 --> 01:08:19,010
Who did this, Raquel?

666
01:08:23,473 --> 01:08:24,517
I don't know.

667
01:08:34,735 --> 01:08:36,487
And what is God's plan

668
01:08:37,028 --> 01:08:38,530
for a situation like that?

669
01:08:39,990 --> 01:08:40,992
What?

670
01:08:46,122 --> 01:08:47,122
Tell me, Raquel!

671
01:08:51,168 --> 01:08:52,252
To forgive.

672
01:08:54,547 --> 01:08:55,630
To forgive?

673
01:08:59,510 --> 01:09:00,887
Forgive!

674
01:09:03,930 --> 01:09:05,307
Forgive what, my daughter?

675
01:09:06,017 --> 01:09:07,058
Huh?

676
01:09:08,518 --> 01:09:11,897
Do you think that forgiving those
who destroy our home is to do good?

677
01:09:12,397 --> 01:09:13,398
That's it?

678
01:09:19,447 --> 01:09:21,532
They don't know
what they are doing.

679
01:09:21,573 --> 01:09:23,033
And you don't know either.

680
01:09:25,785 --> 01:09:28,455
You also don't know what you do.

681
01:09:32,960 --> 01:09:33,960
Look!

682
01:09:37,923 --> 01:09:41,218
Can you see the absurdity
of this situation, Raquel?

683
01:09:42,343 --> 01:09:43,428
Can you?

684
01:09:48,558 --> 01:09:49,977
I don't know what else to do.

685
01:09:54,607 --> 01:09:56,067
I don't know what else to do.

686
01:10:49,495 --> 01:10:51,372
Everything was like this
when we arrived.

687
01:10:51,663 --> 01:10:54,833
I don't know how they got in.
The door was open. It was a mess.

688
01:10:54,875 --> 01:10:58,503
Things thrown on the floor.
They left everything upside down.

689
01:10:59,922 --> 01:11:04,133
- Did they steal something?
- There was no time to see...

690
01:11:50,472 --> 01:11:51,473

Get up!

696
01:15:24,518 --> 01:15:25,687
Come on. Get up.

697
01:15:30,900 --> 01:15:31,943
Calm down.

698
01:15:50,670 --> 01:15:53,048
- Go on. Hurry!
- Go, go, go.

699
01:16:09,480 --> 01:16:10,565

700
01:16:12,192 --> 01:16:16,070
- Vera!
- Close it. Faster!

701

He's coming! He's coming! Faster!

Vera!

703
01:16:21,452 --> 01:16:23,162
Open the garage!

704
01:16:23,203 --> 01:16:24,997
- Vera?
- Come on, mom!

705
01:16:26,080 --> 01:16:27,915
- What the fuck is this?
- Run, Raquel!

706
01:16:27,958 --> 01:16:30,002
What the fuck is this?

707
01:16:30,585 --> 01:16:33,297
- Shut up!
- Let me go, André! Let me go!

708
01:16:33,338 --> 01:16:36,048
- André! Let her go!
- You must think that I'm a fool!

709
01:16:36,090 --> 01:16:38,093
Don't hurt her, please!

710
01:16:38,760 --> 01:16:41,347
Give me that key!
The party is over.

711
01:16:42,472 --> 01:16:46,560
You want to go out? So let's go out!
Raquel, get in the trunk!

712
01:16:46,602 --> 01:16:50,147
- No! André, leave her out of this!
- Shut your mouth!

713
01:16:51,022 --> 01:16:54,567
- For God's sake! Leave her out of this!
- Silence!

714
01:16:54,608 --> 01:16:58,572
- Leave her! I'll go with you!
- Can you be quiet, dammit!

715
01:16:58,613 --> 01:17:01,950
Raquel, get in the goddamn trunk!
Or I'll beat you up!

716
01:17:01,992 --> 01:17:04,493
- Do it, darling!
- Ok, I'll do it!

717
01:17:04,535 --> 01:17:05,995
I'll do it! Calm down!

718
01:17:06,663 --> 01:17:10,083
For the love of God!
André, what are you doing?

719
01:17:10,125 --> 01:17:13,503
Don't you want to pray?
Then pray!

720
01:17:15,297 --> 01:17:16,297
Stop.

721
01:17:16,757 --> 01:17:20,635
- André, I'm sorry.
- You don't trust me.

722
01:17:20,677 --> 01:17:23,638
You are right, I'm sorry.
I'm so stupid!

723
01:17:23,930 --> 01:17:27,725
I'm so stupid! I don't know why
I left you, André. I love you!

724
01:17:27,767 --> 01:17:31,772
- You're talking bullshit now.
- I mean it. I love you!

725
01:17:32,147 --> 01:17:33,898
André, please believe me!

726
01:17:34,148 --> 01:17:35,150
André...

727
01:17:35,442 --> 01:17:36,693
André, you are right!

728
01:17:37,193 --> 01:17:42,365
- André, slow down for god's sake!
- You have exhausted my patience.

729
01:17:42,407 --> 01:17:45,618
- Look at me! I love you!
- Stop it! Take your hands off!

730
01:17:45,660 --> 01:17:48,247
- Let's try it again, please!
- Take your hands off!

731
01:17:48,288 --> 01:17:51,917
- Please, you're going too fast!
- Take your hands off the wheel!

732
01:17:53,168 --> 01:17:54,543
Watch out!

733
01:18:30,955 --> 01:18:33,708
- Good evening, brothers!
- Good evening!

734
01:18:34,250 --> 01:18:36,335
How are you all tonight?

735
01:18:36,628 --> 01:18:39,547
- Good! Thank God!
- Thank God!

736
01:18:39,588 --> 01:18:43,008
But I hope you leave here
better than when you arrived.

737
01:18:43,385 --> 01:18:47,222
Because today is
the night of healing and deliverance!

738
01:18:47,513 --> 01:18:50,058
It is my favorite night

739
01:18:50,100 --> 01:18:54,813
because tonight God works
His miracles.

740
01:18:54,855 --> 01:18:56,815
- Praise the Lord!
- Hallelujah!

741
01:18:56,857 --> 01:18:59,400
What is the cure you are
looking for today, brother?

742
01:19:00,152 --> 01:19:03,488
What cure do you need?

743
01:19:04,238 --> 01:19:09,743
What do you need to experience
before the Lord, brother?

744
01:19:10,787 --> 01:19:11,830
Look.

745
01:19:11,872 --> 01:19:13,832
Do not waste your illness.

746
01:19:13,873 --> 01:19:19,337
Do not waste, as the disease is
an opportunity for revelation, brothers!

747
01:19:19,378 --> 01:19:20,380
Amen!

748
01:19:20,422 --> 01:19:24,758
It is through disease, be it physical,
emotional, spiritual...

749
01:19:24,802 --> 01:19:28,888
It is through sickness
that God works in us!

750
01:19:29,263 --> 01:19:33,477
- Praise the Lord!
- And He will work on you!

751
01:19:33,518 --> 01:19:35,645
Work the healing on you!

752
01:19:35,895 --> 01:19:36,980
Praise the Lord!

753
01:19:37,022 --> 01:19:40,525
Tonight, God will do something
extraordinary in your lives.

754
01:19:46,280 --> 01:19:50,077
If someone needs to cure
the pain of guilt,

755
01:19:50,327 --> 01:19:51,912
because guilt hurts, brothers.

756
01:19:52,162 --> 01:19:55,623
Blame for wrong doings,
blame for blasphemy,

757
01:19:55,665 --> 01:19:57,917
blame for any crime,
it doesn't matter!

758
01:19:58,418 --> 01:20:00,920
It doesn't matter
because God knows you!

759
01:20:01,170 --> 01:20:05,800
He knows each one of you,
your life, your struggle.

760
01:20:07,927 --> 01:20:11,097
And it is through Him
that we will heal!

761
01:20:11,682 --> 01:20:13,642
We will heal from
everything that affects us.

762
01:20:13,683 --> 01:20:16,728
Today is the day that God
will work a miracle.

763
01:20:17,103 --> 01:20:18,563
Tonight!

764
01:20:19,813 --> 01:20:22,317
So I want to pray for you!

765
01:20:23,193 --> 01:20:25,695
He is touched
by your struggles, brothers.

766
01:20:26,572 --> 01:20:27,988
And He wants to help you.

767
01:20:34,078 --> 01:20:35,580
Let's all stand up.

768
01:20:38,875 --> 01:20:39,960
Lord!

769
01:20:41,210 --> 01:20:43,128
Merciful God,

770
01:20:44,005 --> 01:20:47,133
perform a miracle tonight.

771
01:20:48,008 --> 01:20:51,597
Give this young woman
a righteous path to follow.

772
01:20:52,222 --> 01:20:55,392
Keep the tortuous paths

773
01:20:55,725 --> 01:20:59,478
of blasphemy away from this girl.

774
01:21:00,480 --> 01:21:05,402
Take the enemies away from her!
The enemies! The evil angels!

775
01:21:05,652 --> 01:21:07,237
Take it from her, Lord!

776
01:21:07,278 --> 01:21:10,615
The Demon in her body!
Take it away, Lord!

777
01:21:10,907 --> 01:21:14,660
Get it out of her, give her mercy, Lord!
Heal her wounds!

778
01:21:15,120 --> 01:21:18,122
Bad thoughts about others!

779
01:21:19,917 --> 01:21:22,502
- Mom?
- Raquel.

780
01:21:23,378 --> 01:21:25,922
Raquel, my daughter!
Oh, thank you God!

781
01:21:27,382 --> 01:21:31,010
- Thank God! Are you ok, darling?
- Yes, I think I am.

782
01:21:31,052 --> 01:21:35,140
- Where are you, mom?
- I think I'm stuck. I can't get out.

783

Bastard.

784
01:21:39,643 --> 01:21:41,647
Look at the shit you've done.

785

Help me, please, André.
I'm stuck here. Help!

786

- You need help?
- Please, get me out.

787

What are you going
to do with that?

788
01:21:56,285 --> 01:21:59,413
For what? What are you going
to do with that, André?

789
01:21:59,455 --> 01:22:01,165
I want the truth...

790
01:22:01,207 --> 01:22:04,252
What you're going to do with
that stone? Drop that stone, André!

791
01:22:04,293 --> 01:22:07,172
- Drop that stone!
- Look what you've done!

792
01:22:08,340 --> 01:22:14,303
No, please! For God's sake!
I'll do anything you want!

793
01:22:14,345 --> 01:22:17,890
Women are a dangerous thing,
aren't they? Make anyone go crazy.

794
01:22:17,932 --> 01:22:19,475
Help!

This could be the room
of any small boy,

but it just happens to belong to
a boy named Christopher Robin.

many toy animals to play with,

6
00:00:47,130 --> 00:00:51,592
Together, Pooh and his friends
shared many grand adventures.

7
00:00:51,676 --> 00:00:54,053
But one of their most unusual

8
00:00:54,137 --> 00:00:57,848
began on an early
autumn morning.

9
00:00:59,309 --> 00:01:02,311
lt was that time of year again.

10
00:01:02,395 --> 00:01:06,440
That magical time
when leaves fall,

11
00:01:06,524 --> 00:01:08,484
and pumpkins grin,

12
00:01:08,568 --> 00:01:12,237
and Spookables roam free.

13
00:01:12,322 --> 00:01:16,158
Halloween had come to
the Hundred Acre Wood.

14
00:01:21,456 --> 00:01:23,707
-Boo!
-Oh, my!

15
00:01:23,792 --> 00:01:26,168
A very, very small Spookable.

16
00:01:26,294 --> 00:01:27,878
Whatever shall I do?

17
00:01:27,962 --> 00:01:30,214
Don't be afraid, Mama.

18
00:01:30,340 --> 00:01:32,132
It's only me!

19
00:01:32,217 --> 00:01:33,842
-See?
-Oh, Roo.

20
00:01:33,927 --> 00:01:36,178
Thank goodness. I'm saved.

21
00:01:36,262 --> 00:01:37,679
Sorry I scared you so bad.

22
00:01:37,764 --> 00:01:39,973
I was just getting
ready for Halloween.

23
00:01:40,642 --> 00:01:43,018
Aren't you starting a
little early, dear?

24
00:01:43,103 --> 00:01:47,147
I can't help it. I'm excited. It's
Lumpy's first time trick-or-treating.

25
00:01:47,232 --> 00:01:49,149
Well, that is exciting.

26
00:01:49,234 --> 00:01:51,235
We're going to
Piglet's to practice.

27
00:01:51,319 --> 00:01:53,487
-Bye-bye, Mama!
-Bye, dear.

28
00:01:53,571 --> 00:01:55,447
Have a good time.

29
00:02:33,486 --> 00:02:35,779
-Treat-or-Trick!
-Lumpy!

30
00:02:35,864 --> 00:02:38,323
How was that, then? Did I
do it right this time?

31
00:02:38,408 --> 00:02:41,243
-Did I?
-Almost. But not quite.

32
00:02:41,327 --> 00:02:42,786
It's ""trick-or-treat""!

33
00:02:44,581 --> 00:02:47,457
Trick-or-treat!

34
00:02:47,542 --> 00:02:49,209
Got it.

35
00:02:50,003 --> 00:02:51,503
-Roo?
-Yeah?

36
00:02:52,422 --> 00:02:55,465
-I don't get it.
-It's simple.

37
00:02:55,550 --> 00:02:58,802
We knock on any door, and
say ""trick-or-treat"".

38
00:02:59,721 --> 00:03:03,098
And they give us candy
and cider and cookies.

39
00:03:03,183 --> 00:03:05,350
What? Just like that?

40
00:03:05,435 --> 00:03:08,228
Don't worry, Lumpy, you'll
get the hang of it.

41
00:03:08,313 --> 00:03:09,354
I'll help you.

42
00:03:09,439 --> 00:03:12,858
This is gonna be the best
Halloween ever because it's...

43
00:03:12,942 --> 00:03:15,694
...our first
Halloween together.

44
00:03:15,778 --> 00:03:18,655
Come on, let's go practice
at Piglet's house.

45
00:03:35,423 --> 00:03:38,592
This is gonna be the most fun
you've ever had in your life.

46
00:03:38,676 --> 00:03:40,844
Trick-or-treat.

47
00:03:42,430 --> 00:03:44,389
Boo!

48
00:03:49,312 --> 00:03:50,562
Would you look at that.

49
00:03:50,647 --> 00:03:53,690
We frightened them so much
, they forgot to scream.

50
00:03:54,525 --> 00:03:56,485
Oh, bother.

51
00:03:56,569 --> 00:03:58,904
I don't think we
frightened them, Piglet.

52
00:03:58,988 --> 00:04:01,531
Oh, dear. Didn't we
scare you at all, Roo?

53
00:04:01,616 --> 00:04:03,951
Maybe a little bit.
Right, Lumpy?

54
00:04:04,035 --> 00:04:06,078
Oh, sure.

55
00:04:06,162 --> 00:04:08,372
Scary.

56
00:04:08,456 --> 00:04:10,666
Why are you wearing
those funny faces?

57
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:14,962
What? Why, these are
Halloween masks, Lumpy-boy.

58
00:04:15,046 --> 00:04:17,464
I guess the kid's not
from around here.

59
00:04:17,548 --> 00:04:20,717
-This is his first Halloween.
-No kidding?

60
00:04:20,802 --> 00:04:24,680
Don't Heffalumps have Heffaween.
.. I mean, Halloween?

61
00:04:24,764 --> 00:04:29,226
Well, we have
Trumplet-Trumpet Day.

62
00:04:30,019 --> 00:04:31,895
Flapadoodle Eve.

63
00:04:33,022 --> 00:04:35,065
-But that's it.
-Well, then,

64
00:04:35,149 --> 00:04:38,694
we must make this a very
special night, indeed.

65
00:04:38,778 --> 00:04:40,445
Well, what're we waiting for?

66
00:04:40,530 --> 00:04:42,698
Somebody get this
Heffalump some candy.

67
00:04:42,782 --> 00:04:45,200
No! No candy for anyone.

68
00:04:45,285 --> 00:04:48,787
Not until the proper time
to go trick-or-treating.

69
00:04:48,871 --> 00:04:52,082
Now, if you'll follow me
inside, I have all the fun

70
00:04:52,166 --> 00:04:54,668
meticulously planned out.

71
00:04:55,628 --> 00:04:57,879
Now, gather round, everyone.

72
00:04:57,964 --> 00:05:02,050
As you see, I've collected all the candy
to be found in the Hundred Acre Wood,

73
00:05:02,135 --> 00:05:05,178
and divided it into equal
, easy-to-carry sacks.

74
00:05:05,263 --> 00:05:08,307
Tonight, each of you
will take your sack home

75
00:05:08,391 --> 00:05:10,559
and dispense it for
trick-or-treating.

76
00:05:10,643 --> 00:05:13,770
Pooh Bear, you'll be
trick-or-treating with Piglet.

77
00:05:13,855 --> 00:05:16,023
Roo, you'll be with Lumpy.

78
00:05:16,107 --> 00:05:17,691
And I'll be with Tigger.

79
00:05:19,569 --> 00:05:22,696
-What about me?
-You, Eeyore?

80
00:05:22,780 --> 00:05:26,158
Forgot about me, didn't you?

81
00:05:26,242 --> 00:05:27,784
lt figures.

82
00:05:27,869 --> 00:05:29,661
The point is to get organized.

83
00:05:29,746 --> 00:05:33,248
If we follow the plan, we can
make this the best Halloween ever.

84
00:05:33,333 --> 00:05:34,416
Oh, boy!

85
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:37,753
Trick-or-treating begins promptly
at the stroke of sunset.

86
00:05:37,837 --> 00:05:40,922
But I don't think my tummy
can wait that long, Rabbit.

87
00:05:41,007 --> 00:05:43,008
lt wants a treat now.

88
00:05:43,092 --> 00:05:46,178
Well, your tummy will
just have to wait, Pooh.

89
00:05:46,262 --> 00:05:49,264
We need to save all the
candy for tonight.

90
00:05:50,933 --> 00:05:54,519
See, Lumpy? This is gonna be a
great night of trick-or-treating.

91
00:05:54,604 --> 00:05:58,690
I think I'm gonna like this Heffaween.
.. Hallow...

92
00:05:58,775 --> 00:06:02,527
The word is ""Halloween"".

93
00:06:02,612 --> 00:06:05,322
And it's time we
showed our new friend

94
00:06:05,406 --> 00:06:09,659
what my favourite night
of the year is all about.

95
00:06:12,622 --> 00:06:15,707
Now, a Halloween-y night is good

96
00:06:15,792 --> 00:06:19,252
When we're trick or
treatin' through the woods

97
00:06:19,379 --> 00:06:22,839
I'll be sneakin' up and peekin'
While my tippety toes are creakin'

98
00:06:22,924 --> 00:06:25,926
Boogity Boo-in' like a
Super Tigger should

99
00:06:26,010 --> 00:06:29,054
Well, a sweet treat
is just my cup of tea

100
00:06:29,180 --> 00:06:32,140
And a tricky-trick is
just the treat for me

101
00:06:32,225 --> 00:06:35,852
Oh, everybody pay attention
'Cause I really hate to mention

102
00:06:35,937 --> 00:06:38,647
That the ghoulie ghosts
are howling up a tree

103
00:06:38,731 --> 00:06:42,275
We are daring to be scaring

104
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:45,362
Who's behind that
mask you're wearing

105
00:06:45,446 --> 00:06:47,114
We can ""Boo!"" a spooky greetin'

106
00:06:47,198 --> 00:06:49,282
Then we'll share the
sweets we're eating

107
00:06:49,367 --> 00:06:52,411
When we're home from
trick-or-treating With our friends

108
00:06:52,537 --> 00:06:55,580
Oh, the Spookables crawl
out from where they hide

109
00:06:55,665 --> 00:06:58,875
Do you think they might
be hiding here inside?

110
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:02,421
-Well, together we're more clever
-We go places they would never!

111
00:07:02,505 --> 00:07:05,382
And a boo-hoo-hoo will
send 'em for a ride

112
00:07:05,466 --> 00:07:08,885
We are daring to be scaring

113
00:07:08,970 --> 00:07:11,721
Who's behind that
mask you're wearing?

114
00:07:11,806 --> 00:07:13,473
We can ""Boo!"" a spooky greeting

115
00:07:13,558 --> 00:07:15,559
Then we'll share the
sweets we're eating

116
00:07:15,643 --> 00:07:18,687
When we're home from
trick-or-treating With our friends

117
00:07:18,771 --> 00:07:21,731
We are daring to be scaring

118
00:07:21,858 --> 00:07:25,026
Who's behind that
mask you're wearing?

119
00:07:25,111 --> 00:07:28,905
We can ""Boo!"" a spooky greeting Then
we'll share the sweets we're eating

120
00:07:28,990 --> 00:07:32,826
When we're home from
trick-or-treating

121
00:07:32,910 --> 00:07:36,037
With our friends

122
00:07:42,753 --> 00:07:45,130
Bravo, Tigger.

123
00:07:45,214 --> 00:07:48,091
You've succeeded in
terrifying poor Lumpy.

124
00:07:49,302 --> 00:07:51,553
Lumpy, please come out.

125
00:07:51,637 --> 00:07:53,680
Halloween isn't that scary.

126
00:07:53,764 --> 00:07:57,058
-Right, Tigger?
-You said it, Roo, old pal.

127
00:07:57,143 --> 00:08:00,395
Not scary is just what it is.

128
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:03,857
As long as we don't run into
the Gobloon, of course.

129
00:08:03,941 --> 00:08:06,651
No! Not the Gobloon!

130
00:08:06,736 --> 00:08:09,196
-What's a Gobloon?
-Well, I'm glad you asked.

131
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:11,573
I didn't wanna leave
you in the dark.

132
00:08:11,699 --> 00:08:14,910
The Gobloon is the
scardiest fraidifier

133
00:08:14,994 --> 00:08:17,871
that ever scarified
on Halloween night.

134
00:08:17,955 --> 00:08:23,418
And he lives in the eeriest
part of the Hundred Acre Woods.

135
00:08:24,504 --> 00:08:27,797
His lair lies beyond
the Creepy Cave...

136
00:08:27,882 --> 00:08:30,842
-Dear.
-...down the Slimy Slide,

137
00:08:30,927 --> 00:08:36,306
and in the Tree of Terror!

138
00:08:37,642 --> 00:08:39,643
There, there, Lumpy.

139
00:08:39,727 --> 00:08:41,353
Don't listen to that lunatic.

140
00:08:43,814 --> 00:08:45,982
There's no such thing
as a Gobloon.

141
00:08:46,067 --> 00:08:48,485
You are so wrong, Long-Ears!

142
00:08:48,569 --> 00:08:49,945
-Tigger...
-Rabbit...

143
00:08:50,029 --> 00:08:51,696
-Lunatic.
-Long ears.

144
00:08:55,076 --> 00:08:57,244
Wrong you are, Long-Ears.

145
00:08:57,328 --> 00:08:59,996
Every Halloween,
he roams the woods

146
00:09:00,081 --> 00:09:03,625
for poor victims to turn
into jaggedy lanterns.

147
00:09:04,919 --> 00:09:07,212
Jaggedy lanterns!

148
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:09,089
Lumpy!

149
00:09:09,215 --> 00:09:11,883
I'm sure the Gobloon
isn't all bad.

150
00:09:11,968 --> 00:09:13,134
Right, Tigger?

151
00:09:13,219 --> 00:09:15,303
As a point of factin', Roo-boy,

152
00:09:15,388 --> 00:09:17,847
there is one good thing
about the Gobloon.

153
00:09:17,932 --> 00:09:21,268
If you catch him, you
get to make a wish.

154
00:09:21,352 --> 00:09:24,271
Did you hear that, Lumpy?
What kind of wish?

155
00:09:24,355 --> 00:09:26,022
Well, only the wish-iest wish

156
00:09:26,107 --> 00:09:28,567
that you could ever
wish about wishing for.

157
00:09:28,651 --> 00:09:31,027
Meaning, anything at all.

158
00:09:31,112 --> 00:09:33,321
-Wow!
-Oh, fiddlesticks and nonsense.

159
00:09:33,406 --> 00:09:37,242
There's no such thing as a Gobloon
and that's all there is to it!

160
00:09:40,371 --> 00:09:42,956
Lumpy? Please come out.

161
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:45,333
-Please?
-No, thanks.

162
00:09:45,459 --> 00:09:49,004
Don't want to get turned
into a jaggedy lantern.

163
00:09:49,088 --> 00:09:51,256
Lumpy won't come out.

164
00:09:51,340 --> 00:09:52,757
What do we do?

165
00:09:54,385 --> 00:09:58,471
This is going to require thought,
planning, concentration.

166
00:09:58,556 --> 00:10:02,392
Quick, everyone. ""Operation
: Extract the Heffalump.""

167
00:10:02,476 --> 00:10:06,021
Everyone grab hold. Heave ho!

168
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:13,570
We have to get organized.
All together now.

169
00:10:13,654 --> 00:10:15,488
Put some muscle into it.

170
00:10:16,949 --> 00:10:18,617
But I don't wanna come out!

171
00:10:18,659 --> 00:10:20,410
Come on, pull!

172
00:10:21,787 --> 00:10:23,872
Watch my tail, Piglet.

173
00:10:25,541 --> 00:10:27,709
Easy on the stripes back there.

174
00:10:27,793 --> 00:10:31,296
Somehow I don't believe
they thought this through.

175
00:10:31,380 --> 00:10:34,507
Come on, little Lumpster,
don't be scarified.

176
00:10:34,592 --> 00:10:36,676
The front of me's
not coming out.

177
00:10:36,761 --> 00:10:38,637
And the back of me's
not coming out.

178
00:10:38,721 --> 00:10:41,640
And neither is my middle.

179
00:10:46,854 --> 00:10:48,313
Who turned out the lights?

180
00:10:53,402 --> 00:10:55,820
-It's a Spookable! Help!
-Spookables! Run!

181
00:10:55,905 --> 00:10:57,989
-Help!
-Oh, my!

182
00:11:04,413 --> 00:11:07,540
Ah, well, that's more like it.

183
00:11:08,167 --> 00:11:11,461
I guess I taught him
a lesson or two.

184
00:11:12,129 --> 00:11:13,963
Please come out, Lumpy.

185
00:11:14,048 --> 00:11:16,841
I thought we were gonna
spend Halloween together?

186
00:11:16,926 --> 00:11:19,594
You can come under
here if you want.

187
00:11:23,891 --> 00:11:26,101
You guys go ahead.

188
00:11:27,103 --> 00:11:29,562
I'll stay here with Lumpy.

189
00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:38,279
It's OK, Lumpy.

190
00:11:38,364 --> 00:11:42,492
I was just really looking forward
to trick-or-treating together.

191
00:11:44,328 --> 00:11:46,830
Lumpy! You're not
hiding anymore.

192
00:11:46,914 --> 00:11:49,958
-Aren't you afraid?
-Oh, I still am.

193
00:11:50,042 --> 00:11:51,835
But as long as we're together,

194
00:11:51,919 --> 00:11:53,878
I can be brave.

195
00:11:53,963 --> 00:11:56,506
-Hooray for Lumpy!
-Good for you!

196
00:11:56,590 --> 00:11:58,341
That's what I'm talking about!

197
00:11:58,426 --> 00:12:01,219
Well, this calls
for a celebration.

198
00:12:01,303 --> 00:12:03,346
Piglet, fetch some candy.

199
00:12:03,431 --> 00:12:05,098
Yes, sir. Rabbit, sir.

200
00:12:09,019 --> 00:12:10,687
Yes, I know.

201
00:12:10,771 --> 00:12:12,397
You're all surprised.

202
00:12:12,481 --> 00:12:15,650
""No candy until
tonight,"" I said.

203
00:12:15,735 --> 00:12:18,903
But special occasions
call for sweets.

204
00:12:18,988 --> 00:12:21,823
So, Piglet, one piece
of candy each.

205
00:12:23,367 --> 00:12:26,494
-Rabbit?
-Yes, Piglet. The candy, if you please.

206
00:12:26,579 --> 00:12:28,663
Oh, dear. That's just it.

207
00:12:28,748 --> 00:12:30,790
Well, what is it, Piglet?
Spit it out!

208
00:12:30,875 --> 00:12:35,211
Well, there's no candy
left, Rabbit, sir.

209
00:12:35,296 --> 00:12:37,464
What do you mean,
""no candy left""?

210
00:12:37,548 --> 00:12:39,883
There's sacks and sacks
of it over there.

211
00:12:40,843 --> 00:12:43,970
Pooh Bear? You ate
all our candy?

212
00:12:44,054 --> 00:12:46,639
Mighty impressive for
one bear, though.

213
00:12:46,724 --> 00:12:48,391
I don't know how it happened.

214
00:12:48,476 --> 00:12:50,769
I only wanted one, but...

215
00:12:50,895 --> 00:12:53,521
...my tummy kept
asking for more.

216
00:12:54,899 --> 00:12:57,984
There's gotta be some
left here somewhere.

217
00:12:58,068 --> 00:13:00,403
We can't have Halloween
without candy.

218
00:13:00,488 --> 00:13:03,364
Well, I'll betcha Rabbit has
a few sweets tucked away.

219
00:13:03,449 --> 00:13:05,492
Don't ya, Long-Ears?

220
00:13:05,618 --> 00:13:07,952
I'm afraid not, Tigger.

221
00:13:14,877 --> 00:13:17,796
You see, I've collected
every bit of candy

222
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:19,756
from the Hundred Acre Wood.

223
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:22,133
I'm afraid...

224
00:13:22,259 --> 00:13:26,137
...there will be no trick-or-treating
this year. Oh, dear.

225
00:13:26,180 --> 00:13:28,890
Oh, bother.

226
00:13:28,974 --> 00:13:31,392
My tummy says it's sorry.

227
00:13:34,188 --> 00:13:37,106
I wish there was some way
we can get more candy.

228
00:13:37,191 --> 00:13:40,109
""Wish""? Maybe there is a way.

229
00:13:40,194 --> 00:13:42,320
Remember Tigger's story?

230
00:13:42,404 --> 00:13:44,030
If we catch the Gobloon,

231
00:13:44,114 --> 00:13:46,533
we could wish for enough
candy for everyone.

232
00:13:46,659 --> 00:13:48,952
Yeah! We can save Halloween.

233
00:13:49,036 --> 00:13:53,498
But if the Gobloon caught us,
we'd be jaggedy lanterns.

234
00:13:55,543 --> 00:13:57,585
Don't worry. I'll
be right there.

235
00:13:57,670 --> 00:13:59,212
I won't let him hurt you.

236
00:14:03,008 --> 00:14:04,384
OK, Lumpy,

237
00:14:04,468 --> 00:14:07,345
let's just go find some
costumes for tonight.

238
00:14:07,429 --> 00:14:10,598
Yes, Roo, let us do so.

239
00:14:10,683 --> 00:14:12,767
That's the spirit.

240
00:14:12,852 --> 00:14:15,353
We can still have
fun without candy.

241
00:14:15,980 --> 00:14:19,524
And don't forget, be back
promptly at the stroke of sunset.

242
00:14:19,608 --> 00:14:20,817
We will!

243
00:14:30,703 --> 00:14:33,329
Now, what did Tigger say again?
Oh, yeah.

244
00:14:33,414 --> 00:14:35,540
First we gotta find
the Creepy Cave,

245
00:14:35,624 --> 00:14:39,294
then the Slimy Slide and then.
..

246
00:14:39,420 --> 00:14:43,214
-The Tree of Terror.
-Oh, right. The Tree of Terror.

247
00:14:43,340 --> 00:14:44,674
Thanks, Lumpy. Come on!

248
00:14:44,758 --> 00:14:48,011
We're gonna make this the
best Halloween ever.

249
00:14:48,095 --> 00:14:51,389
Take that! And that! And that!

250
00:14:51,473 --> 00:14:53,766
I proclaim Lumpy and Roo

251
00:14:53,851 --> 00:14:56,603
to be the floundering
members of the...

252
00:14:58,731 --> 00:15:00,857
Bravest of the brave?

253
00:15:00,941 --> 00:15:04,736
The Bravest of the Brave
Gobloon Catchers' Club.

254
00:15:04,820 --> 00:15:07,989
Brave together! Brave forever!

255
00:15:08,073 --> 00:15:10,575
Conquerors of the Gobloon!

256
00:15:11,201 --> 00:15:12,243
Now shake.

257
00:15:15,873 --> 00:15:18,124
No, no! Shake hands.

258
00:15:18,208 --> 00:15:20,627
That means we stick
together, no matter what.

259
00:15:20,711 --> 00:15:23,171
What are we waiting for?
Let's go!

260
00:15:27,217 --> 00:15:31,471
We're friends forever
We'll be brave together

261
00:15:31,555 --> 00:15:35,850
We can weather
whatever comes along

262
00:15:36,477 --> 00:15:38,144
One can do it Two is better

263
00:15:38,228 --> 00:15:40,188
You and me together forever

264
00:15:40,272 --> 00:15:42,398
Braver than brave
Stronger than strong

265
00:15:42,483 --> 00:15:44,192
Brave together Singing our song

266
00:15:44,276 --> 00:15:46,861
-We're friends forever
-One can do it, two is better

267
00:15:46,946 --> 00:15:49,113
-We'll be brave together
-You and me together forever

268
00:15:49,198 --> 00:15:51,324
Braver than brave
Stronger than strong

269
00:15:51,408 --> 00:15:53,409
Brave together Singing our song

270
00:15:53,494 --> 00:15:55,370
Rumple de doodle Rumple dee dee

271
00:15:55,496 --> 00:15:57,789
We'll rumble and tumble
like bumbly bees

272
00:15:57,873 --> 00:15:59,958
Two together Together we're one

273
00:16:00,042 --> 00:16:02,335
Rumple de doodle
De doodle de dum

274
00:16:02,419 --> 00:16:04,253
-You're my buddy
-You're mine too

275
00:16:04,380 --> 00:16:06,673
-If I get scared
-I'm right behind you

276
00:16:06,757 --> 00:16:11,177
lt would be super if we could be
the bravest friends in history

277
00:16:13,180 --> 00:16:17,725
We're friends forever
We'll be brave together

278
00:16:17,810 --> 00:16:26,192
We can weather
whatever comes along

279
00:16:26,276 --> 00:16:30,822
We can weather whatever

280
00:16:30,906 --> 00:16:32,031
Comes

281
00:16:32,116 --> 00:16:33,616
Along

282
00:16:44,128 --> 00:16:47,422
No prizes for guessing
where the Gobloon lives?

283
00:16:47,506 --> 00:16:51,342
Oh, don't worry.
Gobloon catchers, ho!

284
00:16:53,554 --> 00:16:55,054
Lumpy?

285
00:16:58,142 --> 00:16:59,142
Come on!

286
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:02,103
All right.

287
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:06,441
Know what I'm gonna wish for
when we catch that Gobloon?

288
00:17:06,525 --> 00:17:09,861
Assuming the Gobloon
doesn't catch us first?

289
00:17:09,945 --> 00:17:12,113
I'm gonna wish for
a million cookies,

290
00:17:12,197 --> 00:17:14,032
and then a million candies,

291
00:17:14,116 --> 00:17:16,492
then three more wishes.

292
00:17:16,618 --> 00:17:18,828
-How 'bout you?
-Gosh.

293
00:17:18,912 --> 00:17:20,997
I've already got my best friend

294
00:17:21,081 --> 00:17:23,916
and a lunch box full
of rumpledoodles.

295
00:17:24,001 --> 00:17:26,002
What else do I need?

296
00:17:35,721 --> 00:17:37,221
What was that?

297
00:17:37,306 --> 00:17:39,515
lt sounded like it
came from over there.

298
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:40,933
Look!

299
00:17:43,103 --> 00:17:44,896
That's gotta be the Creepy Cave,

300
00:17:44,980 --> 00:17:46,439
just like Tigger said.

301
00:17:46,523 --> 00:17:48,649
The Slimy Slide
can't be far off.

302
00:17:48,734 --> 00:17:50,193
Come on, Lumpy.

303
00:17:57,159 --> 00:17:58,451
Whoa!

304
00:18:00,996 --> 00:18:02,830
Let's go!

305
00:18:06,460 --> 00:18:09,545
It's OK, Lumpy. It's only an echo.
Listen.

306
00:18:09,630 --> 00:18:11,005
Gobloon!

307
00:18:13,675 --> 00:18:17,386
Roo, please don't
do that again.

308
00:18:17,471 --> 00:18:18,846
I'm sorry.

309
00:18:37,491 --> 00:18:40,952
Roo! Something's following us.

310
00:18:42,663 --> 00:18:45,623
-I don't see anything.
-I heard it.

311
00:18:45,707 --> 00:18:47,416
I don't hear anything, either.

312
00:18:47,501 --> 00:18:49,544
My ears are bigger than yours.

313
00:18:49,628 --> 00:18:52,088
Lumpy, it's all in
your imagination.

314
00:19:02,224 --> 00:19:05,017
It's right behind me, Roo.
lt kicked me in the bottom.

315
00:19:05,102 --> 00:19:06,727
Lumpy! Stop!

316
00:19:08,063 --> 00:19:10,481
It's only your lunch box. See?

317
00:19:10,566 --> 00:19:13,651
I don't care. This is too scary.

318
00:19:13,735 --> 00:19:15,153
I don't want to go on.

319
00:19:15,237 --> 00:19:16,654
But we can't stop now.

320
00:19:16,780 --> 00:19:17,822
I'm sorry, Roo.

321
00:19:17,906 --> 00:19:21,826
I'm not taking another
step and that is final!

322
00:19:21,910 --> 00:19:24,579
We're almost through the cave.
All we have to...

323
00:19:24,663 --> 00:19:27,832
... find is the Slimy Slide!

324
00:19:34,506 --> 00:19:37,592
Lumpy? Are you OK?

325
00:19:37,676 --> 00:19:39,844
I think so.

326
00:19:46,351 --> 00:19:48,853
OK, we got through the
cave and down the slide.

327
00:19:48,979 --> 00:19:52,064
But where's that Tree of Terror?

328
00:19:54,067 --> 00:19:56,736
Wonder which way we should go?

329
00:20:04,912 --> 00:20:06,704
Smell anything?

330
00:20:08,540 --> 00:20:09,790
Nope.

331
00:20:09,875 --> 00:20:11,709
See anything?

332
00:20:15,547 --> 00:20:18,507
-Nope.
-Maybe he's not home.

333
00:20:18,592 --> 00:20:21,677
Well, only one way to find out.

334
00:20:22,346 --> 00:20:23,930
What are you going to do?

335
00:20:24,014 --> 00:20:26,974
Don't worry. I have a plan.

336
00:21:02,219 --> 00:21:03,552
Lumpy!

337
00:21:03,637 --> 00:21:06,472
You know what? He must
be out Goblooning.

338
00:21:06,556 --> 00:21:08,224
He could be back any minute.

339
00:21:08,308 --> 00:21:11,769
He could turn us into
jaggedy lanterns.

340
00:21:11,895 --> 00:21:14,605
I don't think I
can do this, Roo.

341
00:21:14,690 --> 00:21:16,607
I want to go home.

342
00:21:16,692 --> 00:21:20,152
If we leave, we won't catch the
Gobloon and we won't get our wishes

343
00:21:20,237 --> 00:21:23,281
and we won't have candy and
I won't get to show you

344
00:21:23,365 --> 00:21:24,824
how great Halloween is.

345
00:21:24,908 --> 00:21:26,784
I'm sorry.

346
00:21:26,868 --> 00:21:29,120
I'm just so scared.

347
00:21:30,622 --> 00:21:32,790
Gosh, I wish Piglet was here.

348
00:21:32,874 --> 00:21:34,375
-Piglet?
-Yeah.

349
00:21:34,459 --> 00:21:38,129
He was so afraid of Halloween once,
it almost was a Hallow-wasn't.

350
00:21:38,213 --> 00:21:41,257
-But then he got un-scared.
-Really?

351
00:21:42,259 --> 00:21:46,137
Say, maybe if I told
you the story, Lumpy,

352
00:21:46,221 --> 00:21:48,097
you might be un-scared too.

353
00:21:48,181 --> 00:21:49,932
All right.

354
00:21:50,058 --> 00:21:53,269
lt happened before Mom and I
moved to the Hundred Acre Wood.

355
00:21:53,353 --> 00:21:54,854
lt was Halloween,

356
00:21:54,938 --> 00:21:58,232
and everyone was really excited
to go trick-or-treating.

357
00:21:58,317 --> 00:22:00,735
They all had funny costumes

358
00:22:00,819 --> 00:22:03,654
and Pooh Bear's was the
bestest of them all.

359
00:22:03,739 --> 00:22:05,281
Look, there he is now.

360
00:22:05,365 --> 00:22:07,158
Hi, Pooh Bear. What
are you up to?

361
00:22:07,242 --> 00:22:09,535
Practicing.

362
00:22:09,619 --> 00:22:11,120
For Halloween.

363
00:22:11,204 --> 00:22:13,706
Which happens to happen soon.

364
00:22:13,790 --> 00:22:16,125
So I must be prepared.

365
00:22:18,170 --> 00:22:21,088
Though I'm not
fond of tricking,

366
00:22:21,173 --> 00:22:23,215
I do enjoy treating,

367
00:22:23,300 --> 00:22:25,468
because treating means...

368
00:22:26,345 --> 00:22:27,595
...eating.

369
00:22:28,347 --> 00:22:32,099
Bother. I've smackled every
smackeral of hon...

370
00:22:33,101 --> 00:22:36,020
Happy Halloweenin'
to ya, Pooh-boy!

371
00:22:37,939 --> 00:22:40,483
Not late, am I? Didn't
miss any anythin', did I?

372
00:22:40,567 --> 00:22:42,985
Halloween's what
Tiggers like the best.

373
00:22:45,947 --> 00:22:48,032
Trick or treat!

374
00:22:48,116 --> 00:22:50,910
Hello, Pooh. Hello, Tigger.

375
00:22:55,415 --> 00:22:57,375
Nice costume.

376
00:22:57,459 --> 00:22:59,251
You make a good yak.

377
00:22:59,378 --> 00:23:03,798
I'm not supposed to be some
yakkety-yakketin'-yak!

378
00:23:05,801 --> 00:23:08,260
Now I gotta get a new outfit!

379
00:23:08,345 --> 00:23:12,139
'Cause I'm gonna win
that Best Costume Prize.

380
00:23:12,224 --> 00:23:14,183
You wait and see!

381
00:23:16,311 --> 00:23:19,897
But, Gopher, I don't think
there is such a prize.

382
00:23:19,981 --> 00:23:22,149
Fine with me!

383
00:23:23,693 --> 00:23:26,404
Cuts down on the competition.

384
00:23:27,155 --> 00:23:29,073
Night'll be fallin'
any minute now,

385
00:23:29,157 --> 00:23:31,992
and I still haven't pulled
any warm-up tricks!

386
00:23:32,744 --> 00:23:35,371
But, Tigger, we can't go yet.

387
00:23:36,832 --> 00:23:38,416
What do you mean?

388
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:40,668
Halloween night
won't last all day,

389
00:23:40,752 --> 00:23:42,461
and we gotta be ready for it!

390
00:23:42,546 --> 00:23:45,881
But our very dear friend
Piglet is not here.

391
00:23:45,966 --> 00:23:49,385
And I would have thought he
should have been by now.

392
00:23:49,469 --> 00:23:52,263
I hope he is all right.

393
00:23:53,682 --> 00:23:57,059
Yes, Piglet, you're gonna
be quite all right.

394
00:23:57,144 --> 00:24:00,020
Because this year is
going to be the year.

395
00:24:00,105 --> 00:24:03,065
This Halloween, you're
going to enjoy yourself.

396
00:24:03,150 --> 00:24:05,443
Nothing is going
to frighten you.

397
00:24:08,780 --> 00:24:10,948
There! If I'm not scared

398
00:24:11,032 --> 00:24:14,702
of something as frightful as this,
I'll be unafraid of anything!

399
00:24:16,496 --> 00:24:18,372
I hope.

400
00:24:18,457 --> 00:24:21,292
Ghoulish goblin Ghastly ghost

401
00:24:21,376 --> 00:24:24,211
Everything scares me the most

402
00:24:24,296 --> 00:24:26,255
All I really want to do

403
00:24:26,339 --> 00:24:29,467
ls be with Pooh,
Eeyore and Tigger

404
00:24:29,551 --> 00:24:32,052
Kind of creepy, sort of scary

405
00:24:32,179 --> 00:24:34,763
Yes, but maybe not so very

406
00:24:34,848 --> 00:24:37,141
Well, in order to be brave

407
00:24:37,225 --> 00:24:41,645
I tell myself that
I am not afraid

408
00:24:41,730 --> 00:24:43,272
No, not too much

409
00:24:43,356 --> 00:24:46,734
And if I am not afraid

410
00:24:46,860 --> 00:24:48,986
Not more than a touch

411
00:24:49,070 --> 00:24:52,740
I can be around my friends

412
00:24:52,824 --> 00:24:56,202
And being with them
is much better

413
00:24:56,286 --> 00:24:58,996
We might be more brave together

414
00:24:59,080 --> 00:25:01,957
Then I can say that
I am not af...

415
00:25:02,042 --> 00:25:04,460
What if some spook
comes up to me

416
00:25:04,544 --> 00:25:07,004
When it's dark and really gloomy

417
00:25:07,088 --> 00:25:10,049
How very grand to stand up tall

418
00:25:10,133 --> 00:25:13,552
But could I even stand at all?

419
00:25:13,637 --> 00:25:16,514
I don't have one scary feature

420
00:25:16,598 --> 00:25:19,433
A timid, small and
frightened creature

421
00:25:19,518 --> 00:25:21,894
Dear, oh dear, I'm
just not brave

422
00:25:21,978 --> 00:25:23,354
I want to tell them

423
00:25:23,438 --> 00:25:26,524
I am not afraid

424
00:25:26,608 --> 00:25:28,442
No, not too much

425
00:25:28,527 --> 00:25:31,820
And if I am not afraid

426
00:25:31,905 --> 00:25:34,031
Not more than a touch

427
00:25:34,115 --> 00:25:37,868
I can be around my friends

428
00:25:37,953 --> 00:25:40,996
And being with them
is much better

429
00:25:41,081 --> 00:25:43,707
We might be more brave together

430
00:25:43,792 --> 00:25:46,585
It's Halloween I'll face my fear

431
00:25:46,670 --> 00:25:50,589
'Cause it's the spookiest
night of the year

432
00:25:50,674 --> 00:25:55,135
What a very grand
thing to be so brave

433
00:25:55,220 --> 00:26:00,391
To show myself that
I am not afraid

434
00:26:09,067 --> 00:26:12,611
Trick or treat. Or not.

435
00:26:12,696 --> 00:26:16,073
Why, Piglet, where
is your costume?

436
00:26:16,157 --> 00:26:18,242
Oh. I...

437
00:26:20,412 --> 00:26:23,872
Actually I haven't entirely
decided, exactly,

438
00:26:23,957 --> 00:26:26,000
just what I want
to be, precisely.

439
00:26:27,460 --> 00:26:29,503
Gasp! Look at the time.

440
00:26:29,588 --> 00:26:31,297
Half-past a quarter of sunset.

441
00:26:31,381 --> 00:26:34,883
And I still haven't done any
warmin'-uppin'! Come on!

442
00:26:38,054 --> 00:26:41,682
I gotta try some
trick-or-trickin' on old Rabbit.

443
00:26:41,766 --> 00:26:44,101
There is a trick to
pullin' tricks, you know.

444
00:26:47,439 --> 00:26:49,106
Storm brewin'.

445
00:26:50,317 --> 00:26:51,859
Oh, dear.

446
00:26:52,652 --> 00:26:53,777
Piglet.

447
00:26:53,862 --> 00:26:57,573
If you were I and I were you,

448
00:26:57,657 --> 00:27:01,160
would you think my costume will
get me plenty of treats tonight?

449
00:27:01,244 --> 00:27:04,330
Namely, honey.

450
00:27:04,831 --> 00:27:08,834
I should give it a
trying-out to be sure.

451
00:27:08,918 --> 00:27:11,754
Oh, Pooh, I really don't know.

452
00:27:11,838 --> 00:27:15,466
Say, where y'all buzzing
off to, buddy boys?

453
00:27:20,513 --> 00:27:23,807
I shall know I'm all
the bee that I can be,

454
00:27:23,892 --> 00:27:25,726
if the bees see me

455
00:27:25,810 --> 00:27:28,729
and see a bee instead of me.

456
00:27:28,813 --> 00:27:30,064
See?

457
00:27:33,860 --> 00:27:35,736
Oh, Pooh Bear!

458
00:27:37,030 --> 00:27:39,073
Perhaps it would
be best, Piglet,

459
00:27:39,157 --> 00:27:41,450
if you didn't call me by name.

460
00:27:41,576 --> 00:27:44,411
lt might make the bees curious.

461
00:27:44,496 --> 00:27:47,331
I'm sorry, Pooh Who Isn't.

462
00:27:58,009 --> 00:28:00,678
A trick? Or treat?

463
00:28:02,597 --> 00:28:04,139
Oh, bother.

464
00:28:06,559 --> 00:28:10,771
Each precious pumpkin a
picture of perfection!

465
00:28:12,565 --> 00:28:14,983
No, no, no!

466
00:28:15,068 --> 00:28:18,278
Not this way. That
way, to your left.

467
00:28:18,363 --> 00:28:20,197
No, your other left!

468
00:28:22,617 --> 00:28:24,410
Oh, my!

469
00:28:24,536 --> 00:28:27,371
My poor pumpkins.

470
00:28:28,164 --> 00:28:29,873
Are you all right, Pauline?

471
00:28:29,958 --> 00:28:32,543
Oh, speak to me, Pietro.

472
00:28:32,627 --> 00:28:36,296
Oh, don't you know me, Petunia?

473
00:28:36,381 --> 00:28:38,966
Trick or treat!

474
00:28:39,050 --> 00:28:41,301
Not now, Gopher.

475
00:28:41,386 --> 00:28:43,595
And why are you dressed
like a muskrat?

476
00:28:43,680 --> 00:28:45,222
Muskrat?

477
00:28:46,391 --> 00:28:49,935
That guy wouldn't know a rabbit
from a hole in the ground!

478
00:28:57,902 --> 00:29:00,154
Look at all the
pretty pumplekins!

479
00:29:00,238 --> 00:29:03,073
Jackie-lanterns just
waitin' to happen!

480
00:29:19,382 --> 00:29:27,473
Oh, dear!

481
00:29:27,557 --> 00:29:29,558
Tigger, stop that!

482
00:29:29,642 --> 00:29:32,478
I have no time for this
Halloween nonsense.

483
00:29:32,562 --> 00:29:36,064
I have work to do. I have
pumpkins to protect!

484
00:29:36,149 --> 00:29:38,400
How's this one?

485
00:29:38,485 --> 00:29:41,236
Of all my favourite holidays,

486
00:29:41,321 --> 00:29:43,614
Halloween isn't.

487
00:29:54,250 --> 00:29:56,210
A stormin'-good storm.

488
00:29:56,336 --> 00:29:59,213
This is gonna be the
bestest Halloween ever!

489
00:29:59,339 --> 00:30:01,715
With loads of lightnin'!

490
00:30:03,009 --> 00:30:05,344
And thunderous thunderin'!

491
00:30:06,679 --> 00:30:09,973
And windiferous winds
breaking everywhere!

492
00:30:13,937 --> 00:30:16,063
Oh, dear.

493
00:30:16,648 --> 00:30:21,235
Why, we're gonna be creepin'
and crawlin' with Spookables!

494
00:30:21,736 --> 00:30:23,737
Oh, dear.

495
00:30:25,156 --> 00:30:28,408
You don't suppose there
will be any Spookables

496
00:30:28,493 --> 00:30:31,453
of the honey-hungry sort?

497
00:30:31,538 --> 00:30:35,040
-Do you?
-At least half a dump of Spookables.

498
00:30:35,124 --> 00:30:39,002
And bug-eyed Woozles and
saw-toothed Jagulars!

499
00:30:40,296 --> 00:30:42,506
Oh, dear! Deary dear dear!

500
00:30:42,590 --> 00:30:43,799
Piglet.

501
00:30:53,560 --> 00:30:55,602
And then Piglet
ran for his life.

502
00:30:55,770 --> 00:30:58,689
Hey, Lumpy, is the story
making you feel any better?

503
00:31:00,775 --> 00:31:04,278
-I'll take that as a ""no"".
-What happened next, Roo?

504
00:31:04,362 --> 00:31:06,947
Did the Spookables get Piglet?

505
00:31:07,615 --> 00:31:09,575
Well, let's see.

506
00:31:13,872 --> 00:31:16,748
Piglet was all alone,
lost in the woods,

507
00:31:16,833 --> 00:31:20,294
on the ookiest-spookiest
night of the year,

508
00:31:21,004 --> 00:31:23,130
which really wasn't
the best place to be.

509
00:31:33,975 --> 00:31:36,977
There. Now you're
safe and sound.

510
00:31:39,272 --> 00:31:41,273
Who is it?

511
00:31:41,357 --> 00:31:44,860
It's me, them, and
, of course, us.

512
00:31:44,944 --> 00:31:46,778
Oh. But wait.

513
00:31:46,863 --> 00:31:50,782
Perhaps if you'd say something
only you would say,

514
00:31:50,867 --> 00:31:52,284
I'd know you're you.

515
00:31:52,368 --> 00:31:56,246
A very good idea, Piglet.
But what should I say?

516
00:31:56,331 --> 00:32:00,500
Well, possibly..
. ""I am Pooh""?

517
00:32:00,585 --> 00:32:03,462
You are? Well, then who am I?

518
00:32:05,340 --> 00:32:06,924
It's Pooh.

519
00:32:10,136 --> 00:32:12,262
Are you quite all right, Piglet?

520
00:32:14,390 --> 00:32:15,432
Yes.

521
00:32:15,516 --> 00:32:19,061
You will be joining us for
Halloween, won't you?

522
00:32:19,145 --> 00:32:21,521
Well, to be perfectly honest.
..

523
00:32:21,606 --> 00:32:23,273
What I mean to say is...

524
00:32:23,358 --> 00:32:25,317
To put it another way...

525
00:32:25,401 --> 00:32:27,319
The truth of the matter is...

526
00:32:27,403 --> 00:32:29,196
As a small and timid animal,

527
00:32:29,280 --> 00:32:32,115
I'm afraid I'm
really too afraid.

528
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:33,700
Oh, but Piglet,

529
00:32:33,785 --> 00:32:37,162
Halloween without you
would be like...

530
00:32:37,246 --> 00:32:40,457
Like last year, and the
year before last year.

531
00:32:40,541 --> 00:32:42,960
And the year before that year.

532
00:32:43,044 --> 00:32:45,879
And all the years leadin'
up to and includin'

533
00:32:45,964 --> 00:32:47,881
every last Halloween ever.

534
00:32:47,966 --> 00:32:51,009
I'm very, very sorry indeed.

535
00:32:51,094 --> 00:32:53,845
Oh, that's quite
all right, Piglet.

536
00:32:53,930 --> 00:32:56,890
We shall simply not
have Halloween.

537
00:32:57,016 --> 00:32:59,101
Oh, you mustn't do
that, Pooh Bear,

538
00:32:59,185 --> 00:33:01,853
-only because of me.
-Oh, no.

539
00:33:01,938 --> 00:33:04,815
This Halloween shall
be a Hallo-wasn't

540
00:33:04,899 --> 00:33:07,859
and you shall have no
reason to be frightened.

541
00:33:07,944 --> 00:33:09,945
Thank you, Pooh Bear.

542
00:33:12,573 --> 00:33:15,283
Would you like us to
stay with you, Piglet?

543
00:33:15,368 --> 00:33:19,162
No, I'll be quite all right now.

544
00:33:21,124 --> 00:33:23,500
I had hoped it wouldn't
happen this year.

545
00:33:23,584 --> 00:33:27,254
Everyone was looking
forward to Halloween so.

546
00:33:27,380 --> 00:33:30,841
I've let down Pooh and Tigger

547
00:33:30,925 --> 00:33:32,801
and Gopher and Eeyore

548
00:33:32,885 --> 00:33:36,430
and most of all... me.

549
00:33:40,476 --> 00:33:43,770
I do so hope this blusterous
and rather stormish night

550
00:33:43,855 --> 00:33:46,815
will not be too frightening
for poor Piglet.

551
00:33:46,899 --> 00:33:49,901
I suspect something
should be done.

552
00:33:49,986 --> 00:33:51,737
But what?

553
00:33:51,779 --> 00:33:53,613
I don't know either.

554
00:33:53,698 --> 00:33:55,615
Think, think.

555
00:33:55,700 --> 00:34:00,078
Why, just because Piglet can't
have Halloween with us,

556
00:34:00,163 --> 00:34:03,540
there's no reason we can't
have Hallo-wasn't with him!

557
00:34:03,624 --> 00:34:06,626
I like the way you think.

558
00:34:07,170 --> 00:34:11,631
No way, no how, am I gonna miss
out on another Halloween!

559
00:34:11,716 --> 00:34:15,385
I'll have my own
Hallo-wasn't all by myself.

560
00:34:16,679 --> 00:34:20,682
If only Piglet was more
like me and less like him.

561
00:34:22,143 --> 00:34:26,021
I love surprises and wearin' disguises
A horribly hideous costume'll do

562
00:34:26,105 --> 00:34:29,983
Better be wary, be spooky and scary
I'll bounce from the shadows and ""Boo""

563
00:34:30,068 --> 00:34:32,110
I wanna scare myself
and everyone else

564
00:34:32,195 --> 00:34:34,488
Those thrilly and chilly
old willys will rise

565
00:34:34,614 --> 00:34:38,325
Cover your eyes, little buddy beware
I'm twitchin' and itchin' to scare

566
00:34:38,409 --> 00:34:39,701
Myself

567
00:34:39,786 --> 00:34:42,162
Unspeakable Spookables
Awful unlookables

568
00:34:42,246 --> 00:34:44,372
Galloping ghosties
and goblins galore

569
00:34:44,457 --> 00:34:46,208
What if they find you
Oh, look out behind you

570
00:34:46,292 --> 00:34:49,503
A terrible Tigger-type roar
That would be me, hoo-hoo

571
00:34:49,587 --> 00:34:51,713
I wanna scare myself
and everyone else

572
00:34:51,798 --> 00:34:54,091
Those thrilly and chilly
old willys will rise

573
00:34:54,217 --> 00:34:57,969
Cover your eyes, little buddy beware
I'm twitchin' and itchin' to scare

574
00:34:58,096 --> 00:34:59,429
Myself

575
00:35:01,641 --> 00:35:03,975
Now Tiggers I figger
make scares even bigger

576
00:35:04,060 --> 00:35:06,061
They dress up and scream ""Who am I?
Can you guess?""

577
00:35:06,145 --> 00:35:08,021
And tricks always happen
when ghosts are a-flappin'

578
00:35:08,106 --> 00:35:12,192
And tricks are what Tiggers like best!
I wanna scare myself and everyone else

579
00:35:12,276 --> 00:35:14,277
Those thrilly and chilly
old willys will rise

580
00:35:14,362 --> 00:35:18,156
Cover your eyes, little buddy beware
I'm twitchin' and itchin' to scare

581
00:35:18,241 --> 00:35:19,741
Myself

582
00:35:21,077 --> 00:35:22,828
And who better?

583
00:35:23,371 --> 00:35:25,497
Oh, by the way. Boo!

584
00:35:29,001 --> 00:35:31,294
Spookables!

585
00:35:34,465 --> 00:35:37,217
Trick-or-treat, again.

586
00:35:37,301 --> 00:35:40,178
We're on our way to Piglet's
to have a Hallo-wasn't,

587
00:35:40,263 --> 00:35:42,973
-if you'd like to join...
-What're ya waitin' for?

588
00:35:43,057 --> 00:35:44,558
Come on!

589
00:35:48,771 --> 00:35:51,022
What was that?

590
00:35:54,193 --> 00:35:55,652
Someone's coming!

591
00:35:56,195 --> 00:36:00,157
It's a three-headed, bug-eyed
, saw-toothed Spookable!

592
00:36:01,617 --> 00:36:03,493
I must find Pooh!

593
00:36:05,079 --> 00:36:08,582
Perhaps we'd better
take off our costumes,

594
00:36:08,666 --> 00:36:10,667
so as not to frighten him.

595
00:36:10,751 --> 00:36:14,588
Piglet? Piglet?

596
00:36:17,300 --> 00:36:19,968
Don't you know what this means?

597
00:36:20,052 --> 00:36:23,180
He's been pignapped
by Spookables!

598
00:36:24,056 --> 00:36:27,225
Hup, two, three, four.

599
00:36:38,404 --> 00:36:40,614
Pooh wasn't at Eeyore's either,

600
00:36:40,740 --> 00:36:42,490
and neither was Eeyore,

601
00:36:42,575 --> 00:36:46,036
and no one was at Tigger's.

602
00:36:46,120 --> 00:36:49,289
Hello, Rabbit?

603
00:36:52,877 --> 00:36:56,338
Oh, no one at all is
where they should be.

604
00:36:59,383 --> 00:37:02,177
Oh, dear.

605
00:37:18,736 --> 00:37:21,029
Was that you, Eeyore?

606
00:37:21,113 --> 00:37:23,740
Wish I could say it was.

607
00:37:23,824 --> 00:37:25,575
But it wasn't.

608
00:37:27,578 --> 00:37:29,579
If I didn't know any better,

609
00:37:29,664 --> 00:37:32,499
I'd think you fellas
was all scaredy.

610
00:37:33,751 --> 00:37:35,877
We are.

611
00:37:42,260 --> 00:37:44,052
Well, I'm not!

612
00:37:44,887 --> 00:37:47,472
Now quit climbin' all
over me, buddy bear!

613
00:37:47,556 --> 00:37:49,349
We got piglets to find!

614
00:37:51,477 --> 00:37:53,687
I think I have had a thought.

615
00:37:53,771 --> 00:37:56,523
If we put our costumes on,

616
00:37:56,607 --> 00:37:58,733
when we find the Spookables,

617
00:37:58,859 --> 00:38:02,612
they shall think we're them and
we shall think they are us,

618
00:38:02,697 --> 00:38:05,240
so we can save Piglet

619
00:38:05,324 --> 00:38:08,201
and no one will be the wiser!

620
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:18,920
I know I got it this time!

621
00:38:29,974 --> 00:38:34,728
Oh, an infestation of ghosts
and goblins and ghouls!

622
00:38:36,439 --> 00:38:37,856
Piglet!

623
00:38:39,483 --> 00:38:42,402
Excuse me, but could someone,

624
00:38:42,486 --> 00:38:44,988
anyone really, help me?

625
00:38:48,326 --> 00:38:50,410
Oh, dear! Pooh Bear!

626
00:38:50,494 --> 00:38:52,829
Oh, they have Pooh Bear!

627
00:38:52,913 --> 00:38:56,499
Two very fierce and
savage Spookables!

628
00:39:06,510 --> 00:39:09,095
I must save my friend Pooh!

629
00:39:09,180 --> 00:39:11,056
Boo! Boo, I say.

630
00:39:11,140 --> 00:39:12,223
Boo!

631
00:39:16,520 --> 00:39:19,272
Spookable!

632
00:39:27,490 --> 00:39:29,366
What? Who's that?

633
00:39:29,450 --> 00:39:31,409
Oh no, not this way!

634
00:39:40,836 --> 00:39:42,670
Oh, dear!

635
00:39:51,639 --> 00:39:55,934
Why, Piglet, you scared
the Spookable away!

636
00:39:56,018 --> 00:39:57,310
I did?

637
00:39:57,395 --> 00:40:01,398
You did and what you
did saved us all.

638
00:40:01,482 --> 00:40:03,441
I did!

639
00:40:03,526 --> 00:40:07,445
Three cheers for the bravest
little timid guy ever!

640
00:40:07,530 --> 00:40:11,908
Hip-hip! Hooray! Hip-hip!
Hooray!

641
00:40:17,832 --> 00:40:19,290
Dagnabit!

642
00:40:19,375 --> 00:40:23,253
Why, Gopher, what a
wonderful costume.

643
00:40:23,379 --> 00:40:26,131
lt is? lt is!

644
00:40:26,215 --> 00:40:30,260
By dingy, it's the best!
That's what it is.

645
00:40:30,344 --> 00:40:33,430
Of all the Halloweens
I can remember,

646
00:40:33,514 --> 00:40:34,931
and I can't,

647
00:40:35,015 --> 00:40:37,225
this Hallo-wasn't has been

648
00:40:37,309 --> 00:40:39,978
the most unforgettable of all.

649
00:40:40,062 --> 00:40:44,274
And I got a super, grade-A,
lollapaloozin' good scare!

650
00:40:44,358 --> 00:40:46,276
Not that I was frightened by it.

651
00:40:46,360 --> 00:40:50,363
And this year Piglet has made
it all the way through,

652
00:40:50,448 --> 00:40:54,325
so our Hallo-wasn't
truly was a Hallo-was.

653
00:40:54,410 --> 00:40:57,203
Hey, wait a half a segundo.

654
00:40:57,288 --> 00:41:00,331
You never did figure out what
you're gonna be, Piglet!

655
00:41:00,458 --> 00:41:02,333
Actually, Tigger, I did.

656
00:41:02,460 --> 00:41:05,712
I've decided I'd like to
go as Pooh's very best,

657
00:41:05,796 --> 00:41:08,423
and very bravest friend.

658
00:41:08,507 --> 00:41:11,092
That, Piglet,

659
00:41:11,177 --> 00:41:14,596
is the thing I should
most like you to be.

660
00:41:15,639 --> 00:41:19,517
So, with just a little bit of
help from his very good friend...

661
00:41:19,602 --> 00:41:21,478
-Pooh Bear?
-That's right.

662
00:41:21,562 --> 00:41:23,396
Piglet became un-scared.

663
00:41:23,481 --> 00:41:25,482
And he stayed un-scared
for a while.

664
00:41:25,566 --> 00:41:29,194
'Cause he had his friends
to keep him company.

665
00:41:29,278 --> 00:41:32,280
Lumpy, did my story
un-scare you?

666
00:41:32,364 --> 00:41:33,823
I think so.

667
00:41:33,908 --> 00:41:37,076
If someone as small as
Piglet can be brave,

668
00:41:37,161 --> 00:41:40,997
-I can be twice as brave.
-At least.

669
00:41:41,081 --> 00:41:45,084
You would never leave me
alone, would you, Roo?

670
00:41:45,169 --> 00:41:47,795
Never, Lumpy. I promise.

671
00:41:47,880 --> 00:41:51,174
-Brave together.
-Brave forever.

672
00:41:51,300 --> 00:41:53,885
Conquerors of the Gobloon!

673
00:41:53,969 --> 00:41:55,887
Come on, Lumpy.

674
00:42:38,722 --> 00:42:40,139
Come on!

675
00:42:44,645 --> 00:42:47,146
All we have to do now is
wait 'til he comes home.

676
00:42:47,231 --> 00:42:50,441
Then I pull the rope, the trap
door slams down and wham!

677
00:42:50,526 --> 00:42:52,819
-We get our wishes?
-Yep!

678
00:42:52,903 --> 00:42:54,862
Now...

679
00:42:54,947 --> 00:42:58,992
Don't make a sound.

680
00:43:04,164 --> 00:43:05,498
Whoa!

681
00:43:07,126 --> 00:43:08,751
What was that?

682
00:43:08,836 --> 00:43:11,796
Maybe it's the Gobloon.

683
00:43:11,880 --> 00:43:13,840
You stay here. I'll
go check it out.

684
00:43:13,924 --> 00:43:15,717
If it's him, I'll
chase him here.

685
00:43:15,801 --> 00:43:18,928
And when I give the signal
, you spring the trap.

686
00:43:19,013 --> 00:43:20,597
What signal?

687
00:43:22,141 --> 00:43:24,601
I'll hoot like Owl. Only
instead of ""hoo hoo"",

688
00:43:24,685 --> 00:43:26,394
I'll hoot ""Roo hoo"".

689
00:43:27,396 --> 00:43:30,356
On second thought, why
don't you come with me?

690
00:43:30,441 --> 00:43:33,610
Good idea. That way I'll know
when you give the signal.

691
00:43:48,751 --> 00:43:50,543
Come on.

692
00:43:56,425 --> 00:43:59,010
It's coming from the bridge.

693
00:44:01,555 --> 00:44:03,431
Follow me.

694
00:44:08,437 --> 00:44:11,022
Lumpy, come on!

695
00:44:23,243 --> 00:44:25,453
Lumpy, quiet!

696
00:44:40,469 --> 00:44:42,220
Run, Lumpy! Run!

697
00:44:48,477 --> 00:44:50,645
The Gobloon's gonna get us.

698
00:45:06,745 --> 00:45:08,329
Help!

699
00:45:12,501 --> 00:45:14,085
Roo!

700
00:45:21,301 --> 00:45:23,136
Roo?

701
00:45:27,725 --> 00:45:30,351
Roo, where are you?

702
00:45:32,813 --> 00:45:36,858
You said you'd never
leave me alone.

703
00:46:00,883 --> 00:46:03,259
Lumpy?

704
00:46:03,343 --> 00:46:05,928
Where are you?

705
00:46:14,730 --> 00:46:18,149
Help! The Gobloon's got me!
The Gobloon's got me!

706
00:46:20,694 --> 00:46:22,695
Hold on, Roo. I'll save you!

707
00:46:22,780 --> 00:46:24,739
Help!

708
00:46:39,046 --> 00:46:40,546
Roo hoo!

709
00:46:40,631 --> 00:46:42,840
Where are you, Roo?

710
00:46:43,342 --> 00:46:44,842
Please answer me.

711
00:46:44,927 --> 00:46:46,886
Roo?

712
00:46:49,807 --> 00:46:51,974
Help! The Gobloon's got Roo!

713
00:46:54,770 --> 00:46:58,523
Brave together, brave forever.

714
00:47:00,484 --> 00:47:02,193
I'll save you, Roo.

715
00:47:02,277 --> 00:47:05,696
If Piglet can be
un-scared, so can I.

716
00:47:07,950 --> 00:47:11,744
Brave together, brave forever.

717
00:47:14,706 --> 00:47:17,500
Conquerors of the Gobloon.

718
00:47:25,884 --> 00:47:27,677
Oh, no, you don't.

719
00:47:56,832 --> 00:47:59,417
-Boo.
-Oh, hello, Eeyore.

720
00:47:59,501 --> 00:48:02,336
How'd you know it was me?

721
00:48:02,921 --> 00:48:05,214
-Hello, Piglet.
-Hello, Pooh.

722
00:48:05,340 --> 00:48:07,675
Look at me, Piglet.

723
00:48:07,759 --> 00:48:09,302
I'm a little honey pot.

724
00:48:09,386 --> 00:48:11,971
Oh, very nice, Pooh Bear.

725
00:48:12,055 --> 00:48:14,015
Oh, hi, Tigger.

726
00:48:15,475 --> 00:48:18,102
Tigger is my
mild-mannered alter-ego.

727
00:48:18,186 --> 00:48:21,355
I am Super-Tigger.

728
00:48:21,440 --> 00:48:26,193
I can leap over a house or something
really big, in a single bounce.

729
00:48:26,278 --> 00:48:29,655
And then... And I...

730
00:48:29,740 --> 00:48:31,157
I'm not kidding anyone.

731
00:48:31,241 --> 00:48:34,368
lt just doesn't feel like
Halloween without any candy.

732
00:48:34,453 --> 00:48:38,998
lt feels more like Hallow-almost
or Hallow-Not-Quite-Right.

733
00:48:39,082 --> 00:48:41,709
-Or something.
-I know what you mean, Tigger.

734
00:48:41,793 --> 00:48:44,170
Even my tummy can't be fooled.

735
00:48:45,631 --> 00:48:47,506
Cheer up, everyone.

736
00:48:47,591 --> 00:48:49,800
Halloween is saved.

737
00:48:50,427 --> 00:48:52,428
I knew you could
do it, Long-Ears.

738
00:48:52,512 --> 00:48:54,555
So, what did ya bring?
Popcorn balls?

739
00:48:54,640 --> 00:48:56,724
Candied apples? Cookies?

740
00:48:56,808 --> 00:48:58,601
-Even better.
-Honey?

741
00:48:58,685 --> 00:49:01,979
-Even better.
-As long as it's candy.

742
00:49:02,064 --> 00:49:03,105
Sure is.

743
00:49:04,441 --> 00:49:07,193
Nature's candy. Vegetables.

744
00:49:08,528 --> 00:49:10,696
Carrots. Radishes. Rutabagas.

745
00:49:10,781 --> 00:49:12,823
Oh, they're tasty, juicy,

746
00:49:12,908 --> 00:49:15,618
and most important,
good for you.

747
00:49:16,662 --> 00:49:21,290
Well, I suppose we could go
trick-or-treating with these.

748
00:49:22,459 --> 00:49:24,502
Well, I'll take
the trick, please.

749
00:49:26,254 --> 00:49:29,048
Oh, nonsense. This is
going to be the best

750
00:49:29,132 --> 00:49:32,176
and healthiest Halloween ever!

751
00:49:32,260 --> 00:49:34,011
Finally, as it should be.

752
00:49:34,096 --> 00:49:36,764
Hey, I just thought
of something.

753
00:49:36,848 --> 00:49:39,600
If we're all here to go
tricking and treating,

754
00:49:39,685 --> 00:49:43,062
then none of us are home
to be treated or tricked.

755
00:49:43,146 --> 00:49:45,272
You're right, Tigger.

756
00:49:45,357 --> 00:49:47,149
That is a bother.

757
00:49:47,234 --> 00:49:49,318
But what should we do?

758
00:49:50,195 --> 00:49:51,737
Think, think, think.

759
00:49:51,822 --> 00:49:55,074
I have an idea!
Let's take turns.

760
00:49:55,158 --> 00:49:57,451
We can practice
here at my house.

761
00:49:57,536 --> 00:49:59,704
I don't know, Piglet.

762
00:49:59,788 --> 00:50:02,164
What if you don't
answer the door?

763
00:50:02,249 --> 00:50:04,583
Oh, I will! I
promise, I will!

764
00:50:04,668 --> 00:50:06,544
Well, it's risky.

765
00:50:06,628 --> 00:50:08,295
Oh, my head hurts.

766
00:50:08,380 --> 00:50:10,464
But it's just crazy
enough to work.

767
00:50:10,549 --> 00:50:13,384
-Let's give it a try.
-Goody-goody!

768
00:50:23,520 --> 00:50:25,646
Who's there?

769
00:50:25,731 --> 00:50:28,649
It's us! Who else could it be?

770
00:50:29,818 --> 00:50:32,945
-""Us"" who?
-""Us""!

771
00:50:33,030 --> 00:50:35,281
Rabbit, Tigger and Pooh Bear!

772
00:50:35,365 --> 00:50:36,907
Forgot me again.

773
00:50:36,992 --> 00:50:38,659
Prove it.

774
00:50:38,744 --> 00:50:40,703
Open this door at once!

775
00:50:46,168 --> 00:50:49,920
-Rabbit! lt is you!
-Trick-or-treat!

776
00:50:52,299 --> 00:50:53,549
Hooray!

777
00:50:54,968 --> 00:50:57,845
I can't wait to try my place.

778
00:50:57,929 --> 00:51:00,264
Wonder if I'm gonna be there.

779
00:51:08,690 --> 00:51:12,902
Lumpy?

780
00:51:12,986 --> 00:51:14,987
Where are you?

781
00:51:23,246 --> 00:51:24,789
Lumpy?

782
00:51:29,044 --> 00:51:31,295
Oh, no! The Gobloon got you!

783
00:51:31,379 --> 00:51:34,298
And he's turned you into
a jaggedy lantern.

784
00:51:34,382 --> 00:51:37,384
Say something, Lumpy.

785
00:51:38,220 --> 00:51:40,763
Oh no, Lumpy.

786
00:51:41,306 --> 00:51:42,973
Don't worry, I'll find help.

787
00:51:43,058 --> 00:51:45,559
It'll be OK.

788
00:51:45,644 --> 00:51:48,020
I won't leave you again.

789
00:51:55,028 --> 00:51:58,072
Let's give Rabbit the
old trickety-treatment.

790
00:52:00,075 --> 00:52:02,034
Knockety knock knockety.

791
00:52:02,119 --> 00:52:03,786
Guess who!

792
00:52:06,164 --> 00:52:09,291
""Guess who,"" he says.
Gee, I don't know.

793
00:52:09,417 --> 00:52:11,210
Pooh Bear? Tigger?

794
00:52:11,294 --> 00:52:14,046
Oh, he's good.

795
00:52:14,131 --> 00:52:16,090
Very good.

796
00:52:16,925 --> 00:52:19,635
Anyway, let's see, where
are those treats?

797
00:52:19,719 --> 00:52:20,719
Oh, here we go.

798
00:52:20,804 --> 00:52:23,764
A nice juicy rutabaga
for Pooh Bear.

799
00:52:23,849 --> 00:52:27,143
Prunes for Piglet,
celery for Eeyore,

800
00:52:27,227 --> 00:52:31,355
and for you, Tigger.
.. spinach.

801
00:52:34,484 --> 00:52:37,194
Roo-boy and Lumpy are
missing all the fun,

802
00:52:37,279 --> 00:52:40,239
and the spinach.

803
00:52:40,323 --> 00:52:43,659
I told 'em to be here at sunset.
I'm sure they'll be by any minute.

804
00:52:43,743 --> 00:52:45,119
-Help!
-Roo-boy.

805
00:52:45,203 --> 00:52:46,954
Help!

806
00:52:47,539 --> 00:52:50,374
We tried to catch the Gobloon
, and we found his tree

807
00:52:50,458 --> 00:52:52,042
but I got scared and ran away.

808
00:52:52,127 --> 00:52:54,879
Then the Gobloon turned him
into a jaggedy lantern.

809
00:52:56,673 --> 00:52:59,592
Could you start again
from that first Gobloon?

810
00:53:01,469 --> 00:53:03,929
-Gobloon!
-Oh, dear.

811
00:53:04,014 --> 00:53:06,432
The story's true. There
really is a Gobloon.

812
00:53:06,516 --> 00:53:08,267
Quick, everyone, panic!

813
00:53:08,351 --> 00:53:10,936
-Poor Lumpy.
-Oh, this will never do.

814
00:53:12,647 --> 00:53:14,481
Wait a second. I got it.

815
00:53:14,566 --> 00:53:16,901
We gotta catch the Gobloon.

816
00:53:16,985 --> 00:53:19,528
-What?
-Well, if you catch the Gobloon,

817
00:53:19,613 --> 00:53:21,989
-you get to make a wish.
-That's it, Tigger.

818
00:53:22,073 --> 00:53:23,574
We can wish Lumpy back.

819
00:53:23,700 --> 00:53:25,910
Tigger's right. Wait a minute.

820
00:53:25,994 --> 00:53:28,787
Tigger's right? That
can't be right.

821
00:53:28,788 --> 00:53:29,038


822
00:53:29,289 --> 00:53:32,833
Hurry! There's not
a moment to lose!

823
00:53:34,294 --> 00:53:36,128
-Hurry!
-Come on.

824
00:53:36,213 --> 00:53:37,755
We're gonna save him.

825
00:53:37,839 --> 00:53:39,924
-We're coming, Lumpy.
-Don't worry!

826
00:53:40,008 --> 00:53:42,426
We'll have you back
to normal in no time.

827
00:53:42,510 --> 00:53:45,679
I'm sorry I left you all alone.

828
00:53:45,764 --> 00:53:48,349
Lumpy, we're coming for you!

829
00:53:48,433 --> 00:53:50,601
We're coming, Lumpy!

830
00:53:58,193 --> 00:54:00,986
Remind me again, Pooh Bear.

831
00:54:01,071 --> 00:54:04,657
How did I ever become un-scared?

832
00:54:08,787 --> 00:54:10,079
Listen, everyone.

833
00:54:10,872 --> 00:54:13,916
The tree is making noises.

834
00:54:17,545 --> 00:54:20,506
Maybe it has a bellyache.

835
00:54:20,590 --> 00:54:23,008
That's the Gobloon!
The trap worked.

836
00:54:23,093 --> 00:54:25,010
We caught him!

837
00:54:25,095 --> 00:54:27,554
-Hooray!
-Hooray for us!

838
00:54:27,639 --> 00:54:30,391
-I knew we could do it.
-Hooray! Yay!

839
00:54:32,269 --> 00:54:34,270
Now what?

840
00:54:34,354 --> 00:54:38,482
-Knock and shout ""trick-or-treat"".
-I could offer him some honey.

841
00:54:38,566 --> 00:54:40,359
I don't think
Gobloons eat honey.

842
00:54:40,443 --> 00:54:42,736
Well, he could sure
have all of my spinach.

843
00:54:46,950 --> 00:54:50,494
Um, Mr Gobloon?

844
00:54:53,832 --> 00:54:56,542
I don't want candy.

845
00:54:56,626 --> 00:54:59,128
All I care about is Lumpy.

846
00:55:00,380 --> 00:55:03,340
I wish my friend back.

847
00:55:07,470 --> 00:55:10,306
You hear me, you
mean old Gobloon?

848
00:55:10,390 --> 00:55:12,433
I want my friend back!

849
00:55:12,517 --> 00:55:15,352
Roo? Roo! I'm in here!

850
00:55:51,389 --> 00:55:53,057
Lumpy?

851
00:55:53,141 --> 00:55:54,767
-You're OK!
-lt worked.

852
00:55:54,851 --> 00:55:58,937
-Things couldn't get better.
-Roo wished Lumpy back!

853
00:56:00,732 --> 00:56:02,483
-lt worked!
-Oh, yes!

854
00:56:02,567 --> 00:56:05,611
Now, that's what I
call a happy ending.

855
00:56:06,488 --> 00:56:08,530
I'm sorry I ran away, Lumpy.

856
00:56:08,656 --> 00:56:10,908
I was just so scared.

857
00:56:10,992 --> 00:56:12,493
Would you...

858
00:56:12,577 --> 00:56:15,454
Could you... forgive me?

859
00:56:15,580 --> 00:56:19,083
Gosh, Roo, you
came back for me.

860
00:56:19,167 --> 00:56:21,001
That was brave.

861
00:56:21,086 --> 00:56:25,547
I guess thinking about being
with you made me brave.

862
00:56:25,632 --> 00:56:28,926
-Brave together?
-Brave forever.

863
00:56:29,010 --> 00:56:31,720
Conquerors of the Gobloon!

864
00:56:31,805 --> 00:56:33,305
-Hooray!
-Hooray for us!

865
00:56:33,390 --> 00:56:35,766
Who needs candy to have
a great Halloween?

866
00:56:35,850 --> 00:56:37,559
When we've got each other.

867
00:56:38,436 --> 00:56:40,437
You know, it seems to me

868
00:56:40,522 --> 00:56:43,107
there's only one
thing left to say.

869
00:56:43,191 --> 00:56:44,650
I know, I know.

870
00:56:44,734 --> 00:56:46,235
Trick-or-Treat.

871
00:56:47,737 --> 00:56:50,406
-Gasp!
-Happy Halloween, everyone!

872
00:56:50,490 --> 00:56:51,824
Trick-or-Treat.

873
00:56:54,119 --> 00:56:55,994
Mama!

874
00:56:56,079 --> 00:56:57,162
Come in.

875
00:56:57,247 --> 00:57:00,624
I baked cookies and
rumpledoodles for everybody.

876
00:57:00,708 --> 00:57:03,377
And I made a special
jack-o'-lantern

877
00:57:03,420 --> 00:57:05,587
for each and every one of you.

878
00:57:07,298 --> 00:57:09,425
Hello, gorgeous.

879
00:57:10,677 --> 00:57:13,053
Doesn't look like me at all.

880
00:57:13,138 --> 00:57:15,305
Why the long face?

881
00:57:15,390 --> 00:57:19,268
Oh, look, Piglet. It's me
and my very best friend.

882
00:57:19,352 --> 00:57:20,853
Oh, mine too!

883
00:57:20,979 --> 00:57:22,980
Look, Lumpy. There's
even one for me.

884
00:57:23,064 --> 00:57:24,898
-Wow!
-But where's yours?

885
00:57:24,983 --> 00:57:26,608
I'm so sorry, Lumpy.

886
00:57:26,693 --> 00:57:28,485
I did make one for you,

887
00:57:28,570 --> 00:57:31,280
but it must have fallen
off my wheelbarrow.

888
00:57:34,868 --> 00:57:36,452
See? I told you.

889
00:57:36,578 --> 00:57:39,288
Halloween is the most fun ever.

890
00:57:39,372 --> 00:57:42,332
You were right. I
love Hallowoon.

891
00:57:42,417 --> 00:57:45,252
Hallow-woo... Hallow...

892
00:57:45,336 --> 00:57:46,462
Oh, whatever.

893
00:57:46,546 --> 00:57:49,214
As long as we're together.

894
00:57:49,549 --> 00:57:52,718
We are daring to be scaring

895
00:57:52,802 --> 00:57:55,554
Who's behind that
mask you're wearing?

896
00:57:55,638 --> 00:57:59,433
We can ""Boo!"" a spooky greetin' Then
we'll share the sweets we're eating

897
00:57:59,517 --> 00:58:03,896
When we're home from
trick or treating

898
00:58:03,980 --> 00:58:06,857
With our friends

899
00:58:18,578 --> 00:58:20,579

We can weather

00:58:27,212 --> 00:58:28,921
One can do it Two is better

903
00:58:29,005 --> 00:58:30,797
You and me together forever

Braver than brave

-We're friends forever
-One can do it, two is better

907

-We'll be brave together
-You and me together forever

908
00:58:39,307 --> 00:58:41,266
-We can weather
-Braver than brave stronger than strong

909
00:58:41,351 --> 00:58:43,477
-Whatever comes along
-We're brave together singing our song

00:58:43,561 --> 00:58:45,229

WILD ROOTS

2
00:00:50,420 --> 00:00:53,219
Hey buddy!
It's time to leave, we are closing.

3
00:00:53,300 --> 00:00:56,539
- I'll just drink this.
- You'll drink it outside. Move!

4
00:00:58,259 --> 00:00:59,499
Hey!

5
00:01:00,980 --> 00:01:03,660
Sleeping beauty! Wake up!

6
00:02:13,780 --> 00:02:15,340
Hey!
You can't do that here!

7
00:02:16,340 --> 00:02:17,699
Put the brush back and go!

8
00:02:19,739 --> 00:02:21,539
Are you deaf?
Put the brush back!

9
00:02:40,060 --> 00:02:43,660
- Was she expelled?
- We were going to leave, anyway.

10
00:02:43,739 --> 00:02:47,340
They don't pay much attention to children
there. It's better for Niki here.

11
00:02:47,900 --> 00:02:49,579
Wasn't she going to come too?

12
00:02:50,380 --> 00:02:52,819
She had a bellyache,
and went to the bathroom.

13
00:02:52,900 --> 00:02:54,819
- Are you the child's legal guardian?
- Yes.

14
00:02:55,139 --> 00:02:57,419
- And her parents?
- Her mother died.

15
00:02:57,819 --> 00:03:01,259
- My condolences. And her father?
- We don't keep in touch.

16
00:03:01,340 --> 00:03:04,100
She could join the sixth graders
even today.

17
00:03:04,180 --> 00:03:06,780
But if she feels sick
then she should rest.

18
00:03:09,019 --> 00:03:09,979
Did you hear?

19
00:03:12,660 --> 00:03:15,620
Karola, long time no see.

20
00:03:22,739 --> 00:03:24,620
Hello, how can I help you?

21
00:03:24,699 --> 00:03:28,460
Hello... I have a savings account
with a prize car.

22
00:03:28,539 --> 00:03:29,380
You won a car?

23
00:03:30,660 --> 00:03:34,419
- No, I need the money from the account.
- Your passbook, please.

24
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:35,819
And if I don't have it?

25
00:03:36,220 --> 00:03:39,139
I'd suggest that you find it
and then come back again.

26
00:03:39,859 --> 00:03:42,259
- Then I'd say I can't get it.
- How so?

27
00:03:42,340 --> 00:03:43,579
Like I said.

28
00:03:44,060 --> 00:03:45,460
I don't want to get into this, but...

29
00:03:45,539 --> 00:03:50,340
You're in it now, there must be some
record of my money here.

30
00:03:50,419 --> 00:03:52,220
That's what a passbook is for.

31
00:03:52,739 --> 00:03:54,859
It's the official record that
you invested at our bank.

32
00:03:55,579 --> 00:03:57,859
Without it, anyone could
come in and claim money.

33
00:03:58,419 --> 00:04:01,739
You mean it's not here?
Where the fuck is it?

34
00:04:02,299 --> 00:04:04,780
Calm down please,
or else I can't help you.

35
00:04:11,660 --> 00:04:12,579
Here you are.

36
00:04:13,299 --> 00:04:15,460
ID. Address card.
Shop loyalty card...

37
00:04:16,499 --> 00:04:20,059
...a photo of my mother, what else
will make you believe me?

38
00:04:20,140 --> 00:04:21,660
That's not how it works, sir.

39
00:04:22,900 --> 00:04:24,059
What's the problem?

40
00:04:28,460 --> 00:04:31,340
What's the problem?
You steal people's money.

41
00:04:31,419 --> 00:04:34,539
You shuffle it then make it
disappear like fucking Houdini!

42
00:04:34,619 --> 00:04:37,460
- Leave the building.
- And if I don't, what then?

43
00:04:37,539 --> 00:04:39,780
- I'll call the police.
- 'Cause I want to take my money out?

44
00:04:39,859 --> 00:04:43,140
- You're disrupting service.
- What service? Your service is shit here!

45
00:04:43,460 --> 00:04:45,260
I want to talk to your bosses.

46
00:04:55,340 --> 00:04:59,820
Fuck, just call your daddy.
You're all clowns. Go fuck yourselves.

47
00:05:08,739 --> 00:05:11,140
- Not bad, but it's not my style.
- I'll try it on.

48
00:05:18,379 --> 00:05:19,739
What did you do in England?

49
00:05:20,379 --> 00:05:23,419
- Well, all sorts. I didn't go to school.
- How come?

50
00:05:23,939 --> 00:05:25,499
- They didn't mind.
- Your parents?

51
00:05:26,580 --> 00:05:30,299
My mom is a musician. She's in a
synth-pop band, and I joined her on tour.

52
00:05:30,660 --> 00:05:32,299
- Is she the singer?
- The drummer.

53
00:05:32,379 --> 00:05:33,939
- Cool.
- Check this out.

54
00:05:50,820 --> 00:05:52,700
Don't you have any
clean socks?

55
00:05:53,460 --> 00:05:55,059
Hello!

56
00:05:57,460 --> 00:05:58,419
Hello!

57
00:05:59,220 --> 00:06:01,100
Don't you have any
clean socks?

58
00:06:07,419 --> 00:06:10,619
- You can't try them on without socks.
- Then how?

59
00:06:10,700 --> 00:06:12,220
Only with clean socks.

60
00:06:15,820 --> 00:06:17,580
I'm calling the manager.

61
00:07:11,419 --> 00:07:12,460
Pali, come here.

62
00:07:14,260 --> 00:07:17,379
- What is it?
- He ate the kid's sandwich.

63
00:07:17,460 --> 00:07:20,739
- OK, I'll deal with him.
- Come on, Domi, it's 7:30!

64
00:07:25,340 --> 00:07:26,460
Hey.

65
00:07:27,100 --> 00:07:28,260
Wake up, already.

66
00:07:29,340 --> 00:07:31,260
You fuckin' ate Domi's lunch.

67
00:07:33,499 --> 00:07:37,220
- A little diet won't hurt that kid.
- Don't be such an asshole.

68
00:07:37,780 --> 00:07:39,260
- Did you go to the bank?
- Yeah.

69
00:07:39,340 --> 00:07:41,059
- And?
- Nothing.

70
00:07:41,140 --> 00:07:44,220
- They need that fucking passbook.
- Maybe you should go and ask for it.

71
00:07:44,299 --> 00:07:45,780
- You go for it.
- Me?

72
00:07:45,859 --> 00:07:49,419
I asked you to pick up
my things, right?

73
00:07:51,499 --> 00:07:55,260
It doesn't matter when
your brother is in need, right?

74
00:07:58,900 --> 00:08:01,700
- It's weird if I go instead of you.
- It's you who needs money.

75
00:08:01,780 --> 00:08:03,260
I need money?

76
00:08:03,340 --> 00:08:06,859
You eat my food, you sleep on my couch
and it's me who needs money?

77
00:08:06,939 --> 00:08:09,059
Every day, my wife asks
when you're going to chip in.

78
00:08:09,140 --> 00:08:10,419
I'll give when I get it.

79
00:08:12,739 --> 00:08:13,979
Come!

80
00:09:21,180 --> 00:09:22,220
Hello...

81
00:09:29,420 --> 00:09:30,499
Hello, Éva.

82
00:09:31,340 --> 00:09:32,300
Hello, Éva.

83
00:09:33,060 --> 00:09:33,979
It's me, Tibi.

84
00:10:26,580 --> 00:10:27,940
Can I buy some new shoes?

85
00:10:29,379 --> 00:10:32,820
- You already have some.
- But the sole's coming off.

86
00:10:34,940 --> 00:10:36,220
How much are they?

87
00:10:37,379 --> 00:10:38,340
21 thousand.

88
00:10:44,220 --> 00:10:45,499
Go on, pick it up!

89
00:10:54,300 --> 00:10:55,220
Hello.

90
00:10:57,460 --> 00:10:58,899
It's Tibi.

91
00:11:01,340 --> 00:11:02,899
Is anyone there?

92
00:11:03,979 --> 00:11:04,979
Hello?

93
00:11:06,340 --> 00:11:07,580
Who is it?

94
00:11:09,460 --> 00:11:10,420
Who is it?

95
00:11:17,340 --> 00:11:18,259
Who was that?

96
00:11:19,540 --> 00:11:20,460
Tibi.

97
00:11:24,019 --> 00:11:24,940
What did he want?

98
00:11:26,619 --> 00:11:27,540
I don't know.

99
00:11:28,019 --> 00:11:29,379
What do you mean, you don't know?

100
00:11:30,300 --> 00:11:33,019
- Why didn't you call me?
- He hung up.

101
00:11:33,859 --> 00:11:35,979
If he calls again,
give the phone to me.

102
00:12:09,619 --> 00:12:10,379
Who's that?

103
00:12:11,700 --> 00:12:14,180
- My dad.
- Got a proper pic of him?

104
00:12:14,259 --> 00:12:16,940
- No, because he's wanted by the police.
- Why?

105
00:12:18,180 --> 00:12:22,460
He has an offshore firm in the Bahamas.
We get a lot of money from it.

106
00:12:26,739 --> 00:12:28,019
He is my mom's manager.

107
00:12:29,019 --> 00:12:31,979
If you're so rich, why do you
always borrow money?

108
00:12:32,499 --> 00:12:35,940
- I told you, I left my purse at home.
- Why are you such a liar?

109
00:12:36,019 --> 00:12:38,540
- I'm not lying.
- Yeah, right.

110
00:12:41,739 --> 00:12:43,019
What's the matter?

111
00:12:49,739 --> 00:12:51,460
How do you have the nerve
to come here?

112
00:12:51,540 --> 00:12:52,619
I need the papers.

113
00:12:53,100 --> 00:12:54,940
You think I still have them?

114
00:12:56,899 --> 00:12:59,060
I told you not to
come here anymore!

115
00:12:59,499 --> 00:13:03,300
- We don't want to hear about him.
- Maybe it was mixed with Edina's stuff.

116
00:13:03,379 --> 00:13:05,100
Get lost!

117
00:14:13,220 --> 00:14:14,540
Granny

118
00:14:23,139 --> 00:14:25,220
<i>Why didn't you answer?</i>
<i>Where are you?</i>

119
00:14:25,300 --> 00:14:26,259
At Karola's.

120
00:14:27,019 --> 00:14:29,940
<i>Are you in the city?</i>
<i>What's that noise?</i>

121
00:14:30,300 --> 00:14:31,259
We're on our way.

122
00:14:31,779 --> 00:14:32,700
To their place.

123
00:14:33,180 --> 00:14:36,420
<i>Come home! You didn't tell me</i>
<i>you're staying out!</i>

124
00:14:36,899 --> 00:14:38,100
They live really far.

125
00:14:38,979 --> 00:14:40,019
In Budakeszi.

126
00:14:40,420 --> 00:14:42,940
<i>Then ask her mother</i>
<i>to bring you home!</i>

127
00:14:43,460 --> 00:14:44,379
She's gone to bed.

128
00:14:46,580 --> 00:14:49,139
<i>Next time, tell me</i>
<i>you're sleeping over!</i>

129
00:14:49,460 --> 00:14:50,379
Sorry.

130
00:15:40,379 --> 00:15:43,739
I put up with shit from
your mother-in-law and Kinga.

131
00:15:43,820 --> 00:15:46,499
It's not the best fucking time
to discuss this.

132
00:15:46,580 --> 00:15:50,060
You think it's okay that I go for your
stuff, 'cause you don't dare?

133
00:15:50,139 --> 00:15:51,420
I went back to work.

134
00:15:52,540 --> 00:15:55,460
- I'm tired of cleaning up after you.
- You clean up?

135
00:15:55,540 --> 00:15:57,619
I keep your house in order!
Your fucking garden!

136
00:15:57,700 --> 00:16:00,420
I take your dog for a piss.
Should I fuck your wife too?

137
00:16:00,499 --> 00:16:03,060
- Then she might calm down.
- Give me the keys.

138
00:16:04,259 --> 00:16:08,019
Get out in the morning.
I don't want to see you there anymore.

139
00:16:11,820 --> 00:16:13,619
Stop. Show me your purse.

140
00:16:16,340 --> 00:16:18,220
- You can't take that in.
- Are you serious?

141
00:16:18,300 --> 00:16:20,420
- I said throw it out.
- It's only water!

142
00:16:20,499 --> 00:16:23,019
I don't care, throw it out!

143
00:16:26,019 --> 00:16:26,859
Enjoy the party.

144
00:16:29,540 --> 00:16:31,700
- Hold it!
- What's the problem?

145
00:16:31,779 --> 00:16:33,739
- She can't walk.
- Get off.

146
00:16:33,820 --> 00:16:35,580
Your friend let us in.

147
00:16:35,659 --> 00:16:37,019
- What's wrong?
- She can barely walk.

148
00:16:37,100 --> 00:16:39,859
- Calm the fuck down.
- Don't tell me to calm down.

149
00:16:39,940 --> 00:16:42,379
- I've had it with you!
- They are off their faces!

150
00:16:42,460 --> 00:16:43,619
I don't care! Hey, girls!

151
00:16:44,100 --> 00:16:45,700
Stop! What's the rush?

152
00:16:48,259 --> 00:16:52,460
Back off! You can't take booze in.
Who do you think you are?

153
00:16:52,540 --> 00:16:54,259
Go back!

154
00:17:35,939 --> 00:17:39,060
- I told you, you can't come in!
- Fuck off!

155
00:18:37,699 --> 00:18:39,260
What are you doing here?

156
00:18:40,379 --> 00:18:42,379
Dorci, take this kid away from here!

157
00:18:44,179 --> 00:18:45,939
What the fuck is going on here?

158
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:48,899
- What have you done?
- They came at me with a wine glass.

159
00:18:49,659 --> 00:18:52,300
Get the fuck outta here.
Your shift is over.

160
00:19:04,379 --> 00:19:06,340
What happened down there?

161
00:19:08,699 --> 00:19:09,619
So...

162
00:19:10,100 --> 00:19:11,139
How did you get in?

163
00:19:13,179 --> 00:19:14,139
Who were you with?

164
00:19:18,899 --> 00:19:20,540
I have to call your parents.

165
00:19:21,500 --> 00:19:22,939
Please, talk to me!

166
00:19:24,899 --> 00:19:27,020
She was walking around alone.

167
00:20:03,219 --> 00:20:04,340
Could you leave us?

168
00:20:04,419 --> 00:20:05,580
- Why?
- Please.

169
00:20:05,899 --> 00:20:07,859
- But Gábor told me to...
- She's with me.

170
00:20:08,459 --> 00:20:10,020
- What?
- Like I said.

171
00:20:22,540 --> 00:20:23,780
How did you get here?

172
00:20:26,540 --> 00:20:28,179
How did you find me?

173
00:20:29,859 --> 00:20:31,580
Who told you I was here? Huh?

174
00:20:34,060 --> 00:20:35,139
Nobody.

175
00:20:35,820 --> 00:20:37,060
Then, how?

176
00:20:37,540 --> 00:20:39,740
Did you see what
happened upstairs?

177
00:20:42,740 --> 00:20:44,100
Why did you come here?

178
00:20:45,260 --> 00:20:47,780
It's no place for a kid,
for fuck's sake!

179
00:20:49,020 --> 00:20:51,139
They'll be
looking for you at home.

180
00:20:52,980 --> 00:20:54,540
Where do they think you are?

181
00:20:55,859 --> 00:20:57,260
With a friend.

182
00:21:01,980 --> 00:21:04,100
I have to get out of here.

183
00:21:04,179 --> 00:21:05,379
Now.

184
00:21:06,300 --> 00:21:07,340
Come.

185
00:21:09,699 --> 00:21:10,619
I said come.

186
00:21:27,179 --> 00:21:28,780
I'm taking you home, OK?

187
00:21:30,540 --> 00:21:32,179
I can go home on my own.

188
00:21:38,820 --> 00:21:39,740
Are you hungry?

189
00:22:02,100 --> 00:22:03,459
What will you have?

190
00:22:04,740 --> 00:22:07,219
- Come on.
- I'm not hungry.

191
00:22:08,060 --> 00:22:09,139
It's up to you.

192
00:22:22,780 --> 00:22:25,459
I bought these for you.
I don't eat dessert.

193
00:22:27,379 --> 00:22:29,260
You can take it to school, hm?

194
00:22:29,859 --> 00:22:31,300
School lunch is crap.

195
00:22:35,020 --> 00:22:36,419
I don't want it.

196
00:23:00,419 --> 00:23:03,219
Can you believe this?
Are you blind, man?

197
00:23:13,899 --> 00:23:17,020
This guy too.
Can't you see, you prick?

198
00:23:19,619 --> 00:23:22,100
Unbelievable. I mean, seriously.

199
00:23:35,300 --> 00:23:36,459
I'm conquered.

200
00:23:37,859 --> 00:23:40,340
Overcome by the forces of nature.

201
00:24:01,580 --> 00:24:02,820
Where do you live?

202
00:24:06,939 --> 00:24:08,379
Can't we go to your place?

203
00:24:10,580 --> 00:24:11,980
It's not that simple.

204
00:24:12,459 --> 00:24:13,619
Why?

205
00:24:16,939 --> 00:24:18,300
I'm in between places.

206
00:24:22,699 --> 00:24:24,340
But I happen to know a place.

207
00:24:30,179 --> 00:24:34,060
In two weeks, they're gonna alter
this place. Until then, it's free.

208
00:24:34,580 --> 00:24:36,459
Can you put on some music?

209
00:24:36,820 --> 00:24:37,820
Sure.

210
00:25:32,219 --> 00:25:34,219
Do you want to put on something?

211
00:26:25,580 --> 00:26:27,980
- What language is this?
- Icelandic.

212
00:26:29,100 --> 00:26:30,139
What's she saying?

213
00:28:19,020 --> 00:28:20,060
Listen...

214
00:28:23,859 --> 00:28:26,139
My life is a mess right now.

215
00:28:27,300 --> 00:28:31,100
I have no place to live.
You saw, I couldn't take you anywhere.

216
00:28:31,500 --> 00:28:33,820
If I get a bit more money,
then maybe...

217
00:28:34,740 --> 00:28:38,619
but right now, it's just too complicated
for us to meet everyday.

218
00:28:44,060 --> 00:28:46,459
It's better that way, believe me.

219
00:29:18,780 --> 00:29:19,899
My T-shirts?

220
00:29:19,980 --> 00:29:22,780
Kinga washed them.
They're on the drying rack.

221
00:29:27,580 --> 00:29:28,980
You have a place to go?

222
00:29:30,020 --> 00:29:31,340
Don't act like you care.

223
00:29:32,020 --> 00:29:34,699
- I wanted to help.
- I can see that.

224
00:29:35,659 --> 00:29:37,980
Some people are beyond help.

225
00:29:43,219 --> 00:29:49,580
Last year we learned about
animals with a similar diet: cattle.

226
00:29:56,300 --> 00:29:58,580
This is the third time
you're late.

227
00:30:19,659 --> 00:30:21,540
- Your shoes are cool.
- Thanks.

228
00:30:23,300 --> 00:30:26,540
- You said you didn't like them.
- I changed my mind.

229
00:30:27,419 --> 00:30:29,179
- Is it a problem?
- No.

230
00:30:30,419 --> 00:30:33,340
I bet your criminal father
can buy them for you, right?

231
00:30:33,419 --> 00:30:34,340
Stupid cunt.

232
00:30:34,419 --> 00:30:36,619
What's going on back there?

233
00:30:37,580 --> 00:30:38,699
Niki, stand up.

234
00:30:47,260 --> 00:30:49,619
How many stomachs does a cow have?

235
00:30:53,859 --> 00:30:54,859
69.

236
00:30:56,459 --> 00:30:57,580
69.

237
00:31:01,659 --> 00:31:02,859
69, really?

238
00:31:03,980 --> 00:31:06,780
Okay, bring me your report book.

239
00:31:06,859 --> 00:31:07,859
That is an F.

240
00:32:47,219 --> 00:32:48,340
Listen.

241
00:32:49,060 --> 00:32:50,139
You've lost this.

242
00:32:54,219 --> 00:32:58,659
Listen, I acted shit, I'm sorry.
Let's sit down somewhere and talk.

243
00:32:59,020 --> 00:33:00,540
Do you know this man?

244
00:33:01,939 --> 00:33:03,459
Do you know this man?

245
00:33:03,540 --> 00:33:04,300
No.

246
00:33:04,619 --> 00:33:06,340
Leave this child alone.

247
00:33:06,419 --> 00:33:08,540
- Let's go this way.
- That's not where I'm going.

248
00:33:08,619 --> 00:33:11,139
- Would you go away!
- Ma'am would you just calm down?

249
00:33:11,219 --> 00:33:13,139
You're not going to molest this child!

250
00:33:13,619 --> 00:33:14,980
- Is he your father?
- No.

251
00:33:16,379 --> 00:33:18,020
- Who are you?
- Fuck, I don't believe it.

252
00:33:18,100 --> 00:33:19,659
I'm going to report you.

253
00:33:28,899 --> 00:33:30,540
Where are you going?

254
00:33:34,980 --> 00:33:36,020
You hear?

255
00:33:36,899 --> 00:33:37,980
Nowhere.

256
00:33:43,340 --> 00:33:45,179
Fine, I'm going with you.

257
00:34:10,580 --> 00:34:13,779
Are you serious?
This is so embarrassing.

258
00:34:13,860 --> 00:34:16,699
I'll give you money instead.
How much do you need?

259
00:34:16,779 --> 00:34:17,980
21 thousand.

260
00:34:25,380 --> 00:34:26,819
Maybe not today.

261
00:34:29,779 --> 00:34:32,020
Didn't I tell you
not to come here?

262
00:34:35,739 --> 00:34:36,779
Or else?

263
00:34:37,900 --> 00:34:39,779
What are you gonna do about it?

264
00:34:43,139 --> 00:34:44,139
Keep working.

265
00:35:21,339 --> 00:35:22,619
She is nice.

266
00:35:23,460 --> 00:35:24,739
She sure is.

267
00:35:51,580 --> 00:35:52,500
Rad.

268
00:35:55,139 --> 00:35:56,139
Cool.

269
00:35:58,020 --> 00:35:58,900
Check this out.

270
00:36:02,860 --> 00:36:04,259
This is the one I like.

271
00:36:05,819 --> 00:36:07,139
Not bad.

272
00:36:15,460 --> 00:36:17,139
I'm not loaded right now.

273
00:36:19,100 --> 00:36:21,900
But there is something
you could find for me.

274
00:36:22,380 --> 00:36:24,779
A little green book,
with the word Passbook on it.

275
00:36:25,299 --> 00:36:28,699
With that, I could buy you those shoes.
It must be at the bottom of a drawer.

276
00:36:28,779 --> 00:36:31,139
Come with me
and let's find it together.

277
00:36:34,659 --> 00:36:36,100
I'm not welcome there.

278
00:36:39,540 --> 00:36:41,659
Why is Granny so angry with you?

279
00:36:43,060 --> 00:36:44,900
Because... you were in prison?

280
00:36:47,420 --> 00:36:48,339
That's right.

281
00:36:48,940 --> 00:36:49,900
What did you do?

282
00:36:53,420 --> 00:36:56,860
I did a lot of shit. I was all over
the place, making trouble all the time.

283
00:36:58,179 --> 00:36:59,699
Why, what did she tell you?

284
00:37:03,659 --> 00:37:07,580
That I shouldn't talk to you.
And that you'll never look for me.

285
00:37:09,619 --> 00:37:10,980
See, here I am.

286
00:37:20,779 --> 00:37:23,819
- Aren't you going to pick it up?
- It's unknown.

287
00:37:28,940 --> 00:37:31,580
Don't tell them at home
that you met me, okay?

288
00:37:41,420 --> 00:37:42,819
Are you coming tomorrow?

289
00:37:44,139 --> 00:37:45,139
I can.

290
00:38:00,259 --> 00:38:02,339
- Hello.
- Good afternoon.

291
00:38:03,060 --> 00:38:04,659
Is this Tibor Kondor?

292
00:38:05,380 --> 00:38:06,460
Yes?

293
00:38:06,540 --> 00:38:10,659
<i>I'm calling from the Life Protection Unit</i>
<i>of Budapest Police HQ.</i>

294
00:38:10,739 --> 00:38:13,339
<i>You have to come in</i>
<i>for questioning.</i>

295
00:38:14,020 --> 00:38:15,179
Regarding what?

296
00:38:15,739 --> 00:38:19,420
<i>The man you beat up Thursday night</i>
<i>fell into a coma today.</i>

297
00:38:19,819 --> 00:38:22,299
<i>Come and see me</i>
<i>in Teve street at 10 AM.</i>

298
00:38:28,980 --> 00:38:33,940
Tibor Kondor. Regarding the
life-threatening assault

299
00:38:34,020 --> 00:38:38,580
that took place on Thursday
September 16, at 22:14,

300
00:38:38,659 --> 00:38:40,699
I am questioning you as a suspect.

301
00:38:41,299 --> 00:38:44,020
You can file a complaint
against being suspected,

302
00:38:44,100 --> 00:38:46,619
you are not obliged to speak.

303
00:38:46,699 --> 00:38:49,739
You may refuse to speak at
any time during the procedure.

304
00:38:49,819 --> 00:38:52,580
- Do you understand this information?
- Yes.

305
00:38:53,139 --> 00:38:55,540
In your own words,
tell me what happened.

306
00:38:57,219 --> 00:38:59,699
He came with his girlfriend,
who was shitfaced.

307
00:39:00,060 --> 00:39:04,500
Told them that they can't go in.
But they got in somehow.

308
00:39:04,580 --> 00:39:06,420
Then I told them that wasn't okay.

309
00:39:07,580 --> 00:39:10,100
First, the woman came at me,
then the guy.

310
00:39:10,179 --> 00:39:13,580
He was already on a roll,
so I gave him a little twist.

311
00:39:13,659 --> 00:39:16,460
- Can you be more concrete?
- Concrete how?

312
00:39:16,540 --> 00:39:19,179
""They got in somehow.""
""He was already on a roll.""

313
00:39:19,259 --> 00:39:22,819
""I gave him a little twist.""
Can you elaborate?

314
00:39:23,619 --> 00:39:25,940
They wanted to go in,
but I didn't let them.

315
00:39:26,020 --> 00:39:28,020
- My colleague let them...
- His name?

316
00:39:28,100 --> 00:39:29,739
Zsolt Bene let them in.

317
00:39:29,819 --> 00:39:34,779
I suspected that this was a mistake,
since, as I mentioned, they were drunk.

318
00:39:35,500 --> 00:39:37,060
I told them to leave.

319
00:39:37,139 --> 00:39:43,100
Then she picked up a fat wine glass,
broke it, and lunged at me with a shard.

320
00:39:43,500 --> 00:39:47,540
Well, that's... Only a woman can do that.
Then he hit me...

321
00:39:49,139 --> 00:39:51,739
and I did hit him back,
more than once.

322
00:39:52,500 --> 00:39:56,339
But what was I supposed to do?
Stand there like a dick at a wedding?

323
00:39:56,420 --> 00:39:58,259
- Do you wish to say anything else?
- No.

324
00:39:59,380 --> 00:40:02,179
I checked your record.
You have a criminal history.

325
00:40:03,339 --> 00:40:06,020
You did four years for
vehicular manslaughter.

326
00:40:06,100 --> 00:40:07,339
That is not relevant.

327
00:40:07,420 --> 00:40:10,540
This is not the first time the suspect
committed a life-threatening crime,

328
00:40:10,619 --> 00:40:12,779
so, I believe that it is relevant.

329
00:40:12,860 --> 00:40:16,380
Under the influence of drugs
and alcohol he caused an accident

330
00:40:16,460 --> 00:40:19,139
resulting in the death of his partner,
Edina Várkonyi.

331
00:40:19,219 --> 00:40:20,779
I'm going to report bias.

332
00:40:20,860 --> 00:40:23,819
Don't you see a pattern
between these two cases?

333
00:40:53,540 --> 00:40:57,060
- Are we going to the theatre?
- To the circus, young lady.

334
00:41:26,779 --> 00:41:28,500
- Evenin'.
- Good evening.

335
00:41:31,139 --> 00:41:34,619
Listen, guys. The doors are open until 7.
After that, you're standing outside.

336
00:41:35,179 --> 00:41:38,339
Richie, look at you.
You want me to button you up?

337
00:41:40,139 --> 00:41:40,980
What a dick.

338
00:41:42,259 --> 00:41:44,139
One more week, then I'm gone.

339
00:41:45,299 --> 00:41:46,299
Because?

340
00:41:46,380 --> 00:41:48,540
To fuck about here,
for 1500 Forints per hour?

341
00:41:48,619 --> 00:41:51,020
Looking like a penguin? Fuck that.
I'm outta here!

342
00:41:51,500 --> 00:41:52,779
Where?

343
00:41:54,299 --> 00:41:56,980
Barcelona,
they are hiring at a casino.

344
00:41:57,060 --> 00:41:59,219
I'd work two days a week,
and I'll make 150 Euros a day.

345
00:41:59,580 --> 00:42:00,900
I'll party the whole time.

346
00:42:01,659 --> 00:42:04,219
Be careful, or they'll
take you as a dancer too.

347
00:42:04,299 --> 00:42:05,980
You're just envious.

348
00:42:11,699 --> 00:42:13,060
I'm at Karola's...

349
00:42:14,739 --> 00:42:15,779
Hello.

350
00:42:16,219 --> 00:42:18,139
Are you Julcsi's daughter?

351
00:42:18,739 --> 00:42:22,259
Look! It's Julcsi's daughter.
You're Anna, right?

352
00:42:22,339 --> 00:42:26,299
Your mom told me a lot about you.
That you do modeling and such.

353
00:42:28,339 --> 00:42:29,580
Tell me, how is it?

354
00:42:30,259 --> 00:42:32,739
- Well...
- You were abroad... In Japan, right?

355
00:42:32,819 --> 00:42:34,940
Yes, and in Cuba too.

356
00:42:35,020 --> 00:42:36,460
- You hear that?
- Yeah, great.

357
00:42:36,940 --> 00:42:39,179
Yes, we lived
on a yacht the whole time.

358
00:42:39,779 --> 00:42:41,219
Considering that,
you look pale.

359
00:42:41,299 --> 00:42:44,900
They sprayed me with a whitening cream
so I wouldn't get a tan.

360
00:42:44,980 --> 00:42:47,860
- With a whitening cream?
- There you are!

361
00:42:47,940 --> 00:42:50,299
- We introduced ourselves to Anna.
- Hello, I'm Julcsi.

362
00:42:51,460 --> 00:42:54,900
- She is not your daughter?
- I could never get Anna to come here.

363
00:42:57,020 --> 00:42:59,819
So? Where can I buy
that skin whitener?

364
00:43:01,100 --> 00:43:02,020
Leave her be.

365
00:43:04,179 --> 00:43:05,100
This is outrageous!

366
00:43:42,100 --> 00:43:43,580
- What's the matter?
- She sneaked in.

367
00:43:43,980 --> 00:43:45,900
- I'll handle it.
- I'll handle it myself.

368
00:43:46,900 --> 00:43:47,819
She is with me.

369
00:43:48,219 --> 00:43:50,819
For this they could
cancel our contract!

370
00:43:50,900 --> 00:43:53,739
There's no need to be mad,
she'll sit here quietly.

371
00:43:54,060 --> 00:43:54,980
Why aren't you at your place?

372
00:43:55,540 --> 00:43:58,100
- He brought this child in here.
- Who is she?

373
00:43:58,659 --> 00:43:59,860
My daughter.

374
00:44:01,020 --> 00:44:04,179
- What's got into you?
- I'll let you two handle this.

375
00:44:05,139 --> 00:44:07,500
This is a workplace,
not a fucking kids' party.

376
00:44:08,100 --> 00:44:10,139
Is it a problem that
she ate two sandwiches?

377
00:44:10,219 --> 00:44:13,420
No, the problem is that
you always get into trouble.

378
00:44:13,500 --> 00:44:16,380
For me, it's not worth it.
Get outta here, okay?

379
00:44:18,900 --> 00:44:20,619
- Are you firing me?
- That's right.

380
00:44:21,380 --> 00:44:22,540
Right now, right here?

381
00:44:22,980 --> 00:44:25,819
And your free shelter is gone.
Move out from B7.

382
00:44:29,380 --> 00:44:31,060
The exit is not that way!

383
00:44:56,619 --> 00:44:57,900
Bon appétit!

384
00:45:08,619 --> 00:45:10,219
What are you looking at?

385
00:45:12,900 --> 00:45:15,900
This fuckin' shit!
Fuck this!

386
00:45:18,940 --> 00:45:19,940
Hey, Tibi, stop it.

387
00:45:20,020 --> 00:45:21,299
- Come outside.
- I'll eat this first.

388
00:45:21,380 --> 00:45:24,139
- Buddy! Don't do this, come on!
- I said now.

389
00:45:25,060 --> 00:45:25,980
Sorry.

390
00:45:35,860 --> 00:45:37,980
Stop it! Come outside!
Come on.

391
00:45:38,500 --> 00:45:41,060
- You'll have to carry me...
- That's enough.

392
00:46:01,739 --> 00:46:02,739
What is it now?

393
00:46:04,299 --> 00:46:06,299
- Why did you do that?
- Do what?

394
00:46:06,779 --> 00:46:09,580
- We were supposed to leave!
- We did leave, didn't we?

395
00:46:16,580 --> 00:46:19,060
Why feel sorry for them?

396
00:46:30,580 --> 00:46:31,980
Was I an asshole?

397
00:46:35,619 --> 00:46:36,540
Yes.

398
00:46:39,819 --> 00:46:41,380
Show me how much.

399
00:46:44,659 --> 00:46:46,380
So I wasn't an asshole.

400
00:46:49,139 --> 00:46:50,779
That's all?

401
00:46:53,739 --> 00:46:55,739
I won't ever be an asshole again.

402
00:46:56,339 --> 00:46:57,659
Promise?

403
00:47:02,100 --> 00:47:03,460
Promise.

404
00:47:33,020 --> 00:47:34,259
Tastes like shit.

405
00:47:34,699 --> 00:47:35,819
I like it.

406
00:47:50,100 --> 00:47:53,100
You should invite
this Karola over sometime.

407
00:48:05,219 --> 00:48:07,980
It's always them hosting you.
It's not right.

408
00:48:08,940 --> 00:48:12,139
- What her parents do for a living?
- They're lawyers.

409
00:48:21,060 --> 00:48:22,259
What are you looking for?

410
00:48:22,900 --> 00:48:25,100
- Some tools.
- What for?

411
00:48:25,900 --> 00:48:27,219
For home economics.

412
00:48:28,339 --> 00:48:30,100
I'll find you some tools tomorrow.

413
00:48:37,699 --> 00:48:39,739
- Are you coming?
- Coming.

414
00:49:16,699 --> 00:49:17,619
Thank you.

415
00:49:18,380 --> 00:49:19,739
It was next to this.

416
00:49:22,940 --> 00:49:24,339
It was mom's, right?

417
00:49:27,219 --> 00:49:28,940
I couldn't find the other one.

418
00:49:31,299 --> 00:49:32,779
She only wore one.

419
00:49:33,420 --> 00:49:34,659
Why?

420
00:49:36,219 --> 00:49:37,500
It was her idea.

421
00:49:38,060 --> 00:49:40,380
She always had odd socks.

422
00:50:20,259 --> 00:50:21,540
What are you doing?

423
00:50:22,179 --> 00:50:23,380
What do you think? I'm cooking.

424
00:50:24,380 --> 00:50:26,940
You don't need that much.
It'll be disgusting.

425
00:50:27,420 --> 00:50:28,380
Really?

426
00:50:37,219 --> 00:50:38,739
You seem to be
doing great with this.

427
00:50:39,139 --> 00:50:42,020
- In England, I always cooked for myself.
- You were in England?

428
00:50:42,420 --> 00:50:44,580
I was an exchange student
in Liverpool.

429
00:50:44,659 --> 00:50:47,060
Exchange student...
what the heck is that?

430
00:50:47,460 --> 00:50:49,779
I lived with an English girl,
but her parents sent me back,

431
00:50:49,860 --> 00:50:51,619
because she told them
that I broke her hand.

432
00:50:52,060 --> 00:50:54,460
And... It wasn't you?

433
00:50:54,860 --> 00:50:57,940
No, but she cried so hard,
the teachers believed her.

434
00:50:58,020 --> 00:51:00,420
And when I came back
they kicked me out of the school.

435
00:51:01,779 --> 00:51:03,100
Why are you lying?

436
00:51:03,860 --> 00:51:05,100
I'm not lying.

437
00:51:05,179 --> 00:51:07,739
Don't give me that,
I can see you're faking.

438
00:51:08,420 --> 00:51:11,339
She fell out of a tree.
She was clumsy. That's it.

439
00:51:13,900 --> 00:51:16,020
I built a hideout in a tall tree,

440
00:51:16,100 --> 00:51:19,339
then Emily and her friend climbed in,
and they didn't let me in.

441
00:51:19,420 --> 00:51:21,420
But I built the whole thing on my own!

442
00:51:21,819 --> 00:51:24,299
So I locked them inside,
and took away the ladder.

443
00:51:24,380 --> 00:51:26,420
They sat up there all day long!

444
00:51:26,500 --> 00:51:28,619
Then Emily got out.

445
00:51:28,699 --> 00:51:31,219
But it's not my fault
if she can't jump properly.

446
00:51:33,020 --> 00:51:34,659
Did you tell them this?

447
00:51:37,819 --> 00:51:42,139
If you had said this, then maybe you
wouldn't have to take the blame, right?

448
00:51:45,299 --> 00:51:47,900
But I'd love to have
a word with this Emily.

449
00:51:53,540 --> 00:51:54,460
Hello.

450
00:51:55,380 --> 00:51:57,339
- Hello.
- Hi!

451
00:52:07,699 --> 00:52:09,940
Can't you see the room is occupied?

452
00:52:11,580 --> 00:52:13,500
There isn't room
for four of us.

453
00:52:13,819 --> 00:52:16,699
It's a shared kitchen,
didn't you see the sign?

454
00:52:18,060 --> 00:52:20,739
I can't believe it.
We can't get five minutes in peace!

455
00:52:21,500 --> 00:52:23,500
- Relax, man.
- Don't 'relax' me.

456
00:52:26,940 --> 00:52:28,259
Niki, come on.

457
00:52:29,420 --> 00:52:30,819
Did you hear?

458
00:52:41,580 --> 00:52:43,060
Thank you very much.

459
00:53:30,259 --> 00:53:31,580
Tastes good.

460
00:53:48,179 --> 00:53:51,020
I got a letter from the police.

461
00:53:51,100 --> 00:53:54,139
<i>We have to appear as witnesses,</i>
<i>because of a fight.</i>

462
00:53:54,739 --> 00:53:56,540
<i>- Did somebody hurt you?</i>
<i>- No!</i>

463
00:53:57,179 --> 00:54:00,540
<i>- What is all this? You can tell me...</i>
<i>- Nothing happened!</i>

464
00:54:00,619 --> 00:54:03,900
<i>What is this business</i>
<i>with the police?</i>

465
00:54:04,500 --> 00:54:05,540
I don't know.

466
00:54:05,860 --> 00:54:08,500
<i>Come home,</i>
<i>and we'll talk about it, okay?</i>

467
00:54:09,139 --> 00:54:10,460
Okay.

468
00:54:15,380 --> 00:54:16,940
Something wrong?

469
00:54:17,699 --> 00:54:19,900
Granny got a letter from the police.

470
00:54:20,699 --> 00:54:23,819
We have to go in.
Because of that fight.

471
00:54:25,060 --> 00:54:27,380
You don't have to say anything.
Okay?

472
00:54:28,779 --> 00:54:30,940
Don't say anything,
and it'll be fine.

473
00:54:52,900 --> 00:54:54,619
Niki, do you know
why we're here?

474
00:54:59,299 --> 00:55:02,739
There is CCTV footage of you
on Thursday, September 16...

475
00:55:03,100 --> 00:55:06,500
at the entrance of a nightclub called Red.

476
00:55:08,060 --> 00:55:12,500
That night, there was a fight in the club.
There is no footage of that.

477
00:55:13,020 --> 00:55:16,380
Your father, Tibor Kondor
got into a fight with a man.

478
00:55:16,900 --> 00:55:18,259
Did he come to see you?

479
00:55:18,339 --> 00:55:20,699
It's important that we let Niki speak,
so please...

480
00:55:20,779 --> 00:55:23,699
I told you to tell me
if he contacts you.

481
00:55:23,779 --> 00:55:27,860
If you don't let the girl speak,
I'll have to ask you to leave the room.

482
00:55:30,460 --> 00:55:34,420
You should know that if you tell me
what you saw, it might help your father,

483
00:55:34,500 --> 00:55:36,179
or it might not.

484
00:55:36,819 --> 00:55:40,779
You must be careful to
answer me honestly.

485
00:55:44,980 --> 00:55:48,940
Can you tell me why you went
to the place where your father worked?

486
00:55:49,020 --> 00:55:52,739
- You went there yourself? At night?
- I have to ask you to leave the room.

487
00:55:52,819 --> 00:55:55,100
I have the right to know
what happened to my granddaughter.

488
00:55:55,179 --> 00:55:58,299
You are obstructing questioning,
please leave.

489
00:56:00,860 --> 00:56:02,699
Until you do, we can't continue.

490
00:56:12,060 --> 00:56:14,219
If you are ready,
we can continue.

491
00:56:16,699 --> 00:56:20,420
Can you tell me why you went
to the place where your father worked?

492
00:56:24,500 --> 00:56:27,020
Did your father ask you to go there?

493
00:56:28,699 --> 00:56:30,299
You wanted to go there?

494
00:56:32,139 --> 00:56:33,980
Why did you want to go there?

495
00:56:36,500 --> 00:56:38,819
Did you want to say something to him?

496
00:56:40,460 --> 00:56:42,339
I just wanted to see him.

497
00:56:43,580 --> 00:56:44,500
Why?

498
00:56:45,860 --> 00:56:49,299
- I heard that he was there.
- Where was he, until then?

499
00:56:50,699 --> 00:56:52,060
- Inside.
- Where?

500
00:56:53,860 --> 00:56:54,900
In prison.

501
00:57:00,460 --> 00:57:02,299
And did you see him at the club?

502
00:57:05,980 --> 00:57:06,900
Yes.

503
00:57:07,619 --> 00:57:09,219
And did you see the fight?

504
00:57:11,580 --> 00:57:12,659
No.

505
00:57:13,699 --> 00:57:15,900
You didn't see anybody fighting?

506
00:57:17,619 --> 00:57:21,020
Well... I did. A woman went at him,
and wanted to beat him up.

507
00:57:21,100 --> 00:57:22,179
Your father?

508
00:57:23,940 --> 00:57:24,860
Yes.

509
00:57:25,819 --> 00:57:28,420
Then did you see the fight, or didn't you?

510
00:57:30,900 --> 00:57:31,980
I saw it.

511
00:57:34,460 --> 00:57:36,819
And did you see your father fight?

512
00:57:40,299 --> 00:57:43,179
Remember, I told you,
there are no right or wrong answers.

513
00:57:43,819 --> 00:57:46,259
What matters is that you tell the truth.

514
00:57:47,619 --> 00:57:48,540
Yes...

515
00:57:51,580 --> 00:57:54,100
Did your father
strike the first blow?

516
00:58:05,339 --> 00:58:06,619
No.

517
00:58:08,900 --> 00:58:10,739
Thank you for your help.

518
00:58:11,980 --> 00:58:13,299
We are finished.

519
00:58:17,739 --> 00:58:21,460
I'm calling the medical expert.
Do you stand by your opinion?

520
00:58:21,540 --> 00:58:22,580
Yes.

521
00:58:22,659 --> 00:58:25,299
Please, in a few sentences,
summarize your expert opinion.

522
00:58:28,060 --> 00:58:30,619
Based on my examinations,
I came to the conclusion

523
00:58:31,060 --> 00:58:34,020
that as a result of strikes
from the accused's fist,

524
00:58:34,100 --> 00:58:36,779
and due to a fall to the ground
the victim sustained...

525
00:58:37,100 --> 00:58:39,900
serious injuries that resulted in
bleeding within the skull.

526
00:58:39,980 --> 00:58:44,139
The victim was only saved from death
due to prompt medical assistance.

527
00:58:44,619 --> 00:58:46,540
To this day, the victim is comatose,

528
00:58:46,619 --> 00:58:50,139
and the long-term effects of
his injury are unpredictable.

529
00:59:09,699 --> 00:59:10,699
Go inside.

530
00:59:12,139 --> 00:59:13,100
Hear me?

531
00:59:14,779 --> 00:59:15,460
Niki.

532
00:59:17,940 --> 00:59:18,940
Niki!

533
00:59:22,179 --> 00:59:23,860
You have the nerve
to show up here?

534
00:59:24,179 --> 00:59:27,619
You promised me
that you wouldn't look for her anymore.

535
00:59:28,420 --> 00:59:30,020
She came to see me.

536
00:59:30,980 --> 00:59:32,540
And I wanted to see her, too.

537
00:59:33,259 --> 00:59:36,380
What do you want?
Haven't you caused pain enough?

538
00:59:40,299 --> 00:59:41,460
I'm sorry.

539
00:59:42,259 --> 00:59:46,060
If I see you near her again,
I'll tell her what you did!

540
00:59:48,060 --> 00:59:49,540
You took her away from me...

541
00:59:53,020 --> 00:59:55,460
- I didn't mean to.
- You didn't mean to...

542
00:59:56,179 --> 00:59:59,460
You made her get into the car
while you were drunk!

543
01:00:01,299 --> 01:00:03,020
She pulled the wheel.

544
01:01:14,339 --> 01:01:15,380
What did you do?

545
01:01:23,380 --> 01:01:24,540
We were driving.

546
01:01:27,179 --> 01:01:28,100
We had a fight.

547
01:01:31,219 --> 01:01:32,980
I was being jealous again.

548
01:01:36,900 --> 01:01:38,460
I was driving too fast.

549
01:01:39,259 --> 01:01:40,860
I was really mad, and she...

550
01:01:42,659 --> 01:01:45,739
...she wanted to get out
while the car was moving.

551
01:01:49,259 --> 01:01:51,020
We crashed into the guard rail.

552
01:01:55,420 --> 01:01:57,259
I didn't want to hurt her.

553
01:01:58,299 --> 01:02:00,139
You two were my everything.

554
01:04:26,940 --> 01:04:29,020
Niki

555
01:04:42,259 --> 01:04:43,339
I don't know, I think it's math.

556
01:04:44,020 --> 01:04:45,739
- We have physics next.
- How do you know?

557
01:04:45,819 --> 01:04:47,619
We got the final schedule.

558
01:04:47,699 --> 01:04:50,739
Well, the teacher told me that
she'd send it to me, but she didn't.

559
01:04:52,020 --> 01:04:53,779
- But then what is the next class?
- I don't know.

560
01:04:53,860 --> 01:04:56,179
Something really stinks here.

561
01:05:00,020 --> 01:05:02,299
It really stinks here.

562
01:05:44,860 --> 01:05:47,299
What's going on here?
Both of you, stop it, this instant!

563
01:05:47,819 --> 01:05:49,779
Give me your report book, now!

564
01:05:57,659 --> 01:05:59,940
I'd like to see both of your parents.

565
01:06:03,339 --> 01:06:05,259
In this closed hearing,
the court has reached,

566
01:06:05,339 --> 01:06:07,500
and announces
the following verdict.

567
01:06:08,060 --> 01:06:13,420
The accused, Tibor Kondor, is guilty
of causing life threatening bodily harm.

568
01:06:14,259 --> 01:06:18,060
The court now sentences him
to spend three years in prison.

569
01:06:19,219 --> 01:06:22,380
The sentence is to be spent
in a medium-security prison.

570
01:06:28,219 --> 01:06:30,219
This fucking thing...

571
01:06:41,380 --> 01:06:42,580
Closing time!

572
01:06:45,860 --> 01:06:47,380
I'm closing up now.

573
01:06:48,420 --> 01:06:49,339
Hey.

574
01:06:50,259 --> 01:06:51,339
Wake up.

575
01:07:00,420 --> 01:07:01,739
Let me drink this one.

576
01:07:02,060 --> 01:07:03,219
Uh-huh.

577
01:07:26,259 --> 01:07:27,900
This is what I owe you, right?

578
01:07:30,540 --> 01:07:31,619
No?

579
01:07:33,380 --> 01:07:34,299
Thanks.

580
01:07:36,060 --> 01:07:37,020
You want to come in?

581
01:07:38,179 --> 01:07:39,739
Get inside! Shoo! Get in!

582
01:07:41,739 --> 01:07:43,139
Get inside!

583
01:07:44,659 --> 01:07:45,779
I'd rather not.

584
01:07:46,819 --> 01:07:48,619
When are you going inside?

585
01:07:48,699 --> 01:07:50,659
Tonight.
The lawyer called.

586
01:07:51,420 --> 01:07:52,500
I'm sorry.

587
01:08:06,259 --> 01:08:07,619
What are you lookin' at?

588
01:08:08,779 --> 01:08:09,940
No more walks.

589
01:08:17,259 --> 01:08:20,579
<i>Can you come to school now?</i>
<i>Room 8b, fourth floor.</i>

590
01:08:23,419 --> 01:08:24,419
What is it?

591
01:08:27,940 --> 01:08:29,579
Can I take the car for a ride?

592
01:08:30,259 --> 01:08:31,219
Now?

593
01:08:31,579 --> 01:08:34,740
I have to make a stop.
I'll bring it back right away.

594
01:08:48,379 --> 01:08:50,700
Did you tell them at home
about the meeting?

595
01:08:51,259 --> 01:08:53,780
- Yes.
- Then why did nobody come?

596
01:08:55,980 --> 01:08:57,660
Show me your report book.

597
01:09:10,700 --> 01:09:11,980
This isn't signed.

598
01:09:14,020 --> 01:09:16,179
This will have consequences.

599
01:09:16,259 --> 01:09:19,219
I'm going to speak
to your grandmother.

600
01:09:20,259 --> 01:09:22,539
Sorry, we'll have to
reschedule this meeting.

601
01:09:22,620 --> 01:09:26,179
I left work early today.
Karola missed sports practice.

602
01:09:26,259 --> 01:09:29,660
I see, but we can't proceed...

603
01:09:30,060 --> 01:09:33,060
I'm sorry you had to
come here for no reason.

604
01:09:36,299 --> 01:09:38,299
- Afternoon!
- Good afternoon.

605
01:09:40,299 --> 01:09:41,860
I'm Niki's father.

606
01:09:43,900 --> 01:09:46,259
You didn't tell your grandmother?

607
01:09:50,060 --> 01:09:55,339
Thank you for coming, but the fact is
that you aren't Niki's legal guardian.

608
01:09:55,419 --> 01:09:58,780
And without the legal guardian
we cannot represent Niki here.

609
01:09:59,139 --> 01:10:03,060
What legal guardian? Did I invite myself?
My daughter called me.

610
01:10:03,139 --> 01:10:05,579
Yes, I know, but you can't stay here.

611
01:10:08,660 --> 01:10:09,700
What's the issue?

612
01:10:12,419 --> 01:10:13,339
Go on.

613
01:10:13,980 --> 01:10:15,660
Tell us what you did.

614
01:10:19,100 --> 01:10:20,740
You're not proud of it, are you?

615
01:10:21,100 --> 01:10:23,259
- I had a fight.
- She attacked Karola.

616
01:10:23,339 --> 01:10:26,379
Scratched her so badly,
it left a wound on her face.

617
01:10:28,980 --> 01:10:31,379
Did anyone ask her why she did it?

618
01:10:31,459 --> 01:10:34,379
I don't think this level of aggression
is ever acceptable.

619
01:10:34,940 --> 01:10:36,980
So are they just here for decoration?

620
01:10:37,419 --> 01:10:39,179
All right, Niki...

621
01:10:39,740 --> 01:10:42,459
...would you tell us
what made you so angry?

622
01:10:43,900 --> 01:10:46,419
She smeared
dogshit on my shoes.

623
01:10:47,820 --> 01:10:49,700
- You did what?
- Is that true?

624
01:10:50,139 --> 01:10:52,579
- She got the same ones I had!
- I wanted them first!

625
01:10:52,660 --> 01:10:56,539
- Why didn't you buy them?
- You said you didn't even like them!

626
01:11:00,339 --> 01:11:02,100
Tell me something you fought for.

627
01:11:02,179 --> 01:11:05,020
Something you really wanted
and you did everything for it.

628
01:11:05,339 --> 01:11:07,339
We'll deal with this, okay?

629
01:11:09,100 --> 01:11:10,100
Nothing?

630
01:11:10,179 --> 01:11:13,139
- We came first in volleyball.
- What did you get for it?

631
01:11:13,660 --> 01:11:14,860
A medal.

632
01:11:15,419 --> 01:11:18,539
- What if I pissed on your medal?
- Leave my child alone!

633
01:11:18,620 --> 01:11:21,780
- That tone isn't necessary, OK?
- We won't resolve things like this.

634
01:11:22,499 --> 01:11:23,740
Would you be pleased?

635
01:11:24,539 --> 01:11:26,179
I'd be a real asshole,
if I did that, right?

636
01:11:26,539 --> 01:11:28,259
Niki worked fucking hard
for those shoes.

637
01:11:28,660 --> 01:11:33,060
Oh really? And so she can fight?
As if that were an excuse.

638
01:11:34,060 --> 01:11:35,339
You know what?

639
01:11:39,980 --> 01:11:41,419
Here, buy the shoes.

640
01:11:41,900 --> 01:11:45,259
But my daughter was hurt,
and this won't undo it.

641
01:11:46,900 --> 01:11:47,900
Do you want it?

642
01:11:50,179 --> 01:11:51,100
Me neither.

643
01:11:51,419 --> 01:11:54,940
It seems the only way to get even
is if I shit on your daughter's shoes.

644
01:11:55,020 --> 01:11:57,219
Let's stop, right here.
Please, leave.

645
01:11:58,860 --> 01:11:59,940
Gladly.

646
01:12:00,020 --> 01:12:01,219
Niki, are you coming?

647
01:12:37,780 --> 01:12:38,700
You have a car?

648
01:12:39,740 --> 01:12:40,660
Rad.

649
01:12:48,780 --> 01:12:50,060
Where are we going?

650
01:12:54,700 --> 01:12:56,499
Elvira lawyer

651
01:13:02,259 --> 01:13:04,499
Wanna come with me to Barcelona?

652
01:13:06,379 --> 01:13:08,299
I'd have a job there...

653
01:13:10,379 --> 01:13:13,219
What do you say?
We'll leave all these assholes behind.

654
01:13:14,499 --> 01:13:15,499
Cool.

655
01:13:17,299 --> 01:13:19,900
- But we can't take your phone with us.
- Why?

656
01:13:19,980 --> 01:13:22,419
Don't worry,
I'll buy you a better one.

657
01:13:57,179 --> 01:13:59,219
What's the beach like?
Pebbles or sand?

658
01:13:59,299 --> 01:14:01,820
- Whichever you want.
- I'd prefer pebbles.

659
01:14:01,900 --> 01:14:04,419
The water is much clearer,
and I can see my feet.

660
01:15:39,339 --> 01:15:40,259
Pump no. 4.

661
01:15:41,020 --> 01:15:42,620
5710 Forints.

662
01:15:47,660 --> 01:15:48,860
This too?

663
01:15:50,060 --> 01:15:51,139
8Yeah.

664
01:16:03,539 --> 01:16:05,179
8805 Forints.

665
01:16:10,020 --> 01:16:13,219
Fuck, I thought I had more money.
Do you have any?

666
01:16:28,020 --> 01:16:29,860
That's enough for the gas.

667
01:16:36,379 --> 01:16:39,820
- Then we won't take these.
- Just leave them here.

668
01:16:42,860 --> 01:16:44,100
Thanks.

669
01:16:50,539 --> 01:16:52,900
Yes... that's a good girl.

670
01:16:55,299 --> 01:16:56,860
We're almost done.

671
01:17:00,459 --> 01:17:01,419
All right.

672
01:17:02,459 --> 01:17:03,900
Good girl.

673
01:17:04,299 --> 01:17:05,740
You're a good girl.

674
01:17:09,539 --> 01:17:11,100
We're almost done.

675
01:17:11,499 --> 01:17:12,900
Okay.

676
01:17:13,459 --> 01:17:14,660
There you go.

677
01:17:22,700 --> 01:17:25,259
There.
Now we lift this up.

678
01:17:26,299 --> 01:17:27,219
Okay.

679
01:17:36,539 --> 01:17:38,499
It's okay now.

680
01:17:44,100 --> 01:17:45,259
Almost done.

681
01:17:47,820 --> 01:17:49,299
We're just about done.

682
01:18:07,820 --> 01:18:10,740
If all goes well,
we'll be on the beach tomorrow.

683
01:18:14,459 --> 01:18:16,940
Cool right?

684
01:18:37,139 --> 01:18:39,820
- What's wrong?
- Be quiet for a moment.

685
01:18:39,900 --> 01:18:41,419
What's going on?

686
01:19:38,940 --> 01:19:39,740
Are you hurt?

687
01:20:06,339 --> 01:20:07,459
What's wrong?

688
01:20:09,820 --> 01:20:11,740
I thought we were in trouble.

689
01:20:20,259 --> 01:20:22,139
Everything will be all right.

690
01:20:24,660 --> 01:20:26,660
Everything will be all right.

691
01:22:57,940 --> 01:22:59,219
Niki.

692
01:23:02,419 --> 01:23:03,579
Niki.

693
01:23:14,660 --> 01:23:15,940
Why have we come back?

694
01:23:17,579 --> 01:23:18,980
We're not going away?

695
01:23:20,259 --> 01:23:22,700
- You promised!
- You're expected at home.

696
01:23:22,780 --> 01:23:24,060
You promised!

697
01:23:27,379 --> 01:23:29,940
- We can't go to Barcelona right now.
- Why?

698
01:23:30,539 --> 01:23:31,780
I was convicted.

699
01:23:34,100 --> 01:23:35,940
Because of that fight you saw.

700
01:23:36,620 --> 01:23:37,980
Will you go away?

701
01:23:39,100 --> 01:23:40,060
Again?

702
01:24:04,740 --> 01:24:05,820
I'll come back.

703
01:24:09,219 --> 01:24:10,660
Now, go.

704
01:24:25,620 --> 01:24:26,780
Niki.

705
01:26:09,259 --> 01:26:10,700
- Good evening.
- Good evening.

706
01:26:10,780 --> 01:26:12,179
Evening.

707
01:26:15,620 --> 01:26:17,339
I think you're looking for me.

708
01:26:20,860 --> 01:26:22,259
Tibor Kondor.

709
01:26:24,820 --> 01:26:27,100
- Get to the front of the car.
- I'll call dispatch.

710
01:26:27,780 --> 01:26:29,419
Put your hands on the hood.

711
01:26:30,139 --> 01:26:32,780
I'm going to frisk
your clothes, understood?

712
01:26:32,860 --> 01:26:33,860
Yes.

713
01:26:33,940 --> 01:26:35,020
-What?
-I understand.

714
01:26:35,100 --> 01:26:38,780
...Tibor Kondor gave himself up.
He is currently being taken into custody.

715
01:26:44,660 --> 01:26:45,780
Hey!

716
01:26:46,339 --> 01:26:47,259
Stop!

00:00:00,291 --> 00:00:07,041
…Queen Beatrix reached the deck of the
ship with her mother Juliana, and from…

2
00:00:07,125 --> 00:00:11,625
…tonight on Vijzelstraat and Leidsestraat,

3
00:00:11,708 --> 00:00:15,541
with Leidseplein and Koningsplein
on either side.

4
00:00:15,625 --> 00:00:20,666
There has been as much damage
as was paid for the festivities.

5
00:00:20,750 --> 00:00:23,375
…pure vandalism.

6
00:00:23,458 --> 00:00:26,750
""Horrible, awful
and an unbelievable shame,""

7
00:00:26,833 --> 00:00:30,041
were the socialist politician's words.

8
00:00:30,125 --> 00:00:34,791
He felt these actions
were an attempt to cause mayhem.

9
00:00:34,875 --> 00:00:38,958
There have also been reactions
to unrest elsewhere in the country.

10
00:00:39,041 --> 00:00:44,666
NOS management believes the reports
on the event have been responsible.

11
00:00:45,833 --> 00:00:49,541
We will conclude
with the weather until tomorrow evening.

12
00:02:02,291 --> 00:02:04,958
- Yeah?
- Good afternoon.

13
00:02:05,041 --> 00:02:09,333
The owner of this building kindly
requests you to vacate the premises.

14
00:02:09,416 --> 00:02:10,416
Oh yeah?

15
00:02:12,958 --> 00:02:14,750
Where's the owner then?

16
00:02:14,833 --> 00:02:18,375
What he does with his house
is none of our business. So…

17
00:02:18,458 --> 00:02:19,833
Listen, idiot.

18
00:02:19,916 --> 00:02:23,583
If the owner wants us to leave,
he can come here and tell us himself.

19
00:02:49,708 --> 00:02:51,250
No.

20
00:03:53,958 --> 00:03:57,666
The rest of the royal family
boarded the S.S. Beatrix…

21
00:03:57,750 --> 00:03:59,416
7 DAYS UNTIL THE CORONATION

22
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:01,125
…to watch the fireworks.

23
00:04:01,208 --> 00:04:05,333
At the same time fighting and looting
took place in Amsterdam's city center

24
00:04:05,416 --> 00:04:09,041
as a result of the violent turmoil
earlier this afternoon.

25
00:04:09,125 --> 00:04:12,250
In backroom talks it was decided…

26
00:04:27,250 --> 00:04:31,541
The guy in two is barfing the whole day.
I've had it. Somebody take care of him.

27
00:04:31,625 --> 00:04:36,500
George, put Shayla in five,
and release the Chinaman in four.

28
00:04:36,583 --> 00:04:42,708
This fucking mess is driving me crazy,
people. A tidy house is a tidy mind.

29
00:04:44,250 --> 00:04:47,500
- Talk to me, honey.
- Good day. I have an appointment.

30
00:04:49,875 --> 00:04:51,333
Jurriaan DeKok.

31
00:04:52,416 --> 00:04:54,333
Keep your fucking hands to yourself.

32
00:04:54,416 --> 00:05:01,208
- It's K-O-K.
- Congratulations. With capital letters?

33
00:05:01,291 --> 00:05:03,791
For a tenner you can blow me.

34
00:05:03,875 --> 00:05:05,416
- Freek.
- Virginia.

35
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:08,458
Virginia, sit down
or I'm going to call your mother.

36
00:05:10,208 --> 00:05:13,416
He'll also do it for a fiver.
Who do you need?

37
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:15,291
Mr Montijn.

38
00:05:16,125 --> 00:05:20,000
Tonnie Montijn.
The meeting was for half past nine.

39
00:05:23,250 --> 00:05:25,750
- With Tonnie?
- That's right.

40
00:05:25,833 --> 00:05:27,791
Around the corner.

41
00:05:27,875 --> 00:05:30,500
- This way?
- He's at Lowietje.

42
00:05:34,708 --> 00:05:36,000
Nice shoes.

43
00:05:36,083 --> 00:05:39,708
The riots in the capital
lasted until the evening.

44
00:05:39,791 --> 00:05:41,333
We're closed.

45
00:05:42,625 --> 00:05:44,458
Hey idiot, you deaf?

46
00:05:45,666 --> 00:05:49,916
No, I have an appointment
with a Mr Montijn.

47
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,208
Tscheu La Ling.

48
00:05:52,291 --> 00:05:54,708
I just don't get it.

49
00:05:54,791 --> 00:05:56,916
Fucking unbelievable.

50
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:00,333
Boy oh boy.
Tscheu La fucking Ling.

51
00:06:00,416 --> 00:06:03,958
Why do we need this half ass Chinaman
when we got Vanenburg.

52
00:06:04,041 --> 00:06:07,291
- Have they lost their minds?
- You know what Ajax should do?

53
00:06:07,375 --> 00:06:09,125
- Well?
- Get Cruijff back.

54
00:06:09,208 --> 00:06:10,375
In your dreams.

55
00:06:11,875 --> 00:06:13,041
Soccer?

56
00:06:14,416 --> 00:06:16,916
- You must be with the police.
- Uh, yes.

57
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:21,958
- Lowie. Get Sherlock some coffee.
- Oh no, thank you, I'm okay.

58
00:06:22,041 --> 00:06:23,750
Did you just come from the gym?

59
00:06:28,750 --> 00:06:33,750
I just wanted to say that I'm glad
to receive this opportunity.

60
00:06:35,541 --> 00:06:40,041
- What opportunity?
- To work together.

61
00:06:40,125 --> 00:06:42,583
- Work together?
- Correct.

62
00:06:42,666 --> 00:06:47,125
I got a letter from the commissioner,
De Woerd.

63
00:06:47,208 --> 00:06:50,708
A response to my application.
He said that I am to work with you.

64
00:06:50,791 --> 00:06:51,875
Urk.

65
00:06:52,708 --> 00:06:55,666
Yes. Born and raised.

66
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,708
Do you have cash on you?

67
00:07:01,625 --> 00:07:02,958
No.

68
00:07:06,875 --> 00:07:12,125
Lesson one:
Always have money on you around here.

69
00:07:16,208 --> 00:07:18,875
- Well, I'll see you later then.
- Sorry?

70
00:07:18,958 --> 00:07:22,166
Half past nine, right?

71
00:07:22,250 --> 00:07:26,125
Half past nine in the evening, mate.
Night shift.

72
00:07:30,791 --> 00:07:32,791
You done, honey?

73
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:36,625
- You were terrific.
- Bye, darling.

74
00:07:37,916 --> 00:07:42,500
- Well, what can I do for you?
- I'm just waiting.

75
00:07:42,583 --> 00:07:47,541
What for? The tram? The only line
that runs around here is line 69.

76
00:07:48,708 --> 00:07:51,958
- Hey, early bird.
- Tonnie, you owe me a tenner.

77
00:07:52,041 --> 00:07:54,833
Get rid of your crotch crickets yet,
Rebecca?

78
00:07:54,916 --> 00:07:58,458
Screw you, limp dick.
Fuck off, asshole.

79
00:07:58,541 --> 00:08:00,750
Leave that at home.
For your own safety.

80
00:08:00,833 --> 00:08:03,541
This week two cops
have been sent to the hospital.

81
00:08:03,625 --> 00:08:07,458
And if you're with me,
everyone will know who you are.

82
00:08:07,541 --> 00:08:10,958
Hey Richard, take it easy.
I know where to find you.

83
00:08:11,041 --> 00:08:16,041
The lingo is different too. Lesson two:
A fiver is different than the Five-O.

84
00:08:16,125 --> 00:08:20,500
And a buck is different than a fuck.
You'll get the hang of it.

85
00:08:20,583 --> 00:08:22,375
- Hey, doll.
- Hot stuff.

86
00:08:22,458 --> 00:08:25,583
- By the way, do you have a house?
- Yes, I found a place.

87
00:08:25,666 --> 00:08:28,291
Great.
That seems to be a problem nowadays.

88
00:08:28,375 --> 00:08:30,875
- Whereabouts?
- On Zeedijk.

89
00:08:30,958 --> 00:08:34,333
Nice. If you want your mail
to smell like piss.

90
00:08:34,416 --> 00:08:37,333
- Wife? Girlfriend? Kids?
- Uh, no.

91
00:08:37,416 --> 00:08:39,916
- Boyfriend?
- No, nothing.

92
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:43,083
It doesn't matter to me.
Everything goes in Amsterdam.

93
00:08:43,166 --> 00:08:44,375
I am single.

94
00:08:44,458 --> 00:08:48,958
That'll save you a lot of trouble when
you get shot in the face. Here we are.

95
00:08:49,041 --> 00:08:50,250
Nell?

96
00:08:51,625 --> 00:08:53,708
Nellie?

97
00:08:53,791 --> 00:08:55,625
Nell?

98
00:08:55,708 --> 00:08:57,500
- Nellie?
- Hey, cutie.

99
00:08:57,583 --> 00:08:59,166
Hey, Tonnie.

100
00:08:59,250 --> 00:09:02,250
I'm looking for Ron.
You know where he is?

101
00:09:02,333 --> 00:09:04,875
Who's Ron?

102
00:09:04,958 --> 00:09:06,583
Really?

103
00:09:07,708 --> 00:09:10,958
Are you serious? Have it your way.

104
00:09:11,041 --> 00:09:12,583
Ron?

105
00:09:13,833 --> 00:09:15,708
Ronny?

106
00:09:19,583 --> 00:09:22,750
- Fuck off, man. I'm busy.
- Hi, Tonnie.

107
00:09:22,833 --> 00:09:24,416
- Asshole.
- Sorry.

108
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:29,291
Ton, quit it. He's upstairs.

109
00:09:29,375 --> 00:09:31,833
Now, was that so difficult?

110
00:09:35,083 --> 00:09:38,833
Urk is new, and he's happily single.

111
00:09:39,666 --> 00:09:43,083
For another one of these
you'll get a half hour with me.

112
00:09:43,166 --> 00:09:46,958
What kind of tourist rates are those?
How long have we known each other?

113
00:09:47,041 --> 00:09:50,250
- Block is my friend.
- It's DeKok.

114
00:09:52,041 --> 00:09:54,083
Often misspelled as C-O-C-K.

115
00:10:01,791 --> 00:10:03,416
Ronny?

116
00:10:10,166 --> 00:10:11,791
Ronny?

117
00:10:13,125 --> 00:10:14,416
Ron?

118
00:10:17,791 --> 00:10:19,458
Ronny?

119
00:10:22,625 --> 00:10:26,166
I've had it with this bullshit.
How am I supposed to get it up?

120
00:10:28,541 --> 00:10:30,541
Urk, give me a hand.

121
00:10:31,541 --> 00:10:32,625
Urk?

122
00:10:37,208 --> 00:10:40,291
- Don't point your gun at me, man.
- Leave me alone, faggot.

123
00:10:40,375 --> 00:10:43,416
Talk to me with some respect,
you filthy junk.

124
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:48,208
- I've already said, if he calls me…
- Shut up, Ron. I'm busy.

125
00:10:48,291 --> 00:10:50,166
Not like this.

126
00:10:50,250 --> 00:10:53,625
A drug-related crime, Urk.
Fished it right out of his pocket.

127
00:10:53,708 --> 00:10:58,666
- You planted that there.
- Get up. On your knees. Sit down.

128
00:10:58,750 --> 00:11:01,500
Keep an eye on David Bowie here,
will you.

129
00:11:02,875 --> 00:11:05,083
Let's see what he brought along.

130
00:11:09,541 --> 00:11:13,833
Look what I found here.
That's so generous. Thanks, buddy.

131
00:11:14,541 --> 00:11:17,416
Those pills are for my heart.

132
00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:21,541
- Maybe I should…
- Keep an eye on your suspect, detective.

133
00:11:28,583 --> 00:11:30,750
Goddammit.

134
00:11:36,583 --> 00:11:39,041
Hell of a first day, DeKok.

135
00:12:27,208 --> 00:12:30,250
- Sorry. Sorry.
- Go away.

136
00:12:57,583 --> 00:12:59,208
Thanks, asshole.

137
00:13:30,916 --> 00:13:33,125
You got some speed, DeKok.

138
00:13:33,208 --> 00:13:36,083
Lesson three:
Never chase trams, junkies or women.

139
00:13:36,166 --> 00:13:38,250
There'll always be a next one. Hey, Ron.

140
00:13:40,416 --> 00:13:41,958
What?

141
00:13:50,375 --> 00:13:53,250
- Let's go. Give me the keys.
- What?

142
00:13:53,333 --> 00:13:55,500
Come on, Urk, move it.
Go, go, go.

143
00:13:55,583 --> 00:13:58,958
Let's go. Let precinct Rapenburg
pull it out of the canal.

144
00:13:59,041 --> 00:14:02,541
- But I already had it called in.
- What?

145
00:14:04,125 --> 00:14:05,875
Seriously?

146
00:14:18,083 --> 00:14:24,291
- So, Tonnie. You pulled out a drunkard?
- And a squatter to boot.

147
00:14:25,041 --> 00:14:27,250
That's going to be a week of paperwork.

148
00:14:27,333 --> 00:14:32,208
- Why didn't you call precinct Rapenburg?
- That's what we would've done.

149
00:14:38,666 --> 00:14:42,291
- I didn't know you…
- It's best if you stay away from me.

150
00:14:46,125 --> 00:14:48,416
6 DAYS UNTIL THE CORONATION

151
00:14:48,500 --> 00:14:53,125
Can someone tell me why our sweet
Lord and Savior hates my fucking guts?

152
00:14:53,208 --> 00:14:58,583
I see you thinking:
""But, Chief, you're a man who has it all.

153
00:14:58,666 --> 00:15:05,125
You have a pretty face,
you're a natural leader…""

154
00:15:05,208 --> 00:15:07,041
- Humble.
- Yes, humble.

155
00:15:07,125 --> 00:15:12,541
Thanks, Van Kemenade.
So why the long face?

156
00:15:14,208 --> 00:15:18,625
Jesse Schippers. Thierry Lejeune.
Maxine de Waard.

157
00:15:18,708 --> 00:15:20,958
We know who they are.
We know where they live.

158
00:15:21,041 --> 00:15:25,041
And we know they've got something
planned on Coronation Day.

159
00:15:25,125 --> 00:15:29,583
It's our job to make sure
it doesn't turn into a goddamn disaster.

160
00:15:29,666 --> 00:15:35,916
However, I just received a call
from our wonderful mayor himself

161
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:41,458
saying we should keep our hands off
of them if we don't have any proof.

162
00:15:41,541 --> 00:15:44,083
- Ridiculous.
- Something about the constitution.

163
00:15:44,166 --> 00:15:47,208
- Oh, that old thing.
- So we're going to be busy this week.

164
00:15:47,291 --> 00:15:52,625
- I have 35 full-timers in the hospital.
- Look, the canal cops.

165
00:15:52,708 --> 00:15:57,375
And to make matters worse,
my star detective decided

166
00:15:57,458 --> 00:16:02,208
that it was a good idea
to fish a drunk pisser from the canal.

167
00:16:02,291 --> 00:16:03,791
Montijn, my office.

168
00:16:03,875 --> 00:16:07,416
Glad someone here
is still doing the hard work.

169
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:11,541
District South called saying there's
a cat in a tree, maybe you can help?

170
00:16:12,625 --> 00:16:15,791
Maybe you should go.
You haven't had pussy in while.

171
00:16:17,208 --> 00:16:19,375
He's allergic.

172
00:16:19,458 --> 00:16:21,958
No, he means pussy.

173
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:25,958
Good one.

174
00:16:29,083 --> 00:16:35,958
Fingers off of my blinds, Tonnie.
Only I can touch my blinds. Got it?

175
00:16:36,041 --> 00:16:40,166
Half my squad is in the hospital
and you pull a drunkard out of the canal.

176
00:16:40,250 --> 00:16:44,625
- We have uniformed officers for that.
- Sorry, sir, it's my fault.

177
00:16:44,708 --> 00:16:48,958
I thought ""Vigilance while they rest""
was our motto. I didn't know…

178
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,333
- Tonnie?
- Chief.

179
00:16:52,416 --> 00:16:54,375
Who is this?

180
00:16:54,458 --> 00:16:55,833
Jurriaan DeKok, sir.

181
00:16:55,916 --> 00:16:58,500
We spoke on the phone.
It's my first day.

182
00:16:58,583 --> 00:17:03,416
Well, you're off to a great start, DeKok.
How long is your trial period?

183
00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:08,500
We'll stop by the morgue, pull down
his fly, take a photo, and we're done.

184
00:17:08,583 --> 00:17:14,541
I want a short report. Don't piss away
time with the coronation coming up.

185
00:17:14,625 --> 00:17:15,750
Yes, Chief.

186
00:17:15,833 --> 00:17:19,583
What were you doing there anyway?
Don't you have anything better to do?

187
00:17:19,666 --> 00:17:23,750
We were making the rounds
when Jurre here saw him floating. Right?

188
00:17:24,708 --> 00:17:27,000
- Uh, yeah.
- You have two days.

189
00:17:27,083 --> 00:17:28,541
Understood, Chief.

190
00:17:34,208 --> 00:17:37,291
- Sorry.
- Sorry for what?

191
00:17:37,375 --> 00:17:40,333
Sorry I didn't know
we weren't supposed to…

192
00:17:40,416 --> 00:17:45,000
If it gets me away from the coronation
for two days, I'm happy.

193
00:17:46,041 --> 00:17:47,875
I almost forgot.

194
00:17:48,791 --> 00:17:55,416
- Your cut from Ron.
- Oh no, that's alright.

195
00:17:55,500 --> 00:18:00,708
- Sure? Have you seen your pay check?
- Yeah, it's fine. Really.

196
00:18:00,791 --> 00:18:04,416
Ron would've used this
to buy smack, heroin.

197
00:18:06,541 --> 00:18:10,041
You'll learn soon enough
that it's not all black and white.

198
00:18:10,125 --> 00:18:12,000
I'm hungry. Let's go.

199
00:18:14,125 --> 00:18:16,083
Or did you have other plans?

200
00:18:16,166 --> 00:18:17,791
- Ma?
- Hey, Tonnie.

201
00:18:17,875 --> 00:18:21,708
We're getting a bite to eat.
This is Jurre, my new partner.

202
00:18:23,333 --> 00:18:27,375
- Hello, ma'am. Jurre DeKok.
- Nice to meet you. Louise Montijn.

203
00:18:27,458 --> 00:18:31,750
Nice you finally brought someone along.
If it's not a good time…

204
00:18:31,833 --> 00:18:34,625
No problem.
I'll peel some extra potatoes.

205
00:18:34,708 --> 00:18:36,916
- Where's fatty?
- At school.

206
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,666
My daughter, Pien, goes to university.

207
00:18:40,416 --> 00:18:43,791
Jurre's from Urk. They only have
an elementary school over there.

208
00:18:43,875 --> 00:18:47,208
Nothing wrong with that.
I also only went to elementary school.

209
00:18:47,291 --> 00:18:50,041
Oh no, I finished college.

210
00:18:50,125 --> 00:18:53,125
He fished a corpse
out of the canal last night.

211
00:18:53,208 --> 00:18:57,000
Christ's sake. I don't want
to hear about that before dinner.

212
00:18:57,083 --> 00:19:01,208
- Hang up his jacket, will you.
- This will be the first and last time.

213
00:19:01,750 --> 00:19:04,250
- Ma?
- That's Pien.

214
00:19:05,375 --> 00:19:08,166
Good to see you, fatty.

215
00:19:09,208 --> 00:19:11,666
- Have you been smoking again?
- No, my friends.

216
00:19:11,750 --> 00:19:15,208
- I have friends, unlike you.
- Very funny. This is Jurre.

217
00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:19,500
- Hi.
- Hi.

218
00:19:20,708 --> 00:19:22,458
Jurre DeKok.

219
00:19:25,291 --> 00:19:29,708
I see this was a mistake, Ma.
We're kicking him out after dinner.

220
00:19:29,791 --> 00:19:32,541
- Here you go.
- Tonnie. Jacket.

221
00:19:35,541 --> 00:19:38,375
- Want me to hang yours up too, fatty?
- Yes.

222
00:19:38,458 --> 00:19:39,833
Cheers.

223
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:47,666
The tanks were followed by hundreds
of police and gendarmerie officers.

224
00:19:47,750 --> 00:19:48,875
Some youngsters…

225
00:19:48,958 --> 00:19:52,708
Can you please turn that off?
We have a guest.

226
00:19:52,791 --> 00:19:56,791
Tanks. Unbelievable.
It's as if the goddamn krauts are back.

227
00:19:56,875 --> 00:20:00,666
- But they are.
- I think Claus is a really nice man.

228
00:20:00,750 --> 00:20:03,583
And he seems perfect for Beatrix.

229
00:20:04,916 --> 00:20:08,166
At the university
they don't really like the royal family.

230
00:20:08,250 --> 00:20:12,458
We don't like their money, which could
be used to solve the housing shortage.

231
00:20:12,541 --> 00:20:15,041
You have a house. You live here.

232
00:20:15,125 --> 00:20:17,000
- Please.
- Yeah, we do.

233
00:20:17,083 --> 00:20:20,791
If that scum wants to live somewhere,
they should get a job.

234
00:20:20,875 --> 00:20:26,791
- What job? There are no jobs.
- Jurre has a job. And he also has a house.

235
00:20:26,875 --> 00:20:31,500
- This is lovely. Really lovely.
- Yes? Great.

236
00:20:31,583 --> 00:20:34,958
They're a bunch of filthy freeloaders.
They're fucking lazy.

237
00:20:35,041 --> 00:20:38,125
- You sound just like Dad.
- That's enough!

238
00:20:43,125 --> 00:20:45,958
Jurre, would you like some coffee?

239
00:20:46,916 --> 00:20:49,666
Oh no, let me help.

240
00:20:50,250 --> 00:20:54,083
You see. That's what they learn in Urk.
Work.

241
00:20:54,166 --> 00:20:55,958
Work.

242
00:21:00,250 --> 00:21:03,708
Jurre has a very refreshing appearance.

243
00:21:08,625 --> 00:21:11,083
- What?
- Nothing.

244
00:21:18,750 --> 00:21:20,458
I saw you.

245
00:21:21,958 --> 00:21:23,291
Good for you.

246
00:21:24,375 --> 00:21:27,833
- In the squat.
- The squat?

247
00:21:29,666 --> 00:21:32,416
Why would I be in a squat?
I have a home.

248
00:21:33,208 --> 00:21:38,000
And you? Do you have a home
with its own kitchen?

249
00:21:38,083 --> 00:21:41,125
Or do you eat with someone else
every evening?

250
00:21:43,583 --> 00:21:45,875
I'm certain it was you.

251
00:21:46,625 --> 00:21:49,208
Maybe in your dreams.

252
00:21:51,083 --> 00:21:56,458
Listen, I understand you have sympathy
for the squatters and want to help them.

253
00:21:58,583 --> 00:22:01,583
Their hard core isn't playing games.

254
00:22:01,666 --> 00:22:05,958
Thank you for your concern, officer.
I'll take it into consideration.

255
00:22:10,708 --> 00:22:13,708
Now you'll probably tell Tonnie
everything, right?

256
00:22:19,833 --> 00:22:21,416
This one's still dirty.

257
00:22:30,750 --> 00:22:32,916
5 DAYS UNTIL THE CORONATION

258
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:36,708
This guy drank a little more
than just canal water.

259
00:22:40,958 --> 00:22:45,708
Anyway, forehead wound
inflicted by a blunt object.

260
00:22:45,791 --> 00:22:50,666
Maybe a pole, or something
at the bottom of the canal.

261
00:22:50,750 --> 00:22:54,000
- That was the cause of death?
- No. He drowned.

262
00:22:54,083 --> 00:22:57,208
- Tumbled in while pissing?
- Well…

263
00:22:57,291 --> 00:22:59,416
Don't say ""well.""
Why did you say ""well""?

264
00:22:59,500 --> 00:23:02,250
With the amount of alcohol
and heroin in his system

265
00:23:02,333 --> 00:23:06,166
I doubt he could even stand upright,
let alone open his fly.

266
00:23:07,083 --> 00:23:12,333
- Maybe he had help.
- My first guess, but I'm not sure,

267
00:23:12,416 --> 00:23:15,666
is that his unconscious body
was dumped into the canal.

268
00:23:15,750 --> 00:23:19,416
- So it's murder.
- The rookie is eager.

269
00:23:19,500 --> 00:23:23,375
Listen, he fell asleep on the ledge
and rolled into the canal.

270
00:23:23,458 --> 00:23:26,708
- Happens all the time.
- Yes, but then there's also this.

271
00:23:33,541 --> 00:23:38,208
- You could've just started with this.
- Yeah, but I like to keep it exciting.

272
00:23:38,291 --> 00:23:43,500
- Rat. Maybe he was an informant.
- Not one of mine in any case.

273
00:23:43,583 --> 00:23:48,375
Since I like you guys so much,
there is also some good news.

274
00:23:48,458 --> 00:23:53,583
His pockets were empty, of course,
but they forgot to check his boots.

275
00:23:53,666 --> 00:23:58,500
Take a look at that. Thank you.
Here you go, DeKok.

276
00:23:59,625 --> 00:24:03,166
Let's roll. I can't stand the stench here.
Later, babe.

277
00:24:07,250 --> 00:24:08,666
Bye?

278
00:24:14,375 --> 00:24:19,166
""John Doe drowned in his own
state of mind."" How does that sound?

279
00:24:28,916 --> 00:24:31,000
- Tonnie?
- Yeah?

280
00:24:32,208 --> 00:24:33,708
Duivendrecht.

281
00:24:41,375 --> 00:24:43,708
Number three is ours.

282
00:25:04,291 --> 00:25:06,250
Just great.

283
00:25:07,083 --> 00:25:08,583
Christ.

284
00:25:11,625 --> 00:25:13,125
Lesson seven:

285
00:25:13,208 --> 00:25:17,208
A search warrant is only needed
when someone sees you entering.

286
00:25:17,291 --> 00:25:21,458
That's not the case now.
Can you shine the light over here?

287
00:25:26,750 --> 00:25:28,208
Here you go.

288
00:25:43,708 --> 00:25:45,583
- Jurre?
- Yeah?

289
00:25:47,583 --> 00:25:50,250
- Do me a favor.
- Sure.

290
00:25:51,875 --> 00:25:55,166
The next time you see a body
floating in the canal…

291
00:25:55,250 --> 00:25:59,041
- I'll just leave him there.
- That would be great.

292
00:26:11,250 --> 00:26:14,208
4 DAYS UNTIL THE CORONATION

293
00:26:14,291 --> 00:26:19,125
We found a floor plan of the New Church
where the coronation will take place.

294
00:26:19,208 --> 00:26:21,458
- Maybe it's fake.
- It's not.

295
00:26:21,541 --> 00:26:24,375
- I don't mean the floor plan, but…
- Wait.

296
00:26:29,541 --> 00:26:33,750
It's the same floor plan.
Upper House, Lower House,

297
00:26:33,833 --> 00:26:36,500
the president of France,
the crown prince of England.

298
00:26:36,583 --> 00:26:40,750
There are maybe a hundred people
who've been given a floor plan like this.

299
00:26:40,833 --> 00:26:44,875
- A hundred and one, apparently.
- Show me that photo again.

300
00:26:48,416 --> 00:26:50,916
- You sure you don't know him?
- No, Chief.

301
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:56,166
Goddammit. I told them to do the ceremony
at Soestdijk or in The Hague,

302
00:26:56,250 --> 00:27:00,791
but no, no, no, it has to be here,
in our neck of the woods.

303
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:05,333
- What are we going to do?
- We have four days.

304
00:27:07,458 --> 00:27:13,333
Take a forensic team with you.
If there's even one fingerprint pointing

305
00:27:13,416 --> 00:27:18,458
towards one of the squatters in charge,
I can finally lock them all up.

306
00:27:18,541 --> 00:27:21,625
Tonnie. Only the two of you.

307
00:27:22,958 --> 00:27:25,500
Gentlemen, knock yourself out.

308
00:27:44,875 --> 00:27:49,000
- You got to explain me one thing, DeKok.
- What?

309
00:27:49,083 --> 00:27:51,875
Why here? Why the Red Light District?

310
00:27:54,041 --> 00:28:00,291
I mean, you were the top of your class.
You're a good-looking guy.

311
00:28:00,375 --> 00:28:06,375
Very righteous. Maybe a bit too much.
So why did you ask to work with me?

312
00:28:06,458 --> 00:28:09,000
Oh, that.

313
00:28:09,083 --> 00:28:15,041
I wanted a challenge.
I knew that this station was the most…

314
00:28:15,125 --> 00:28:18,125
The biggest piss bucket
in the Netherlands.

315
00:28:18,208 --> 00:28:22,500
- This is two kilometers of misery.
- Something like that.

316
00:28:22,583 --> 00:28:24,791
And I…

317
00:28:24,875 --> 00:28:28,208
I really want to make a change.

318
00:28:28,291 --> 00:28:31,583
Oh God, you're one of those.

319
00:28:32,625 --> 00:28:34,958
- You know what's come to my attention?
- Well?

320
00:28:35,041 --> 00:28:38,708
Since you entered my life,
shit just keeps hitting the fan.

321
00:28:40,916 --> 00:28:42,583
Just kidding.

322
00:28:44,875 --> 00:28:47,500
Goddammit, it's a quarter past ten.

323
00:28:47,583 --> 00:28:49,083
- What?
- We're drinking.

324
00:28:49,166 --> 00:28:51,541
- Drinking?
- Yes, we're getting a drink.

325
00:28:55,291 --> 00:28:59,333
- He'll take one too.
- He still needs to pay for the last one.

326
00:28:59,416 --> 00:29:04,458
Don't be a dick. He's with me.
Just put it on my tab.

327
00:29:04,541 --> 00:29:06,208
- Your tab?
- My tab.

328
00:29:06,291 --> 00:29:09,000
You better have a good story, pal.

329
00:29:11,458 --> 00:29:16,541
We found a floor plan of the New Church
with stuff even we know nothing about.

330
00:29:16,625 --> 00:29:18,375
Who is this?

331
00:29:18,458 --> 00:29:21,583
He's one of ours.
Mees from Groningen. Okay?

332
00:29:23,916 --> 00:29:26,416
Nice to meet you. Jurre DeKok.

333
00:29:26,500 --> 00:29:29,916
It must be linked to the coronation.

334
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:34,041
And we've found a body in the canal.
Most likely a squatter.

335
00:29:34,125 --> 00:29:37,166
He had the word ""rat""
carved into his abdomen.

336
00:29:41,625 --> 00:29:45,291
- And?
- I don't know him. So he's not a squatter.

337
00:29:46,250 --> 00:29:49,208
And I also don't think
he's an undercover cop.

338
00:29:49,291 --> 00:29:51,958
Can you ask around
if they're missing anyone?

339
00:29:53,333 --> 00:29:56,750
- Sounds like a fucking shit show to me.
- Pardon me?

340
00:29:56,833 --> 00:29:59,541
I'm not asking around.
They're all paranoid.

341
00:29:59,625 --> 00:30:03,833
If I do, I'll be lying there next to him.
I don't ask. I listen.

342
00:30:03,916 --> 00:30:07,166
I'm not listening, I'm asking.

343
00:30:07,250 --> 00:30:09,458
Come on, Mees. I need info.

344
00:30:12,958 --> 00:30:15,041
Okay, listen.

345
00:30:16,500 --> 00:30:21,333
There's a meeting tonight
at Fort Keizer with the hard core.

346
00:30:21,416 --> 00:30:24,500
- Attend that meeting and we're set.
- No, I'm bartending.

347
00:30:24,583 --> 00:30:28,416
If I change my routines now,
it's going to stand out.

348
00:30:28,500 --> 00:30:32,000
- I can get someone in, though.
- Fine, I'll go.

349
00:30:32,083 --> 00:30:35,458
No. Man, even my mother knows
who you are.

350
00:30:38,708 --> 00:30:40,666
I'll take this shithead.

351
00:30:46,083 --> 00:30:48,083
I don't know if this is a good idea.

352
00:30:48,166 --> 00:30:52,000
It's best if you just get a drink
and stay at the bar.

353
00:30:52,083 --> 00:30:56,083
Most of them will drink so much
they'll spill their guts anyway.

354
00:30:56,166 --> 00:30:59,916
- And if they ask where I'm from?
- Then you're the first squatter of Urk.

355
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:03,333
- From Urk.
- Like this?

356
00:31:06,583 --> 00:31:09,625
- Yes?
- Almost there.

357
00:31:12,291 --> 00:31:15,958
- Shame on you.
- Why did you do that?

358
00:31:16,041 --> 00:31:19,333
Now you really look like a squatter.

359
00:31:19,416 --> 00:31:21,083
INOCCUPANCY
A TRAVESTY

360
00:31:33,333 --> 00:31:34,708
You'll be all right.

361
00:32:11,458 --> 00:32:13,708
- A beer.
- Coming up.

362
00:32:25,625 --> 00:32:28,125
What are you looking at?

363
00:32:30,708 --> 00:32:32,916
What the fuck are you looking at?

364
00:32:34,583 --> 00:32:36,041
I'm…

365
00:32:38,916 --> 00:32:45,041
I'm looking for a friend of mine.
Tall guy, mohawk, brown eyes.

366
00:32:46,541 --> 00:32:48,291
How did you get in here?

367
00:32:54,125 --> 00:32:58,333
Through the front door, idiot.
How about you?

368
00:32:58,416 --> 00:33:00,875
Fucking wankers.

369
00:33:08,416 --> 00:33:11,750
Is everyone having a good time?

370
00:33:12,791 --> 00:33:14,750
Thank you. Good evening.

371
00:33:14,833 --> 00:33:19,416
Also a warm welcome
to all the police who are here tonight.

372
00:33:19,500 --> 00:33:23,500
Fuck you all.

373
00:33:23,583 --> 00:33:25,333
And now some good news.

374
00:33:25,416 --> 00:33:30,375
Our radio station, the megaphone
for all squatters, has a new DJ.

375
00:33:30,458 --> 00:33:37,458
Hot of the press. She has a heart of gold,
an iron will, and an acid tongue.

376
00:33:38,500 --> 00:33:40,625
The Pien Machine.

377
00:33:45,958 --> 00:33:49,041
Hello, everyone.
Live from the Fort Keizer.

378
00:33:49,125 --> 00:33:52,708
Squatnet Radio, 95.6 FM.
Can you hear me?

379
00:33:55,000 --> 00:34:00,166
And at home, fellow comrades, who are
exploited and eaten away by the man.

380
00:34:00,250 --> 00:34:03,166
People all over the world
who are done with the scum

381
00:34:03,250 --> 00:34:08,375
who spit us and our friends out
onto the street: Can you hear me?

382
00:34:18,250 --> 00:34:22,458
And how about you,
you dirty filthy capitalist?

383
00:34:22,541 --> 00:34:28,291
You and all your friends, bankers
and politicians who think they're safe

384
00:34:28,375 --> 00:34:33,541
from a small innocent girl like me
and the fucking bricks I carry with me.

385
00:34:33,625 --> 00:34:35,583
Can you hear me?

386
00:34:37,208 --> 00:34:39,375
I hope so, for your sake.

387
00:34:39,458 --> 00:34:46,583
If not today, then tomorrow or the day
after. You shall certainly hear us roar.

388
00:34:46,666 --> 00:34:51,875
- No habitation.
- No coronation.

389
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:29,125
It has come to my attention that you're
in the market for two kilos of uncut coke.

390
00:35:29,208 --> 00:35:31,958
- Where's Marcel?
- That's right. Where's Marcel?

391
00:35:33,083 --> 00:35:36,041
- I don't know a Marcel.
- Marcel the Belgian.

392
00:35:36,125 --> 00:35:41,625
- We're supposed to do business with him.
- Oh, that Marcel. He's unable to attend.

393
00:35:41,708 --> 00:35:44,583
Fucking bullshit.
Who let this fascist pig in?

394
00:35:44,666 --> 00:35:47,166
Maybe your friend should shut it, Jesse.

395
00:35:47,250 --> 00:35:50,708
- Shut the fuck up.
- Listen, I'm just here to do business.

396
00:35:50,791 --> 00:35:54,375
You can't fight the riot police
doped up on heroin.

397
00:35:54,458 --> 00:36:00,125
You have a war to win. And I happen
to have the magic potion to do just that.

398
00:36:00,208 --> 00:36:02,291
- Do you want it or not?
- No, Jesse.

399
00:36:02,375 --> 00:36:04,375
You won't get it from Marcel.

400
00:36:07,291 --> 00:36:10,250
Finally, at least someone
is using their brains.

401
00:36:13,250 --> 00:36:17,583
Do you think I'll stand out carrying
all that cash in public like that?

402
00:36:18,583 --> 00:36:20,333
Maybe you should fetch me a bag.

403
00:36:21,666 --> 00:36:23,416
Do we have a bag?

404
00:36:28,750 --> 00:36:31,708
- Oh, hey.
- Don't ""hey"" me.

405
00:36:31,791 --> 00:36:33,791
Did Tonnie send you?

406
00:36:37,375 --> 00:36:40,791
- Pien. What the fuck is this?
- Nothing.

407
00:36:40,875 --> 00:36:44,875
- Who's that?
- This is Jurre, a friend of mine.

408
00:36:46,458 --> 00:36:49,041
- How'd you get inside?
- I let him in.

409
00:36:49,125 --> 00:36:51,625
Do I need permission for that as well?

410
00:36:55,375 --> 00:36:58,833
Can you leave us alone?
We were in the middle of something.

411
00:37:05,541 --> 00:37:09,041
Leave me alone, okay?
We don't like your kind around here.

412
00:37:14,708 --> 00:37:16,125
- Drugs?
- Coke.

413
00:37:16,208 --> 00:37:17,666
3 DAYS UNTIL THE CORONATION

414
00:37:17,750 --> 00:37:20,583
And how much coke
are we talking about?

415
00:37:20,666 --> 00:37:23,166
- Two kilos.
- Two kilos?

416
00:37:23,250 --> 00:37:26,625
And how did these squatters
get all that cash, Jurre?

417
00:37:27,708 --> 00:37:30,166
- There's a lot of them.
- Look out the window.

418
00:37:30,250 --> 00:37:33,958
This is Amsterdam.
Everyone's doing heroin.

419
00:37:34,041 --> 00:37:38,583
The only coke here are a few packages
that come in by truck from Antwerp.

420
00:37:38,666 --> 00:37:40,791
Maybe the Belgian police can help us.

421
00:37:40,875 --> 00:37:45,458
- They spoke about a Belgian, Marcel.
- I think we have better things to do.

422
00:37:45,541 --> 00:37:49,583
Jurre, feel free to contact the Belgians,
but do it fast.

423
00:37:49,666 --> 00:37:52,666
Drugs are the least of our problems.

424
00:37:52,750 --> 00:37:58,375
We have a coronation in three days
and an unidentified dead informant

425
00:37:58,458 --> 00:38:01,916
with serious indications
there's going to be an attack.

426
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:04,791
Perhaps we should focus more on that.

427
00:38:05,625 --> 00:38:10,250
- Why don't we arrest the squatters?
- Drugs are a daily problem in Amsterdam.

428
00:38:10,333 --> 00:38:13,041
In three days someone might
blow up the New Church.

429
00:38:13,125 --> 00:38:14,958
But I saw them with the coke.

430
00:38:15,041 --> 00:38:18,791
Three more days. We'll go
on your drug hunt after that, okay?

431
00:38:21,666 --> 00:38:23,750
Man, oh man.

432
00:38:27,666 --> 00:38:30,166
- You missed a spot.
- Excuse me?

433
00:38:30,250 --> 00:38:35,250
- It's still black.
- I must've washed my hair five times.

434
00:38:35,333 --> 00:38:39,458
It's crap dye. Once it's fully dried,
it'll takes weeks to wash out.

435
00:38:39,541 --> 00:38:42,375
- I think it suits him.
- He looks like a guinea pig.

436
00:38:57,375 --> 00:38:59,458
He's right, though.

437
00:38:59,541 --> 00:39:02,541
- Shame I didn't see it immediately.
- What?

438
00:39:05,291 --> 00:39:09,875
The dye is partially washed away.
Wounds on the scalp.

439
00:39:12,583 --> 00:39:15,375
The mohawk was made posthumously.

440
00:39:16,375 --> 00:39:21,333
- Who's trying to mislead us?
- Oh yeah, and who the fuck is this then?

441
00:39:25,250 --> 00:39:26,833
Marcel.

442
00:39:26,916 --> 00:39:28,916
The Belgian.

443
00:39:32,083 --> 00:39:34,083
I'm starting to like the new guy.

444
00:39:34,166 --> 00:39:37,708
If he keeps this up, I think
he'll end up on your table soon.

445
00:39:39,125 --> 00:39:41,541
Can you tell us who this is?

446
00:40:09,250 --> 00:40:11,500
And? Is it true?

447
00:40:13,083 --> 00:40:14,375
What?

448
00:40:14,458 --> 00:40:18,500
That within an hour you can get
that photo anywhere in the world.

449
00:40:20,083 --> 00:40:23,708
- Within a half an hour even.
- No way.

450
00:40:23,791 --> 00:40:28,583
- I can't bring it to Antwerp that quickly.
- Antwerp. Never been there.

451
00:40:28,666 --> 00:40:30,291
Me neither.

452
00:40:30,375 --> 00:40:32,708
Hey, Colombo. Hey, honey.

453
00:40:34,125 --> 00:40:37,375
- Explain it to me sometime.
- Sure.

454
00:40:39,541 --> 00:40:41,750
Listen, lesson eight:

455
00:40:41,833 --> 00:40:45,833
Don't dip your pen in company ink.
It never ends well. Trust me.

456
00:40:45,916 --> 00:40:50,875
Say what you like about those squatters,
but they can take a beating.

457
00:40:51,833 --> 00:40:53,750
Fucking annoying.

458
00:40:55,708 --> 00:40:59,000
You're going to put
that shirt on expenses.

459
00:40:59,083 --> 00:41:01,375
Baks. It's for you guys.

460
00:41:04,083 --> 00:41:05,708
Baks speaking.

461
00:41:07,041 --> 00:41:10,208
Thanks. Anonymous tip.

462
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:27,166
Baks.

463
00:41:29,125 --> 00:41:30,958
Well, fuck me sideways.

464
00:41:32,125 --> 00:41:36,666
- I really had to beat it out of them.
- Oh, I thought it was an anonymous tip.

465
00:41:36,750 --> 00:41:42,083
- No, it was good detective work.
- What the hell are you doing?

466
00:41:43,583 --> 00:41:46,583
- Just look at all that. Crazy.
- Fucking nut jobs.

467
00:41:54,250 --> 00:41:57,541
- Hello?
- Mertens, Antwerp Police. Jurre DeKok?

468
00:41:57,625 --> 00:41:59,666
- Speaking.
- I received your fax,

469
00:41:59,750 --> 00:42:02,666
but it's just one big blur.

470
00:42:02,750 --> 00:42:06,791
- You can't be serious.
- I can't make head or tail of it.

471
00:42:06,875 --> 00:42:09,416
- Okay, we'll come over in person.
- Today?

472
00:42:09,500 --> 00:42:10,750
- Yes.
- I'll see you.

473
00:42:10,833 --> 00:42:12,625
Bye.

474
00:42:14,708 --> 00:42:19,416
What a fucking long drive.
I hate Belgium, you know that?

475
00:42:20,958 --> 00:42:25,708
- You hate everything outside Amsterdam.
- Me? Not true.

476
00:42:25,791 --> 00:42:29,291
Anything beyond Marnixkade
feels like a day trip for me.

477
00:42:31,458 --> 00:42:34,500
- What's Pien studying anyway?
- Who, my Pien?

478
00:42:34,583 --> 00:42:36,500
- Yes.
- No idea.

479
00:42:38,333 --> 00:42:40,958
Politics or something. Why?

480
00:42:42,541 --> 00:42:43,916
No reason.

481
00:42:45,708 --> 00:42:48,291
Jurre, Pien's not for you. Understood?

482
00:42:48,375 --> 00:42:52,125
I know. Of course.
I didn't mean it like that.

483
00:42:53,041 --> 00:42:56,000
I was just curious.

484
00:42:56,083 --> 00:42:59,041
Be curious about some other girl,
but not Pien.

485
00:42:59,125 --> 00:43:02,458
We need to find you a chick,
that's what it is.

486
00:43:02,541 --> 00:43:05,375
- No, I've had enough of women lately.
- Really?

487
00:43:05,458 --> 00:43:08,291
Then we definitely
need to find you a chick.

488
00:43:09,250 --> 00:43:10,750
Nice one.

489
00:43:15,750 --> 00:43:18,666
Corneel? The Dutchies.

490
00:43:20,625 --> 00:43:22,958
- Tonnie Montijn.
- Corneel Mertens.

491
00:43:23,041 --> 00:43:26,458
- Jurre DeKok.
- Ah, yes. Well…

492
00:43:26,541 --> 00:43:29,708
Sorry we had to meet here.

493
00:43:29,791 --> 00:43:34,291
Probably the handy work of Flanders'
biggest criminal, Seppe Brunae.

494
00:43:34,375 --> 00:43:37,166
Absolutely ruthless.

495
00:43:37,250 --> 00:43:41,333
A total lack of respect or morals.

496
00:43:42,166 --> 00:43:43,791
Cocaine.

497
00:43:43,875 --> 00:43:46,666
Be warned. It's coming your way, too.

498
00:43:46,750 --> 00:43:49,833
Anyway, the reason we're here is this.

499
00:43:49,916 --> 00:43:52,625
Maybe imagine him without the mohawk.

500
00:43:52,708 --> 00:43:56,458
I don't need to. That is Marcel Pittoors.

501
00:43:57,375 --> 00:44:00,125
Married to Seppe Brunae's niece.

502
00:44:04,291 --> 00:44:06,083
And where can we find her?

503
00:44:14,541 --> 00:44:16,541
Good night.

504
00:44:16,625 --> 00:44:17,875
Evening.

505
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:21,083
Good evening.

506
00:44:22,291 --> 00:44:24,125
Two jars, please.

507
00:44:24,208 --> 00:44:26,041
Two what?

508
00:44:26,833 --> 00:44:28,041
Two beers.

509
00:44:32,125 --> 00:44:35,333
- They says ""pints"" here.
- Pints… Fuck off.

510
00:44:36,250 --> 00:44:38,625
I prefer Café Lowietje, right?

511
00:44:40,125 --> 00:44:41,791
Thank you kindly.

512
00:44:50,208 --> 00:44:52,041
Excuse me.

513
00:44:53,250 --> 00:44:56,291
We're looking for Marcel Pittoors.

514
00:44:57,791 --> 00:44:59,500
Don't know him.

515
00:45:01,250 --> 00:45:04,666
We understood he was a friend of yours.

516
00:45:07,791 --> 00:45:09,958
I don't know any Marcel.

517
00:45:12,208 --> 00:45:15,125
And we're about to close.
That's 40 francs, please.

518
00:45:15,208 --> 00:45:16,958
- Sorry?
- Can't we finish our…

519
00:45:17,041 --> 00:45:19,625
I'm not asking again.

520
00:45:19,708 --> 00:45:21,250
Why are we leaving?

521
00:45:23,708 --> 00:45:25,625
How do you think it went?

522
00:45:29,541 --> 00:45:31,250
Marcel is dead.

523
00:45:32,708 --> 00:45:34,250
What?

524
00:45:35,333 --> 00:45:39,083
They found his body in a canal,
all blue and bloated.

525
00:45:39,166 --> 00:45:41,666
- He's lying.
- Unfortunately not.

526
00:45:41,750 --> 00:45:45,166
He'd been in the water for a week
so the rats got to him, too.

527
00:45:45,250 --> 00:45:48,375
Right, DeKok?
His dick was hanging by a tiny thread.

528
00:45:48,458 --> 00:45:51,000
Fortunately you didn't know him.

529
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:53,666
Is this really necessary?

530
00:45:53,750 --> 00:45:56,750
- Let's go inside.
- Sometimes you have to push a little.

531
00:45:58,833 --> 00:46:03,416
He was sent ahead to Amsterdam.

532
00:46:05,875 --> 00:46:10,666
Normally he would sell
half a kilo a week,

533
00:46:10,750 --> 00:46:16,250
but Seppe wanted to find a new buyer.
For two kilos.

534
00:46:17,333 --> 00:46:20,375
- And then another 50.
- 50 kilos?

535
00:46:21,833 --> 00:46:24,750
- To whom?
- Those squatters.

536
00:46:27,125 --> 00:46:29,166
Do you have any names for us?

537
00:46:31,291 --> 00:46:35,500
- I'm really sorry. Thanks anyway.
- Wait a moment.

538
00:46:36,916 --> 00:46:39,416
Who was the previous buyer?

539
00:46:40,458 --> 00:46:42,375
Bob.

540
00:46:42,458 --> 00:46:47,750
- Bob who?
- Bob… I don't know. Oh, Seppe.

541
00:46:50,416 --> 00:46:52,833
Good evening.

542
00:46:52,916 --> 00:46:57,000
- Good evening.
- And who are the pretty ladies?

543
00:46:57,083 --> 00:46:59,958
- None of your fucking business.
- Ay.

544
00:47:04,333 --> 00:47:07,333
I only hope you weren't sent here
by Bob Donkers.

545
00:47:21,833 --> 00:47:23,708
And what if we were?

546
00:47:30,625 --> 00:47:32,833
What if we were?

547
00:47:37,583 --> 00:47:41,166
Wow.
You're a long way from home, aren't you?

548
00:47:45,291 --> 00:47:48,708
Kitty, my guys are thirsty.

549
00:47:53,041 --> 00:47:54,791
Let's go.

550
00:48:06,666 --> 00:48:09,541
- Who were those guys?
- Marcel is dead.

551
00:48:09,625 --> 00:48:13,666
- Come again?
- Marcel is dead.

552
00:48:15,166 --> 00:48:17,416
Who's Bob Donkers?

553
00:48:18,375 --> 00:48:22,875
What is it you want to hear?
What is it you want to hear, Jurre?

554
00:48:22,958 --> 00:48:28,500
That you were right about Marcel
and the drugs? Well done, well done.

555
00:48:28,583 --> 00:48:32,166
You did a great job, alright?
Now we know who the guy is.

556
00:48:32,250 --> 00:48:36,333
Our two days are up. Done. Finished.

557
00:48:36,416 --> 00:48:40,000
- Then what do you suggest?
- I suggest we warn the chief.

558
00:48:41,250 --> 00:48:42,708
Okay.

559
00:48:46,458 --> 00:48:48,416
Who is Bob Donkers?

560
00:48:50,333 --> 00:48:53,291
2 DAYS UNTIL THE CORONATION

561
00:48:59,125 --> 00:49:02,541
Hi, Barrie.
Still paying off your debts?

562
00:49:02,625 --> 00:49:04,208
Old habits, you know?

563
00:49:04,291 --> 00:49:07,291
- I need new shoes.
- Sure, for your new boyfriend?

564
00:49:07,375 --> 00:49:10,166
No, for your mother. Alright?

565
00:49:10,250 --> 00:49:12,958
Barrie, don't be a dick.
Let the boys in.

566
00:49:13,666 --> 00:49:16,333
Heavy security. For a shoe store.

567
00:49:18,291 --> 00:49:19,541
Hello.

568
00:49:19,625 --> 00:49:22,708
He needs to live up to his name,
Barrie Kade.

569
00:49:22,791 --> 00:49:25,333
- Take a seat, madam.
- Thank you.

570
00:49:25,416 --> 00:49:28,750
I don't know you.
I'm Bob Donkers, nice to meet you.

571
00:49:29,541 --> 00:49:31,125
Jurre DeKok.

572
00:49:31,208 --> 00:49:34,458
Support soles
for the friendly neighborhood cop?

573
00:49:34,541 --> 00:49:36,208
Funny.

574
00:49:37,250 --> 00:49:41,958
- What do you think, Mrs Van Dijk?
- I think they're quite handsome.

575
00:49:42,041 --> 00:49:45,708
I couldn't agree more.
Put your foot up here.

576
00:49:50,458 --> 00:49:52,083
Lift it up a little bit.

577
00:49:55,500 --> 00:49:57,125
Well…

578
00:49:59,708 --> 00:50:01,583
Go ahead.

579
00:50:01,666 --> 00:50:05,750
We're here to ask some questions
about Marcel Pittoors.

580
00:50:06,833 --> 00:50:09,666
Did you hear that Fat Nelis died?

581
00:50:10,500 --> 00:50:13,000
The guy with no teeth? That's rough.

582
00:50:13,083 --> 00:50:16,250
He was a moonlighter on Kinkerstraat.
Toothless Fat Nelis.

583
00:50:16,333 --> 00:50:19,166
- Ton and I grew up together.
- Do you have to tell this story?

584
00:50:19,250 --> 00:50:24,250
It's a good story. I used to fuck around
with my mates on Kinkerstraat.

585
00:50:24,333 --> 00:50:27,708
Nasty little fuckers, we were.
Not Ton, though.

586
00:50:27,791 --> 00:50:31,625
Ton's dad used to smack him about
and he wanted to join the police.

587
00:50:31,708 --> 00:50:35,666
Right, Ton?
But anyway, Fat Nelis approaches us

588
00:50:35,750 --> 00:50:38,708
and he says to us:

589
00:50:43,125 --> 00:50:45,916
""What?"" He had no teeth,
so I couldn't understand him.

590
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:49,791
He says: ""I'll pay you 12 grand
if you kill my wife.""

591
00:50:49,875 --> 00:50:54,708
But what does this fucking idiot do?
He gives us the money up front.

592
00:50:54,791 --> 00:50:57,833
All of it. In one go.

593
00:50:57,916 --> 00:51:00,541
Now, you guess what we did next.

594
00:51:01,208 --> 00:51:04,833
- You kept the money.
- No, of course not!

595
00:51:04,916 --> 00:51:08,041
What kind of cop are you?
We called the police.

596
00:51:08,125 --> 00:51:10,416
Who is Marcel Pittoors?

597
00:51:14,666 --> 00:51:18,500
We found him dead in a canal last week.

598
00:51:20,416 --> 00:51:25,083
He was on his way here
to deliver two kilos of coke.

599
00:51:25,166 --> 00:51:28,166
Put your foot on here, madam.

600
00:51:28,250 --> 00:51:30,375
Okay, well…

601
00:51:30,458 --> 00:51:32,791
Ask your question.

602
00:51:32,875 --> 00:51:36,333
We want to know if the Belgians
tried to cut you out.

603
00:51:38,750 --> 00:51:41,125
It's Jurre, right?

604
00:51:42,083 --> 00:51:43,250
Yes.

605
00:51:43,333 --> 00:51:48,583
I'm sorry, Jurre, I have absolutely
no idea what you're talking about.

606
00:51:48,666 --> 00:51:51,083
I'm an orthopedist.
I own a few buildings.

607
00:51:51,166 --> 00:51:54,750
Which is tough nowadays because
you guys can't control the squatters.

608
00:51:54,833 --> 00:51:58,000
But, hey, who am I to tell you
how to do your job?

609
00:51:58,083 --> 00:52:01,625
I'm sure you have the situation
under control. Right, Ton?

610
00:52:01,708 --> 00:52:04,458
- Absolutely, Bob.
- Yeah.

611
00:52:05,916 --> 00:52:11,291
The other foot please, Mrs Van Dijk.
That's right, very good.

612
00:52:11,375 --> 00:52:14,208
Come on. Let's go.

613
00:52:18,166 --> 00:52:22,000
- What happened to the woman?
- Fat Nelis' old lady?

614
00:52:22,083 --> 00:52:23,541
Yes.

615
00:52:24,458 --> 00:52:27,166
They found her in the bathtub,
cut to pieces.

616
00:52:27,250 --> 00:52:29,375
Let's go, we're done here.

617
00:52:29,458 --> 00:52:31,708
Could you stand up for a moment?

618
00:52:32,958 --> 00:52:35,500
Yes, I'm not quite sure.

619
00:52:37,333 --> 00:52:40,000
- Sorry, guys. Hey, Barrie.
- Hey, sport.

620
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:45,666
Hey, where were you? You can't
keep the chief waiting like that.

621
00:52:45,750 --> 00:52:47,750
Calm down, darling.

622
00:52:47,833 --> 00:52:49,833
Look, unbelievable.

623
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:53,583
Boys, come in. Sit down.

624
00:52:53,666 --> 00:53:00,166
So, Tonnie. The squatter in the canal.
Any progress?

625
00:53:00,250 --> 00:53:04,625
Unfortunately not, Chief. We don't know
jack about the New Church, either.

626
00:53:04,708 --> 00:53:08,041
- We hit a dead end in Belgium, too.
- Excuse me, Chief.

627
00:53:08,125 --> 00:53:11,250
I think we found
some major leads in Belgium.

628
00:53:11,333 --> 00:53:16,000
Plus, we just spoke to Bob Donkers.
And I strongly feel we're being misled.

629
00:53:16,083 --> 00:53:19,208
- I would…
- Sure, but I need to prioritize things.

630
00:53:19,291 --> 00:53:24,875
Is Belgium a threat to the coronation?
No. Belgium is all about drugs.

631
00:53:24,958 --> 00:53:30,833
That Semtex that was found in the squat
clearly indicates that there are plans

632
00:53:30,916 --> 00:53:34,541
to blow up our royal family.

633
00:53:40,208 --> 00:53:42,875
I spoke to the mayor.

634
00:53:42,958 --> 00:53:46,666
He's very sensitive about Amsterdam's
reputation as a tolerant city.

635
00:53:46,750 --> 00:53:49,750
Where everyone has a right
to demonstrate.

636
00:53:50,500 --> 00:53:54,708
But if you think
the coronation is in danger,

637
00:53:54,791 --> 00:53:59,125
then we can talk
about additional, temporary…

638
00:54:00,250 --> 00:54:01,875
measures.

639
00:54:05,416 --> 00:54:08,250
- Do we have a problem, Jurre?
- What are you doing?

640
00:54:08,333 --> 00:54:12,541
Me? Listen, I know it's all new
and exciting in the big city for you,

641
00:54:12,625 --> 00:54:16,666
but the coronation is in two days.
Do you have any idea what's going down?

642
00:54:16,750 --> 00:54:18,333
- No.
- That's what I mean.

643
00:54:18,416 --> 00:54:22,041
It's not our job. This shit is above us.
Above our pay grades.

644
00:54:22,125 --> 00:54:26,083
- ""Vigilance while they rest.""
- Let it go, will you?

645
00:54:26,166 --> 00:54:29,916
- Are you even paying attention?
- What do you mean?

646
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:33,958
Let's get one thing straight. If all hell
breaks loose with those squatters,

647
00:54:34,041 --> 00:54:36,500
I rely on you to have my back.

648
00:54:39,333 --> 00:54:42,125
Children, can I have your attention?

649
00:54:42,208 --> 00:54:48,208
The mayor has given us a green light
to handle things a little differently.

650
00:54:48,291 --> 00:54:52,333
It's time to tighten the thumb screws.

651
00:54:53,333 --> 00:55:00,041
So if one out of every four squatters
accidentally walks into a baton,

652
00:55:00,125 --> 00:55:03,291
you won't hear any complaints from me.

653
00:55:03,375 --> 00:55:08,041
We will surely get in trouble for that,
but that will be after the coronation.

654
00:55:08,125 --> 00:55:13,041
The plan is to raid all the smaller squats
simultaneously today.

655
00:55:13,125 --> 00:55:18,916
And early tomorrow morning
we will storm the squatters' HQ,

656
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:23,416
culminating in a raid on Fort Keizer.
Thank you.

657
00:55:26,333 --> 00:55:28,083
Montijn speaking.
It's Jurre.

658
00:55:28,166 --> 00:55:31,125
Oh, hi, Jurre. How nice.
But Tonnie's not in.

659
00:55:31,208 --> 00:55:34,083
I'm not calling for Tonnie,
I'm calling for Pien.

660
00:55:34,166 --> 00:55:35,916
- Pien?
- Yes.

661
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:41,458
She's at the university. No wait, she said
she was going to sleep over somewhere.

662
00:55:41,541 --> 00:55:46,500
- What's wrong?
- No, it's nothing. Bye.

663
00:55:46,583 --> 00:55:48,625
Oh, okay. Bye.

664
00:55:58,458 --> 00:56:01,750
- Pien. Where's Pien?
- Over there.

665
00:56:04,791 --> 00:56:06,250
Hold this.

666
00:56:07,041 --> 00:56:09,083
- I need bandages!
- Pien.

667
00:56:10,166 --> 00:56:13,666
- What the fuck are you doing here?
- I've come to warn you.

668
00:56:13,750 --> 00:56:17,125
- They'll kill you if they see you.
- You have to get out.

669
00:56:17,208 --> 00:56:18,791
Pien.

670
00:56:18,875 --> 00:56:20,500
Go home.

671
00:56:21,291 --> 00:56:25,250
- What happened?
- The police are going nuts.

672
00:56:25,333 --> 00:56:27,583
Thierry! He's not responding.

673
00:56:29,250 --> 00:56:32,125
- Fuck!
- He's bleeding too heavily.

674
00:56:32,208 --> 00:56:33,541
Move aside!

675
00:56:34,958 --> 00:56:37,750
- He's losing too much blood.
- Has anyone got any coins?

676
00:56:37,833 --> 00:56:39,875
He's not responding. Thierry!

677
00:56:48,250 --> 00:56:50,666
- Coins.
- Jesse.

678
00:56:50,750 --> 00:56:53,291
- Coins.
- Yes, here.

679
00:56:56,125 --> 00:56:59,208
Hold his chin up. At right-angles.

680
00:56:59,291 --> 00:57:01,666
- Thierry!
- Mouth-to-mouth.

681
00:57:01,750 --> 00:57:03,333
Pinch his nose.

682
00:57:04,583 --> 00:57:06,583
Okay, out of the way, move!

683
00:57:09,375 --> 00:57:11,208
Do it again.

684
00:57:11,291 --> 00:57:14,208
I can't feel a thing. No pulse, nothing.

685
00:57:14,291 --> 00:57:16,666
Call an ambulance! Move!

686
00:57:24,416 --> 00:57:28,708
Get off him. Breathe.
Keep his mouth open. Head straight.

687
00:57:46,208 --> 00:57:53,125
Amsterdam is preparing for
Queen Beatrix's inauguration ceremony.

688
00:57:53,208 --> 00:57:59,041
The first guests arrived yesterday.
Today, the royal guests will arrive.

689
00:58:00,333 --> 00:58:05,500
Prince Charles, the British crown prince
and most important guest arrived…

690
00:58:05,583 --> 00:58:06,958
Jesse?

691
00:58:07,750 --> 00:58:10,291
- Is Thierry okay?
- Thierry is alive.

692
00:58:10,375 --> 00:58:11,833
- And you?
- Me too.

693
00:58:16,958 --> 00:58:21,750
- What the fuck is that pig doing here?
- He saved Thierry's life.

694
00:58:21,833 --> 00:58:25,500
- I don't give a shit. Fuck off, you pig.
- Calm down.

695
00:58:25,583 --> 00:58:27,333
Knock it off.

696
00:58:35,583 --> 00:58:39,541
Right now there are riots
between protesters and the police.

697
00:58:39,625 --> 00:58:42,375
- You need to get out of here.
- No, I'm not leaving.

698
00:58:42,458 --> 00:58:47,250
It'll only get worse. Tomorrow, there
will be 1,000 riot police on the doorstep.

699
00:58:48,291 --> 00:58:51,250
And what about these people
and the children?

700
00:58:51,333 --> 00:58:54,583
- I don't know.
- Where will they all live?

701
00:58:54,666 --> 00:58:58,083
I don't know.
Somewhere where there are homes.

702
00:58:58,166 --> 00:59:02,291
Outside the city?
Tucked away in the Bijlmer somewhere?

703
00:59:02,375 --> 00:59:07,083
- Is the city only for the rich?
- No. Well…

704
00:59:09,083 --> 00:59:10,291
No.

705
00:59:10,375 --> 00:59:15,375
If all these people decided
to move to Urk tomorrow,

706
00:59:15,458 --> 00:59:18,833
and the rent goes up by 500 per cent,
overnight,

707
00:59:18,916 --> 00:59:22,041
- will you all leave?
- I understand it's hard.

708
00:59:22,125 --> 00:59:25,333
But I just don't believe
violence is the solution.

709
00:59:26,291 --> 00:59:30,333
Tell your boss that. You were saying
something about 1,000 riot police.

710
00:59:30,416 --> 00:59:33,375
The police are only trying
to keep it livable.

711
00:59:33,458 --> 00:59:37,333
- Livable? Don't you have eyes?
- Don't you?

712
00:59:40,708 --> 00:59:44,458
Why are you being so difficult?
I'm just trying to help.

713
00:59:44,541 --> 00:59:46,083
I know.

714
00:59:47,125 --> 00:59:48,583
Honestly, Jurre.

715
00:59:49,875 --> 00:59:51,250
Thank you.

716
00:59:52,166 --> 00:59:55,083
Is there anyone more noble
in this world than you?

717
00:59:56,916 --> 01:00:01,083
- Is that how you want to play it?
- Yes, or else?

718
01:00:01,166 --> 01:00:02,666
You're off again?

719
01:00:05,125 --> 01:00:09,333
Fine. I'll see you
and your 1,000 friends tomorrow.

720
01:00:47,833 --> 01:00:49,416
Where did you learn that?

721
01:00:51,208 --> 01:00:52,291
What?

722
01:00:54,166 --> 01:00:55,916
How to do CPR.

723
01:00:58,833 --> 01:01:00,083
At sea.

724
01:01:03,708 --> 01:01:07,041
And now the Red Light District?

725
01:01:14,250 --> 01:01:17,250
I wanted to work somewhere
where I could really help people.

726
01:01:20,500 --> 01:01:24,375
Oh, Lord. You're one of those.

727
01:01:27,041 --> 01:01:31,208
- Your brother said exactly the same.
- Tonnie is a relic.

728
01:01:32,708 --> 01:01:38,000
He still thinks this is the sixties
and they're all petty criminals.

729
01:01:39,583 --> 01:01:45,125
If my mother hadn't made him go to school,
he'd have ended up just like his friends.

730
01:01:47,500 --> 01:01:49,250
What friends?

731
01:01:50,958 --> 01:01:55,541
People like Buffoon,
Shoeshine Bob, Steel Jan.

732
01:01:57,875 --> 01:01:59,666
Bob Donkers?

733
01:02:04,333 --> 01:02:05,916
Were they friends?

734
01:02:06,833 --> 01:02:09,458
Yes, very close.

735
01:02:10,708 --> 01:02:12,500
They still are.

736
01:02:31,333 --> 01:02:34,958
Please make sure
you're out of here on time tomorrow.

737
01:02:36,583 --> 01:02:38,125
Fine, Jurre.

738
01:02:39,916 --> 01:02:43,500
AMSTERDAM, 29 APRIL 1980
ONE DAY UNTIL THE CORONATION

739
01:02:48,916 --> 01:02:52,916
Alright, the plan is clear.
The batons go in first, then you.

740
01:02:53,000 --> 01:02:56,458
We arrest all of them,
but we want those three in particular.

741
01:02:56,541 --> 01:02:58,333
This is the police.

742
01:02:58,416 --> 01:03:03,833
Please come outside
or we will resort to action.

743
01:03:29,875 --> 01:03:31,666
No, no, no.

744
01:03:33,083 --> 01:03:34,250
Pien?

745
01:03:41,500 --> 01:03:42,875
Hello?

746
01:03:53,625 --> 01:03:54,833
No.

747
01:03:56,500 --> 01:03:58,791
Stop.

748
01:04:00,125 --> 01:04:01,291
Stop.

749
01:04:03,750 --> 01:04:05,916
Let me through.

750
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:08,208
Let him through, leave him alone.

751
01:04:10,416 --> 01:04:14,416
They've all left, there is nobody there.
They have all jumped ship.

752
01:04:14,500 --> 01:04:18,416
- What?
- Somebody ratted. There's no one inside.

753
01:04:37,750 --> 01:04:39,291
Oh, my God.

754
01:04:50,958 --> 01:04:55,500
- How the fuck did they know?
- They left last night. I don't know.

755
01:04:58,000 --> 01:05:00,166
- Where were you?
- Nice timing, Jurre.

756
01:05:00,250 --> 01:05:03,458
- We waited for you.
- Is there something I should know?

757
01:05:08,791 --> 01:05:11,291
Shut the fuck up, all of you.

758
01:05:11,375 --> 01:05:14,958
- Repeat. Over.
- Back-up needed on Rapenburg.

759
01:05:15,041 --> 01:05:17,916
To Rapenburg. Move it.

760
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:19,791
Oh, fuck off.

761
01:05:29,833 --> 01:05:32,208
How did you get that blood
on your shirt?

762
01:05:36,083 --> 01:05:37,666
Bob is quite something.

763
01:05:38,500 --> 01:05:40,708
I didn't know you were such good friends.

764
01:05:51,083 --> 01:05:54,958
Don't get in the way out there
or you might get hit with a nightstick.

765
01:06:13,416 --> 01:06:14,791
Stand your ground.

766
01:06:16,083 --> 01:06:17,916
Don't break formation.

767
01:06:26,708 --> 01:06:28,333
Molotov.

768
01:06:31,375 --> 01:06:32,875
Stay close together.

769
01:06:34,041 --> 01:06:36,000
Maintain formation.

770
01:06:36,083 --> 01:06:37,833
Keep walking.

771
01:06:39,166 --> 01:06:41,416
There's still someone in the van.

772
01:06:49,833 --> 01:06:52,291
- We have to.
- Let's go.

773
01:06:56,916 --> 01:06:59,375
Move it!
There's somebody in here.

774
01:07:10,291 --> 01:07:13,208
- Open it, goddammit.
- It's jammed.

775
01:07:16,541 --> 01:07:18,625
The side door.

776
01:07:20,208 --> 01:07:22,000
Here, man.

777
01:07:22,083 --> 01:07:23,291
You okay?

778
01:07:46,250 --> 01:07:47,250
You okay?

779
01:07:59,041 --> 01:08:00,208
We have to get out.

780
01:08:00,291 --> 01:08:04,416
We have to get out.
Can you hear me?

781
01:08:04,500 --> 01:08:06,291
- Help me.
- Again.

782
01:08:19,000 --> 01:08:20,500
Hold it open.

783
01:08:27,541 --> 01:08:28,833
Pien.

784
01:08:34,833 --> 01:08:37,416
I saw Pien. I saw my sister.

785
01:08:37,500 --> 01:08:39,000
Quick, get out of here.

786
01:08:40,416 --> 01:08:41,833
Hold this.

787
01:08:43,500 --> 01:08:44,833
Pien!

788
01:08:54,750 --> 01:08:56,708
Wait.

789
01:08:59,458 --> 01:09:01,041
Come here.

790
01:09:03,083 --> 01:09:04,666
This way.

791
01:09:13,041 --> 01:09:14,750
Fucking traitor.

792
01:09:20,125 --> 01:09:23,666
Pien! No!

793
01:10:02,875 --> 01:10:06,583
No, stay with me. Ambulance!

794
01:10:08,583 --> 01:10:11,416
Ambulance!

795
01:10:29,125 --> 01:10:33,708
That's enough, sit down.
Go and argue somewhere else. Sit down.

796
01:10:33,791 --> 01:10:35,583
- Listen to me.
- Jurre, please.

797
01:10:35,666 --> 01:10:36,791
Tonnie.

798
01:10:40,291 --> 01:10:43,583
- I have to…
- This is about my sister.

799
01:10:46,208 --> 01:10:48,958
- Can you hold on to this for me?
- Sure.

800
01:10:51,791 --> 01:10:53,708
Well, look who's here.

801
01:11:06,583 --> 01:11:10,500
Every hand you lay on me
means a day less in jail for me.

802
01:11:19,041 --> 01:11:23,000
- What was she doing there?
- Who are you talking about?

803
01:11:24,708 --> 01:11:29,625
- You know exactly who I mean.
- Oh, Pien?

804
01:11:29,708 --> 01:11:33,375
Our warrior in fishnet tights.

805
01:11:33,458 --> 01:11:36,875
- She couldn't stay away.
- A dirty whore is who you are.

806
01:11:38,208 --> 01:11:39,291
How is she?

807
01:11:42,875 --> 01:11:46,625
- He's going to beat her to death.
- I hope he does.

808
01:11:50,125 --> 01:11:52,000
Take it easy, cowboy.

809
01:11:53,625 --> 01:11:56,000
Do you always treat the ladies
like this?

810
01:11:58,708 --> 01:12:00,333
Does it give you a boner?

811
01:12:14,583 --> 01:12:18,000
I'm sorry we had to hurt her a bit.

812
01:12:19,416 --> 01:12:20,958
What did you say?

813
01:12:22,541 --> 01:12:27,416
Oh, man.
You wouldn't accept it if one…

814
01:12:28,958 --> 01:12:32,541
if one of my men was fucking your wife.

815
01:12:38,125 --> 01:12:41,000
That kind of behavior
gets in the way of the cause.

816
01:12:44,208 --> 01:12:50,416
No matter how well she conveyed
her idealism, she was fucking the enemy.

817
01:12:50,500 --> 01:12:54,041
And that makes her a dirty kraut whore.

818
01:13:06,708 --> 01:13:08,208
I was actually impressed…

819
01:13:10,250 --> 01:13:12,041
by your tolerance.

820
01:13:13,500 --> 01:13:16,791
- What's that?
- That you let him have his way with her.

821
01:13:16,875 --> 01:13:19,875
- With your little sister.
- Sorry?

822
01:13:22,083 --> 01:13:28,041
We could evacuate the Keizer squat on time
and leave you a beautiful surprise behind

823
01:13:28,125 --> 01:13:33,000
because he had to follow his dick
and stick it into your sister.

824
01:13:33,083 --> 01:13:36,833
- What did you say?
- Then again, with a name like that.

825
01:13:38,000 --> 01:13:40,791
A name like that says it all, really.

826
01:13:41,416 --> 01:13:44,875
Man, what is his name again?

827
01:13:45,541 --> 01:13:47,958
What's his name again?

828
01:13:49,791 --> 01:13:52,041
- Goddam…
- DeKok.

829
01:13:54,958 --> 01:13:56,500
- Tonnie…
- Fuck off.

830
01:14:34,625 --> 01:14:36,333
Thank you, Baks.

831
01:14:43,083 --> 01:14:44,458
Chief.

832
01:14:52,583 --> 01:14:55,958
I wanted to warn Pien, that's all.

833
01:14:56,041 --> 01:14:59,125
And she immediately told her friends.

834
01:14:59,208 --> 01:15:03,708
- I don't believe that.
- What you believe doesn't matter, DeKok.

835
01:15:03,791 --> 01:15:07,125
Six of my men are hospitalized
thanks to your actions.

836
01:15:07,208 --> 01:15:11,416
You've only been here a week.
I doubt you'll last another.

837
01:15:15,083 --> 01:15:19,666
Chief, Tonnie and Bob Donkers
are childhood friends.

838
01:15:20,708 --> 01:15:25,333
I'm convinced that Bob Donkers
had a Flemish drug dealer killed

839
01:15:25,416 --> 01:15:28,625
and dumped as a squatter in a canal.

840
01:15:28,708 --> 01:15:30,958
And the evidence for this is what?

841
01:15:33,625 --> 01:15:35,291
There is no evidence.

842
01:15:39,458 --> 01:15:41,791
- We found something in the Vondel Church.
- What?

843
01:15:41,875 --> 01:15:46,083
- Three empty sniper rifle cases.
- Look, DeKok, hard evidence.

844
01:15:46,166 --> 01:15:48,750
You're lucky I need everyone I can get.

845
01:15:48,833 --> 01:15:52,125
You'll be providing security tomorrow
at the coronation.

846
01:15:52,208 --> 01:15:56,708
Every police officer will be
within a 200-meter radius

847
01:15:56,791 --> 01:15:58,750
to protect our new queen.

848
01:15:59,708 --> 01:16:04,875
And if Bob Donkers or whoever
wants to sell a kilo of coke tomorrow,

849
01:16:04,958 --> 01:16:07,958
we will deal with it
the day after tomorrow.

850
01:16:08,041 --> 01:16:10,458
Is that clear, DeKok?

851
01:16:10,541 --> 01:16:11,916
Unacceptable.

852
01:16:12,000 --> 01:16:17,041
Mayor Polak said that a major police
intervention at the squat

853
01:16:17,125 --> 01:16:21,833
can be avoided if the squatters
are prepared to negotiate.

854
01:16:21,916 --> 01:16:24,375
But the chances of that are small.

855
01:16:25,875 --> 01:16:28,958
HOSPITAL

856
01:16:50,000 --> 01:16:53,041
AMSTERDAM, 30 APRIL 1980
CORONATION DAY

857
01:17:00,833 --> 01:17:01,873
NO HABITATION
NO CORONATION

858
01:17:20,166 --> 01:17:24,166
Practically all the prominent guests
are staying in the Amstel Hotel,

859
01:17:24,250 --> 01:17:26,666
which is heavily guarded.

860
01:17:26,750 --> 01:17:31,375
All these measures are in place to ensure
a smooth coronation on the Dam.

861
01:17:31,458 --> 01:17:36,416
Before the visitors enter the church,
they'll pass through metal detectors

862
01:17:36,500 --> 01:17:39,500
provided by Schiphol Airport.

863
01:17:39,583 --> 01:17:44,791
Let's go to our reporter Hugo van Rijn
for an update on the current situation.

864
01:17:44,875 --> 01:17:51,125
Fences have been placed
and the police are stopping all traffic.

865
01:17:51,208 --> 01:17:53,791
Only cyclists and public transport…

866
01:17:56,666 --> 01:17:59,541
Okay, today is the big day.

867
01:17:59,625 --> 01:18:05,166
Thanks to Mr Hans Wiegel, I have
about 6,000 policemen at my disposal,

868
01:18:05,250 --> 01:18:10,041
and probably the same number of squatters,
demonstrators and opportunists

869
01:18:10,125 --> 01:18:16,000
who want to have their own party.
The threat to security remains serious.

870
01:18:16,083 --> 01:18:18,458
It didn't have to come to this.

871
01:18:18,541 --> 01:18:22,125
We don't want power.
We don't want money.

872
01:18:22,208 --> 01:18:24,666
We don't want to be on TV.

873
01:18:24,750 --> 01:18:28,833
Waiting in the Moses Hall are the
chairmen of the Upper and Lower House,

874
01:18:28,916 --> 01:18:31,875
the representatives of the Dutch Antilles,
the cabinet,

875
01:18:31,958 --> 01:18:34,083
the vice-president
of the Council of State,

876
01:18:34,166 --> 01:18:38,333
the queen's commissioner and
the Amsterdam mayor. The princess…

877
01:18:41,291 --> 01:18:48,041
Today, everyone's eyes are focused
on Dam Square and on nothing else.

878
01:18:48,125 --> 01:18:51,375
No fuck-ups, no hesitating.

879
01:18:51,458 --> 01:18:55,375
If you have to, you hit first
and then ask questions.

880
01:18:55,458 --> 01:18:59,291
But I don't want to see
any firearms today.

881
01:19:02,750 --> 01:19:05,291
I'm not going down in history

882
01:19:05,375 --> 01:19:09,416
as the chief of police
who had a massacre on his hands.

883
01:19:09,500 --> 01:19:13,083
Accommodation, safety, honesty.

884
01:19:13,166 --> 01:19:16,708
And yes, we're prepared to die for it.

885
01:19:16,791 --> 01:19:21,416
The outer ring is shut off to squatters,
demonstrators or any other scumbags.

886
01:19:21,500 --> 01:19:26,166
- No habitation.
- No coronation.

887
01:19:26,250 --> 01:19:30,208
I only want to see
people celebrating, today.

888
01:19:30,291 --> 01:19:32,000
Okay, let's get to work.

889
01:19:42,916 --> 01:19:47,000
- Post 1 to Post 11. How are you?
- Post 11, everything under control.

890
01:19:47,750 --> 01:19:50,208
- Good. Stand by.
- Stand by.

891
01:20:00,916 --> 01:20:04,833
At the moment,
the situation is fairly calm.

892
01:20:04,916 --> 01:20:10,625
The number of wounded policemen is six.
Of the squatters it's unknown.

893
01:20:24,833 --> 01:20:27,250
Jurre to Command, all quiet.

894
01:20:31,375 --> 01:20:36,833
31 to Command, we've got trainloads
of demonstrators are heading your way.

895
01:20:36,916 --> 01:20:40,458
God, Jesus.
What a fucking awful day.

896
01:20:40,541 --> 01:20:45,333
- Shouldn't we draw the bridges?
- Good advice, not doing it.

897
01:20:47,666 --> 01:20:51,958
A building is being squatted
on Kinkerstraat right now.

898
01:20:52,041 --> 01:20:55,250
Unit A,
move from Nieuwmarkt to Kinkerstraat.

899
01:20:55,333 --> 01:20:56,791
Switch to Kinkerstraat.

900
01:21:07,208 --> 01:21:10,291
Okay, guys.
Everyone keep their eyes peeled.

901
01:21:17,458 --> 01:21:21,125
Look to the left. Top window.
Activity.

902
01:21:21,208 --> 01:21:24,000
Can we see what's happening?
What do you see?

903
01:21:25,041 --> 01:21:29,000
I have no idea.
I've got my eyes on them.

904
01:21:36,583 --> 01:21:41,208
It's a banner, a banner.
They're letting down a banner.

905
01:21:41,291 --> 01:21:44,083
Can somebody please
get those rats out of there?

906
01:21:44,166 --> 01:21:47,500
By eleven o'clock,
Dam Square is full of people

907
01:21:47,583 --> 01:21:51,083
waiting for the abdicated
and the new queen

908
01:21:51,166 --> 01:21:53,500
to appear on the palace balcony.

909
01:22:06,125 --> 01:22:11,833
I introduce to you
Beatrix, your new queen.

910
01:22:14,958 --> 01:22:17,041
Yes, they're inside.

911
01:22:20,958 --> 01:22:22,708
It's all under control.

912
01:22:24,333 --> 01:22:27,291
…as Princess Juliana.

913
01:22:28,458 --> 01:22:32,916
All together we head into the future.

914
01:22:33,000 --> 01:22:34,875
We're all set, Bob.

915
01:22:37,125 --> 01:22:39,916
I strive for nothing else

916
01:22:40,000 --> 01:22:45,416
but to be at your disposal
and that of the people,

917
01:22:45,500 --> 01:22:47,625
and to serve the nation.

918
01:22:47,708 --> 01:22:51,625
- I'll be right back.
- Long live the Netherlands.

919
01:22:56,666 --> 01:22:59,166
- Wait. Command?
- Yes, come in.

920
01:22:59,250 --> 01:23:00,666
Should Tonnie…

921
01:23:03,333 --> 01:23:06,625
- Hello, Command?
- I can't hear you, Jurre.

922
01:23:08,833 --> 01:23:12,000
Guys, this isn't happening, is it?

923
01:23:12,083 --> 01:23:14,500
Hello, can somebody answer me?

924
01:23:17,833 --> 01:23:20,875
Hello? Okay, I'm…

925
01:23:22,333 --> 01:23:27,208
Jesus fucking Christ.
Come on, get on with it.

926
01:23:29,041 --> 01:23:33,750
…where you first appeared
as Queen Juliana,

927
01:23:34,958 --> 01:23:38,625
I now wish you

928
01:23:38,708 --> 01:23:43,875
many more years
of happiness and satisfaction…

929
01:23:43,958 --> 01:23:46,791
- Jurre for Command.
- …as Princess Juliana.

930
01:23:47,666 --> 01:23:49,958
Command, Command.

931
01:23:50,041 --> 01:23:51,958
Long live the Netherlands.

932
01:24:16,708 --> 01:24:19,250
Hey, bike for sale.

933
01:24:50,583 --> 01:24:52,875
- Did it all work out?
- I'm here, aren't I?

934
01:24:56,875 --> 01:25:01,041
Bob, I'm not going in, I've done my bit.
You have uniforms and a get-away car.

935
01:25:01,125 --> 01:25:04,750
Your bit? Your bit is done
once we've paid the Belgians.

936
01:25:04,833 --> 01:25:07,541
Or did you think
we'd be doing the dirty work?

937
01:25:07,625 --> 01:25:13,500
We're in this shit because your goons
can't control themselves. Okay?

938
01:25:13,583 --> 01:25:17,833
And you were there, weren't you?
Or did I dream all that?

939
01:25:41,958 --> 01:25:46,666
Emergency, ma'am. Call your boss
and gather everyone outside.

940
01:25:46,750 --> 01:25:50,416
The police has declared
a state of emergency.

941
01:26:06,291 --> 01:26:09,750
- Can I help you?
- An emergency due to the squatter riots.

942
01:26:09,833 --> 01:26:13,875
- Everybody must leave the building.
- Linda, gather the staff.

943
01:26:24,208 --> 01:26:25,875
Stand over here.

944
01:26:43,083 --> 01:26:45,541
- The alarm is switched off.
- That's great.

945
01:26:48,000 --> 01:26:50,125
We want to take a look in your safe.

946
01:26:55,666 --> 01:26:58,166
Command?

947
01:26:59,000 --> 01:27:02,458
Guys, I… Why don't I hear anything?

948
01:27:02,541 --> 01:27:04,416
We don't have access to the safe.

949
01:27:17,125 --> 01:27:20,708
- Has anyone done a first-aid course?
- Me.

950
01:27:27,666 --> 01:27:31,625
- Fuck, goddammit.
- Can somebody open the safe now?

951
01:27:31,708 --> 01:27:33,666
Jurre to Command.

952
01:27:33,750 --> 01:27:36,125
- What the fuck are you doing?
- Ma'am, this way.

953
01:27:36,208 --> 01:27:38,791
I'll go with you, come on.

954
01:27:45,416 --> 01:27:49,541
- You fucking psychopath.
- You're on the lookout, half-ass crook.

955
01:27:50,875 --> 01:27:55,500
Wait here, stand still.
Line up here and stand still.

956
01:28:05,250 --> 01:28:08,125
Open it. Perfect, next.

957
01:28:08,208 --> 01:28:11,416
Well done. Give me the keys.
Don't move!

958
01:28:21,125 --> 01:28:25,875
Breathe in and out. You'll be fine.
You can call an ambulance once we're gone.

959
01:28:28,500 --> 01:28:31,000
- Jurre.
- Where are they?

960
01:28:33,416 --> 01:28:36,125
- I'm glad you're here.
- Where are they?

961
01:28:40,125 --> 01:28:43,250
- Call an ambulance.
- Move away.

962
01:28:43,333 --> 01:28:48,791
- This is not what it seems.
- I'm not stupid.

963
01:28:53,916 --> 01:28:57,041
- I told you it's not all black and white.
- Move away.

964
01:28:57,125 --> 01:28:59,250
What a first week you're having.

965
01:29:00,125 --> 01:29:02,458
- Come on!
- Move, pigs.

966
01:29:02,541 --> 01:29:05,958
Move it, faster! Get in there!

967
01:29:07,666 --> 01:29:11,041
- This is bigger than you think.
- With you and Bob, yes.

968
01:29:14,000 --> 01:29:15,333
I'm undercover.

969
01:29:17,458 --> 01:29:20,916
I'm undercover. Help me, please.

970
01:29:21,000 --> 01:29:23,750
- Bob is emptying out the safe.
- How's that?

971
01:29:23,833 --> 01:29:25,625
Honestly, Jurre.

972
01:29:27,708 --> 01:29:30,875
Grab his arm.
He passed out. Take him outside.

973
01:29:30,958 --> 01:29:34,250
- Hold his arm.
- Yes, we must tie it off. His belt.

974
01:29:42,166 --> 01:29:43,625
Sorry, buddy.

975
01:29:50,250 --> 01:29:51,375
Come on.

976
01:29:52,541 --> 01:29:56,250
- What's all this?
- Some loser trying to be a hero.

977
01:29:56,333 --> 01:29:58,833
- Well, finish him.
- No.

978
01:30:00,583 --> 01:30:01,666
Goddammit.

979
01:30:03,208 --> 01:30:05,000
Get the fuck out of here.

980
01:30:14,250 --> 01:30:19,083
AMSTERDAM, 1 MAY 1980
8 HOURS AFTER THE CORONATION

981
01:30:19,166 --> 01:30:21,291
There he is.

982
01:30:22,625 --> 01:30:24,375
Well…

983
01:30:24,458 --> 01:30:27,791
I have 80 officers in hospital.

984
01:30:27,875 --> 01:30:33,375
The riots are ongoing,
but the coronation went smoothly.

985
01:30:34,666 --> 01:30:40,875
I suppose the leaders of the free world
are probably having their dessert.

986
01:30:40,958 --> 01:30:43,625
- What are these for?
- That was quite impressive.

987
01:30:43,708 --> 01:30:48,791
Right under our noses, very smart.
And we were very dumb.

988
01:30:49,625 --> 01:30:54,083
I'd appreciate it if you were
to tell me exactly what happened.

989
01:30:57,666 --> 01:31:01,708
We were on the lookout
when Tonnie suddenly left.

990
01:31:02,708 --> 01:31:07,250
I followed him and he went into a bank
with some other guys.

991
01:31:07,333 --> 01:31:11,250
I tried to stop him,
but he knocked me out.

992
01:31:11,333 --> 01:31:16,875
Yes, well, Tonnie told me a very
different story. Didn't you, Tonnie?

993
01:31:27,708 --> 01:31:31,666
He knows exactly what happened.
Don't you?

994
01:31:38,375 --> 01:31:40,500
Do you know where the money is?

995
01:31:40,583 --> 01:31:45,166
Tonnie just told me that you were
the one who suddenly took off

996
01:31:45,250 --> 01:31:48,041
to play bank robbers with your mates.

997
01:31:48,125 --> 01:31:50,416
Who are your mates?

998
01:31:55,333 --> 01:31:57,375
Bob Donkers is one of them, isn't he?

999
01:31:57,458 --> 01:32:02,291
- So Tonnie killed the bank manager then?
- Killed?

1000
01:32:02,375 --> 01:32:05,416
No, when I passed out,
nobody was dead.

1001
01:32:05,500 --> 01:32:09,666
He's in a coma, a severed artery.
A breath away from dying.

1002
01:32:09,750 --> 01:32:14,458
And the fact that you betrayed us to the
squatters doesn't help you much either.

1003
01:32:14,541 --> 01:32:17,541
But until I've figured it out,
you'll be guarded.

1004
01:32:19,625 --> 01:32:23,000
Who the hell are you really,
Jurre from Urk?

1005
01:32:26,083 --> 01:32:27,583
Chief?

1006
01:32:30,625 --> 01:32:31,791
Tonnie.

1007
01:32:58,916 --> 01:33:00,208
What is it?

1008
01:33:14,375 --> 01:33:15,541
Sorry.

1009
01:33:20,708 --> 01:33:22,041
Taxi.

1010
01:33:24,041 --> 01:33:25,708
Jordaan.

1011
01:33:52,541 --> 01:33:54,125
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

1012
01:33:54,208 --> 01:33:56,000
Make it 22.

1013
01:34:01,166 --> 01:34:02,791
Hang on, wait a second.

1014
01:34:06,375 --> 01:34:08,791
I think we're going for another drive.

1015
01:34:32,625 --> 01:34:36,625
Yes, stop here. Stop.

1016
01:35:02,375 --> 01:35:05,750
Seppe, it's good to see you.

1017
01:35:18,208 --> 01:35:19,750
Ton.

1018
01:35:30,875 --> 01:35:32,625
It's probably too much.

1019
01:35:38,000 --> 01:35:40,666
Well, how about you guys?

1020
01:35:40,750 --> 01:35:43,125
- What about us?
- The coke.

1021
01:35:43,916 --> 01:35:46,458
- There is no coke.
- Well, give it back then.

1022
01:35:46,541 --> 01:35:49,333
We've decided not to do business
with you anymore.

1023
01:35:49,958 --> 01:35:54,458
Take it easy, everybody.
Let's calm down.

1024
01:36:00,000 --> 01:36:03,125
What? Is this about Marcel?

1025
01:36:06,333 --> 01:36:11,500
Marcel was a junkie
and hence a risk to send on errands.

1026
01:36:11,583 --> 01:36:14,458
First of all,
I decide who runs my errands.

1027
01:36:14,541 --> 01:36:19,458
Secondly, Marcel may have been a junkie,
but he was my friend, and family.

1028
01:36:19,541 --> 01:36:22,958
And that, Bob,
brings us to our third point.

1029
01:36:23,041 --> 01:36:24,750
You don't touch my family.

1030
01:36:24,833 --> 01:36:27,416
How was I supposed to know
he was family?

1031
01:36:29,583 --> 01:36:34,250
Listen, we must be able
to solve this as gentlemen.

1032
01:36:35,833 --> 01:36:40,083
If we have to raise the price,
that's not a problem for me.

1033
01:36:45,416 --> 01:36:49,083
See?
We just need to talk to each other, Seppe.

1034
01:36:49,166 --> 01:36:51,291
All the squatters are locked up

1035
01:36:51,375 --> 01:36:54,166
so if you can't do business with me,
with who can you?

1036
01:36:54,250 --> 01:36:58,000
What's the world coming to
if even we don't have a moral code…

1037
01:37:08,458 --> 01:37:11,708
I'm sorry, but it was
such a boring conversation.

1038
01:37:14,875 --> 01:37:18,791
It's a bit impolite, but we'd still be
here in the morning. Right, Barrie?

1039
01:37:23,458 --> 01:37:27,000
And you don't mess with family.

1040
01:37:27,083 --> 01:37:29,291
I totally agree with that.

1041
01:37:32,791 --> 01:37:36,291
Five kilos a week for starters?

1042
01:37:36,375 --> 01:37:39,875
Fine. And Barrie here is all right.

1043
01:37:42,541 --> 01:37:44,958
But I'm not too sure about this retard.

1044
01:37:47,541 --> 01:37:49,166
I thought you were a cop.

1045
01:37:49,250 --> 01:37:51,750
- I am.
- Yes, he is.

1046
01:37:51,833 --> 01:37:55,666
And coincidentally, he's also
the last person to see Marcel alive.

1047
01:37:55,750 --> 01:38:00,708
It was his idea to dump Marcel
in the canal dressed up as a squatter.

1048
01:38:00,791 --> 01:38:02,000
Wasn't it?

1049
01:38:03,375 --> 01:38:05,000
Fucking asshole.

1050
01:38:21,041 --> 01:38:23,083
Say hello to Marcel.

1051
01:39:20,083 --> 01:39:22,250
Man, oh man.

1052
01:39:26,125 --> 01:39:29,375
Goddammit.

1053
01:39:33,166 --> 01:39:35,666
It's all fucked up.

1054
01:39:40,625 --> 01:39:42,416
Jurre?

1055
01:39:47,208 --> 01:39:49,666
It was all for nothing.

1056
01:39:53,291 --> 01:39:55,125
Hey, buddy.

1057
01:40:00,083 --> 01:40:05,750
You used me in everything.
You knew all along who Marcel was.

1058
01:40:06,833 --> 01:40:09,875
You were on top of everything.

1059
01:40:09,958 --> 01:40:13,291
It should never have come to this.

1060
01:40:13,375 --> 01:40:17,625
That business with the squatters and the
attack was all part of Bob's smoke screen.

1061
01:40:17,708 --> 01:40:21,708
- How long have you been working for Bob?
- I don't work for or with Bob.

1062
01:40:21,791 --> 01:40:23,750
For how long?

1063
01:40:23,833 --> 01:40:27,708
I work undercover
to roll up this entire fucking operation.

1064
01:40:27,791 --> 01:40:31,041
Yeah, we all know that story,
just like in the bank.

1065
01:40:32,666 --> 01:40:34,625
Keep that hand away from there.

1066
01:40:36,541 --> 01:40:41,708
Call an ambulance, I'm losing blood.
A lot of it.

1067
01:40:45,500 --> 01:40:50,916
- Are you giving up on me?
- I saw the whole thing. I'm not like you.

1068
01:40:51,875 --> 01:40:56,416
That's why I love you, buddy.
You're not like the rest of them.

1069
01:40:56,500 --> 01:41:00,333
You're real. I can just picture it.

1070
01:41:02,916 --> 01:41:05,541
Pien and you.

1071
01:41:05,625 --> 01:41:08,708
Don't fucking sweet talk me.

1072
01:41:10,500 --> 01:41:13,625
You're a beautiful person, Jurre DeKok.

1073
01:41:15,000 --> 01:41:17,666
And hey, lesson number 13.

1074
01:41:17,750 --> 01:41:20,250
- Stop.
- Lesson 13:

1075
01:41:20,333 --> 01:41:24,500
Unfortunately in our world,
who you hang out with…

1076
01:41:25,750 --> 01:41:27,708
is who you get contaminated by.

1077
01:41:28,958 --> 01:41:30,333
I'm sorry.

1078
01:41:49,041 --> 01:41:50,833
No, no.

1079
01:41:56,416 --> 01:41:59,666
- Jurre?
- No, no.

1080
01:42:03,625 --> 01:42:06,583
No. No, Tonnie.

1081
01:42:11,291 --> 01:42:15,916
They're on their way,
they're on their way.

1082
01:42:50,583 --> 01:42:52,166
What a mess.

1083
01:42:56,208 --> 01:43:01,791
That bank manager of yours,
he has come to. So…

1084
01:43:04,375 --> 01:43:05,875
Well done.

1085
01:43:12,750 --> 01:43:14,416
He said…

1086
01:43:15,875 --> 01:43:18,958
He said that he was working undercover.

1087
01:43:19,041 --> 01:43:21,875
That all the top brass knew about it.

1088
01:43:24,291 --> 01:43:26,458
That's not true, is it?

1089
01:43:28,083 --> 01:43:29,458
No.

1090
01:43:40,375 --> 01:43:41,750
Your firearm.

1091
01:43:44,625 --> 01:43:46,166
Your firearm.

1092
01:43:53,291 --> 01:43:58,041
I want a brief police report
and a statement.

1093
01:43:58,125 --> 01:44:00,875
Nothing complicated, okay?

1094
01:44:00,958 --> 01:44:03,291
I'll see you Monday morning.

1095
01:44:03,375 --> 01:44:04,791
Okay.

1096
01:45:06,791 --> 01:45:08,291
To Tonnie.

1097
01:45:10,291 --> 01:45:12,333
To Tonnie.

1098
01:45:19,500 --> 01:45:22,416
He fucking succeeded, after all.

1099
01:45:24,541 --> 01:45:28,333
- What?
- In the saddle.

1100
01:45:29,916 --> 01:45:34,333
I always used to say: They'll have to
push you into a grave when you're 120.

1101
01:45:36,166 --> 01:45:37,875
The fucking bastards.

1102
01:45:37,958 --> 01:45:40,750
Don't get me wrong,
Tonnie had his share of mistakes.

1103
01:45:40,833 --> 01:45:43,958
If you steal a rich man's watch,
that's one thing.

1104
01:45:44,041 --> 01:45:46,166
But you just don't shoot people.

1105
01:45:57,541 --> 01:45:59,583

Stop calling my name
out, it's distracting me.

This is harder than I thought. The
hash rate alone is similar to Ethereum.

00:00:47,419 --> 00:00:50,767
A 51% attack won't work then.
Perhaps an old-school move.

9
00:00:50,768 --> 00:00:52,498
What about cryptojacking?

10
00:00:52,499 --> 00:00:54,314
Do you even know what that means?

11
00:00:54,315 --> 00:00:56,561
Why crawl through all of
this to get here then?

Hey, I'm the one crawling here. Keep
me updated on external developments.

00:01:02,292 --> 00:01:04,813

Well, I have the day off tomorrow.

Come on now.

18
00:01:21,513 --> 00:01:26,223
I thought it would be nice to take
the kids out for a drive for once

19
00:01:26,224 --> 00:01:28,721
but you are being so difficult.

20
00:01:28,722 --> 00:01:29,988
I'm tired too!

21
00:01:29,989 --> 00:01:33,717
I want to do nothing
but rest on my day off.

22
00:01:35,110 --> 00:01:37,448
It's nothing.

23

These damn kids.

00:02:02,032 --> 00:02:03,508
What happened?

29
00:02:03,509 --> 00:02:05,435
Did you lose something?

30
00:02:05,436 --> 00:02:08,336
Like some loser in a movie?

31
00:02:10,639 --> 00:02:12,580
Was that the sound of a door closing?

32
00:02:12,581 --> 00:02:17,454
My palms are so sweaty. The tension is
like watching a Premier League game.

33
00:02:17,455 --> 00:02:20,555

Northwest Derby, and United vs City!

34

Calm down. It's just a routine patrol.

35

I got it. Just hurry up and
tell me how to get out of here.

36

Being stuck here is
making me claustrophobic.

Is it too obvious that this

- Hey, Jaemin.
- Yeah?

351
00:22:56,904 --> 00:23:00,723
Do you think... I'm...

352
00:23:01,388 --> 00:23:03,399
a little lame?

353
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:05,114
Why?

354
00:23:05,874 --> 00:23:08,792
Chanho is a bit

355
00:23:08,793 --> 00:23:10,890
out of my league, right?

356
00:23:13,094 --> 00:23:14,410
Hey!

357
00:23:14,411 --> 00:23:18,384
Why are you talking down to
yourself so seriously like that?

358
00:23:19,722 --> 00:23:22,738
That guy... Chanho...

359
00:23:22,739 --> 00:23:26,386
was a bit popular when
we were in high school.

360
00:23:26,387 --> 00:23:29,192
No, he was super popular!

361
00:23:29,193 --> 00:23:33,412
He could have been a K-pop
idol with a face like that.

362
00:23:35,083 --> 00:23:38,023
He was academically great too.

363
00:23:41,986 --> 00:23:45,304
Wasn't I also cool when we were younger?

364
00:23:45,305 --> 00:23:48,591
You are sobering me up.

365
00:23:48,592 --> 00:23:51,298
Was that a serious question?

366
00:23:51,802 --> 00:23:54,802
Woah, you don't have to burn me like that.

367
00:23:55,260 --> 00:23:59,784
You were different from Chanho.

368
00:24:00,806 --> 00:24:04,012
You were the kind of type
that attracted party girls.

369
00:24:04,013 --> 00:24:06,305
You had this mint chocolate vibe.

370
00:24:06,306 --> 00:24:08,277
Only liked by a certain group.

371
00:24:08,278 --> 00:24:10,201
Definitely controversial.

372
00:24:10,202 --> 00:24:13,154
Tasted like toothpaste or chocolate.
Neither one nor the other.

373
00:24:13,155 --> 00:24:16,901
They were good kids. You only
judge a book by its cover.

374
00:24:16,902 --> 00:24:18,302
Also, toothpaste?

375
00:24:18,303 --> 00:24:21,315
If I was toothpaste, was Chanho mouthwash?

376
00:24:21,316 --> 00:24:23,808
No, no, no.

377
00:24:23,809 --> 00:24:26,406
He was a classic, luxurious chocolate.

378
00:24:26,407 --> 00:24:28,511
From Belgium, like Godiva?

379
00:24:28,512 --> 00:24:30,397
Everyone loved Chanho.

380
00:24:30,398 --> 00:24:32,923
He was smart, kind, honest.

381
00:24:32,924 --> 00:24:36,008
All the teachers really liked him, too.

382
00:24:36,790 --> 00:24:40,575
I got along with some teachers, too.

383
00:24:40,576 --> 00:24:44,902
Oh, yeah! Remember that teacher
that was only good to Chanho?

384
00:24:46,994 --> 00:24:49,087
What's next period?

385
00:24:49,531 --> 00:24:52,143
Hey, hey! This isn't a flea market!

386
00:24:52,144 --> 00:24:54,109
Hey, you are running down the corridor!

387
00:24:54,110 --> 00:24:56,404
Join the track team if you want to run!

Punks.

389
00:25:00,488 --> 00:25:05,007
Chanho, could you get the mock
exam results from my office?

390
00:25:05,008 --> 00:25:07,697
You came first again. Don't study too hard.

391
00:25:07,698 --> 00:25:10,192
Spare some hope for the others.

392
00:25:10,193 --> 00:25:11,898
Yes, sir.

393
00:25:11,899 --> 00:25:13,569
Anyway, that kid.

394
00:25:13,570 --> 00:25:17,806
Always looks like he's goofing off
but his test scores are always good.

395
00:25:17,807 --> 00:25:20,702
He was second again. Just below you.

396
00:25:20,703 --> 00:25:24,282
Your homeroom teacher must
be happy to have both of you.

397
00:25:24,283 --> 00:25:26,600
I'm just lucky.

398
00:25:38,796 --> 00:25:40,997
He's a rare breed.

399
00:25:50,174 --> 00:25:52,100
You didn't have to walk me home.

400
00:25:52,101 --> 00:25:53,399
Chivalry is it?

401
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:54,906
Hey.

402
00:25:54,907 --> 00:25:57,200
I think you two look alike.

403
00:25:57,201 --> 00:25:58,126

404
00:25:58,127 --> 00:26:02,094

You look exactly like the dean.

408
00:26:11,721 --> 00:26:13,600
The long-faced version.

409
00:26:13,601 --> 00:26:15,173
Ugh, Mr. Park.

410
00:26:15,174 --> 00:26:17,200

415

You know my situation.

416

There's no need to send a car.
I'll be fine on my own.

417
00:26:35,804 --> 00:26:40,605
So, there is no real pressure, right?

418
00:26:41,216 --> 00:26:45,420
Okay. I'll see you then.

Right! The background music.

Chanho, Hwarang Hall is where all
our school clubs are gathered. Right?

446
00:29:03,801 --> 00:29:04,860

00:59:53,222 --> 00:59:56,388
I told you to remarry
to the laundromat lady!

872
00:59:58,700 --> 01:00:01,124
- Joohee.
- What?

873
01:00:01,125 --> 01:00:04,671
Do you want to study abroad?

874
01:00:04,672 --> 01:00:07,293
That's random, what are you on about?

875
01:00:07,294 --> 01:00:11,699
When you were in eighth grade
you wanted to study in New York.

876
01:00:11,700 --> 01:00:14,605
- At Pass?
- Parsons.

877
01:00:14,606 --> 01:00:17,916
That's a fashion school anyway.
I ended up choosing art, remember?

878
01:00:17,917 --> 01:00:20,340
Be a more attentive father.

879
01:00:22,736 --> 01:00:24,942
For six years during
middle and high school.

880
01:00:24,943 --> 01:00:29,174
You changed your career path 22
times, same with your crushes.

881
01:00:29,175 --> 01:00:31,398
And I'm not an attentive father.

882
01:00:31,399 --> 01:00:35,155
Your crush in 12th grade must
have been an art student.

883
01:00:36,070 --> 01:00:37,083
That's enough.

884
01:00:37,084 --> 01:00:39,142
And you wanted to follow him to New York.

885
01:00:39,143 --> 01:00:40,516
Have you heard of Covid-19?

886
01:00:40,517 --> 01:00:43,019
Korea is doing well. Studying
abroad is a bad idea.

887
01:00:43,020 --> 01:00:44,638
Do you ever worry

888
01:00:44,639 --> 01:00:48,801
that your dad won't be able to
buy you a nice wedding dress?

889
01:00:48,802 --> 01:00:50,975
- Do you?
- I'm only twenty years old!

890
01:00:50,976 --> 01:00:54,598
I told you to be quiet
when we do our masks.

891
01:00:54,599 --> 01:00:56,795
Your dad is still alive!

892
01:00:56,796 --> 01:00:59,677
Don't worry about money
and do what you want.

893
01:00:59,678 --> 01:01:02,131
Have I ever asked you to sell
the house for a start-up?

894
01:01:02,132 --> 01:01:05,692
Or asked to borrow what's
left of your pension?

895
01:01:06,991 --> 01:01:09,077
Is it andropause?

896
01:01:11,753 --> 01:01:15,326
I, Park Kyungshik, am in the
second chapter of my life.

897
01:01:17,217 --> 01:01:20,336
Luck! Fortune!

898
01:01:22,444 --> 01:01:26,904
That's a man finally breaking after
being stuck in traffic for hours.

899
01:01:32,359 --> 01:01:35,516
You know there are many bars around here.

900
01:01:35,517 --> 01:01:38,007
The convenience store isn't so bad.

901
01:01:38,008 --> 01:01:40,686
I really wanted to do this with you.

902
01:01:40,687 --> 01:01:42,308
- What is ""this""?
- You know,

903
01:01:42,309 --> 01:01:45,234
cracking open some beers on
a nice night with a friend.

904
01:01:45,235 --> 01:01:47,220
When will we do this again?

905
01:01:47,221 --> 01:01:48,574
We have military duty soon.

906
01:01:48,575 --> 01:01:52,034
Once that's done, we are back on
campus with freshmen crawling around.

907
01:01:52,035 --> 01:01:54,212
Do you think we'll be able to?

908
01:01:54,213 --> 01:01:55,706
The romance of youth!

909
01:01:55,707 --> 01:01:57,421
Romance?

910
01:01:58,381 --> 01:02:00,813
You haven't changed at all, Jaemin.

911
01:02:00,814 --> 01:02:02,025
The same as high school.

912
01:02:02,026 --> 01:02:06,120
Even though we weren't
close in high school,

913
01:02:09,596 --> 01:02:11,226
""I have to drink with this guy,""

914
01:02:11,227 --> 01:02:12,707
is what I thought.

915
01:02:12,708 --> 01:02:13,915
Why me?

916
01:02:13,916 --> 01:02:16,230
Dude, you were so smart in high school.

917
01:02:16,231 --> 01:02:17,601
The thing is...

918
01:02:17,602 --> 01:02:24,011
people want to experience a unique,
tight bond with the best of the best.

919
01:02:24,012 --> 01:02:28,811
That's rich coming from you. You didn't
even study after school and you did great.

920
01:02:28,812 --> 01:02:30,025
Guess I did.

921
01:02:30,026 --> 01:02:32,205
In fact, I thought you were so arrogant.

922
01:02:32,206 --> 01:02:35,144
Whom are you calling arrogant? You
were worse. Following around teachers,

923
01:02:35,145 --> 01:02:36,387
like a teacher's pet.

924
01:02:36,388 --> 01:02:39,173
No way, they were following me.

925
01:02:39,174 --> 01:02:43,496
To them, I was the kid that chose
liberal arts over a science high school.

926
01:02:43,497 --> 01:02:45,097
Their attention was too much.

927
01:02:45,098 --> 01:02:49,098
I knew how the other kids saw me.
I understand.

928
01:02:50,597 --> 01:02:54,014
You are way more arrogant than I thought.

929
01:03:00,057 --> 01:03:03,303
Do you have a girl you like?

930
01:03:03,304 --> 01:03:05,282
A girl?

931
01:03:05,283 --> 01:03:06,587
Why?

932
01:03:06,588 --> 01:03:08,591
You have someone in mind?

933
01:03:09,495 --> 01:03:12,105
Well, I could introduce you.

934
01:03:13,315 --> 01:03:14,540
You want me to?

935
01:03:14,541 --> 01:03:18,167
Actually, I already have someone I like.

936
01:03:18,168 --> 01:03:19,661
You do?

937
01:03:19,662 --> 01:03:21,132
Who?

938
01:03:21,133 --> 01:03:23,292
She must be a catch if you are into her.

939
01:03:23,293 --> 01:03:26,093
- Do I know her?
- It's Joohee.

940
01:03:27,386 --> 01:03:29,812
Joohee? What's her surname?

941
01:03:29,813 --> 01:03:31,623
Park Joohee.

942
01:03:32,504 --> 01:03:34,718
Well, it is a common name.

943
01:03:34,719 --> 01:03:38,874
Is there another Park Joohee we know?

944
01:03:38,875 --> 01:03:43,120
Our friend Park Joohee?
You seriously like her?

945
01:03:43,121 --> 01:03:46,823
The same Park Joohee that
we went to high school with?

946
01:03:46,824 --> 01:03:49,268
The very same Joohee that
studies art at Hankuk University?

947
01:03:49,269 --> 01:03:50,776
Yeah.

948
01:03:50,777 --> 01:03:53,434
That's one hell of a reaction.

949
01:03:56,769 --> 01:03:58,967
Can I go out with Joohee?

950
01:04:00,579 --> 01:04:02,291
Why are you asking me for?

951
01:04:02,292 --> 01:04:04,948
Because you and Joohee are best friends.

952
01:04:04,949 --> 01:04:06,159
Best friends?

953
01:04:06,160 --> 01:04:08,106
Are we?

954
01:04:10,396 --> 01:04:12,899
She's not some object needing approval,

955
01:04:12,900 --> 01:04:15,417
whether you two should date,

956
01:04:17,519 --> 01:04:19,334
that decision,

957
01:04:19,808 --> 01:04:21,818
is between you two.

958
01:04:22,666 --> 01:04:25,944
I thought you were interested in her.

959
01:04:25,945 --> 01:04:27,510
Guess not, huh?

960
01:04:27,511 --> 01:04:29,510
That's a relief.

961
01:04:29,511 --> 01:04:31,025
Yeah.

Park Jaemin, how are you?

974
01:05:44,290 --> 01:05:48,491
- You're looking after Joohee, right?
- Of course, sir.

975
01:05:48,492 --> 01:05:51,784
This is a pleasant surprise,
how can I help you?

976
01:05:51,785 --> 01:05:53,796
You know, this and that.

977
01:05:53,797 --> 01:05:55,384
Thought I'd ask how you're doing.

978
01:05:55,385 --> 01:05:58,532
The last time you called, you asked
me how I was doing for 20 minutes.

979
01:05:58,533 --> 01:06:00,216
And we had 20 minutes of small talk.

980
01:06:00,217 --> 01:06:03,127
Let's skip to the bottom line, for both us?

981
01:06:03,128 --> 01:06:09,699
We can definitely skip that part where we
engage in small talk to build a rapport.

982
01:06:09,700 --> 01:06:11,821
You're an honest man.

983
01:06:11,822 --> 01:06:13,681
You said you were

984
01:06:13,682 --> 01:06:15,900
- a computer science major?
- Yes.

985
01:06:15,901 --> 01:06:19,313
It's a little weird calling
you out of the blue like this,

but you really know your stuff
when it comes to things like this.

987
01:06:22,813 --> 01:06:24,225
Do you happen to know

988
01:06:24,226 --> 01:06:28,390
- anything about blockchain?
- Ah, you want to talk about crypto.

989
01:06:28,391 --> 01:06:32,448
- Wow, exactly!

- We're a team.

This kind of exposure is not

and tore up all of his

01:34:40,266 --> 01:34:41,346
Of course.

1387
01:34:41,347 --> 01:34:43,798
Of course, it records
everything in real-time

1388
01:34:43,799 --> 01:34:47,423
and will be broadcast across the
nation, just like in the movies.

1389
01:34:47,424 --> 01:34:48,923
Psych.

1390
01:34:48,924 --> 01:34:52,542
If you want to mount a
camera, we would need MI6...

1391
01:34:52,543 --> 01:34:55,089
I have another plan.

1392
01:35:08,512 --> 01:35:11,306
Do you know what YOUKNOWWHAT is?

1393
01:35:12,985 --> 01:35:14,485
What is it?

1394
01:35:15,984 --> 01:35:18,083
It's...

1395
01:35:18,084 --> 01:35:19,666
no one.

1396
01:35:32,732 --> 01:35:35,597
With Chanho's profound parting words,

1397
01:35:35,598 --> 01:35:40,888
an unusual summer for a
twenty-year-old came and went.

1398
01:35:40,889 --> 01:35:43,480
The Seoul Cyber Bureau was at
Songdo International Exchange...

1399
01:35:43,481 --> 01:35:47,592
The hack of the century, which could
have erased millions of cryptocurrencies,

1400
01:35:47,593 --> 01:35:50,416
did attract the public's
attentions for a while

1401
01:35:50,417 --> 01:35:54,853
but the news died down and was remembered
as the act of an attention-craving hacker.

1402
01:35:54,854 --> 01:35:57,693
YOUKNOWWHAT, the man I
hunted for three years,

1403
01:35:57,694 --> 01:36:01,438
was forgotten by the
public in just three days.

1404
01:36:04,120 --> 01:36:08,149
[NOTICE: As of August 10, 2020, ""Better World"" club
will be converted into a ""Fine Dust"" research room.]

1405
01:36:08,150 --> 01:36:10,579
""Better World""?

1406
01:36:11,071 --> 01:36:13,282
Is it a name of a club?

1407
01:36:13,283 --> 01:36:14,552
Never heard of it.

1408
01:36:14,553 --> 01:36:17,031
It's a weird name. ""Better World,"" huh?

1409
01:36:17,032 --> 01:36:19,631
Maybe it's a volunteering group?

1410
01:36:27,834 --> 01:36:30,679
So, if we're out,

1411
01:36:30,680 --> 01:36:32,473
who's replacing us?

1412
01:36:32,474 --> 01:36:35,007
What's so great about them?

1413
01:36:35,008 --> 01:36:36,625
They're sponsored by Samsung,

1414
01:36:36,626 --> 01:36:39,634
collaborating with MIT students on
atmospheric engineering research.

1415
01:36:39,635 --> 01:36:42,550
Kids that can save the
world from fine dust?

1416
01:36:42,551 --> 01:36:45,431
I heard KBS is going to interview them too.

1417

1418
01:36:48,592 --> 01:36:50,904
Then, what about us?

1419
01:36:50,905 --> 01:36:54,548
- Where can we do our club activities?
- You guys...

1420
01:36:54,549 --> 01:36:56,325
should meet in the virtual world.

1421
01:36:56,326 --> 01:36:59,947
Your club failed to meet the
member's requirements anyways.

1422
01:36:59,948 --> 01:37:03,119
You're making me look like a
bad landlord expelling tenants.

1423
01:37:03,120 --> 01:37:04,780
I have no power.

1424
01:37:04,781 --> 01:37:06,687
I have no power to help you.

1425
01:37:06,688 --> 01:37:09,436
Do you want me to make an
appointment with the president?

1426
01:37:11,725 --> 01:37:13,473
My honorable TA,

1427
01:37:13,474 --> 01:37:15,650
you can't do this to us!

1428
01:37:15,651 --> 01:37:19,375
It's not like I'm a pearl lacquerware
master trying to pass down the torch

1429
01:37:19,376 --> 01:37:21,332
or noodle pulling master from China.

1430
01:37:21,333 --> 01:37:24,632
I have no plans to accept any disciples.

1431
01:37:24,633 --> 01:37:28,317
I just want to be the owner of an
internet cafe for the rest of my life.

1432
01:37:28,318 --> 01:37:30,827
I heard you were a reverse engineer,

1433
01:37:30,828 --> 01:37:32,877
one of the top three engineers at the
Ministry of Science and Technology.

1434
01:37:32,878 --> 01:37:36,464
If you accept me as a
disciple, I will do my best.

1435
01:37:36,465 --> 01:37:37,506
Who would have thought?

1436
01:37:37,507 --> 01:37:40,254
That the boss at my part-time
job was a genius hacker?

1437
01:37:40,255 --> 01:37:45,000
That he's one of the very few
Wizard Experts in the world.

1438
01:37:45,001 --> 01:37:47,065

Gryffindor or Slytherin?

1441
01:37:51,234 --> 01:37:53,826
Why do people always say,
""Gryffindor or Slytherin?""

1442
01:37:53,827 --> 01:37:56,116
Ravenclaw, known for their
cleverness and creativity,

1443
01:37:56,117 --> 01:37:58,956
and the protectors of morals
and character, Hufflepuff.

1444
01:37:58,957 --> 01:38:01,266
But I am... a Gryffindor.

1445
01:38:01,267 --> 01:38:03,661
- Such a nerd.
- Could you not bring her here anymore?

1446
01:38:03,662 --> 01:38:06,186
Hey, she didn't even pay for that.

1447
01:38:06,187 --> 01:38:07,265
He will pay for it.

1448
01:38:07,266 --> 01:38:10,558
That will be deducted from your wages.

1449
01:38:11,857 --> 01:38:15,359
Stop eating the expensive
snacks, take the bagged ones.

1450

1455
01:38:32,888 --> 01:38:35,028
I totally forgot about him.

1456
01:38:35,029 --> 01:38:38,053
It's okay, I'll just
have to find number 29.

1457
01:38:38,054 --> 01:38:40,005
Right.

1458
01:38:40,006 --> 01:38:41,617

01:38:42,700 --> 01:38:44,452

1462
01:38:53,214 --> 01:38:55,408
It's not a big deal.

1463
01:38:55,409 --> 01:39:00,289
Your dad was kind to
me in high school, too.

1464
01:39:00,290 --> 01:39:04,414
Just tell him to stop going to
those weird investment seminars.

1465

41
00:05:10,250 --> 00:05:12,250
Do we still have to drive the cats out?

42
00:05:13,458 --> 00:05:14,833
No, not anymore

43
00:05:28,583 --> 00:05:31,000
Does your dad know
that they're tearing down Scala?

44
00:05:31,083 --> 00:05:32,458
Have you talked to him?

45
00:05:32,541 --> 00:05:33,875
No calls?

46
00:05:33,958 --> 00:05:36,291
I meant to call him too,
but I got too busy.

47
00:05:37,375 --> 00:05:40,250
I think it was in late 1973.

48
00:05:46,291 --> 00:05:51,375
It was 40, 45 years ago.

49
00:05:52,583 --> 00:05:53,791
Around 1974.

50
00:05:56,666 --> 00:05:59,666
In the beginning,
the Scala had 1,200 seats.

51
00:05:59,750 --> 00:06:02,791
It was the biggest one.

52
00:06:04,958 --> 00:06:07,791
Siam Cinema had 900 seats.

53
00:06:08,416 --> 00:06:09,958
The Lido Theater had 1,000 seats.

54
00:06:11,208 --> 00:06:12,750
This cinema had the most.

55
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:23,125
I think it's the end
of that October protest.

56
00:06:23,208 --> 00:06:25,458
So I started working here
at the end of 1973.

57
00:06:26,291 --> 00:06:28,250
It was December, I remember.

58
00:06:29,416 --> 00:06:31,916
But I actually was working
at Samyan cinema first.

59
00:06:32,458 --> 00:06:34,000
- Samyan?
- Samyan.

60
00:06:34,083 --> 00:06:37,583
It's the place where...

61
00:06:38,541 --> 00:06:41,291
There were Samyan cinemas
next to Hua Lamphong temple.

62
00:06:41,375 --> 00:06:43,208
You didn't know?

63
00:06:44,708 --> 00:06:46,500
It's a cinema screening Chinese movies.

64
00:06:46,583 --> 00:06:49,000
There are the Samyan and Rama cinemas.

65
00:06:49,750 --> 00:06:56,250
I worked there for over a year
before moving to Lido in 1975.

66
00:06:59,625 --> 00:07:02,708
I remember seeing you
and your father always arguing

67
00:07:02,791 --> 00:07:04,708
when I was working at the Siam Cinema.

68
00:07:05,291 --> 00:07:09,291
At first, you guys were able to
talk normally, and soon started arguing.

69
00:07:09,375 --> 00:07:11,208
That's why Ms. Leka always said,

70
00:07:12,375 --> 00:07:15,375
""If you can't take care of her,
give her to me. I will do it myself!""

71
00:07:15,458 --> 00:07:16,875
That's what she said.

72
00:07:23,125 --> 00:07:25,833
He was an ill-tempered man.

73
00:07:26,708 --> 00:07:28,833
He did not want your mother
to see or meet you.

74
00:07:28,916 --> 00:07:31,500
It's like he doesn't want you
to contact each other.

75
00:07:33,875 --> 00:07:35,250
So he had to...

76
00:07:35,333 --> 00:07:36,833
That's why you never saw her.

77
00:07:37,625 --> 00:07:40,500
I don't have a picture of her either.

78
00:07:41,375 --> 00:07:43,375
Back then, what should I say?

79
00:07:43,458 --> 00:07:49,041
Taking pictures wasn't easy.

80
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,875
<i>Uncle Nao was
a projectionist at Siam cinema.</i>

81
00:07:55,541 --> 00:07:57,958
<i>It was at the Siam cinema projection box
where I first met him.</i>

82
00:07:59,916 --> 00:08:03,708
<i>I don't remember
when I started living in the Siam cinema.</i>

83
00:08:03,791 --> 00:08:06,333
<i>Before I knew it,
I was already running around the place.</i>

84
00:08:07,791 --> 00:08:10,583
<i>But the Lido and the Scala,
I didn't really visit so much back then</i>

85
00:08:10,666 --> 00:08:14,041
<i>unless there was a film I wanted to see
that was not shown at our cinema.</i>

86
00:08:15,583 --> 00:08:19,375
<i>Although the Scala
may look prettier than her sisters,</i>

87
00:08:19,458 --> 00:08:23,375
<i>I didn't feel that they were
so different on the inside.</i>

88
00:09:35,416 --> 00:09:37,291
Go, go.

89
00:09:40,083 --> 00:09:43,125
Stop.

90
00:09:46,833 --> 00:09:51,541
They've been here since 8:30 a.m.

91
00:09:53,583 --> 00:09:57,208
They didn't have the scaffoldings.
They just started taking them off.

92
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,583
Yes, but...

93
00:10:02,875 --> 00:10:05,583
Yes, someone's assisting him.

94
00:10:08,958 --> 00:10:11,333
Yes, it seems all right now.

95
00:10:17,458 --> 00:10:19,375
<i>At this corner
of the Siam cinema projection room,</i>

96
00:10:19,458 --> 00:10:21,791
<i>there was a door to our bedroom.</i>

97
00:10:22,625 --> 00:10:24,750
<i>Our bed lied underneath
the huge air tubes.</i>

98
00:10:25,583 --> 00:10:28,916
<i>My sheets were the same fabric
as the curtains at the cinema's entrance.</i>

99
00:10:29,666 --> 00:10:32,958
<i>I remember because I liked to run
and brush these curtains with my hands</i>

100
00:10:33,041 --> 00:10:36,083
<i>while waiting for The Royal Anthem to end
so I could enjoy the film right away.</i>

101
00:10:41,708 --> 00:10:44,541
They can't start pulling the curtains down
because it might rip something.

102
00:10:44,625 --> 00:10:46,583
- They're expensive curtains.
- There's a procedure!

103
00:10:46,666 --> 00:10:48,958
- They're fireproof.
- No, it's...

104
00:10:49,041 --> 00:10:51,791
- No, just remove the hoops!
- Right.

105
00:10:52,291 --> 00:10:53,625
- Ready?
- Okay!

106
00:10:54,458 --> 00:10:57,166
- I will do it in slow-motion, okay?
- Okay!

107
00:10:57,708 --> 00:11:00,458
One, two, three.

108
00:11:13,208 --> 00:11:17,416
Maybe it can be recycled
into a prosthetic leg.

109
00:11:18,291 --> 00:11:20,958
- No, it's metal.
- It can't be.

110
00:11:21,041 --> 00:11:23,166
- It's metal?
- Metal!

111
00:11:24,291 --> 00:11:25,333
It will rust.

112
00:11:25,416 --> 00:11:27,666
- I thought it was aluminum.
- You sure?

113
00:11:28,416 --> 00:11:29,708
Damn, it's metal.

114
00:11:29,791 --> 00:11:32,250
- You want to get tetanus?
- Right.

115
00:12:03,833 --> 00:12:06,125
- Where's Yod?
- Come here.

116
00:12:06,208 --> 00:12:08,875
- Why don't you turn the light on?
- Pull it.

117
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,333
Can we rest a bit?

118
00:12:26,333 --> 00:12:28,000
Let's take a break.

119
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:31,833
Let's take a break.

120
00:12:33,583 --> 00:12:35,625
How about pulling this way?

121
00:12:35,708 --> 00:12:37,708
No, you have to go in an angle that way.

122
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:50,750
The rope broke.

123
00:12:50,833 --> 00:12:52,541
Even the rope broke.

124
00:13:14,416 --> 00:13:15,666
That's the last of it.

125
00:13:17,833 --> 00:13:19,625
Just move the rest of the curtains.

126
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:02,041
Are you making a review video?

127
00:14:03,916 --> 00:14:06,583
No, more like a documentary film.

128
00:14:07,958 --> 00:14:09,583
It's sad, isn't it?

129
00:14:10,583 --> 00:14:14,208
Some say they used to come here
when they were a child.

130
00:14:14,958 --> 00:14:19,291
People in their 30s
saying they used to come to the Scala.

131
00:14:20,708 --> 00:14:24,250
Some older folks came here,
just realizing that it's being demolished,

132
00:14:24,916 --> 00:14:28,125
and would say they came here since
they were in their teens.

133
00:14:32,625 --> 00:14:36,666
Well, times changed.
Things have to change too.

134
00:14:37,708 --> 00:14:39,625
What was new became something newer.

135
00:15:00,208 --> 00:15:02,708
Your side down, that side lifts.

136
00:15:09,583 --> 00:15:11,583
- That side first.
- Lift.

137
00:15:13,750 --> 00:15:16,916
Don't lift yet! Don't lift yet!

138
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,000
If you're not ready, just don't do it.

139
00:15:21,875 --> 00:15:23,125
Wait, wait.

140
00:15:39,291 --> 00:15:41,166
No one below to catch?

141
00:16:14,583 --> 00:16:16,208
- No.
- No.

142
00:16:17,041 --> 00:16:19,708
Did you see that court order?

143
00:16:19,791 --> 00:16:24,083
The opposition party won the vote
but did not get a seat.

144
00:16:26,958 --> 00:16:30,750
Just because
he makes small merits with the monks.

145
00:16:32,500 --> 00:16:37,083
Now the election committee just revoked
his seat in the parliament.

146
00:16:53,291 --> 00:16:57,291
How much did Yod win in the lotto?

147
00:16:57,375 --> 00:16:58,625
Three hundred?

148
00:17:15,833 --> 00:17:17,833
- This?
- This one first.

149
00:17:18,416 --> 00:17:19,375
Take it here.

150
00:17:20,416 --> 00:17:21,916
Where to go?

151
00:17:23,833 --> 00:17:25,833
- Where?
- Right here.

152
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,208
It's just a frame.

153
00:17:54,166 --> 00:17:59,000
So, I went to work with uncle Saiyud
at the Siam theater.

154
00:18:03,333 --> 00:18:07,625
Back then, all the Siam staff had quit.

155
00:18:08,500 --> 00:18:10,416
I think it was Sompoj, right?

156
00:18:12,625 --> 00:18:13,666
Sompoj.

157
00:18:14,875 --> 00:18:17,958
I was sent to help Sompoj,

158
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:22,125
and then I came back here.

159
00:18:24,500 --> 00:18:28,000
I remember seeing you
walk to school back then.

160
00:18:30,958 --> 00:18:36,541
THIS SITE, THEREFORE, HOLDS A HISTORICAL
IMPORTANCE IN THAI FILM HISTORY.

161
00:18:36,625 --> 00:18:42,583
THIS PLAQUE WAS INSTALLED HERE
ON WORLD AUDIOVISUAL HERITAGE DAY.

162
00:18:42,666 --> 00:18:46,750
OCTOBER 27TH, 2019

163
00:19:18,208 --> 00:19:21,791
It was only after the cinema closed
that I know how to change the lights.

164
00:19:21,875 --> 00:19:26,583
- Let me see.
- And now I'm an electrician.

165
00:19:26,666 --> 00:19:28,541
You still got it.

166
00:19:28,625 --> 00:19:30,041
Yes, but getting soft now.

167
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,000
Just learning to be an electrician now.

168
00:19:33,083 --> 00:19:36,666
How disappointed my parents would be.

169
00:19:38,041 --> 00:19:42,375
They said that to Gen.

170
00:19:42,458 --> 00:19:45,333
That's all you get
from working in Bangkok?

171
00:19:45,416 --> 00:19:47,666
Hold this, then. Yes, climb up.

172
00:19:47,750 --> 00:19:50,666
- Pull?
- No, you hold it from the right. Yes.

173
00:19:52,041 --> 00:19:54,333
Hang on, give me a second.
Big hammer go up.

174
00:19:55,208 --> 00:19:56,625
Hold it like this

175
00:19:57,750 --> 00:19:59,166
- Hey.
- Hey.

176
00:19:59,250 --> 00:20:01,958
- Blackout again?
- Blackout again.

177
00:20:02,041 --> 00:20:03,916
- Just let it go. I can't see.
- Okay.

178
00:20:04,958 --> 00:20:07,750
I can't see. Can you see, Gap?

179
00:20:09,916 --> 00:20:11,875
Who hit the light switch?

180
00:20:21,833 --> 00:20:26,458
<i>The cinema employees were both Bangkokians
and people from other provinces.</i>

181
00:20:26,541 --> 00:20:28,916
<i>Most of them are probably
from the Northeastern region.</i>

182
00:20:30,041 --> 00:20:33,916
<i>When I first came,
I couldn't understand their dialect much.</i>

183
00:20:34,916 --> 00:20:37,375
<i>I started to understand after a while.</i>

184
00:20:39,500 --> 00:20:41,708
<i>Back when there were still
a lot of employees,</i>

185
00:20:41,791 --> 00:20:46,083
<i>at the end of the day, we would turn off
the air conditioners, close the doors,</i>

186
00:20:46,166 --> 00:20:48,458
<i>and spread out the sheet
to sleep in front of the screen.</i>

187
00:20:48,541 --> 00:20:50,791
<i>The air remained cool
until the next morning.</i>

188
00:20:52,583 --> 00:20:57,291
<i>We can talk about this...</i>

189
00:20:57,375 --> 00:20:59,125
<i>I love him because he said...</i>

190
00:20:59,208 --> 00:21:02,458
<i>it's not about gender...</i>

191
00:21:03,916 --> 00:21:07,375
Don't know who won the lottery.

192
00:21:07,458 --> 00:21:13,750
PEKING DUCK

193
00:21:26,125 --> 00:21:27,083
Gen and Nao.

194
00:21:27,916 --> 00:21:29,208
And...

195
00:21:29,291 --> 00:21:31,000
Lee and Apaiwong.

196
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:33,541
How about Arun?

197
00:21:33,625 --> 00:21:34,958
Nao and Yo.

198
00:21:35,041 --> 00:21:40,041
- Arun?
- Arun is reporting for unemployment.

199
00:21:45,416 --> 00:21:48,541
<i>I attended primary school
at Wat Pathum Wanaram.</i>

200
00:21:49,416 --> 00:21:52,958
<i>Most of my friends are descendants of
the people who work around the Siam area.</i>

201
00:21:53,041 --> 00:21:56,000
<i>Some of them have homes
in the slums next to the school.</i>

202
00:21:56,916 --> 00:21:59,041
<i>One day, when I was in fourth grade,</i>

203
00:21:59,833 --> 00:22:02,666
<i>a friend shouted
that my house was on fire.</i>

204
00:22:03,791 --> 00:22:07,458
<i>We saw a huge smoke
rising from Siam Square.</i>

205
00:22:07,541 --> 00:22:10,458
<i>But I think the smoke
was most likely coming from the Lido.</i>

206
00:22:11,416 --> 00:22:14,333
<i>After school,
I hurried back to the Siam cinema,</i>

207
00:22:14,416 --> 00:22:16,666
<i>and turns out it was safe.</i>

208
00:22:17,583 --> 00:22:23,250
<i>After the fire, the Lido was renovated
into a three-screen multiplex cinema.</i>

209
00:22:32,375 --> 00:22:34,666
Oh, your camera is set up already.

210
00:22:34,750 --> 00:22:36,458
- Have you eaten yet?
- No.

211
00:22:36,541 --> 00:22:39,625
No? Not hungry?

212
00:22:39,708 --> 00:22:40,833
I'll eat later.

213
00:22:40,916 --> 00:22:42,208
DO NOT ENTER WITHOUT PERMISSION

214
00:22:42,291 --> 00:22:45,625
I just bought bread
but gave it all to the others.

215
00:22:47,625 --> 00:22:49,000
You can use the toilet too.

216
00:22:50,916 --> 00:22:54,333
Come, have some hot Ovaltine.
It's still warm.

217
00:22:54,416 --> 00:22:55,583
Oh, thank you.

218
00:22:55,666 --> 00:22:57,625
Someone brought me this cookie.

219
00:22:58,333 --> 00:23:00,666
It's quite good. Crispy and yummy.

220
00:23:02,083 --> 00:23:04,625
It's their snack.
Aunt Sarai brought it for them.

221
00:23:04,708 --> 00:23:06,708
They won a lotto, so they brought some.

222
00:23:08,875 --> 00:23:10,333
They actually won the lotto.

223
00:23:10,416 --> 00:23:12,083
They are so cute. And clever too.

224
00:23:12,166 --> 00:23:15,666
They will give whatever you ask for.

225
00:23:18,791 --> 00:23:20,208
They're cute, aren't they?

226
00:23:22,250 --> 00:23:27,375
<i>Back then, the aunties in the office
would bring food just like this.</i>

227
00:23:28,375 --> 00:23:32,041
<i>Auntie Ree, the head of the ticket office,
liked making stewed eggs,</i>

228
00:23:32,125 --> 00:23:35,250
<i>while auntie Leka, the accountant,
always brought steamed buns.</i>

229
00:23:38,375 --> 00:23:43,333
<i>I spent most of the time with those
office aunties while Dad was at work.</i>

230
00:23:45,041 --> 00:23:48,291
<i>At first, it was them
who brought me to the cinema.</i>

231
00:23:48,958 --> 00:23:51,916
<i>Now that I've grown up,
I prefer to go alone.</i>

232
00:23:56,750 --> 00:24:01,958
OUTSIDERS ARE PROHIBITED FROM ENTERING.

233
00:24:05,250 --> 00:24:09,416
BIRDS OF PREY

234
00:24:09,500 --> 00:24:13,666
BIRDS OF PREY

235
00:24:13,750 --> 00:24:18,916
I'm almost 60 years old.
Who would hire someone this old?

236
00:24:22,375 --> 00:24:25,000
So there is a saying
that over the age of 50,

237
00:24:25,083 --> 00:24:26,875
one can only be a security guard.

238
00:24:27,833 --> 00:24:29,916
But I can't stay awake that long.

239
00:24:31,916 --> 00:24:33,250
Too exhausting.

240
00:24:34,291 --> 00:24:38,083
So I have to stay as long as possible
before everyone departs back home.

241
00:24:39,541 --> 00:24:41,666
Your father
started working here before me.

242
00:24:45,125 --> 00:24:46,875
Did my father use to work at Scala first?

243
00:24:46,958 --> 00:24:51,291
Your dad worked
at the APEX company right over there.

244
00:24:51,375 --> 00:24:52,416
He was...

245
00:24:53,333 --> 00:24:57,458
a programmer. He booked films.

246
00:24:58,041 --> 00:25:00,708
His duties were different.

247
00:25:00,791 --> 00:25:04,958
Your dad's office was over there.
APEX was there.

248
00:25:05,041 --> 00:25:08,166
He took the film
to the censorship department,

249
00:25:08,250 --> 00:25:10,583
then to the film labs,
and then to the cinemas.

250
00:25:12,541 --> 00:25:17,541
But I started as an usher.

251
00:25:17,625 --> 00:25:20,000
I used to wear the yellow jackets.

252
00:25:20,083 --> 00:25:22,416
I'm that old.

253
00:25:22,500 --> 00:25:26,666
From usher to the chief.

254
00:25:27,375 --> 00:25:29,000
It took me 51 years.

255
00:25:31,375 --> 00:25:34,791
Back then, we were just like any teenager.

256
00:25:35,833 --> 00:25:40,458
We ate, drank, and hung out,
just like any normal teenager.

257
00:25:41,791 --> 00:25:45,416
And your mom worked
at the snack bar in her yellow uniform.

258
00:25:56,708 --> 00:25:59,000
The rope can't take the weight.

259
00:26:00,708 --> 00:26:03,625
It'll cut your hand if you pull it.

260
00:26:03,708 --> 00:26:07,000
- This is dangerous work, you know.
- Be careful.

261
00:26:26,583 --> 00:26:31,333
We all came after it opened.
How could we know?

262
00:26:31,416 --> 00:26:36,333
Even Gap's dad didn't know.
He came after the cinema opened.

263
00:26:36,416 --> 00:26:38,083
- After the cinema opened?
- Yes.

264
00:26:38,166 --> 00:26:41,166
Who knows who built this screen.

265
00:26:42,625 --> 00:26:46,916
But the guy
who brought the chandelier might know.

266
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:49,291
- Right, the owner of this thing.
- Girl.

267
00:26:49,375 --> 00:26:51,333
- Yes, the chandelier's owner.
- I saw...

268
00:26:51,416 --> 00:26:54,083
I saw him on the last day
of the screening. He could barely walk.

269
00:26:54,166 --> 00:26:56,375
Yes, he is that generation.

270
00:26:56,458 --> 00:27:00,125
Pull it away, Nao, Yod.

271
00:27:00,208 --> 00:27:02,416
Pull away. It's stuck here.

272
00:27:05,208 --> 00:27:06,708
Go sideways.

273
00:27:09,375 --> 00:27:13,041
Hey, do you mind if I ask you something?
Have you met your mother?

274
00:27:13,125 --> 00:27:14,625
- No.
- No?

275
00:27:14,708 --> 00:27:18,041
- Not since you were very young, right?
- Have you ever met my mother?

276
00:27:18,125 --> 00:27:22,166
Yes, I used to visit her at her house.

277
00:27:22,250 --> 00:27:24,666
The house near the mosque.

278
00:27:25,458 --> 00:27:30,208
I remember your mother had very fair skin.

279
00:27:30,291 --> 00:27:32,916
- She is from Phetchaburi, right?
- I don't know.

280
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:34,750
Don't you know?

281
00:27:34,833 --> 00:27:36,250
I've seen her live there.

282
00:27:38,583 --> 00:27:39,833
Disassemble this first.

283
00:27:39,916 --> 00:27:42,583
- Come here first.
- Shall I disassemble it?

284
00:27:43,791 --> 00:27:45,750
Can it disassemble?
Or should we move it like that?

285
00:27:45,833 --> 00:27:47,000
It can't.

286
00:27:55,958 --> 00:27:57,125
Move it.

287
00:28:00,125 --> 00:28:01,750
Where's that cat that likes taking photos?

288
00:28:01,833 --> 00:28:04,000
Probably got startled and ran away.

289
00:28:13,041 --> 00:28:16,958
<i>There were two large windows
in the Siam cinema office.</i>

290
00:28:17,041 --> 00:28:20,083
<i>From there,
you can see almost everyone downstairs.</i>

291
00:28:21,041 --> 00:28:23,416
<i>Next to the window was a table.</i>

292
00:28:23,500 --> 00:28:26,250
<i>There were six phones on the table.</i>

293
00:28:27,208 --> 00:28:30,375
<i>When it rang and no one was around,</i>

294
00:28:30,458 --> 00:28:33,625
<i>I would answer
and give some general information,</i>

295
00:28:33,708 --> 00:28:36,041
<i>such as the showtimes.</i>

296
00:28:37,625 --> 00:28:40,708
<i>One day,
auntie Ree brought me to that window.</i>

297
00:28:40,791 --> 00:28:43,958
<i>She pointed down to the popcorn cabinet
and asked if I could see my mom.</i>

298
00:28:44,041 --> 00:28:45,791
<i>""She's standing right there.""</i>

299
00:28:47,083 --> 00:28:49,750
<i>I think I was becoming short-sighted then.</i>

300
00:28:50,750 --> 00:28:53,750
<i>All I saw was a blurry shape of a person.</i>

301
00:28:53,833 --> 00:28:57,083
<i>Auntie Ree also told me not to tell
my father about what had just happened.</i>

302
00:28:58,875 --> 00:29:01,750
<i>I was very curious
what would happen if he found out.</i>

303
00:29:02,583 --> 00:29:06,666
<i>So I told him
after he came back from work.</i>

304
00:29:07,625 --> 00:29:09,666
<i>He just left the room immediately.</i>

305
00:29:09,750 --> 00:29:12,166
<i>I never heard about my mother ever again.</i>

306
00:29:20,875 --> 00:29:22,375
It's burning.

307
00:29:36,208 --> 00:29:39,416
I can't fix this.

308
00:29:43,375 --> 00:29:44,583
You full already?

309
00:29:50,958 --> 00:29:54,208
Thirty-nine years.
If this was a big company...

310
00:29:54,291 --> 00:29:58,333
by now, I would have been
compensated enough to be rich.

311
00:29:58,416 --> 00:30:00,583
Why did you choose to work here?

312
00:30:01,666 --> 00:30:03,250
I didn't have an education.

313
00:30:04,791 --> 00:30:08,541
I didn't pursue an education back then.
I only finished the 4th grade.

314
00:30:08,625 --> 00:30:13,916
At that time, 30 or 40 years ago.

315
00:30:16,375 --> 00:30:22,333
Without any educational background,
I have to do whatever I can.

316
00:30:23,541 --> 00:30:29,458
I thought about leaving,
but there weren't any other jobs.

317
00:30:29,541 --> 00:30:36,000
I had no education or credentials.
Nothing to build upon.

318
00:30:37,333 --> 00:30:42,000
I had no choice. Nowhere to go.

319
00:30:42,083 --> 00:30:43,916
So I have to stay as long as I can.

320
00:30:46,541 --> 00:30:48,416
Long enough until I became the chief.

321
00:30:50,958 --> 00:30:53,666
From usher to the chief.

322
00:31:06,833 --> 00:31:10,458
Oh, didn't see you there.

323
00:31:16,541 --> 00:31:18,833
It's so dark today.

324
00:31:21,666 --> 00:31:24,041
- Isn't that a 50-Satang coin?
- Wow, a coin.

325
00:31:24,125 --> 00:31:26,125
Move the light, move the light.

326
00:31:27,166 --> 00:31:29,208
There's my one Baht.

327
00:31:30,666 --> 00:31:33,333
Got only a Baht today.

328
00:31:33,416 --> 00:31:35,833
Yesterday, I found a ten Baht coin.

329
00:31:38,583 --> 00:31:41,666
Like picking coins
from a Krathong at the festival.

330
00:31:47,916 --> 00:31:49,666
Is that a cigarette butt?

331
00:31:49,750 --> 00:31:51,375
Since when?

332
00:31:51,458 --> 00:31:55,791
- Around 30 years?
- It was legal 30, 40 years ago.

333
00:31:57,333 --> 00:32:00,291
People in the past were able
to smoke cigarettes in movie theaters.

334
00:32:00,375 --> 00:32:03,291
The ban on smoking in cinemas
was only passed in 1979.

335
00:32:03,375 --> 00:32:05,791
Before that,
they hadn't banned smoking in cinemas yet.

336
00:32:10,875 --> 00:32:12,625
Please tell
those three-fingered protesters

337
00:32:12,708 --> 00:32:14,500
to go to Ratchadamnoen Road.

338
00:32:16,666 --> 00:32:19,875
No, they already changed their plans.

339
00:32:19,958 --> 00:32:21,750
They are coming here.

340
00:32:24,083 --> 00:32:28,708
See? They turn the police into clowns.

341
00:32:28,791 --> 00:32:32,916
After 10:00 p.m., the protesters go home.
What can the police do?

342
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:37,791
Spend 200 million Baht
to chase protestors like this?

343
00:32:39,333 --> 00:32:43,916
- They took the soldiers from everywhere.
- And who knows how many soldiers came.

344
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:48,291
- What a waste of money.
- Yes, a waste of money. They said...

345
00:32:48,375 --> 00:32:50,666
Be careful not to talk about politics.

346
00:32:52,250 --> 00:32:55,125
Cut it out of the film, okay, Gap?

347
00:32:55,208 --> 00:32:57,791
I guess I've already sworn a lot anyways.

348
00:33:07,875 --> 00:33:11,041
- I can't even catch my breath.
- Again? Watch your head.

349
00:33:18,208 --> 00:33:19,750
Watch yourselves. Watch yourselves.

350
00:33:19,833 --> 00:33:21,416
Don't pass through yet.

351
00:33:22,250 --> 00:33:23,666
How reckless.

352
00:33:29,916 --> 00:33:32,208
Put it down, now.

353
00:33:39,625 --> 00:33:41,041
Let it go.

354
00:33:41,833 --> 00:33:43,333
We'll see it later.

355
00:33:52,708 --> 00:33:55,166
Why don't you just let it go?

356
00:33:55,250 --> 00:33:56,791
It might hit someone.

357
00:33:56,875 --> 00:33:59,375
Well, that's their fault.

358
00:34:05,583 --> 00:34:08,083
<i>This person looks like uncle Vinai.</i>

359
00:34:08,166 --> 00:34:11,125
<i>Since COVID-19,
I can hardly recognize people's faces.</i>

360
00:34:12,500 --> 00:34:15,041
<i>I often ran into him
when my father took me for breakfast</i>

361
00:34:15,125 --> 00:34:17,708
<i>at the Chula University's
Dentistry faculty Canteen.</i>

362
00:34:18,416 --> 00:34:19,791
<i>Besides the canteen,</i>

363
00:34:19,875 --> 00:34:23,416
<i>there was an alley behind Bangkok Bank
just next to Siam Cinema</i>

364
00:34:23,500 --> 00:34:25,875
<i>and the allies by the Scala,</i>

365
00:34:25,958 --> 00:34:28,166
<i>where people
who work around here ate regularly</i>

366
00:34:28,250 --> 00:34:29,666
<i>since the price is not so expensive.</i>

367
00:34:30,541 --> 00:34:34,291
<i>The rest are more restaurants
for tourists and shoppers.</i>

368
00:34:40,708 --> 00:34:43,000
Come on, breakfast.

369
00:34:43,833 --> 00:34:45,333
Rice noodles.

370
00:34:46,500 --> 00:34:48,708
Grab a plate and join me.

371
00:34:49,583 --> 00:34:51,583
Not eating? Are you sure?

372
00:34:52,833 --> 00:34:55,250
You'll regret it.

373
00:34:55,333 --> 00:34:56,666
I had a banana.

374
00:34:56,750 --> 00:34:57,875
All right.

375
00:35:18,583 --> 00:35:21,625
<i>If I remember correctly,
my first time visiting the Scala</i>

376
00:35:21,708 --> 00:35:25,791
<i>was when my aunt brought me here
for the owner's birthday party.</i>

377
00:35:25,875 --> 00:35:28,333
<i>It was a Western-Chinese-style restaurant.</i>

378
00:35:28,416 --> 00:35:30,333
<i>The recommended menu was Peking Duck.</i>

379
00:35:31,791 --> 00:35:35,500
<i>Sometimes, the head of the cinema
would bring the Scala's Peking duck ribs</i>

380
00:35:35,583 --> 00:35:38,458
<i>to fry with garlic and pepper
and ate it along with liquor</i>

381
00:35:38,541 --> 00:35:40,041
<i>on the Siam cinema rooftop.</i>

382
00:35:41,833 --> 00:35:45,625
<i>Later, a Siam Skytrain station was built.</i>

383
00:35:45,708 --> 00:35:48,333
<i>The platform is as high as the rooftop,</i>

384
00:35:49,125 --> 00:35:53,166
<i>and the passengers who waited
for the train could see us all.</i>

385
00:35:53,250 --> 00:35:55,458
<i>Since then,
I rarely went out to the roof again.</i>

386
00:35:57,083 --> 00:35:58,541
Put it up.

387
00:36:20,916 --> 00:36:23,625
He worked too much.

388
00:36:24,458 --> 00:36:26,083
He has pain in his legs.

389
00:36:51,375 --> 00:36:54,000
Where were you yesterday?

390
00:36:54,083 --> 00:36:55,583
I was sick.

391
00:36:59,291 --> 00:37:00,916
Stomach ache?

392
00:37:06,666 --> 00:37:13,666
At least, I have land at home upcountry.
My house is there.

393
00:37:14,875 --> 00:37:17,833
I'm here just for work.

394
00:37:17,916 --> 00:37:20,500
I have a house here, too,

395
00:37:20,583 --> 00:37:26,000
but my land is back there.

396
00:37:31,250 --> 00:37:32,833
What province?

397
00:37:32,916 --> 00:37:33,958
Kalasin.

398
00:37:35,333 --> 00:37:37,750
It's far. Have you ever been? I guess not.

399
00:37:38,916 --> 00:37:40,000
You might get lost.

400
00:37:50,208 --> 00:37:54,875
<i>In the cinema, there was a row
of chairs called spare chairs.</i>

401
00:37:54,958 --> 00:37:58,416
<i>It was a row of chairs reserved in case
of any ticket problems,</i>

402
00:37:58,500 --> 00:38:01,333
<i>such as duplicate seat numbers.</i>

403
00:38:01,416 --> 00:38:06,375
<i>They are among
the most expensive seat in the back rows.</i>

404
00:38:06,458 --> 00:38:10,041
<i>Any employee who wanted
to watch a movie could sit there.</i>

405
00:38:10,125 --> 00:38:12,250
<i>I sat there as well.</i>

406
00:38:13,250 --> 00:38:18,041
<i>In the past, some movies were so popular
that they had to add extra chairs.</i>

407
00:38:18,833 --> 00:38:23,458
<i>I had to wait until fewer people came
before I could get back to my row.</i>

408
00:38:25,083 --> 00:38:28,500
<i>Sometimes they forbade me
to see certain films.</i>

409
00:38:28,583 --> 00:38:31,791
<i>But I would see it anyways just by
sitting quietly behind the projector.</i>

410
00:38:45,833 --> 00:38:48,916
Gap, who is the protagonist of your film?

411
00:38:50,083 --> 00:38:52,375
Or is it all of us?

412
00:38:54,583 --> 00:38:56,583
And that's the last person.

413
00:38:56,666 --> 00:38:57,916
The last chair.

414
00:39:00,166 --> 00:39:01,958
The last chair is done.

415
00:39:11,958 --> 00:39:15,000
<i>Lately, people don't come
to see movies like before</i>

416
00:39:15,083 --> 00:39:17,541
<i>Now they rent to watch at home.</i>

417
00:39:18,125 --> 00:39:20,458
<i>Or see a movie at the mall.</i>

418
00:39:20,541 --> 00:39:23,208
<i>Sometimes there was
only one person watching.</i>

419
00:39:24,375 --> 00:39:28,958
<i>When this started to happen more often,
they would have to cancel whole showtimes.</i>

420
00:39:29,041 --> 00:39:32,166
<i>The head of the cinema would then
have to apologize and refund the audience.</i>

421
00:39:36,583 --> 00:39:40,250
There's a huge air tube
above your bed in the Siam theater.

422
00:39:40,333 --> 00:39:44,250
The big air conditioner engine
is down there.

423
00:39:45,125 --> 00:39:46,625
It's an air vent.

424
00:39:47,375 --> 00:39:49,583
So cool air gets in here

425
00:39:50,666 --> 00:39:53,083
and goes over there. That's what we used.

426
00:39:53,166 --> 00:39:59,041
But at Siam,
that room is actually a cold room.

427
00:39:59,125 --> 00:40:01,541
That's why
there's a big tube over your bed.

428
00:40:09,208 --> 00:40:12,916
Yes, I know it's Yai's car,
but he'll drop by and shop first.

429
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:15,041
OUTSIDERS ARE PROHIBITED FROM ENTERING.

430
00:40:15,125 --> 00:40:17,416
No, I mean it's Yai's car, not a big car.

431
00:40:18,708 --> 00:40:22,083
- He's not come yet.
- No, he's coming later.

432
00:40:22,166 --> 00:40:23,666
It's a homonym.

433
00:40:23,750 --> 00:40:27,083
- So it's Yai's car, not a big car, huh?
- Okay, I get it.

434
00:40:27,166 --> 00:40:28,500
I know, I know.

435
00:40:28,583 --> 00:40:30,833
But they don't.

436
00:40:30,916 --> 00:40:32,583
They don't understand.

437
00:40:32,666 --> 00:40:34,166
Big car and Yai's car.

438
00:40:34,250 --> 00:40:35,916
It's different.

439
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:37,666
They'll get confused.

440
00:41:05,500 --> 00:41:07,625
The bread is moldy. Don't eat it.

441
00:41:39,708 --> 00:41:42,458
MONEY IS NOT VALUABLE.

442
00:41:42,541 --> 00:41:45,333
IT'S ALL USED UP ON BILLS,
ON KIDS, AND ON FOOD.

443
00:41:56,083 --> 00:41:57,708
It's 9:00 a.m. already.

444
00:41:59,250 --> 00:42:01,875
Take the air conditioner out now.

445
00:42:38,333 --> 00:42:40,791
That's good soil.

446
00:42:41,833 --> 00:42:44,166
- That plant helps with Gastritis.
- Oh, right.

447
00:42:45,541 --> 00:42:47,875
Would be good with curry.

448
00:43:00,708 --> 00:43:03,041
Do you want some turmeric?

449
00:43:03,125 --> 00:43:05,750
No, my land is all covered in concrete.

450
00:43:07,291 --> 00:43:10,458
And mine has no sun. Nothing grows.

451
00:43:11,416 --> 00:43:13,666
You can grow it again. I think...

452
00:43:13,750 --> 00:43:16,291
That's Nodding Clerodendrum.
But don't take it.

453
00:43:18,625 --> 00:43:23,416
Yan must think it was Chom's plant.
So he doesn't want to risk it.

454
00:43:23,500 --> 00:43:28,666
- Remember how Chom gets mad?
- When he curses, I can't bear to listen.

455
00:43:28,750 --> 00:43:32,416
- I can't catch up with what he says.
- Is that a Santol?

456
00:43:32,500 --> 00:43:38,791
- No, no need to take that.
- Would you like this turmeric?

457
00:43:38,875 --> 00:43:40,041
No.

458
00:43:40,125 --> 00:43:42,791
Why would I? It will just turn into junk.

459
00:43:42,875 --> 00:43:45,208
- Take this one.
- Don't have.

460
00:43:45,291 --> 00:43:48,708
Why take out the clothesline?
I still have to do laundry.

461
00:43:48,791 --> 00:43:54,750
- Put the clothesline back now.
- Calm down, I'll fix it.

462
00:43:54,833 --> 00:43:56,791
Take this right away.

463
00:43:56,875 --> 00:43:59,125
You can put it back. Calm down.

464
00:43:59,208 --> 00:44:02,250
<i>After the Tom Yum Kung financial crisis
in 1997,</i>

465
00:44:02,333 --> 00:44:04,875
<i>Chulalongkorn University, the landowner,</i>

466
00:44:04,958 --> 00:44:07,916
<i>increased the rent exponentially
every year.</i>

467
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:11,625
<i>The initial ten-year lease
was changed to a one-year lease.</i>

468
00:44:12,625 --> 00:44:15,083
<i>A movie that used to screen
for over a week.</i>

469
00:44:15,166 --> 00:44:18,208
<i>Now they have to
show multiple movies in one day.</i>

470
00:44:18,291 --> 00:44:21,708
The popcorn that used to be sold in front
of the cinema is no longer being sold.

471
00:44:21,791 --> 00:44:23,041
They sell only snacks instead.

472
00:44:23,125 --> 00:44:26,458
The younger employees
would quit to find other prospects.

473
00:44:27,291 --> 00:44:28,666
My dad got a new job.

474
00:44:29,375 --> 00:44:31,583
Auntie Ree left
to look after her grandchildren.

475
00:44:31,666 --> 00:44:34,041
As for me, I moved in with auntie Leka

476
00:44:34,125 --> 00:44:37,083
not long before the coup d'état in 2006.

477
00:45:02,291 --> 00:45:06,708
That is such a white shirt.

478
00:45:09,708 --> 00:45:13,458
He's snooping around.

479
00:45:14,458 --> 00:45:17,833
Ning, see? He walked this way.

480
00:45:20,083 --> 00:45:24,458
Ning, go check the other camera at
the stairs for me, but at this exact time.

481
00:45:25,916 --> 00:45:28,125
Here, the stairs, this camera.

482
00:45:28,208 --> 00:45:29,916
Camera number 28, then.

483
00:45:30,625 --> 00:45:31,458
Here. Play backward.

484
00:45:31,541 --> 00:45:33,583
Let me see the time first.

485
00:45:33,666 --> 00:45:36,916
He's wearing trousers.
Is he a driver trying to wake someone?

486
00:45:37,916 --> 00:45:39,125
- Here. Right here.
- Well...

487
00:45:39,833 --> 00:45:42,125
Come, come.

488
00:45:42,208 --> 00:45:43,541
He looks like Mr. Apaiwong.

489
00:45:43,625 --> 00:45:44,541
What?

490
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:51,541
I was on duty there.

491
00:45:51,625 --> 00:45:53,250
Stop and play.

492
00:45:53,333 --> 00:45:57,041
- This camera.
- At 5:29 a.m., who's that?

493
00:45:59,500 --> 00:46:02,833
- There's the phone. There.
- Looks like Miss Wang.

494
00:46:02,916 --> 00:46:05,750
- Who is that?
- She went down the stairs.

495
00:46:29,541 --> 00:46:31,416
Only three milk left.

496
00:46:33,833 --> 00:46:34,958
I didn't drink it.

497
00:46:35,041 --> 00:46:36,541
Drink it, then.

498
00:46:36,625 --> 00:46:40,125
If you're afraid it'll run out, drink it.

499
00:46:58,625 --> 00:47:01,333
One bag of sticky rice
is not enough anymore.

500
00:47:03,541 --> 00:47:05,208
How many do you need, then?

501
00:47:07,916 --> 00:47:09,000
Five Baht, right?

502
00:47:09,083 --> 00:47:12,625
Ten Baht per.
What sticky rice costs five Baht anyway?

503
00:47:15,500 --> 00:47:17,833
When was the last time
you had a five Baht sticky rice?

504
00:47:19,375 --> 00:47:21,583
I can buy at this price
because of those government apps.

505
00:47:22,541 --> 00:47:24,375
It was only ten Baht.

506
00:47:26,208 --> 00:47:28,375
No way it's ten Baht without that app.

507
00:47:29,125 --> 00:47:33,083
So that's five Baht.
The government pays five Baht.

508
00:47:33,166 --> 00:47:37,125
- What is this?
- What? What's up?

509
00:47:37,208 --> 00:47:40,416
It says,
""You've got a pillow. Let's go to bed.""

510
00:47:40,500 --> 00:47:41,541
Let's shop.

511
00:47:42,458 --> 00:47:45,833
- Oh, shopping, huh?
- Again?

512
00:47:45,916 --> 00:47:47,916
<i>So that the officers can follow up</i>

513
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:51,000
<i>and arrest
the criminals for further prosecution...</i>

514
00:47:51,083 --> 00:47:52,666
And that's uncle Gen's house.

515
00:47:54,166 --> 00:47:55,333
Want some bananas?

516
00:47:57,083 --> 00:48:02,791
<i>Down with Feudalism, Long live the People!</i>

517
00:48:02,875 --> 00:48:09,875
<i>Down with Feudalism, Long live the People!</i>

518
00:48:09,958 --> 00:48:13,583
<i>Down with Feudalism, Long live the People!</i>

519
00:48:43,625 --> 00:48:44,791
Take this first.

520
00:48:46,416 --> 00:48:49,000
And then see
what all we can load on the truck.

521
00:48:52,541 --> 00:48:55,125
Yod. The coil, take it.

522
00:49:00,583 --> 00:49:02,333
Okay, just put it down.

523
00:49:45,125 --> 00:49:46,125
Has the truck come yet?

524
00:49:46,208 --> 00:49:47,166
Not yet.

525
00:49:59,041 --> 00:50:00,416
Can't wait for the rope.

526
00:50:01,500 --> 00:50:08,250
- Be careful, don't rush. Take it easy.
- The middle.

527
00:50:08,333 --> 00:50:09,625
Okay, right?

528
00:50:09,708 --> 00:50:12,375
That piece is for you anyway.

529
00:50:41,833 --> 00:50:43,916
Put it down.

530
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:46,625
- Go, go.
- Take the papers.

531
00:50:46,708 --> 00:50:48,375
Wrap them with the papers.

532
00:50:48,458 --> 00:50:50,250
Wrap them with two sheets of paper.

533
00:50:51,083 --> 00:50:52,750
Got to sleep today.

534
00:50:57,625 --> 00:50:58,750
- Drive to...
- Wait, wait.

535
00:52:12,666 --> 00:52:13,958
Shit.

536
00:52:15,791 --> 00:52:18,875
The whole fucking thing came down.

537
00:52:42,500 --> 00:52:45,625
<i>One evening in May 2010,</i>

538
00:52:45,708 --> 00:52:48,875
<i>I heard the news on television
that the Siam cinema was on fire.</i>

539
00:52:49,583 --> 00:52:52,666
<i>There were red-shirt protests rallying
at Ratchaprasong Intersection</i>

540
00:52:52,750 --> 00:52:57,125
<i>demanding Prime Minister
Abhisit's resignation since March.</i>

541
00:52:59,625 --> 00:53:03,416
<i>It was the last day
of the military crackdown.</i>

542
00:53:03,500 --> 00:53:07,833
<i>Live ammunition
was used to disperse the assembly,</i>

543
00:53:07,916 --> 00:53:11,000
<i>which resulted in at least 99 deaths.</i>

544
00:53:11,958 --> 00:53:15,125
<i>To this day, no one knows
who burned down Siam Cinema.</i>

545
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:18,791
<i>Later on, the Siam cinema
became a new department store.</i>

546
00:53:18,875 --> 00:53:22,166
<i>Auntie Leka didn't go back
to work ever again.</i>

547
00:53:22,250 --> 00:53:25,333
<i>When the Lido's lease expired in 2018,</i>

548
00:53:25,416 --> 00:53:28,916
<i>the remaining staff from both cinemas
went to work at the Scala,</i>

549
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:30,541
<i>the last standalone cinema.</i>

550
00:54:50,166 --> 00:54:52,791
I beg them not to remove the handrail yet.

551
00:54:52,875 --> 00:54:54,958
How am I getting up there, then?

552
00:54:55,041 --> 00:54:56,833
We said to do it later.

553
00:55:00,166 --> 00:55:01,375
Miss Peak, hello.

554
00:55:01,458 --> 00:55:02,416
Hello.

555
00:55:08,333 --> 00:55:10,833
They're here. Don't step on the wire.

556
00:55:10,916 --> 00:55:12,416
Careful not to trip.

557
00:55:16,166 --> 00:55:17,708
Here they come. Good.

558
00:55:58,416 --> 00:56:01,500
Have you seen your father lately?

559
00:56:01,583 --> 00:56:04,416
I just realized you are his daughter.

560
00:56:04,500 --> 00:56:07,791
So, have you seen him recently?

561
00:56:08,875 --> 00:56:12,875
So you lived
with miss Leka after that, right?

562
00:56:18,125 --> 00:56:20,583
Please tell your father
that Peak misses him.

563
00:56:20,666 --> 00:56:22,833
I used to be close to him.

564
00:56:22,916 --> 00:56:26,833
Tell him I am the Lido's accountant.

565
00:56:26,916 --> 00:56:29,166
We used to be close.

566
00:56:56,541 --> 00:56:58,333
What do you do for a living?

567
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:01,791
I make documentaries.

568
00:57:01,875 --> 00:57:03,500
Documentaries?

569
00:57:06,916 --> 00:57:10,541
Sometimes, I take photos at weddings.

570
00:57:15,250 --> 00:57:16,750
Is it okay?

571
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:19,666
Is it hard to make a living?

572
00:57:21,041 --> 00:57:23,208
With everything going on now, it's hard.

573
00:57:23,291 --> 00:57:26,916
I ask because I see people
selling things on live streaming.

574
00:57:27,791 --> 00:57:29,250
Is it hard?

575
00:57:30,333 --> 00:57:33,500
Well, not really. Any camera will do.

576
00:57:33,583 --> 00:57:35,250
Phone cameras?

577
00:57:35,333 --> 00:57:37,375
Yes, Front camera phones and internet.

578
00:57:41,125 --> 00:57:44,125
It's all about the product, right?

579
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:50,625
I'm tired.

580
00:57:50,708 --> 00:57:52,666
What are you going to sell?

581
00:57:52,750 --> 00:57:55,666
That's just it. I don't have any products.

582
00:59:31,750 --> 00:59:35,666
<i>Prayut, get out! Prayut, get out!</i>

583
00:59:35,750 --> 00:59:39,708
<i>Prayut, get out! Prayut, get out!</i>

584
00:59:39,791 --> 00:59:44,750
<i>Prawit, get out! Prawit, get out!</i>

585
01:00:31,333 --> 01:00:34,666
<i>Brothers and sisters.</i>

586
01:00:34,750 --> 01:00:37,250
<i>Free our friends.</i>

587
01:00:37,333 --> 01:00:39,416
<i>Draft a new constitution.</i>

588
01:00:39,500 --> 01:00:41,791
<i>Abolish 112.</i>

589
01:00:41,875 --> 01:00:48,708
<i>Prayut, get out! Prayut, get out!
Prayut must get out!</i>

590
01:03:27,666 --> 01:03:30,625
THE SIAM CINEMA'S FIRST FILM SCREENING
WAS ON DECEMBER 15TH, 1966

591
01:03:30,708 --> 01:03:33,958
IT BURNED DOWN ON MAY 19TH, 2010.

592
01:03:34,041 --> 01:03:36,958
DURING THE MILITARY CRACKDOWN
ON RED-SHIRT PROTESTERS.

593
01:03:38,625 --> 01:03:42,875
THE LIDO CINEMA'S FIRST FILM SCREENING
WAS ON JUNE 27TH, 1968.

594
01:03:42,958 --> 01:03:46,416
IT CAUGHT FIRE ON MARCH 16TH, 1993

595
01:03:46,500 --> 01:03:51,958
AND WAS LATER RENOVATED
INTO THREE-SCREEN MULTIPLEXES.

596
01:03:54,125 --> 01:03:58,666
SCALA THEATER'S FIRST FILM SCREENING
WAS ON JANUARY 31ST, 1969.

597
01:03:58,750 --> 01:04:01,291
ITS FINAL FILM SCREENING
WAS ON JULY 5TH, 2020.

598
01:04:01,375 --> 01:04:03,708
AFTER DISMANTLING
THE CINEMA'S KEY COMPONENTS

599
01:04:03,791 --> 01:04:04,958
AND CLOSING DOWN THE BUSINESS,

600
01:04:05,041 --> 01:04:07,541
THE PROPERTY
RETURNED TO CHULALONGKORN UNIVERSITY.

601
01:04:09,125 --> 01:04:15,000
THE REST OF THE BUILDING WAS DEMOLISHED
ON OCTOBER 31ST, 2021.

"
The Judgement,https://yts-subs.com/movie-imdb/tt6851410,https://yts-subs.com/subtitles/the-judgement-2021-english-yify-489990,"1
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:24,280
In the name of the Father,
the Son and the Holy Spirit.

2
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:25,960
Amen.

3
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:33,320
We are gathered here
in memory of...

4
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:38,560
Jacqueline Jeantina Eugenia
Gerarda Wittenberg-Willemen.

5
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:41,959
Widow of Willem Cornelis Wittenberg.

6
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:47,248
A memory of an intensely involved
and caring person...

7
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:51,404
and to an almost
incomprehensible event.

8
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:53,200
A murder.

9
00:02:04,395 --> 00:02:08,520
Mr Louwes, what
do you expect from today?

10
00:02:09,320 --> 00:02:10,320
Sure.

11
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:17,680
- What do you expect from the verdict?
- Do you still believe in it?

12
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:20,160
Mr Louwes, are you nervous?

13
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:24,600
Mr Louwes.

14
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:29,520
- What will you hear today?
- Eh, acquittal of course.

15
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:33,600
I still can't believe it.
- No.

16
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:36,040
She was such a sweet person. -Yes.

17
00:02:39,166 --> 00:02:44,200
- Michael must be having a hard time.
- Yes, she was like a mother to him.

18
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:48,000
Ladies and gentlemen, the court.

19
00:02:56,880 --> 00:03:01,720
Then you ask yourself: are the police
doing anything? I live opposite her.

20
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:05,960
No one has been at the door.
- The family also doesn't know anything.

21
00:03:06,559 --> 00:03:10,137
She was killed on Thursday and
they didn't find her until Saturday.

22
00:03:10,262 --> 00:03:11,582
In the living room.

23
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:16,520
The court finds proven...

24
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:22,240
that the accused intentionally and
premeditatedly assaulted the victim...

25
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:26,040
No, I haven't, ma'am.
- Let me finish.

26
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:28,117
...deprived of life.

27
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:29,600
Sorry for your loss.

28
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:36,720
- My condolences to you too...
- We are friends of the family.

29
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:43,320
Who was that?

30
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:47,960
Jaqueline's
financial advisor, Louwes.

31
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:54,880
The verdict therefore reads: the court
maintains, with improvement of grounds..

32
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:59,560
the judgment of the Court of Appeal
in Arnhem of 22 December 2000.

33
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:02,280
The court orders the arrest of
the accused.

34
00:04:02,399 --> 00:04:06,239
You just continue with all the
falsified arguments of the police.

35
00:04:06,367 --> 00:04:07,719
Mister Louwes...

36
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,469
You wipe everything away.

37
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:15,120
I understand your emotion,
but I haven't finished speaking yet.

38
00:04:15,357 --> 00:04:21,333
You have two weeks to appeal to
the Supreme Court of the Netherlands.

39
00:04:21,520 --> 00:04:24,680
- You know you are wrong.
- Are you coming with me?

40
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:28,720
No, I'm not coming. No, I'm going...

41
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:30,040
I'm not going. Damn.

42
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:34,040
The photos and the cameras
are now stopped.

43
00:04:38,749 --> 00:04:42,140
The Judgement

44
00:04:45,359 --> 00:04:47,636
2 years earlier

45
00:04:50,838 --> 00:04:53,520
Yes, but could you please
put me through?

46
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:58,041
How so? I didn't come up with it.

47
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:02,000
I'm just stating the facts.
The facts, yes.

48
00:05:03,942 --> 00:05:06,600
Haan, could it be a little quieter?

49
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:13,152
How do I get that information?
I'm not going to tell you that

50
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:16,161
Never heard of source protection?

51
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:17,960
Hello?

52
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:19,280
Hello?

53
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:23,920
Dicknose

54
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:31,680
- Did you catch that guy yet?
- No, the same all the time.

55
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:34,280
I ask for comments,
they tell me how I got that information.

56
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:38,000
I can't say that and so on.
They don't even put me through.

57
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:40,240
- And your source has nothing on paper?
- No.

58
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:43,240
Do you like soup? -No thanks.

59
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:45,480
Bas, do you like soup? -Delicious.

60
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:49,640
Maybe a colleague can confirm? -Hey.

61
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:53,903
Do you really think he will be
Prime Minister?

62
00:05:54,552 --> 00:05:56,825
I'd be surprised if he doesn't.

63
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:00,482
But with whom can he form a coalition?

64
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:03,779
Melkert and Dijkstal can
drink his blood.

65
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:07,646
Rosenmöller and De Graaf
cannot sell it to their supporters.

66
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:12,800
- Balkenende?
- Yes, the CDA would be an option.

67
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:17,000
And what do you think, Bas?

68
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:22,240
Bizarre.

69
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:23,560
What?

70
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:26,640
Do you have something nice for me?

71
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:38,901
Who are those people,
that Waisvisz couple?

72
00:06:38,995 --> 00:06:40,240
Involved citizens.

73
00:06:40,638 --> 00:06:45,400
That attorney will file a review request
based on their investigation.

74
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:46,887
They are handwriting experts.

75
00:06:46,938 --> 00:06:49,617
They work a lot for the judiciary,
but they do this themselves.

76
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:52,400
Yes.
And now you want...

77
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:56,120
Find out if it's correct.
If it is true...

78
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:58,680
If that knife cannot
be the murder weapon

79
00:06:58,984 --> 00:07:00,800
then L. is
innocently imprisoned.

80
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:03,640
Yes, but that story
is already in Trouw.

81
00:07:03,774 --> 00:07:05,160
Do you hear anything?

82
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:07,786
Have you read
anything else about it?

83
00:07:07,836 --> 00:07:09,349
Apparently it wasn't picked up.

84
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:11,714
Because everyone is
busy with those polls.

85
00:07:11,780 --> 00:07:14,896
If true, someone
innocent is incarcerated.

86
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,546
- You already said that.
- Yes, but...

87
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:19,080
It is well. It's okay.

88
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:21,960
You may.

89
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:33,320
According to Maurice de Hond,
the LPF will be the largest...

90
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:35,360
in the parliamentary elections.

91
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:41,400
<i>Our question today: is Pim Fortuyn a
good prime minister? Good afternoon...</i>

92
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:43,840
- Good day.
- Hello, Ed Waisvisz.

93
00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:45,960
- I'm Wanda.
- Bas Haan.

94
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:52,720
See what you can do with it.
Our report is on top.

95
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:03,960
This is from the criminal file.
How did you get that?

96
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:07,569
Van Louwes' lawyer.
We are working with him now.

97
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:11,560
Do you also have this digitally?
- Uh-uh.

98
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:14,400
We are not into modern frills.

99
00:08:16,280 --> 00:08:19,600
Can I copy it and show it
to someone else?

100
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:22,600
Okay.

101
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:27,600
And...

102
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:32,320
There was also another suspect.

103
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:37,440
Michaël de Jong, the widow's handyman.
He lied about his alibi.

104
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:40,080
And he had knowledge about the
perpetrator.

105
00:08:40,457 --> 00:08:45,600
He knew the body was in the living room
and told people that...

106
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:47,440
at her own funeral.

107
00:08:56,440 --> 00:09:00,640
He's building a case
against the suspect...

108
00:09:00,760 --> 00:09:04,280
which he eventually brings to court.

109
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:10,345
Yet the public prosecutor is not a
crime fighter, as in American films.

110
00:09:11,564 --> 00:09:15,480
In the Dutch legal system,
the Public Prosecution Service is…

111
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:18,760
unlike in most neighboring countries...

112
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:22,360
both truth finder and crook catcher.

113
00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:28,040
Ladies and gentlemen,
in the back someone has just joined us.

114
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:32,720
Network Editor, Bas Haan.
Specialized in our rule of law.

115
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:36,800
And not so very long ago student,
as yourself.

116
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:44,640
- Hey, Bas.
- Peter.

117
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:48,287
What did you bring again?

118
00:09:48,337 --> 00:09:51,390
I'm not saying anything,
you have to look at it cleanly.

119
00:09:52,506 --> 00:09:55,480
It's a box,
that's as far as I dare go.

120
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:57,600
That's why I always ask you.

121
00:10:10,672 --> 00:10:12,160
You don't believe that, do you?

122
00:10:12,250 --> 00:10:13,293
Look here.

123
00:10:13,344 --> 00:10:18,040
Short time after the robbery
and at a short distance from the house.

124
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:22,640
In fact, three days later
and a mile away.

125
00:10:22,760 --> 00:10:26,600
The knife is not properly secured,
has been in the rain for days...

126
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:30,720
and is linked to Louwes
via a very dubious odor test.

127
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:34,520
In addition, the blade does not
match the depth of the stab wounds.

128
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:38,240
In nine sentences they explained in
Arnhem why Louwes is the perpetrator.

129
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:41,194
And everything is
linked to that knife.

130
00:10:41,244 --> 00:10:42,400
And that telephone tower.

131
00:10:42,520 --> 00:10:46,055
- I'm going after that too.
- And the other suspect?

132
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:49,840
- The handyman?
- Yes, are you going after that?

133
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:51,000
No

134
00:10:51,640 --> 00:10:54,000
But that's a suspect, right?

135
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:57,960
We shouldn't play judge

136
00:10:58,374 --> 00:11:01,960
let alone make some
handyman a suspect.

137
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:08,840
Louwes has been convicted.
There is a verdict. I can test that.

138
00:11:08,959 --> 00:11:10,742
If that doesn't work,
we can say something

139
00:11:10,792 --> 00:11:12,559
about the way the
justice system works.

140
00:11:12,680 --> 00:11:15,440
Hmm, okay. How long do you need?

141
00:11:15,560 --> 00:11:19,055
Come on, broadcast schedule, budget...
How long?

142
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:23,480
Fortuyn was shot.

143
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:28,880
He's laying back here, neatly dressed.

144
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:33,960
<i>He's been shot in the head
and he's laying with his feet crossed...</i>

145
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:37,480
<i>He dropped to his knees
and fell backwards.</i>

146
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:39,640
- Where is it?
- That's here.

147
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:42,280
<i>A parking space at 3FM. No idea who...</i>

148
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:48,275
<i>I meet upset employees of Ruud de Wild..
They are shaken...</i>

149
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:10,240
- Bas Haan.
- Ernest Louwes.

150
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:14,712
- Thank you for welcoming me.
- Wanda said you can be trusted.

151
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:17,440
Hopefully Wanda is too.

152
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:37,600
The third house from the right.

153
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:39,000
I live there.

154
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:46,760
- Your house is opposite?
- With that green door.

155
00:12:52,760 --> 00:12:53,960
Bizarre.

156
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:06,240
Among the items I received from
Mrs. Waisvisz was this.

157
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:12,080
That's my diary.
Yes, I typed everything out.

158
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:16,280
- Could I read it?
- Yes of course.

159
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:19,480
You have to if you believe in my cause.

160
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:25,080
Everything is in there. I wrote
everything down, from the beginning.

161
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:29,480
Good.

162
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:32,400
I want to start with the court's
assessment of the facts.

163
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:34,245
The most important
evidence piece: the knife

164
00:13:34,295 --> 00:13:36,480
has already been disproved
by the Waisvisz family.

165
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:38,320
- That leaves...
- The telephone tower.

166
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:42,040
Yes.
Can you tell me more about that?

167
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:13,600
Louwes says he was at Het Harde
when he called Mrs Wittenberg.

168
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:15,920
Thirty kilometers from Deventer.

169
00:14:16,280 --> 00:14:18,680
He was with her that morning.

170
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:22,040
She asked how much she could donate
to the church tax-free.

171
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:25,400
He reported that from the car
at 8:36 pm that evening.

172
00:14:25,880 --> 00:14:27,400
In 16 seconds?

173
00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:33,800
With Ernest. You wanted to know how
much you could donate. 1750 guilders.

174
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:38,600
Yes, 1750.
Sorry, I'm in the car, so I'll be brief.

175
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:41,320
Yes. See you soon.

176
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:42,640
14 seconds.

177
00:14:43,880 --> 00:14:46,480
- No.
- Come on, Rein. It's possible right?

178
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:48,920
No one believes that
the knife is the weapon.

179
00:14:49,023 --> 00:14:52,000
It is possible, but it
doesn't have to.

180
00:14:52,279 --> 00:14:56,146
That telephone mast is almost
in that woman's backyard.

181
00:14:56,286 --> 00:14:57,429
How do you explain that?

182
00:14:57,480 --> 00:14:59,360
Increased radio propagation.

183
00:14:59,960 --> 00:15:02,200
- Increased what?
- Radio propagation.

184
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:05,840
Sometimes a signal drifts.
I spoke to an expert...

185
00:15:05,960 --> 00:15:07,920
It's okay, Bas.

186
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:24,880
- Coffee?
- Please.

187
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:43,040
You have never seen this?

188
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,000
Nee.

189
00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:48,240
Here it is.

190
00:15:57,680 --> 00:16:00,741
The police in Deventer
questioned me about

191
00:16:00,791 --> 00:16:03,080
the smell identification
test of the knife.

192
00:16:03,476 --> 00:16:06,280
They asked me for a kind of
second opinion.

193
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:12,360
And I then indicated by letter what was
unclear about the test execution.

194
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:14,304
Don't look into the camera

195
00:16:14,354 --> 00:16:16,680
and try to incorporate the questions
into your answers.

196
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:20,000
First the smell test and then
point by point.

197
00:16:20,120 --> 00:16:24,120
But in court you stated that you found
the smell test strong evidence.

198
00:16:24,840 --> 00:16:29,600
Yes, because the reports
I saw then were in order.

199
00:16:31,095 --> 00:16:32,880
- Ready?
- Er, yes.

200
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:36,280
It looks like they used that letter...

201
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:40,320
to improve the original reports.

202
00:16:41,320 --> 00:16:43,480
- Did they cheat?
- Yes.

203
00:16:45,519 --> 00:16:48,979
Mister van Koppen, as an expert in the
field of miscarriages of justice

204
00:16:49,198 --> 00:16:53,160
how do you view
the conviction of Ernest L.?

205
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:58,520
If you put the reports side by side,
the numbers don't match.

206
00:16:58,640 --> 00:17:02,880
There are weird dates.
Subsequent reports were drawn up.

207
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:06,304
<i>It is unclear where
the knife was kept and stored.</i>

208
00:17:06,354 --> 00:17:08,920
<i>And then you are not
allowed to do a sorting test.</i>

209
00:17:09,840 --> 00:17:15,160
<i>Dog handlers are expected
to check this. That didn't happen.</i>

210
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:16,600
Nice.

211
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:21,120
Just a voice-over and the presentation
text for Aart and we're good to go.

212
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:26,880
Good job, Haan.
This is going to cause quite a stir.

213
00:17:45,884 --> 00:17:51,766
Ernest L. was sentenced to 12 years in
prison for murder in Deventer.

214
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:55,320
It now appears with
very questionable evidence.

215
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:57,329
After his conviction on appeal

216
00:17:57,379 --> 00:17:59,520
an independent agency conducted
an investigation...

217
00:17:59,669 --> 00:18:03,629
and came with damning conclusions about…

218
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:17,280
If the bookkeeper didn't do it,
then who did?

219
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:19,680
Didn't that widow have a butler?

220
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:21,960
Ah, there he is. Louwes?

221
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:25,000
Louwes? Mister Louwes?

222
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:32,960
Are you happy that your
case is being reviewed?

223
00:18:40,680 --> 00:18:46,280
Come on. Watch your head.
Watch out guys. Watch out, watch out.

224
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:48,400
Watch your fingers.

225
00:18:48,520 --> 00:18:51,920
Bas, what are you doing man?

226
00:18:56,280 --> 00:18:58,640
Goddamn.

227
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,480
Here it is.

228
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:23,400
Papa.

229
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:26,680
Hey honey.

230
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:30,320
- I missed you so much.
- Oh, baby.

231
00:19:30,440 --> 00:19:33,366
Oh, honey, how
glad I am to see you.

232
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:35,920
Oh, honey. You're out, honey.

233
00:19:36,040 --> 00:19:39,680
- Honey. We won.
- Ernest.

234
00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:43,520
- I'll see you later.
- Yes, I'll see you later.

235
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:45,880
Bye, honey.

236
00:20:01,560 --> 00:20:02,920
Sorry.

237
00:20:04,760 --> 00:20:09,040
A deal is a deal.
You have every right to the scoop.

238
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:12,400
I wouldn't be here without you.

239
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:47,603
How did you pass the time,
those three years?

240
00:20:48,627 --> 00:20:54,495
It was fine at first, but I haven't done
anything in the last few months.

241
00:20:55,800 --> 00:20:57,916
Also unable to do anything.

242
00:20:58,560 --> 00:21:02,480
- One, close.
- Attention, title Louwes.

243
00:21:02,600 --> 00:21:05,200
<i>I wrote a little, I read a lot.</i>

244
00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:10,088
<i>But at some point that
doesn't work anymore.</i>

245
00:21:10,138 --> 00:21:12,229
<i>Interesting, I would expect it the
other way around</i>

246
00:21:12,280 --> 00:21:16,800
<i>At first you think: I'm innocent,
I'll never get out of here, but...</i>

247
00:21:16,920 --> 00:21:20,630
<i>Well, I've always believed it would
turn out alright.</i>

248
00:21:21,040 --> 00:21:23,654
That might sound strange
considering it took that long

249
00:21:24,159 --> 00:21:27,000
but I've always believed that.

250
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:33,156
Perhaps a strange thought, because it
isn't my fault, but someone else's.

251
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:37,440
And that I happen to be
sitting here today.

252
00:21:57,567 --> 00:21:59,800
- Enjoy your meal.
- Thank you.

253
00:22:10,600 --> 00:22:11,600
Thank you.

254
00:22:16,560 --> 00:22:17,560
Proud?

255
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:22,440
Don't act like you don't understand me,
asshole.

256
00:22:34,052 --> 00:22:35,411
First day of review

257
00:23:04,680 --> 00:23:05,680
Good luck.

258
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:22,480
Ladies and gentlemen, the court.

259
00:23:36,913 --> 00:23:38,320
Welcome, ladies and gentlemen.

260
00:23:38,393 --> 00:23:39,600
You can sit down.

261
00:23:44,624 --> 00:23:48,360
Mr. Louwes, we are here to
review your case.

262
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:53,097
A case that is now known in the media
as the Deventer murder case.

263
00:23:53,734 --> 00:23:59,717
After the knife evidence fell apart,
supporting evidence also lost its power.

264
00:24:00,520 --> 00:24:04,988
Like the telephone conversation via the
mobile phone mast in Deventer...

265
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:10,184
that made probable that the suspect was
in Deventer around the murder.

266
00:24:10,560 --> 00:24:15,720
The court in Arnhem could therefore not
have come to proven statement...

267
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:17,840
on the present evidence.

268
00:24:17,960 --> 00:24:23,168
Also not if the evidence is considered
in conjunction with other clues.

269
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:28,640
However, another NFI report came to my
attention this morning.

270
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:32,467
And it concerns the
result of a DNA test.

271
00:24:33,320 --> 00:24:35,000
This research shows...

272
00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:40,480
that Mr. Louwes' DNA was found
on the victim's clothing.

273
00:24:40,600 --> 00:24:45,280
Namely on the blouse Mrs. Wittenberg
was wearing when she was murdered.

274
00:24:46,006 --> 00:24:50,840
I can't say exactly what the situation
is with the DNA. I just received it.

275
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:54,412
And I still have to dig into
its consequences.

276
00:24:58,680 --> 00:25:00,327
New DNA Evidence?

277
00:25:00,377 --> 00:25:02,240
The details will come
the next session day.

278
00:25:02,360 --> 00:25:04,280
In a month and a half.

279
00:25:04,330 --> 00:25:07,400
That interview with
Louwes at home is tonight.

280
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:09,729
Louwes visited the widow
on the morning of the murder

281
00:25:09,779 --> 00:25:11,229
the OM knows that.

282
00:25:11,280 --> 00:25:15,480
If he put a hand on her shoulder,
there's already DNA.

283
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:17,840
- So just broadcast?
- Sure.

284
00:25:17,960 --> 00:25:20,146
The interview is only about
Louwes' experience

285
00:25:20,196 --> 00:25:21,960
what it is like to be free again.

286
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:25,880
- Really very touching.
- I'll get the tissues ready.

287
00:25:39,920 --> 00:25:44,920
<i>Today the revision case against
Ernest Louwes started in Den Bosch.</i>

288
00:25:45,040 --> 00:25:49,640
<i>Before the trial started, we spoke with
Louwes about this special case...</i>

289
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:54,320
<i>and his bizarre years in prison.
Bas Haan reports.</i>

290
00:25:54,446 --> 00:25:56,188
<i>You are free, of course</i>

291
00:25:56,499 --> 00:26:02,054
<i>But your life has basically
become miserable.</i>

292
00:26:02,800 --> 00:26:06,520
<i>And that often feels very awful.</i>

293
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:08,108
Mich?

294
00:26:09,320 --> 00:26:11,720
<i>And that is sometimes difficult.</i>

295
00:26:12,760 --> 00:26:16,680
Mich, come. Louwes is on TV.

296
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:24,886
<i>It would be best if the perpetrator
is quickly arrested.</i>

297
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:28,331
<i>So everyone knows I have
nothing to do with it.</i>

298
00:26:28,800 --> 00:26:33,920
<i>Of course that would be the...
the most, most beautiful thing.</i>

299
00:26:34,040 --> 00:26:36,314
That man gives me the creeps.

300
00:26:45,280 --> 00:26:49,040
I would very much
like to have that, yes.

301
00:26:51,680 --> 00:26:54,800
Okay, then we'll talk about that.

302
00:26:57,840 --> 00:27:00,440
- Yes.
- Peter R. de Vries.

303
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:11,160
Um, oh no, sorry. I'll call you
back in a minute.

304
00:27:19,160 --> 00:27:22,253
- What's that?
- A fax from Peter R. de Vries.

305
00:27:23,160 --> 00:27:28,120
He also watched last night.
And how annoyed he got...

306
00:27:29,136 --> 00:27:31,768
that I didn't mention

307
00:27:32,278 --> 00:27:35,003
the pretty spectacular news...

308
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:39,840
that Louwes' DNA was found
on the blouse of the widow.

309
00:27:41,232 --> 00:27:45,849
Yes, he's right, isn't he?
You didn't report it, did you?

310
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:49,200
Vanity, Bas.

311
00:27:57,520 --> 00:27:58,520
Fuck.

312
00:28:02,137 --> 00:28:05,520
We found DNA from Mr. Louwes...

313
00:28:05,640 --> 00:28:10,560
in places that correspond with
how the victim was killed.

314
00:28:10,680 --> 00:28:15,760
Mrs. Wittenberg was not only stabbed,
but also strangled.

315
00:28:20,600 --> 00:28:26,560
It involves material near the
broken ribs. The killer used force.

316
00:28:26,680 --> 00:28:29,999
And these red-pink spots

317
00:28:30,049 --> 00:28:32,828
eventually turned out to be
facial foundation.

318
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:38,705
Which was reasonably spread by the
killer during the strangling.

319
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:43,285
Apart from these contact traces

320
00:28:43,627 --> 00:28:48,080
we also found this
stain in the collar...

321
00:28:49,160 --> 00:28:52,840
with the DNA of Mr. Louwes.
And this is blood.

322
00:28:56,480 --> 00:28:59,720
Except that it takes liquid blood...

323
00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:05,276
we cannot determine with 100%
certainty how that blood got there.

324
00:29:05,981 --> 00:29:09,073
But all these traces support
the hypothesis that

325
00:29:09,123 --> 00:29:12,426
the DNA was transferred
during the crime.

326
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:18,120
And again: all this DNA
comes from Mr. Louwes.

327
00:30:00,520 --> 00:30:04,840
Mr. Louwes.
Are you nervous for today?

328
00:30:10,160 --> 00:30:15,026
Mr Louwes, are you nervous?
What do you expect from the verdict?

329
00:30:19,957 --> 00:30:20,989
Mr Louwes,

330
00:30:21,246 --> 00:30:23,013
what are you
going to hear today?

331
00:30:23,098 --> 00:30:25,799
Er, acquittal of course.

332
00:30:25,920 --> 00:30:27,560
Are you sure?

333
00:30:29,090 --> 00:30:33,800
Yes. Yeah, I've always assumed that,
so uh... that's for sure, yes.

334
00:30:34,246 --> 00:30:37,960
Yet last week the judiciary
made many people doubt.

335
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:41,120
You would be a top actor
who makes everything up.

336
00:30:41,880 --> 00:30:45,872
Yes, but well, the only top actor
is the OM itself.

337
00:30:46,600 --> 00:30:50,960
They did get me convicted once, so...

338
00:30:51,380 --> 00:30:54,840
What if
the verdict today reads: guilty?

339
00:30:55,280 --> 00:30:56,880
But it's not like that.

340
00:30:59,520 --> 00:31:02,080
I have to go. Will I see you later?

341
00:31:10,520 --> 00:31:14,080
This means that the court finds proven..

342
00:31:14,200 --> 00:31:19,720
that the accused intentionally and
premeditatedly assaulted the victim...

343
00:31:20,120 --> 00:31:24,000
- I haven't, ma'am.
- Let me finish.

344
00:31:24,377 --> 00:31:29,160
...deprived of life. The court orders
the arrest of the accused.

345
00:31:29,280 --> 00:31:31,760
- No no no.
- The ruling...

346
00:31:31,880 --> 00:31:35,640
<i>- I'm not getting picked up again.
- The court rules...</i>

347
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:39,360
The court maintains,
under improvement of grounds...

348
00:31:39,480 --> 00:31:43,880
the judgment of the Court of Appeal
in Arnhem of 22 December 2000.

349
00:31:43,995 --> 00:31:45,920
The court orders imprisonment.

350
00:31:46,040 --> 00:31:50,640
You just continue with all the
falsified arguments of the police.

351
00:31:50,760 --> 00:31:54,080
You just wipe everything away.

352
00:31:54,200 --> 00:31:56,000
You are wiping everything away.

353
00:31:56,120 --> 00:31:59,320
I understand your emotion,
but I haven't finished speaking yet.

354
00:31:59,564 --> 00:32:02,118
If you disagree with the ruling

355
00:32:02,399 --> 00:32:05,853
you have two weeks to appeal to the
Supreme Court of the Netherlands.

356
00:32:06,200 --> 00:32:09,320
<i>- You know you are wrong.
- Are you coming with me?</i>

357
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:13,360
<i>No, I'm not coming. No, I'm going...</i>

358
00:32:14,280 --> 00:32:16,960
I'm not... Damn it.

359
00:32:17,080 --> 00:32:19,000
The cameras are now…

360
00:32:20,360 --> 00:32:23,520
<i>The photos and the cameras
are now stopped.</i>

361
00:33:03,320 --> 00:33:08,120
You can't just act that.
Right, Bas?

362
00:33:08,921 --> 00:33:11,480
Oh come on, man.
You have eyes in your head, right?

363
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:14,480
He didn't do it,
can't you feel it?

364
00:33:14,669 --> 00:33:17,731
His blood was in the collar,
but we feel he didn't do it.

365
00:33:17,781 --> 00:33:19,069
This was the news, good evening.

366
00:33:19,120 --> 00:33:20,520
Come on.

367
00:33:22,080 --> 00:33:26,360
So, folks. You know there's a
broadcast tonight, right?

368
00:33:29,080 --> 00:33:30,640
See you later.

369
00:33:35,760 --> 00:33:36,840
So...

370
00:33:38,080 --> 00:33:39,400
No acquittal.

371
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:42,880
That's too bad.

372
00:33:44,200 --> 00:33:47,040
- Better luck next time.
- What do you mean?

373
00:33:47,680 --> 00:33:49,960
- Well, it's done.
- Finished?

374
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:53,560
I think someone just said that the
blood in the collar can't be ignored.

375
00:33:54,376 --> 00:33:56,960
Rein only said that
a feeling isn't news.

376
00:33:57,080 --> 00:33:59,520
Well, we can't go on feeling.

377
00:33:59,845 --> 00:34:02,720
Whoa, wait. There are still
plenty of questions, aren't there?

378
00:34:02,840 --> 00:34:04,560
- Real questions.
- Bas...

379
00:34:04,680 --> 00:34:06,786
One: they tampered
with the evidence before

380
00:34:06,836 --> 00:34:08,840
with the reporting
on the knife earlier

381
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:12,880
And that blouse was
administratively lost for a while.

382
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:17,280
Two: there is no DNA from Louwes
under the nails of the widow.

383
00:34:17,400 --> 00:34:21,880
While Knoops rightly argued that
this would be the case in a struggle.

384
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:23,908
Three: new facts have come to light.

385
00:34:23,958 --> 00:34:27,800
But nobody knows enough about
DNA to judge them.

386
00:34:27,920 --> 00:34:30,400
- Bas...
- It's our job as journalists...

387
00:34:30,520 --> 00:34:35,320
It's my job to make a
whole program every night.

388
00:34:35,880 --> 00:34:40,960
I can't allow more time and budget with
those facts and the conviction.

389
00:34:41,080 --> 00:34:42,960
I can't justify it!

390
00:34:43,240 --> 00:34:45,480
Management won't have it.

391
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:49,000
Until new developments come around,
Deventer is on the back burner.

392
00:34:49,767 --> 00:34:54,080
- There is also other news.
- You mean that stranded sperm whale.

393
00:34:54,200 --> 00:34:58,680
Bas... Take off the afternoon.
Cool down.

394
00:34:59,800 --> 00:35:01,776
But after that it's over.

395
00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:03,550
Finished.

396
00:35:06,440 --> 00:35:07,840
Boy oh boy.

397
00:36:54,240 --> 00:36:55,800
Evelien?

398
00:36:56,200 --> 00:36:57,200
Bas.

399
00:36:58,280 --> 00:37:00,240
Glad you wanted to come.

400
00:37:01,360 --> 00:37:04,760
Yeah, I didn't know
it was so public here.

401
00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:08,080
Top criminals also meet
in roadside restaurants.

402
00:37:09,480 --> 00:37:13,581
Don't worry, I'm not going to
ask any difficult questions.

403
00:37:14,040 --> 00:37:15,571
I just wanted to know
more about that

404
00:37:15,622 --> 00:37:18,040
DNA course you followed
at the Justice Department.

405
00:37:18,160 --> 00:37:19,800
They don't invite me.

406
00:37:20,720 --> 00:37:24,640
If I tell everything I heard,
I'll violate my duty of confidentiality.

407
00:37:25,470 --> 00:37:29,760
But isn't it a general course,
the use of DNA in criminal cases?

408
00:37:29,880 --> 00:37:33,840
- Would you like to order something?
- A regular coffee, please.

409
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:35,280
A cappuccino.

410
00:37:40,440 --> 00:37:44,360
- I want absolute anonymity.
- I guarantee it.

411
00:37:44,928 --> 00:37:47,603
No one will ever find out
that you talked to me

412
00:37:48,114 --> 00:37:49,840
no matter what you say.

413
00:37:52,020 --> 00:37:57,120
The Public Prosecution Service and the
NFI have withheld DNA evidence.

414
00:37:57,762 --> 00:38:00,320
As a result, an innocent man
is now incarcerated.

415
00:38:02,447 --> 00:38:03,720
Ernest Louwes?

416
00:38:04,680 --> 00:38:05,969
Kees B.

417
00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:08,160
Schiedam park murder.

418
00:38:16,720 --> 00:38:17,720
Succes.

419
00:38:25,400 --> 00:38:28,120
Five, four, three...

420
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:33,840
Four past eight. This is Network.

421
00:38:33,960 --> 00:38:38,698
Incriminating evidence was withheld in
the Schiedam park murder

422
00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:43,240
How the judiciary wanted to keep an
innocent prisoner locked up for life.

423
00:38:43,360 --> 00:38:45,680
A report by Bas Haan.

424
00:38:55,157 --> 00:38:56,360
Hey, man, good day.

425
00:39:00,560 --> 00:39:02,000
A package for you.

426
00:39:02,120 --> 00:39:03,800
Thank you.

427
00:39:36,240 --> 00:39:37,240
Hey

428
00:39:38,360 --> 00:39:40,440
Bad conscience?

429
00:39:48,600 --> 00:39:50,280
Make some room.

430
00:39:54,200 --> 00:39:56,201
Guys what...

431
00:39:57,080 --> 00:40:01,040
Congratulations on your first scoop
as a reporter.

432
00:40:01,160 --> 00:40:02,600
Thank you.

433
00:40:02,720 --> 00:40:03,920
Guys...

434
00:40:04,040 --> 00:40:05,600
Well, blow, Haan.

435
00:40:10,360 --> 00:40:11,560
Speech.

436
00:40:13,240 --> 00:40:15,080
Cake?

437
00:40:15,200 --> 00:40:16,520
Well, please.

438
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:21,840
I was at a meeting of Maurice de Hond
this morning.

439
00:40:21,960 --> 00:40:23,880
- More seats for Wilders?
- No.

440
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:28,600
He had polled the effect of Schiedam on
our confidence in the rule of law.

441
00:40:28,720 --> 00:40:31,560
- I'm guessing it had dropped.
- Dramatic.

442
00:40:31,680 --> 00:40:33,810
But the OM is working on improvement.

443
00:40:33,861 --> 00:40:34,869
Yes

444
00:40:34,920 --> 00:40:38,240
Schiedam was only the start,
he is know looking at Deventer.

445
00:40:38,720 --> 00:40:40,440
- Maurice?
- Hmhm.

446
00:40:40,560 --> 00:40:42,000
- At Deventer?
- Yes.

447
00:40:42,390 --> 00:40:46,400
He claims to have a lot of new evidence
that exonerates Louwes.

448
00:40:46,680 --> 00:40:48,280
Seriously?

449
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:50,671
Did he mention what he found?

450
00:40:51,640 --> 00:40:53,600
Do you know who his source is?

451
00:40:53,720 --> 00:40:57,024
- Does he have a new witness?
- I didn't ask.

452
00:40:57,640 --> 00:40:59,560
Tonight he will sit at Matthijs.

453
00:41:06,320 --> 00:41:08,000
<i>Maurice de Hond, welcome.</i>

454
00:41:08,105 --> 00:41:09,960
<i>Polls are your business.</i>

455
00:41:10,195 --> 00:41:13,360
<i>- Yes.
- You started another campaign today.</i>

456
00:41:13,480 --> 00:41:19,198
<i>You would like to review and reopen the
Deventer murder case of 1999.</i>

457
00:41:19,730 --> 00:41:21,072
<i>Why?</i>

458
00:41:21,122 --> 00:41:22,840
<i>Well, I'm just a civilian too.</i>

459
00:41:22,960 --> 00:41:26,400
<i>And as a citizen,
I am interested in the rule of law.</i>

460
00:41:26,957 --> 00:41:32,863
<i>And in 2003 or 2004, Ernest Louwes
was convicted in the third instance...</i>

461
00:41:33,480 --> 00:41:36,120
<i>after he was first released
by the Supreme Court</i>

462
00:41:36,456 --> 00:41:40,467
<i>and when I saw that on TV,
my stomach turned.</i>

463
00:41:40,841 --> 00:41:46,600
<i>After that I received all sorts of
information from people close to Louwes.</i>

464
00:41:46,651 --> 00:41:49,627
<i>I couldn't believe what I read. This
couldn't happen in this country.</i>

465
00:41:49,893 --> 00:41:52,800
<i>The Netherlands has a constitution.
I couldn't believe it.</i>

466
00:41:53,401 --> 00:41:57,440
<i>Only until the Schiedam park murder
came on TV earlier this year</i>

467
00:41:57,560 --> 00:42:02,400
<i>First on Netwerk, but more importantly
later in the report of OM.</i>

468
00:42:02,515 --> 00:42:05,680
<i>Kees B. was unjustly
imprisoned for murder.</i>

469
00:42:05,800 --> 00:42:09,015
<i>It's kind of a mix between
""Keystone Cops""...</i>

470
00:42:09,065 --> 00:42:12,280
<i>with Inspector Clouseau from ""The
Pink Panther"" and Mr Bean.</i>

471
00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:15,760
<i>Isn't that part of the excitement?</i>

472
00:42:15,880 --> 00:42:18,360
<i>With the Schiedam case you see
how many mistakes...</i>

473
00:42:18,480 --> 00:42:21,080
He just keeps linking those cases.

474
00:42:22,920 --> 00:42:24,320
Also on his site.

475
00:42:25,960 --> 00:42:27,194
Here.

476
00:42:27,835 --> 00:42:30,160
Schiedam, Deventer.

477
00:42:30,381 --> 00:42:34,920
And here. But that in itself
isn't so illogical, is it?

478
00:42:35,440 --> 00:42:39,440
Because they messed up in Schiedam,
they also screwed up Deventer?

479
00:42:39,551 --> 00:42:41,440
That is no argument,
that's bullshit.

480
00:42:41,660 --> 00:42:46,200
Besides, in Schiedam the withheld DNA
proved Kees B.'s innocence...

481
00:42:46,320 --> 00:42:49,600
while in Deventer the found
DNA proves Louwes' guilt.

482
00:42:49,996 --> 00:42:53,760
But many people doubt
whether Louwes did it.

483
00:42:54,183 --> 00:42:57,880
With all due respect, Gerda, those
people don't know fuck all, don't they?

484
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:00,364
Well, Maurice
is not just anyone.

485
00:43:00,718 --> 00:43:03,600
This isn't a poll,
it's a murder case.

486
00:43:06,760 --> 00:43:07,947
What?

487
00:43:08,088 --> 00:43:10,560
Second chances are
rare in our business.

488
00:43:11,800 --> 00:43:15,640
Not so long ago you also
had doubts about Louwes.

489
00:43:16,080 --> 00:43:17,634
That's right.

490
00:43:17,736 --> 00:43:22,840
Schiedam was a crash course in DNA.
Conclusion: DNA, no way around it.

491
00:43:23,040 --> 00:43:26,800
That blood in that collar is a fact,
and that blood belongs to Louwes.

492
00:43:27,120 --> 00:43:29,198
Unless the blood is fraudulent.

493
00:43:30,080 --> 00:43:33,013
According to Louwes
the evidence has been faked.

494
00:43:33,063 --> 00:43:35,070
But Maurice has no hard proof of that.

495
00:43:35,121 --> 00:43:36,560
I took a good look.

496
00:43:36,880 --> 00:43:37,883
So?

497
00:43:38,750 --> 00:43:40,920
- No news?
- Gerda.

498
00:43:41,641 --> 00:43:44,560
Maurice is just a celebrity
with an opinion.

499
00:43:47,360 --> 00:43:48,360
Okay.

500
00:43:57,409 --> 00:44:00,960
On principle, you shouldn't
prune in winter.

501
00:44:01,080 --> 00:44:03,160
The plant needs to lose moisture.

502
00:44:03,280 --> 00:44:05,960
If you prune too much,
you will get fungus.

503
00:44:06,840 --> 00:44:08,200
Good afternoon.

504
00:44:08,320 --> 00:44:10,440
Good afternoon.

505
00:44:10,560 --> 00:44:13,080
- Hello?
- Are you Meike Wittermans?

506
00:44:13,200 --> 00:44:16,240
- The handyman's girlfriend?
- Handyman?

507
00:44:16,360 --> 00:44:18,520
Yes, from Widow Wittenberg.

508
00:44:42,840 --> 00:44:46,320
Did you see this, man?
They are calling you the handyman.

509
00:44:58,520 --> 00:45:00,000
What is this all about?

510
00:45:06,600 --> 00:45:11,160
- I don't quite understand...
- We just want to ask some questions.

511
00:45:11,280 --> 00:45:13,396
Things that are unclear.

512
00:45:13,615 --> 00:45:16,568
At the time, you and your husband
were questioned by the police

513
00:45:16,664 --> 00:45:20,320
And made contradictory statements about
the time at which Michael came home.

514
00:45:20,575 --> 00:45:23,400
- Right?
- Yes, that was a mistake, yes.

515
00:45:27,156 --> 00:45:28,160
A mistake?

516
00:45:28,445 --> 00:45:30,172
Yes, a mistake, yes.

517
00:45:30,617 --> 00:45:34,640
Can you precisely remember where
you wife was last Tuesday at 20:30?

518
00:45:34,760 --> 00:45:37,467
There was no murder that night.

519
00:45:37,720 --> 00:45:39,094
No, exactly.

520
00:45:39,260 --> 00:45:44,280
And we had nothing to do with
that murder, so why would I remember?

521
00:45:46,076 --> 00:45:48,280
I've already explained all this.

522
00:45:49,889 --> 00:45:53,960
You do not have to be scared.
We can take you to a safe place.

523
00:45:56,960 --> 00:45:58,240
Who are you?

524
00:45:58,680 --> 00:46:00,742
Can you identify yourself?

525
00:46:01,191 --> 00:46:02,440
Be honest.

526
00:46:02,686 --> 00:46:07,280
Wouldn't it be nice if you could throw
that burden off your shoulders?

527
00:46:07,475 --> 00:46:10,800
- Come clean
- You can't just show up at my work.

528
00:46:11,514 --> 00:46:13,459
That was the whole plan.

529
00:46:13,592 --> 00:46:16,047
If he's not here,
you can talk freely.

530
00:46:16,232 --> 00:46:19,247
Ma'am, come with us.

531
00:46:19,480 --> 00:46:21,120
We can protect you.

532
00:46:21,372 --> 00:46:23,960
- He can't touch you.
- What do you think?

533
00:46:24,080 --> 00:46:27,240
We have nothing to do with this case.
Can you get out of here now?

534
00:46:28,629 --> 00:46:31,680
I'm calling the police.
The real police.

535
00:46:39,520 --> 00:46:40,520
Okay.

536
00:46:48,680 --> 00:46:50,920
Who do you actually work for?

537
00:47:18,400 --> 00:47:23,853
Maurice has been invited by the
President of the Board of Attorneys...

538
00:47:24,360 --> 00:47:30,000
to personally explain his actions and
doubts in the Deventer murder case.

539
00:47:30,211 --> 00:47:31,611
What?

540
00:47:32,024 --> 00:47:33,760
How did he manage that?

541
00:47:34,920 --> 00:47:37,107
I also don't understand.

542
00:47:41,091 --> 00:47:44,880
Do you think I can talk to Brouwer
about my parking tickets?

543
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:48,080
Then you first have to appear
on 'De Wereld Draait Door'

544
00:47:48,468 --> 00:47:53,200
It's all PR. Restore the trust in the
law; citizens speak up.

545
00:47:53,320 --> 00:47:55,593
But preferably a citizen
who works in media, please.

546
00:47:55,851 --> 00:47:58,257
Thanks to us, huh.
Thanks to us.

547
00:47:58,920 --> 00:48:01,255
It's news... by now.

548
00:48:03,560 --> 00:48:05,920
And the news just came out.

549
00:48:22,120 --> 00:48:23,829
Good morning, mister De Hond.

550
00:48:23,879 --> 00:48:28,040
You have just come from a meeting with
the boss of the judiciary. About what?

551
00:48:28,160 --> 00:48:30,627
Yes, about the Deventer
murder case...

552
00:48:30,677 --> 00:48:33,560
and the fact that the wrong
perpetrator is incarcerated.

553
00:48:33,680 --> 00:48:38,320
And that we now know, at least we do,
who the real perpetrator is.

554
00:48:38,577 --> 00:48:40,360
You know it.
Does he know it too?

555
00:48:40,573 --> 00:48:42,628
Well, he knows what I know.

556
00:48:42,920 --> 00:48:47,880
Of course it isn't easy to
immediately come out and say: it is so.

557
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:51,310
The fact that the research
is reopened indicates...

558
00:48:51,615 --> 00:48:53,669
that they have
sufficient doubts...

559
00:48:53,720 --> 00:48:57,120
about whether they have done the right
thing in the past.

560
00:49:06,330 --> 00:49:09,600
- He is quite confident in himself.
- Quite?

561
00:49:10,634 --> 00:49:12,120
He already has
the fucking culprit.

562
00:49:13,278 --> 00:49:14,280
What now?

563
00:49:14,920 --> 00:49:16,640
On to casa 'De Hond'.

564
00:49:20,154 --> 00:49:23,320
Mr. De Hond.
What do you expect law enforcement to do

565
00:49:23,440 --> 00:49:26,760
with the incriminating information
you unearthed about the handyman?

566
00:49:27,013 --> 00:49:32,720
I only ask for a proper investigation.
I'm not condemning that man yet.

567
00:49:32,840 --> 00:49:37,840
I think for 99.99% if not a
100% that he did it...

568
00:49:38,082 --> 00:49:39,880
but I'm not a judge.

569
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:43,280
My only responsibility with
the information is to say:

570
00:49:43,465 --> 00:49:46,880
Anyone who
reads this information...

571
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:50,200
thinks more research should be done.

572
00:49:50,320 --> 00:49:56,280
Because if only two of my fifteen
hypotheses are true, he's the culprit.

573
00:49:57,600 --> 00:49:58,990
Is it him?

574
00:49:59,480 --> 00:50:00,800
Yes, 100% sure.

575
00:50:01,840 --> 00:50:03,760
- That's tunnel vision.
- No.

576
00:50:03,880 --> 00:50:05,360
He has not yet been convicted.

577
00:50:05,538 --> 00:50:06,920
But I'm not a judge.

578
00:50:07,040 --> 00:50:10,480
You are also not a detective. And can't
read the pieces as a detective.

579
00:50:10,739 --> 00:50:16,120
Your are convinced. Are you allowed to
determine that it is him?

580
00:50:16,240 --> 00:50:19,840
No, I can't say to him:
You get twelve years.

581
00:50:19,960 --> 00:50:25,120
I may say, That's my... I mean, why not?
He's it, 100% sure.

582
00:50:25,240 --> 00:50:26,640
100%.

583
00:50:28,440 --> 00:50:30,240
100%?

584
00:50:31,840 --> 00:50:33,720
- That's what he said?
- Yes.

585
00:50:36,060 --> 00:50:38,560
- And we have that exclusively?
- Yes but...

586
00:50:38,680 --> 00:50:40,760
Yes, but under embargo?

587
00:50:40,832 --> 00:50:42,996
As soon as the OM comes
up with something, we can go.

588
00:50:43,047 --> 00:50:44,800
So we have agreed
with Maurice... But...

589
00:50:45,160 --> 00:50:46,600
But?

590
00:50:47,212 --> 00:50:49,332
It's quite an accusation.

591
00:50:51,080 --> 00:50:53,280
Er, press release from the OM.

592
00:50:54,080 --> 00:50:57,760
At the request of the
Board of Attorneys...

593
00:50:57,880 --> 00:51:02,680
an exploratory investigation has started
into the Deventer murder case.

594
00:51:02,909 --> 00:51:03,949
What?

595
00:51:05,840 --> 00:51:09,524
An exploratory investigation?
There is no such thing.

596
00:51:09,574 --> 00:51:11,440
Well, yes, now there is.

597
00:51:11,560 --> 00:51:13,745
And it's the OM,
so we're allowed.

598
00:51:14,232 --> 00:51:17,320
Yes, but without that
quote about the handyman.

599
00:51:17,440 --> 00:51:18,841
Sorry?

600
00:51:19,400 --> 00:51:21,641
Someone is accused of murder

601
00:51:22,076 --> 00:51:24,440
without any hard evidence.

602
00:51:24,560 --> 00:51:27,385
You elicited that
statement from him yourself.

603
00:51:27,435 --> 00:51:29,497
That's why I'm
going to block it.

604
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:32,040
Bas, this is news.

605
00:51:32,591 --> 00:51:35,642
You can't just accuse someone of
murder on TV. Maurice...

606
00:51:35,693 --> 00:51:38,360
Maurice is just a celebrity
with an opinion, yes.

607
00:51:38,480 --> 00:51:41,169
But if the judicial system
takes him seriously...

608
00:51:41,325 --> 00:51:44,973
and even starts an
exploratory investigation...

609
00:51:45,320 --> 00:51:48,560
Something which, according to you,
has never happened yet.

610
00:51:49,840 --> 00:51:51,520
...then that's news.

611
00:51:57,160 --> 00:52:00,198
<i>I'm only asking for a
proper investigation.</i>

612
00:52:00,248 --> 00:52:02,360
<i>I'm not judging that man today.</i>

613
00:52:02,480 --> 00:52:07,480
<i>I think 99.99% if not 100%
that he did it...</i>

614
00:52:07,785 --> 00:52:09,520
<i>but I'm not a judge.</i>

615
00:52:09,640 --> 00:52:14,295
<i>My only job with
the information is to say:</i>

616
00:52:14,382 --> 00:52:16,480
<i>Anyone who
reads the information...</i>

617
00:52:16,600 --> 00:52:19,840
<i>thinks more research should be done.</i>

618
00:52:19,960 --> 00:52:25,853
<i>Because if only two of my fifteen
hypotheses are true, he's the culprit.</i>

619
00:52:26,400 --> 00:52:28,480
<i>Is it him?</i>

620
00:52:28,599 --> 00:52:30,799
<i>Yes, 100% sure.</i>

621
00:52:30,920 --> 00:52:32,600
<i>That's tunnel vision.</i>

622
00:52:57,720 --> 00:53:01,298
Come here. Hey, come here.

623
00:53:07,735 --> 00:53:10,829
<i>Hello, this is Michaël and
Meike's answering machine.</i>

624
00:53:10,985 --> 00:53:14,800
<i>We aren't in at the moment, but leave
a message after the beep. Thank you.</i>

625
00:53:16,080 --> 00:53:19,280
<i>Hey, Michael, pick up then,
you filthy retard.</i>

626
00:53:19,400 --> 00:53:20,968
<i>I hope they also strangle you...</i>

627
00:53:21,054 --> 00:53:22,682
<i>like you strangled
that old woman.</i>

628
00:53:22,737 --> 00:53:23,905
<i>You cowardly bastard.</i>

629
00:53:23,956 --> 00:53:26,840
<i>You too, Meike, you dirty whore.</i>

630
00:53:37,661 --> 00:53:39,840
<i>Hello, this is the answering machine...</i>

631
00:54:03,480 --> 00:54:04,800
Bas.

632
00:54:04,920 --> 00:54:06,200
Did you read it?

633
00:54:08,360 --> 00:54:12,339
De Telegraaf, Volkskrant, AD,
all on the front page.

634
00:54:13,120 --> 00:54:14,560
Congratulations man.

635
00:54:20,800 --> 00:54:22,520
Goddamnit.

636
00:54:27,995 --> 00:54:33,032
<i>He says Michael van J. probably did it.</i>

637
00:54:33,160 --> 00:54:38,440
<i>That man has a letter in which the
judiciary says: You are not a suspect.</i>

638
00:54:38,560 --> 00:54:40,360
<i>Can a citizen actually do that?</i>

639
00:54:40,480 --> 00:54:43,744
<i>Shouldn't you be
happy that the judiciary investigates</i>

640
00:54:43,794 --> 00:54:46,040
<i>and just leave it them?</i>

641
00:54:46,160 --> 00:54:50,160
<i>No, the point is: why did the
judiciary start to investigate?</i>

642
00:54:50,280 --> 00:54:53,240
<i>Why have they never investigated
it in Schiedam?</i>

643
00:54:53,360 --> 00:54:57,680
<i>Apparently the judiciary only
moves under hard pressure.</i>

644
00:54:57,800 --> 00:55:02,040
<i>- But they are moving now.
- The point is why...</i>

645
00:55:02,160 --> 00:55:08,074
<i>because the piece on my website
has been sent to the OM.</i>

646
00:55:08,360 --> 00:55:12,480
<i>We said: This is our proof,
go do something.</i>

647
00:55:12,600 --> 00:55:18,303
<i>But they are busy now. Why don't you
keep a low profile for now?</i>

648
00:55:18,800 --> 00:55:23,640
<i>It is of course not in the interest
of the judges, the OM, the judiciary...</i>

649
00:55:23,760 --> 00:55:28,640
<i>to say now: Louwes is not it
and the other one might be.</i>

650
00:55:28,760 --> 00:55:32,400
<i>Because then it will be a
bigger scandal than Schiedam.</i>

651
00:55:32,520 --> 00:55:36,800
Mich... Maybe we should consider what
that lawyer said: give an interview.

652
00:55:39,480 --> 00:55:40,480
No.

653
00:55:41,800 --> 00:55:43,240
I'm not going to do that.

654
00:55:46,240 --> 00:55:47,560
Really.

655
00:55:48,357 --> 00:55:53,080
<i>But there's also the 1% chance,
which you mention yourself...</i>

656
00:55:53,302 --> 00:55:56,920
<i>that Michael didn't do it.
Then you caused quite something</i>.

657
00:55:57,040 --> 00:56:01,640
<i>- Then I will bear the consequences.
- They can go very far.</i>

658
00:56:01,760 --> 00:56:02,861
<i>We'll see.</i>

659
00:56:02,987 --> 00:56:04,682
What's the matter with that guy?

660
00:56:06,720 --> 00:56:10,520
Maurice is on campaign.
It's not about the content.

661
00:56:10,640 --> 00:56:12,480
It's about the PR.

662
00:56:13,139 --> 00:56:15,840
Not to be right,
but to get his right.

663
00:56:16,146 --> 00:56:21,560
Last month Brouwer was his best friend,
now he is part of the plot.

664
00:56:21,810 --> 00:56:24,520
Brouwer actually hoisted
him on the shield.

665
00:56:24,640 --> 00:56:26,616
Not just Brouwer, right?

666
00:56:27,163 --> 00:56:30,007
If I remember correctly,
Maurice also got a lot...

667
00:56:30,165 --> 00:56:33,120
of airtime on a certain
current affairs program.

668
00:56:33,920 --> 00:56:35,701
""It's the handyman.""

669
00:56:36,568 --> 00:56:37,920
'100% sure.'

670
00:56:50,800 --> 00:56:54,360
Okay. Second chance, very good,
one more time then.

671
00:56:54,480 --> 00:56:56,960
This time all the way.
Everything and everyone.

672
00:56:57,080 --> 00:57:01,240
Not just what Maurice does.
Every fart from that man is covered.

673
00:57:01,360 --> 00:57:04,840
I was just looking for you.
Press release OM, just came in.

674
00:57:05,381 --> 00:57:08,294
Interim conclusion
exploratory investigation:

675
00:57:08,608 --> 00:57:10,080
five additional contact traces...

676
00:57:10,200 --> 00:57:12,983
and a trail of blood, all from Louwes.

677
00:57:15,400 --> 00:57:17,520
- Do you have to go?
- No, I'm going to smoke.

678
00:57:17,640 --> 00:57:19,920
- Outside?
- Some bore has complained.

679
00:57:20,040 --> 00:57:22,040
That bloody smoking ban...

680
00:57:25,892 --> 00:57:28,520
So it says nothing about
Michael de Jong.

681
00:57:31,280 --> 00:57:34,120
I can already hear Maurice calling it:
cover up.

682
00:57:35,960 --> 00:57:38,886
Can I conclude from
this that you are now...

683
00:57:38,936 --> 00:57:42,600
investigating the handyman,
and not just Louwes?

684
00:57:42,944 --> 00:57:46,240
That's what I said.
The whole story, everything.

685
00:57:49,600 --> 00:57:51,810
And how long do you need for that?

686
00:57:53,662 --> 00:57:57,400
The whole story, checking everything
from Maurice about the handyman...

687
00:57:57,718 --> 00:57:59,092
Louwes one more time...

688
00:57:59,400 --> 00:58:01,160
- Two, three...
- ...weeks.

689
00:58:01,280 --> 00:58:02,400
...months.

690
00:58:09,600 --> 00:58:12,514
But what if Maurice
turns out to be right?

691
00:58:13,475 --> 00:58:17,631
If he has the facts on his side, I'll
carry him around on a silver shield.

692
00:58:17,880 --> 00:58:19,080
100% sure.

693
00:58:20,419 --> 00:58:23,640
I'll ignore the cynicism for now.
But we don't have broadcast.

694
00:58:23,760 --> 00:58:26,600
Of course. You must also dare
to broadcast your faults.

695
00:58:26,720 --> 00:58:29,095
Bas, it is not
a question of daring.

696
00:58:29,716 --> 00:58:31,220
It is journalistic suicide.

697
00:58:31,294 --> 00:58:34,680
So it's open road for circus
De Hond then? I believe it's our job...

698
00:58:34,800 --> 00:58:36,800
Oh my gosh, not again.

699
00:58:39,880 --> 00:58:41,240
Saint Bas.

700
00:58:44,960 --> 00:58:47,080
Do you think
that the handyman did it?

701
00:58:49,280 --> 00:58:52,160
Don't know. I don't think so.

702
00:58:57,360 --> 00:58:58,440
Two months.

703
00:59:04,800 --> 00:59:06,160
Drug addict.

704
00:59:10,400 --> 00:59:12,120
Benefit fraudster.

705
00:59:19,800 --> 00:59:21,760
Hit rock bottom.

706
00:59:25,400 --> 00:59:30,196
Debts as a result of
very high spending patterns.

707
00:59:30,720 --> 00:59:31,960
Perpetrator knowledge.

708
00:59:33,920 --> 00:59:38,021
He and his girlfriend would have
lied about their alibis.

709
00:59:38,720 --> 00:59:40,000
And then this one.

710
00:59:41,600 --> 00:59:47,040
Michael was a patient of psychiatrist
Wittenberg, the husband of the widow.

711
00:59:47,160 --> 00:59:49,560
Because of tantrums.

712
00:59:50,760 --> 00:59:54,560
- How did he get all this information?
- From witnesses.

713
00:59:54,680 --> 00:59:57,600
Because of the publicity,
everyone approaches him.

714
00:59:57,720 --> 01:00:01,960
People who suddenly remember everything
after seven years, often anonymously.

715
01:00:02,080 --> 01:00:06,600
Lots of facts, but no sources.
It cannot be checked directly.

716
01:00:06,720 --> 01:00:10,600
It's a lot.
There must be some truth to it, right?

717
01:00:11,040 --> 01:00:12,440
Yes but what?

718
01:00:12,560 --> 01:00:15,141
There's nothing in it that
makes him a murderer.

719
01:00:16,040 --> 01:00:17,040
But okay.

720
01:00:18,600 --> 01:00:22,560
The handyman did have a motive,
according to Maurice.

721
01:00:22,779 --> 01:00:25,600
Louwes not according to the judges.
Here.

722
01:00:26,373 --> 01:00:30,280
""The handyman was in the
widow's original will...

723
01:00:30,400 --> 01:00:34,130
with a tax-free legacy
of 50,000 guilders...

724
01:00:34,607 --> 01:00:39,200
which was lowered in the new will
ten days before the murder...

725
01:00:39,320 --> 01:00:41,148
to 25,000 guilders.

726
01:00:41,519 --> 01:00:43,993
That's why, and
because of debts...

727
01:00:44,210 --> 01:00:46,759
he would have killed her
in a drunken brawl.'

728
01:00:46,880 --> 01:00:48,280
According to Maurice.

729
01:00:52,280 --> 01:00:54,920
Not known to you? In no registry?

730
01:00:55,320 --> 01:00:59,389
No theft, benefit fraud,
drunk driving, whatever?

731
01:00:59,720 --> 01:01:02,360
Can I quote you on that? Super.

732
01:01:20,560 --> 01:01:22,120
- Here.
- Ah, thank you.

733
01:01:32,120 --> 01:01:33,600
What is that?

734
01:01:33,720 --> 01:01:36,960
- You know that, right?
- Ah, that adoption thingy.

735
01:01:37,080 --> 01:01:38,080
Yes.

736
01:01:46,280 --> 01:01:47,920
Can you picture it?

737
01:01:50,334 --> 01:01:52,360
And can I get that woman too, hm?

738
01:01:54,400 --> 01:01:56,560
If I get that man too.

739
01:02:19,320 --> 01:02:20,800
Come here.

740
01:02:39,600 --> 01:02:41,480
- Are you OK?
- Yes.

741
01:02:56,080 --> 01:02:59,840
- Shall I go to the girls?
- No, I'm coming.

742
01:03:13,280 --> 01:03:15,795
Hey, come here.
Well done.

743
01:03:16,639 --> 01:03:20,040
There's nothing wrong. Yes, good, good.

744
01:03:20,160 --> 01:03:21,440
Well done.

745
01:03:23,320 --> 01:03:26,280
Very good, very good.

746
01:03:26,827 --> 01:03:28,920
Hey, hey, sst.

747
01:03:30,960 --> 01:03:32,840
- Mich?
- Yes, what?

748
01:03:34,600 --> 01:03:37,360
- We have to do something.
- Yes, what then?

749
01:03:37,480 --> 01:03:40,135
I think we need to
talk to that journalist.

750
01:03:40,529 --> 01:03:42,840
But then I have to go
on TV to defend myself.

751
01:03:42,960 --> 01:03:45,360
That man sends private investigators
to my work.

752
01:03:52,120 --> 01:03:55,480
Then I have to tell on TV
how I got that perpetrator knowledge.

753
01:04:15,400 --> 01:04:18,200
- Jan Vlug.
- Good afternoon, Mr Vlug.

754
01:04:18,320 --> 01:04:21,240
- Who am I speaking to?
- With Bas Haan.

755
01:04:21,560 --> 01:04:22,395
Bas Haan.

756
01:04:22,445 --> 01:04:25,600
I would like to speak with a
client of you, Michael de Jong.

757
01:04:25,900 --> 01:04:27,400
I can not reach him.

758
01:04:27,520 --> 01:04:31,113
Oh, so you thought,
let me call his lawyer?

759
01:04:31,754 --> 01:04:36,080
- I assume you can reach him.
- He doesn't want to speak to you.

760
01:04:40,080 --> 01:04:41,080
Hello.

761
01:04:43,619 --> 01:04:45,699
Did anything happen today?

762
01:04:52,753 --> 01:04:55,040
Mr Haan, let me be clear.

763
01:04:55,300 --> 01:05:00,535
According to me and my client,
you are part of the Mr. De Hond group.

764
01:05:01,058 --> 01:05:03,880
You have made more than
ten broadcasts about this case.

765
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:08,089
And in the last one, Mr. De Hond
got to call my client a murderer...

766
01:05:08,236 --> 01:05:10,160
in front of the whole nation.

767
01:05:10,280 --> 01:05:12,080
'100% sure.'

768
01:05:13,377 --> 01:05:16,880
I understand your reaction,
but I only care about the facts.

769
01:05:17,000 --> 01:05:20,880
I can't investigate a lot,
without his explanation.

770
01:05:23,752 --> 01:05:26,040
You wanted to speak to me?

771
01:05:27,400 --> 01:05:28,680
Sit down.

772
01:05:29,587 --> 01:05:33,400
I'm not judging anyone,
but given all the media attention...

773
01:05:33,520 --> 01:05:38,240
it may be in your client's interest
to highlight his side of the story.

774
01:05:40,066 --> 01:05:45,440
First you make his life hell
and now he has to tell his story...

775
01:05:45,560 --> 01:05:47,640
so that you have your next broadcast.

776
01:05:49,011 --> 01:05:53,080
It must be weird, huh,
all that stuff in the media.

777
01:05:53,200 --> 01:05:55,793
Pf. It's a nightmare.

778
01:05:56,428 --> 01:05:58,228
And especially for Meike.

779
01:05:59,520 --> 01:06:03,270
Maurice's accusations about you
are not nothing...

780
01:06:03,785 --> 01:06:07,000
No, but that man is insane you know.

781
01:06:09,760 --> 01:06:13,634
I would like to point out that
Michael and his girlfriend...

782
01:06:13,684 --> 01:06:15,840
are very fond of their privacy.

783
01:06:16,103 --> 01:06:19,680
These are people who don't need
or want to be in the picture.

784
01:06:19,800 --> 01:06:21,580
Unlike some others.

785
01:06:21,630 --> 01:06:23,720
Those people exist, Mr. Haan.

786
01:06:23,840 --> 01:06:28,059
Personally, I understand them very
well. Better than you probably think.

787
01:06:28,400 --> 01:06:31,290
But as long as they don't defend
themselves, Maurice can shoot freely.

788
01:06:34,110 --> 01:06:35,480
For the last time...

789
01:06:35,673 --> 01:06:41,118
My clients don't want to answer for
something they have no part in.

790
01:06:41,639 --> 01:06:45,487
And for Mr. De Hond, he will
soon have to answer for himself...

791
01:06:45,538 --> 01:06:47,200
when I sue him for libel.

792
01:06:47,396 --> 01:06:48,760
Bye Mr. Haan.

793
01:06:50,160 --> 01:06:51,320
Shit.

794
01:06:51,440 --> 01:06:52,960
Shit, shit, shit.

795
01:06:54,480 --> 01:06:58,512
There are customers of
ours who would rather...

796
01:06:58,562 --> 01:07:00,815
not have you come
to them anymore.

797
01:07:01,920 --> 01:07:02,920
Who?

798
01:07:04,360 --> 01:07:05,520
Customers.

799
01:07:13,640 --> 01:07:15,257
Have I lost my job?

800
01:07:40,920 --> 01:07:42,480
Who are you?

801
01:07:43,680 --> 01:07:45,000
Who are you?

802
01:07:47,330 --> 01:07:48,529
Who are you?

803
01:07:51,920 --> 01:07:53,400
Leave us alone.

804
01:07:55,240 --> 01:07:56,640
Leave me alone.

805
01:08:11,000 --> 01:08:12,200
How is it going?

806
01:08:12,952 --> 01:08:14,406
It has been a long time.

807
01:08:15,109 --> 01:08:16,680
Long time, indeed.

808
01:08:18,000 --> 01:08:19,600
Good to have you here.

809
01:08:19,921 --> 01:08:22,880
A lot of people are sticking up
for me now...

810
01:08:23,210 --> 01:08:27,080
but you were one of the first
to believe and stand up for me.

811
01:08:41,203 --> 01:08:43,390
I've dived into the matter again.

812
01:08:44,257 --> 01:08:46,555
I've put everything back together.

813
01:08:47,711 --> 01:08:50,960
You were with Mrs. Wittenberg
the morning of the murder.

814
01:08:52,880 --> 01:08:56,481
In your diary you write
that she was wearing something red.

815
01:08:57,419 --> 01:09:03,080
""I can't remember whether it was a dress
or a suit, but the color was red.""

816
01:09:06,336 --> 01:09:09,520
But the blouse she wore when she
was killed, was white.

817
01:09:09,880 --> 01:09:11,211
Yes...

818
01:09:15,520 --> 01:09:21,238
You always said the DNA got on her
blouse during your visit that morning.

819
01:09:22,520 --> 01:09:26,600
What I don't understand,
is how it got on that white blouse.

820
01:09:27,280 --> 01:09:29,280
Wasn't she wearing something red?

821
01:09:40,402 --> 01:09:43,418
And speaking of that white blouse...

822
01:09:44,360 --> 01:09:48,090
That blood in the collar,
how did they get it?

823
01:09:49,894 --> 01:09:53,080
Um, I donated blood in 1999.

824
01:09:53,200 --> 01:09:57,320
- In my cell, for a DNA profile.
- Where is that written down?

825
01:09:57,440 --> 01:09:59,158
I must have read over it.

826
01:09:59,534 --> 01:10:02,120
I could hardly have
written everything down.

827
01:10:02,533 --> 01:10:05,455
123 typed pages...

828
01:10:05,706 --> 01:10:09,182
of literally every detail
since your arrest.

829
01:10:09,880 --> 01:10:13,270
And then they come into
your cell, take your blood,

830
01:10:13,643 --> 01:10:15,480
and you don't write that down?

831
01:10:34,016 --> 01:10:38,484
In '99 they put my DNA profile
in the database.

832
01:10:39,758 --> 01:10:44,200
That profile required blood.
Then they must have taken it, right?

833
01:10:44,320 --> 01:10:48,640
It wasn't until 2003 that a DNA profile
was made of you, for your review.

834
01:10:48,760 --> 01:10:52,240
- With a cotton swab, in your cheek.
- You're not listening.

835
01:10:52,360 --> 01:10:57,360
I am listening. You say that
blood was drawn in 1999...

836
01:10:57,480 --> 01:11:00,080
to commit fraud with in 2003.

837
01:11:01,414 --> 01:11:06,515
Do they always hold back some blood in
case someone's first conviction fails?

838
01:11:17,629 --> 01:11:21,320
How can you be sure that no
blood has been drawn?

839
01:11:21,440 --> 01:11:24,640
Everything in my case is counterfeit.
Bas!

840
01:11:24,760 --> 01:11:26,360
Everything.

841
01:11:26,480 --> 01:11:28,240
Bas, everything!

842
01:11:30,240 --> 01:11:31,720
Bas!

843
01:11:55,010 --> 01:11:57,120
- Hi.
- I do not have that much time.

844
01:11:57,480 --> 01:11:59,685
It's lunch break
and my boss is strict.

845
01:11:59,893 --> 01:12:01,920
I just have a few questions.

846
01:12:02,040 --> 01:12:03,523
You're not
recording it, are you?

847
01:12:04,299 --> 01:12:07,158
This is as off the
record as it gets.

848
01:12:07,440 --> 01:12:08,440
Really?

849
01:12:13,920 --> 01:12:17,040
Yes, okay. Shall we
just stand there for a while?

850
01:12:17,160 --> 01:12:18,160
Yes.

851
01:12:33,731 --> 01:12:35,789
Actually, I already know a lot.

852
01:12:36,067 --> 01:12:39,285
I'm mainly looking for confirmation
of two things.

853
01:12:40,668 --> 01:12:43,720
A new will was drawn up
ten days before the murder...

854
01:12:43,840 --> 01:12:47,964
in which Louwes becomes
executor of the widow...

855
01:12:48,360 --> 01:12:53,400
and president of a foundation that
manages her millions after her death.

856
01:12:54,440 --> 01:12:56,549
Sorry, I really can't do this.

857
01:12:56,960 --> 01:13:00,360
I thought it would be more about
what I thought of Louwes.

858
01:13:00,565 --> 01:13:05,541
Don't worry, no one will ever
find out about this, I guarantee it.

859
01:13:05,840 --> 01:13:08,680
My word is everything, otherwise
no one will ever talk to me again.

860
01:13:08,940 --> 01:13:12,440
Everything is so specific.
It can only come from me.

861
01:13:12,560 --> 01:13:16,640
It can come from a variety of sources.
No one knows if you work for justice...

862
01:13:16,760 --> 01:13:21,783
or with an involved lawyer,
notary, insurer or Louwes' office.

863
01:13:22,160 --> 01:13:25,360
- Or that you know someone there.
- When you have so much choice...

864
01:13:27,440 --> 01:13:28,480
Listen.

865
01:13:29,049 --> 01:13:33,240
You agreed to this meeting because
things don't sit well with you, right?

866
01:13:34,480 --> 01:13:38,320
Sorry, I shouldn't have...
I shouldn't have come.

867
01:13:42,932 --> 01:13:47,280
You don't necessarily have to talk.
There are also other ways to…

868
01:13:48,320 --> 01:13:51,280
Maybe you know someone
who would like to talk.

869
01:14:06,840 --> 01:14:10,880
<i>This is the knife with which
Michael de Jong stabbed the widow.</i>

870
01:14:11,000 --> 01:14:13,520
<i>With a blade of ten centimeters.</i>

871
01:14:14,520 --> 01:14:17,949
<i>I'll show it here. Ten centimeters.</i>

872
01:14:18,520 --> 01:14:22,457
<i>Michael de Jong killed
the widow with five stabs.</i>

873
01:14:41,840 --> 01:14:44,600
<i>According to expert research...</i>

874
01:14:47,800 --> 01:14:49,840
I uh... found this one.

875
01:14:54,880 --> 01:14:55,960
Get rid of it.

876
01:15:09,240 --> 01:15:11,720
Mr. Vlug, Bas Haan.

877
01:15:13,280 --> 01:15:14,760
Again, yes.

878
01:15:15,599 --> 01:15:19,145
No, I understand that, but you
can propose it to them, can't you?

879
01:15:19,224 --> 01:15:23,000
In a place they choose, without a
camera, in your presence.

880
01:15:26,080 --> 01:15:27,320
I understand.

881
01:15:28,520 --> 01:15:29,520
Yes.

882
01:15:31,400 --> 01:15:32,400
Okay.

883
01:16:00,880 --> 01:16:02,600
Thank you, Maurice.

884
01:17:51,880 --> 01:17:52,960
Michael?

885
01:17:55,480 --> 01:17:56,800
This is Bas Haan.

886
01:17:58,880 --> 01:18:03,247
I know you know my name and
you don't want to talk to me.

887
01:18:05,520 --> 01:18:07,000
And I understand that.

888
01:18:12,480 --> 01:18:13,480
Michael?

889
01:18:20,440 --> 01:18:21,840
Give me a chance.

890
01:18:23,600 --> 01:18:26,800
You get to tell your whole story,
primetime.

891
01:18:30,280 --> 01:18:31,280
Michael.

892
01:18:44,367 --> 01:18:46,515
I'll leave my card here for you.

893
01:19:13,410 --> 01:19:14,770
No sender.

894
01:19:33,230 --> 01:19:35,120
You know whose it is?

895
01:19:35,240 --> 01:19:36,879
I can't say that.

896
01:19:37,410 --> 01:19:40,520
Only that
it left me with a proper cold.

897
01:19:48,760 --> 01:19:50,480
Holy shit.

898
01:19:58,400 --> 01:20:00,800
- Are we shooting?
- Just a moment.

899
01:20:01,978 --> 01:20:03,520
Professor Van Mourik.

900
01:20:03,840 --> 01:20:05,608
As an inheritance
law specialist...

901
01:20:05,658 --> 01:20:08,640
what do you think about
Louwes' letter to the notary...

902
01:20:08,760 --> 01:20:10,400
two months prior to the murder?

903
01:20:11,280 --> 01:20:15,680
Louwes asks the notary to
put in the draft will...

904
01:20:15,800 --> 01:20:18,960
that he becomes the sole director
of a foundation...

905
01:20:19,080 --> 01:20:21,960
which manages all assets
after her death.

906
01:20:22,080 --> 01:20:25,720
And that he does not have to
appoint fellow directors.

907
01:20:25,840 --> 01:20:29,720
In short: that he is the sole ruler
of the wealth...

908
01:20:29,840 --> 01:20:32,360
and can do with it
whatever he pleases.

909
01:20:32,480 --> 01:20:35,400
And he was already working on that
two months before the murder.

910
01:20:35,520 --> 01:20:37,200
Apparently, yes.

911
01:20:37,320 --> 01:20:41,400
But that is not how it turned out
in the final will.

912
01:20:41,840 --> 01:20:46,680
That notary probably smelled a fuse
and thought: we're not going to do that.

913
01:20:47,200 --> 01:20:50,353
That is why Louwes
is ultimately forced

914
01:20:50,832 --> 01:20:53,278
to appoint two
fellow directors?

915
01:20:53,440 --> 01:20:55,280
It strongly resembles that.

916
01:20:55,621 --> 01:21:00,320
But he then chose two colleagues
from his office...

917
01:21:00,440 --> 01:21:03,771
whom he made excited with money
and goods from the foundation...

918
01:21:03,822 --> 01:21:05,986
at least this is what they
declared to the police.

919
01:21:06,104 --> 01:21:07,480
What do you think of that?

920
01:21:09,440 --> 01:21:11,385
The combination of facts...

921
01:21:11,680 --> 01:21:15,840
also that he was trying to
transfer money to a private account...

922
01:21:16,320 --> 01:21:19,280
that leads very clearly in the
direction of Louwes.

923
01:21:19,400 --> 01:21:24,680
You targeted the widow's money,
but you handled it stupidly.

924
01:21:36,200 --> 01:21:37,200
Hey, Meike.

925
01:21:39,056 --> 01:21:43,600
- You better leave that curtain closed.
- It's still there, though.

926
01:21:46,800 --> 01:21:49,520
- I'm going to call the police.
- And then?

927
01:21:52,108 --> 01:21:54,788
You already know what they're
going to say, right?

928
01:21:55,600 --> 01:21:58,810
Well, ma'am, what does he do?

929
01:21:59,960 --> 01:22:04,560
Yes, if he doesn't do anything, then
uh... then we can't do anything either.

930
01:22:04,680 --> 01:22:07,160
Because you can just stand there.

931
01:22:08,640 --> 01:22:10,400
Yeah, no, it's uh...

932
01:22:11,030 --> 01:22:13,640
We can maybe drive by later...

933
01:22:14,160 --> 01:22:18,320
But we are not a private police,
we have to guard the whole city.

934
01:22:18,440 --> 01:22:21,120
Pickpockets, terrorists...

935
01:22:21,240 --> 01:22:23,800
car thefts...

936
01:22:23,920 --> 01:22:24,960
squatters.

937
01:22:47,480 --> 01:22:48,640
Come here.

938
01:22:59,320 --> 01:23:00,400
Jesus.

939
01:23:07,304 --> 01:23:09,840
Oh no.

940
01:23:09,960 --> 01:23:13,077
No, No. Stop, stop, stop, stop.

941
01:23:15,640 --> 01:23:16,913
Out.

942
01:23:17,440 --> 01:23:19,960
- No no no.
- I'm going to get the car.

943
01:23:21,840 --> 01:23:25,800
Come on, come on. It's okay, it's okay.

944
01:23:25,920 --> 01:23:27,120
Hey baby.

945
01:23:27,240 --> 01:23:30,520
We're going to take good care of you,
poopie, aren't we?

946
01:23:41,680 --> 01:23:44,480
It's okay, it's okay.

947
01:24:19,920 --> 01:24:24,560
- Mich, let's talk to that reporter.
- Ah, Mei... Meike, that...

948
01:24:29,480 --> 01:24:30,480
Mich.

949
01:24:34,080 --> 01:24:35,080
No.

950
01:24:39,720 --> 01:24:41,000
Um...

951
01:24:41,548 --> 01:24:45,805
We had to cut open her neck to
remove the skewers, but...

952
01:24:47,680 --> 01:24:50,520
But it looks like she will survive.

953
01:24:55,162 --> 01:24:57,762
- Can we...
- You can see her later.

954
01:25:03,840 --> 01:25:04,840
Hey girl.

955
01:25:10,560 --> 01:25:16,360
And yes, the only conclusion is...
Or the strong suspicion then arises...

956
01:25:16,480 --> 01:25:19,040
He wanted the money for himself.

957
01:25:20,840 --> 01:25:22,449
Press release OM.

958
01:25:23,277 --> 01:25:25,560
- New DNA research.
- What now?

959
01:25:25,680 --> 01:25:28,851
Y-chromosomal DNA research.

960
01:25:29,601 --> 01:25:31,200
It's a new technique.

961
01:25:31,742 --> 01:25:34,120
Performed on the nails of the widow.

962
01:25:35,080 --> 01:25:36,320
Gerda.

963
01:25:36,440 --> 01:25:38,800
It is a match with Louwes.

964
01:25:42,440 --> 01:25:44,881
This technique does not produce
a unique profile.

965
01:25:44,932 --> 01:25:49,978
3 to 4% of men have the profile
found on the nails.

966
01:25:50,502 --> 01:25:52,000
But Louwes has it.

967
01:25:53,440 --> 01:25:54,440
Wow.

968
01:25:55,920 --> 01:26:00,200
- There go Knoops' fingernails.
- Yes, plus Louwes' motive.

969
01:26:00,865 --> 01:26:04,920
- And he lied about drawing blood.
- It looks like it.

970
01:26:05,360 --> 01:26:08,680
Check that nail news,
also from an expert.

971
01:26:08,800 --> 01:26:11,960
If it's right, than it's going
to be broadcast.

972
01:26:13,960 --> 01:26:16,280
<i>And now they come with nails.</i>

973
01:26:16,400 --> 01:26:20,680
<i>They were also investigated in 2004
and then there was nothing on it.</i>

974
01:26:20,800 --> 01:26:26,080
<i>But Maurice, there is now a
technique that can now find something...</i>

975
01:26:26,200 --> 01:26:28,616
Yes, but that's the
misunderstanding.

976
01:26:28,666 --> 01:26:31,760
And that is also neat
PR trick from the OM...

977
01:27:04,764 --> 01:27:07,280
I thought of something last night.
Those nails.

978
01:27:07,514 --> 01:27:12,120
What if the handyman has the same
profile as those 3 to 4% of men?

979
01:27:12,240 --> 01:27:14,278
If not, then the broadcast
becomes difficult.

980
01:27:14,328 --> 01:27:15,760
Everyone will start speculating.

981
01:27:15,880 --> 01:27:17,800
That man never does.

982
01:27:18,762 --> 01:27:21,640
Even if he didn't,
there may be a match.

983
01:27:21,760 --> 01:27:24,760
But if there is no match,
he is 100% innocent.

984
01:27:24,880 --> 01:27:26,095
Yes.

985
01:27:26,333 --> 01:27:29,840
Just make sure you get to talk
to that handyman at all.

986
01:27:55,600 --> 01:27:56,709
Hey.

987
01:27:57,240 --> 01:27:58,400
That's mommy.

988
01:28:09,760 --> 01:28:10,800
Hey.

989
01:28:10,920 --> 01:28:13,200
Eggs. Aaah.

990
01:28:19,760 --> 01:28:21,040
How was your day?

991
01:28:23,960 --> 01:28:25,720
Yes, fantastic.

992
01:29:12,463 --> 01:29:13,503
What?

993
01:29:13,963 --> 01:29:18,480
That he wants to help me get rid of you.
They're ready for me.

994
01:29:21,190 --> 01:29:22,880
What bullshit.

995
01:29:24,263 --> 01:29:26,160
So now they know where we live.

996
01:29:27,800 --> 01:29:31,240
There's no stamp on it,
someone just delivers this.

997
01:29:58,880 --> 01:30:00,464
I can't do this anymore.

998
01:30:00,653 --> 01:30:02,097
I can't do this anymore.

999
01:30:02,317 --> 01:30:04,160
I can't take this anymore.

1000
01:30:04,473 --> 01:30:06,320
I can't.

1001
01:30:06,440 --> 01:30:11,520
You destroy everything.
You destroy everything. Goddamnit.

1002
01:30:13,680 --> 01:30:14,720
Hey.

1003
01:30:15,086 --> 01:30:19,160
Hey, hey, hey.

1004
01:30:19,280 --> 01:30:22,960
I'm going to talk to that journalist.
I'm going to talk to him.

1005
01:30:23,080 --> 01:30:24,120
Yes?

1006
01:30:24,240 --> 01:30:25,240
Yes?

1007
01:30:50,960 --> 01:30:51,960
Mr. Vlug?

1008
01:30:54,280 --> 01:30:55,280
Yes>

1009
01:30:56,640 --> 01:30:58,440
No, of course.

1010
01:30:58,560 --> 01:30:59,960
Tuesday is fine.

1011
01:31:01,200 --> 01:31:02,200
Yes.

1012
01:31:12,550 --> 01:31:13,680
Yes!

1013
01:31:16,160 --> 01:31:17,160
Yes!

1014
01:31:36,960 --> 01:31:37,960
Mr Haan.

1015
01:31:47,840 --> 01:31:49,720
Meet Michael and Meike.

1016
01:31:51,400 --> 01:31:52,579
Bas.

1017
01:31:53,200 --> 01:31:54,280
Hallo.

1018
01:31:55,430 --> 01:31:56,870
Let's sit down.

1019
01:32:10,980 --> 01:32:12,600
Go ahead, Mr Haan.

1020
01:32:12,915 --> 01:32:14,882
My clients are ready.

1021
01:32:17,760 --> 01:32:23,025
First of all thank you very much
for being willing to meet me.

1022
01:32:28,040 --> 01:32:29,586
I understand...

1023
01:32:32,040 --> 01:32:35,600
I understand that you would
rather not be here.

1024
01:32:37,774 --> 01:32:41,480
But if you don't respond
to what Maurice writes...

1025
01:32:41,960 --> 01:32:44,857
then I fear that in the
eyes of the general public...

1026
01:32:45,006 --> 01:32:47,960
the handyman is the killer.

1027
01:32:49,731 --> 01:32:55,599
I'd like to check some things from
Maurice's website one by one.

1028
01:32:56,231 --> 01:32:58,400
- Is that okay?
- Yes.

1029
01:33:06,320 --> 01:33:10,120
Have you ever been a patient
of Dr. Wittenberg?

1030
01:33:12,240 --> 01:33:13,240
No.

1031
01:33:14,280 --> 01:33:18,905
No, I knew the doctor from the
antique store where I worked.

1032
01:33:19,120 --> 01:33:21,480
Mrs Wittenberg too.

1033
01:33:22,030 --> 01:33:25,600
But I had nothing to do
with the doctor's profession.

1034
01:33:25,720 --> 01:33:29,120
I am not a psychiatric patient.

1035
01:33:29,240 --> 01:33:31,912
Not from him
and not from anyone else.

1036
01:33:37,877 --> 01:33:40,440
You would have hit rock bottom...

1037
01:33:41,252 --> 01:33:43,767
and lack of money because
you didn't have a job.

1038
01:33:43,845 --> 01:33:48,800
Michaël worked from 1993 to 2002
through and for a job placement company.

1039
01:33:49,884 --> 01:33:55,105
As a supervisor, manager, quality
controller and security officer...

1040
01:33:55,720 --> 01:33:58,673
for about 36 hours a week. Here.

1041
01:33:59,196 --> 01:34:00,400
'Michaël de Jong

1042
01:34:00,798 --> 01:34:04,891
is a very reliable,
extremely knowledgeable employee.'

1043
01:34:05,329 --> 01:34:06,493
And here:

1044
01:34:06,760 --> 01:34:10,947
'Welcome to provide
references about Mr. MC de Jong.'

1045
01:34:11,494 --> 01:34:13,760
The murder was in 1999...

1046
01:34:13,880 --> 01:34:18,575
so Michael was working at that company
from long before until long after.

1047
01:34:20,240 --> 01:34:24,680
So no unemployment and no decline.

1048
01:34:24,800 --> 01:34:30,596
And I'm not a handyman at all. I did
odd jobs at her house sometimes, but...

1049
01:34:31,300 --> 01:34:32,360
nothing more.

1050
01:34:34,069 --> 01:34:35,640
The bookkeeper
is not a bookkeeper.

1051
01:34:36,569 --> 01:34:38,600
and the handyman
is not a handyman.

1052
01:34:39,600 --> 01:34:40,800
And drugs?

1053
01:34:41,120 --> 01:34:45,480
Yes, that's quite a nice one.
I can't even do drugs.

1054
01:34:45,643 --> 01:34:48,040
I have an allergy, uh...

1055
01:34:48,160 --> 01:34:51,534
- Quincke's edema.
- Doctor's statement.

1056
01:34:52,440 --> 01:34:55,721
I can drop dead if I do drugs.

1057
01:34:56,680 --> 01:35:00,760
Luckily I don't have an alcohol
allergy. I can drink beer in peace.

1058
01:35:00,880 --> 01:35:03,240
And I've been drunk sometimes.

1059
01:35:05,024 --> 01:35:07,377
I've never ran somebody over as well.

1060
01:35:07,480 --> 01:35:09,840
- Well... No, sorry.
- Do not.

1061
01:35:09,960 --> 01:35:12,280
No, sorry, sorry.

1062
01:35:15,283 --> 01:35:17,200
What about that alibi?

1063
01:35:17,548 --> 01:35:20,840
It doesn't matter what we
say about it, right?

1064
01:35:21,344 --> 01:35:25,280
Yes, we said different things.
You can't change that

1065
01:35:25,400 --> 01:35:31,320
When we say we are mistaken,
De Hond calls us pathological liars.

1066
01:35:31,493 --> 01:35:35,480
Then everyone runs after it. But if
Louwes and his wife are mistaken...

1067
01:35:35,531 --> 01:35:36,541
That's true.

1068
01:35:36,592 --> 01:35:40,520
Louwes and his wife also contradicted
each other on this same point.

1069
01:35:40,640 --> 01:35:41,680
I know.

1070
01:35:41,800 --> 01:35:46,948
...Louwes and mister De Hond. But when
we say something, we are the liars

1071
01:35:50,120 --> 01:35:53,320
But then there is the point of
knowing the perpetrator.

1072
01:35:56,520 --> 01:35:57,520
Yes but...

1073
01:36:00,000 --> 01:36:02,000
I don't want to say anything about that.

1074
01:36:02,120 --> 01:36:04,937
At that time the police
questioned Michael about it

1075
01:36:05,609 --> 01:36:07,680
and decided not to prosecute him.

1076
01:36:09,101 --> 01:36:12,440
It doesn't make my story
any more credible, but...

1077
01:36:12,560 --> 01:36:14,480
But a DNA test will.

1078
01:36:14,835 --> 01:36:17,102
I presume you know
about the nail dirt?

1079
01:36:17,152 --> 01:36:19,720
Mr. Haan, my
client is not crazy.

1080
01:36:19,987 --> 01:36:25,360
I understand the risk,
but it could end all discussion.

1081
01:36:25,480 --> 01:36:30,040
Oh, just when I was beginning to believe
that your opportunism had limits.

1082
01:36:30,160 --> 01:36:32,640
It's definitely not that, but...

1083
01:36:32,760 --> 01:36:36,158
Look, if you do it
and you don't like the results

1084
01:36:36,208 --> 01:36:40,120
you can keep
sweep it under the rug.

1085
01:36:40,240 --> 01:36:41,560
Says the journalist.

1086
01:36:41,680 --> 01:36:44,240
You don't have to tell me anything.

1087
01:36:44,360 --> 01:36:46,624
Such a test can probably
be done anonymously.

1088
01:36:46,674 --> 01:36:50,560
Independently
and with a notary...

1089
01:36:50,680 --> 01:36:51,880
No, we'll do it.

1090
01:36:52,000 --> 01:36:55,773
- Michael.
- No, and I want Mr. Haan to film that.

1091
01:36:57,773 --> 01:37:00,640
So everyone can see,
huh, that there's...

1092
01:37:01,992 --> 01:37:04,040
- that it is clear.
- Michael.

1093
01:37:04,160 --> 01:37:06,360
One in 25 men has that profile.

1094
01:37:06,570 --> 01:37:08,854
And then I got it, so what?

1095
01:37:09,242 --> 01:37:13,240
Then everyone will think I did it.
What's the difference with now?

1096
01:37:16,720 --> 01:37:18,480
We're already dead anyway.

1097
01:37:36,760 --> 01:37:38,480
Don't make it too late...

1098
01:37:39,127 --> 01:37:41,630
The final report of Brouwer's
exploratory investigation

1099
01:37:41,680 --> 01:37:42,960
has been leaked.

1100
01:37:43,080 --> 01:37:44,205
Of course.

1101
01:37:44,760 --> 01:37:47,040
And? Any news?

1102
01:37:50,080 --> 01:37:51,212
No.

1103
01:37:51,462 --> 01:37:54,320
Then the motive and knowledge
of the perpetrator remain.

1104
01:37:58,880 --> 01:38:01,080
What did Michael himself say about it?

1105
01:38:01,629 --> 01:38:03,789
He doesn't want to
say anything about that.

1106
01:38:03,840 --> 01:38:05,367
I didn't ask about the motive.

1107
01:38:05,418 --> 01:38:09,003
- That wouldn't prove anything.
- What was it again?

1108
01:38:09,400 --> 01:38:12,960
Mrs Wittenberg would have
cut his bequest in half...

1109
01:38:13,080 --> 01:38:16,680
and he allegedly killed her
in a drunken brawl.

1110
01:38:18,080 --> 01:38:21,556
Well, that remains a point
for Maurice then.

1111
01:38:22,400 --> 01:38:24,480
If we assume that.

1112
01:38:53,812 --> 01:38:58,460
If Maurice and the judiciary have
determined that halving of the bequest..

1113
01:38:59,236 --> 01:39:01,413
then you have to explain me how.

1114
01:39:02,677 --> 01:39:03,917
This is the old one.

1115
01:39:06,385 --> 01:39:09,440
'To Mr. MC de Jong, free of duties
and costs...

1116
01:39:09,560 --> 01:39:13,560
an amount in cash of 25,000 guilders.'

1117
01:39:13,680 --> 01:39:15,200
This is the new one.

1118
01:39:15,986 --> 01:39:18,655
'To Mr. MC de Jong,
free of duties and costs...

1119
01:39:18,760 --> 01:39:21,720
an amount in cash
of 25,000 guilders.'

1120
01:39:21,840 --> 01:39:22,840
- No.
- Yes.

1121
01:39:24,828 --> 01:39:28,628
- And no one has ever checked this?
- No one. Yes, me now.

1122
01:39:38,320 --> 01:39:39,874
One more to go.

1123
01:39:40,320 --> 01:39:41,593
Yes.

1124
01:39:42,171 --> 01:39:45,554
But he doesn't want
to say anything about that. Anyway.

1125
01:39:46,530 --> 01:39:50,475
If the DNA test shows it isn't him,
then it isn't him.

1126
01:39:55,760 --> 01:39:57,440
Maybe he doesn't dare.

1127
01:39:58,440 --> 01:40:01,760
It's kind of like Russian roulette,
right?

1128
01:40:04,840 --> 01:40:06,000
Do you already have that one?

1129
01:40:07,680 --> 01:40:09,680
- With the door?
- Yes.

1130
01:40:17,758 --> 01:40:20,320
No, that's not going to work.
It's too dark.

1131
01:40:21,920 --> 01:40:22,960
Shit.

1132
01:40:23,080 --> 01:40:28,412
Sorry, we weren't ready yet.
Would you like to step out again?

1133
01:40:43,959 --> 01:40:45,799
- How is it going?
- Yes...

1134
01:40:46,720 --> 01:40:48,360
What are you doing, man?

1135
01:40:49,040 --> 01:40:51,240
Yeah, uh, I had to report myself.

1136
01:40:51,532 --> 01:40:52,612
For what?

1137
01:41:01,371 --> 01:41:04,080
Mr De Jong, come on in.

1138
01:41:07,120 --> 01:41:08,200
Hello.

1139
01:41:09,012 --> 01:41:10,080
Michael de Jong.

1140
01:41:10,200 --> 01:41:11,400
- Frans.
- Hi.

1141
01:41:21,558 --> 01:41:26,600
Several people stated that you had said
at Mrs Wittenberg's funeral...

1142
01:41:26,720 --> 01:41:30,600
that her body was found in the living
room and the time of the finding.

1143
01:41:31,400 --> 01:41:32,400
That's right?

1144
01:41:33,440 --> 01:41:35,455
Yes, everyone had questions.

1145
01:41:36,160 --> 01:41:38,040
And you had answers?

1146
01:41:40,600 --> 01:41:44,680
So unreal.
Last Wednesday I was still with her.

1147
01:41:46,572 --> 01:41:48,052
That's bizarre.

1148
01:41:50,160 --> 01:41:52,440
No one says or knows anything.

1149
01:41:59,373 --> 01:42:03,490
But how? That information was only
known to the police.

1150
01:42:04,357 --> 01:42:06,160
Oh that uh...

1151
01:42:06,280 --> 01:42:07,920
I did not know that.

1152
01:42:08,209 --> 01:42:10,320
Do you know what that means?

1153
01:42:11,618 --> 01:42:14,640
This means that you have
perpetrator knowledge.

1154
01:42:21,587 --> 01:42:23,640
Do you understand what I just said?

1155
01:42:24,120 --> 01:42:27,719
Yes, but it sounds so absurd.
Perpetrator knowledge.

1156
01:42:29,440 --> 01:42:31,720
How did you know she was laying there?

1157
01:42:34,000 --> 01:42:36,520
- I had heard that.
- From whom?

1158
01:42:39,040 --> 01:42:40,320
From someone.

1159
01:42:40,760 --> 01:42:42,000
Someone?

1160
01:42:44,210 --> 01:42:46,186
Come on, it's coming out anyway.

1161
01:42:48,811 --> 01:42:51,522
It must have been
a real massacre.

1162
01:42:51,774 --> 01:42:54,360
I overheard a
detective talking about it.

1163
01:42:54,480 --> 01:42:56,760
Five stabs to her chest.

1164
01:43:09,150 --> 01:43:11,158
So you protect the perpetrator?

1165
01:43:11,320 --> 01:43:13,600
I don't want
to get anyone in trouble.

1166
01:43:14,830 --> 01:43:17,840
If you continue like this,
you will be in trouble.

1167
01:43:19,289 --> 01:43:23,200
She didn't show up for a
hairdressing appointment on Saturday.

1168
01:43:23,320 --> 01:43:26,108
Her regular hairdresser
called the police.

1169
01:43:26,273 --> 01:43:28,200
The card said Thursday.

1170
01:43:28,320 --> 01:43:31,920
Then she was murdered.
They didn't find her until Saturday.

1171
01:43:32,040 --> 01:43:33,360
In the living room.

1172
01:43:35,240 --> 01:43:36,280
Well, hey.

1173
01:43:54,160 --> 01:43:55,920
Sst. Yes.

1174
01:44:01,800 --> 01:44:04,448
Well, has it been recorded?

1175
01:44:04,839 --> 01:44:06,640
Otherwise we'll do it again.

1176
01:44:06,760 --> 01:44:08,760
Then we are just as happy.

1177
01:44:14,423 --> 01:44:17,640
It's golden, Bas.
How many minutes do you need?

1178
01:44:17,760 --> 01:44:21,640
The exclusion of Michael on the
basis of the DNA test...

1179
01:44:21,760 --> 01:44:25,320
the new DNA evidence against Louwes,
his possible motive...

1180
01:44:25,440 --> 01:44:29,360
the interview with Professor Van Mourik
about this, the De Hond method...

1181
01:44:30,400 --> 01:44:31,760
The whole broadcast.

1182
01:44:32,291 --> 01:44:33,560
Well, you're in luck.

1183
01:44:33,680 --> 01:44:37,040
Rein needs more time for that
special on campaign finance,

1184
01:44:37,617 --> 01:44:38,832
so Wednesday.

1185
01:44:38,883 --> 01:44:40,520
- In two days?
- Yes.

1186
01:44:40,640 --> 01:44:43,200
I can't make it. There are
hours of material.

1187
01:44:43,320 --> 01:44:45,080
No, I understand.

1188
01:44:45,332 --> 01:44:49,200
Let's see. Well, then... yes, then
Tuesday. Next week. Can you manage that?

1189
01:44:50,200 --> 01:44:51,200
Yes.

1190
01:44:55,000 --> 01:44:59,319
It is absolutely
impossible that the...

1191
01:44:59,369 --> 01:45:03,280
handyman left the
DNA on the nails.

1192
01:45:03,400 --> 01:45:08,840
Eh, title of Eikelenboom. Then I would
do the microscope shot now.

1193
01:45:14,400 --> 01:45:16,080
Oh no, wait. uh...

1194
01:45:17,080 --> 01:45:20,454
Just put the quote from Vlug here,
that's better.

1195
01:45:21,095 --> 01:45:23,640
This is rock solid technical proof...

1196
01:45:23,760 --> 01:45:28,322
that Michael de Jong cannot be linked to
the murder in any way.

1197
01:45:37,880 --> 01:45:38,880
Yes.

1198
01:45:40,880 --> 01:45:43,560
Mireille, do you have those recordings
of Van Koppen?

1199
01:45:45,364 --> 01:45:48,040
- What is this?
- Maurice's weblog.

1200
01:45:48,755 --> 01:45:53,680
""Murder weapon in Deventer murder case
may be under the widow's tombstone.""

1201
01:45:53,800 --> 01:45:58,400
""A metal object has been found that
strongly resembles a knife.""

1202
01:45:58,520 --> 01:46:01,600
""I call on the judiciary to
open the grave.""

1203
01:46:01,902 --> 01:46:05,800
- How does he get this?
- From the manager of the cemetery.

1204
01:46:05,920 --> 01:46:08,160
And he comes with this after
seven years?

1205
01:46:08,280 --> 01:46:11,160
He says the police didn't write
everything down at the time.

1206
01:46:11,280 --> 01:46:12,840
Bas, it's Vlug.

1207
01:46:14,920 --> 01:46:18,360
- Hello?
- Have you seen Maurice's website yet?

1208
01:46:18,740 --> 01:46:22,440
- Yes, I just saw it.
- When do you think you can broadcast?

1209
01:46:23,560 --> 01:46:26,760
- Next Tuesday.
- Only then?

1210
01:46:26,880 --> 01:46:27,888
Yes.

1211
01:46:28,263 --> 01:46:30,080
Then De Hond
can shoot for a week.

1212
01:46:30,200 --> 01:46:31,355
Yes.

1213
01:46:31,405 --> 01:46:34,080
This evening, Plasman is sitting
at 'Pauw & Witteman'.

1214
01:46:34,200 --> 01:46:37,128
How do I explain this
to Michael and Meike?

1215
01:46:37,380 --> 01:46:40,080
Yes, I know, but
it can't be sooner.

1216
01:46:40,200 --> 01:46:44,240
<i>Why didn't the cemetery manager
raise alarm sooner?</i>

1217
01:46:44,590 --> 01:46:49,680
<i>Eh, he did, he says. He was then
questioned by the police at the time.</i>

1218
01:46:50,064 --> 01:46:56,049
<i>Eh, there is also a mutation to
be found in the journal of the research.</i>

1219
01:46:56,960 --> 01:47:02,760
<i>Only he says: What I said then does not
correspond to what it says now.</i>

1220
01:47:02,880 --> 01:47:04,926
<i>He had given very
specific information.</i>

1221
01:47:05,059 --> 01:47:06,080
<i>What then?</i>

1222
01:47:06,200 --> 01:47:10,840
<i>That he spoke to the widow
on the morning of the murder.</i>

1223
01:47:10,960 --> 01:47:14,228
<i>And that she said, I'm going
to tell the handyman today...</i>

1224
01:47:14,278 --> 01:47:16,160
<i>that he is going out of my will.</i>

1225
01:47:16,381 --> 01:47:18,840
She couldn't do that at all, asshole.

1226
01:47:21,760 --> 01:47:25,880
<i>Maurice de Hond has put
together a German team.</i>

1227
01:47:26,000 --> 01:47:31,879
<i>They specialize in detecting
metal objects underground.</i>

1228
01:47:33,600 --> 01:47:34,600
With Bas.

1229
01:47:35,545 --> 01:47:36,360
Yes.

1230
01:47:37,800 --> 01:47:39,235
Yes I know.

1231
01:47:39,620 --> 01:47:41,055
I've seen it.

1232
01:47:42,200 --> 01:47:43,975
I'm going as fast as I can.

1233
01:47:44,760 --> 01:47:47,978
If everyone didn't disturb me all day...
Yes.

1234
01:47:48,440 --> 01:47:50,160
Okay. Yes.

1235
01:47:52,033 --> 01:47:54,885
<i>I cannot tell you what kind of
metal, but there is something.</i>

1236
01:47:55,252 --> 01:47:56,800
What now?

1237
01:47:56,920 --> 01:47:58,521
Oh sorry, it's you.

1238
01:47:58,840 --> 01:48:01,960
- The broadcast is moved to Monday.
- What?

1239
01:48:02,440 --> 01:48:05,157
A week later. Yes, sorry,
extra party leader debate...

1240
01:48:05,207 --> 01:48:06,680
and Wilders will also come.

1241
01:48:07,000 --> 01:48:08,788
Damn it Gerda,
you can't do that.

1242
01:48:08,838 --> 01:48:11,080
Do you know
how many times Vlug called?

1243
01:48:11,218 --> 01:48:14,800
Then you say that if we
don't broadcast that debate, RTL will.

1244
01:48:14,920 --> 01:48:18,834
At the same time. And then no one
will watch your report.

1245
01:48:20,010 --> 01:48:21,210
Sorry, Bas.

1246
01:48:26,160 --> 01:48:28,714
I thought you could use a shot.

1247
01:48:29,247 --> 01:48:30,287
Thank you.

1248
01:48:40,431 --> 01:48:43,120
<i>Is the grave now guarded?</i>

1249
01:48:43,240 --> 01:48:46,080
<i>- Of course.
- By who?</i>

1250
01:48:46,200 --> 01:48:49,520
<i>- By people.
- Yes, but is that police?</i>

1251
01:48:49,800 --> 01:48:52,800
<i>So not police,
it could be police now.</i>

1252
01:48:52,940 --> 01:48:55,600
Where does he pay it all from?

1253
01:48:55,720 --> 01:48:56,773
What do you mean?

1254
01:48:57,457 --> 01:48:59,840
How much do you think
such a Plasman costs?

1255
01:49:01,240 --> 01:49:04,880
- He's just there for the publicity.
- Even still.

1256
01:49:05,000 --> 01:49:10,880
Private detectives, a team of German
tomb investigators, 24/7 surveillance..

1257
01:49:15,900 --> 01:49:20,040
- I don't think that Gerda...
- Ah, Gerda. Just a few phone calls.

1258
01:49:21,360 --> 01:49:23,920
- Follow the money.
- Yes, indeed.

1259
01:49:33,960 --> 01:49:38,040
<i>It's 10 past 1. Good afternoon
and welcome to Stand.nl.</i>

1260
01:49:38,160 --> 01:49:43,800
<i>Our position: Maurice de Hond must
stop insinuating. Call 0800-1101.</i>

1261
01:49:43,920 --> 01:49:47,800
<i>- Good afternoon, this is Truus.
- Hello, Truus.</i>

1262
01:49:48,320 --> 01:49:54,200
<i>- I absolutely disagree. That
gentleman is absolutely innocent.</i>

1263
01:49:54,320 --> 01:49:58,693
<i>As he reacted on
TV to the statement...</i>

1264
01:49:58,743 --> 01:50:02,800
<i>Well, go on. Maurice de Hond, go on.</i>

1265
01:50:02,920 --> 01:50:04,960
<i>Thank you. Good afternoon.</i>

1266
01:50:05,509 --> 01:50:11,400
<i>Michael de J., that handyman,
is obviously not right in his head.</i>

1267
01:50:11,880 --> 01:50:15,960
<i>And the Deventer police force is
blackmailable as I'm concerned.</i>

1268
01:50:16,080 --> 01:50:19,040
<i>That handyman is completely stuck.
What do you think of that?</i>

1269
01:50:19,160 --> 01:50:22,908
<i>Let's stay away
from that lawsuit.</i>

1270
01:50:22,958 --> 01:50:26,200
<i>He's accusing an unconvicted.</i>

1271
01:50:26,320 --> 01:50:30,400
<i>Lady Justice has long since lost her
blindfold a long time ago.</i>

1272
01:50:30,520 --> 01:50:32,720
<i>He knows what he is doing.</i>

1273
01:50:33,240 --> 01:50:38,160
<i>6 a clock. The NOS Radio 1 Journal with
Karin van den Boogaert.</i>

1274
01:50:38,280 --> 01:50:42,280
<i>Because of growing social unrest,
the judge has decided...</i>

1275
01:50:42,400 --> 01:50:45,760
<i>to open the grave of the
widow Wittenberg.</i>

1276
01:50:47,520 --> 01:50:51,720
Unbelievable, what a circus!

1277
01:50:51,840 --> 01:50:53,960
<i>At 3:00 PM the grave has been lifted.</i>

1278
01:50:54,080 --> 01:50:57,720
<i>The stone is from the tomb and
is being examined for traces.</i>

1279
01:50:57,840 --> 01:51:03,400
<i>And much more importantly:
the knife can finally be searched for.</i>

1280
01:51:03,840 --> 01:51:08,240
<i>Each layer of sand is sieved.
Not an inch is looked over.</i>

1281
01:51:08,360 --> 01:51:14,164
<i>You always leave behind DNA...</i>

1282
01:51:15,440 --> 01:51:20,440
It was just announced that no knife
was found in the grave.

1283
01:51:20,560 --> 01:51:22,995
<i>The grave was opened
after Maurice de Hond...</i>

1284
01:51:23,045 --> 01:51:25,480
<i>suggested the murder
weapon might lay in the grave.</i>

1285
01:51:32,303 --> 01:51:34,520
I'm so glad we're airing on Monday.

1286
01:52:03,400 --> 01:52:07,280
- I made some more phone calls.
- What?

1287
01:52:07,586 --> 01:52:10,080
Don't you remember:
who pays for all this?

1288
01:52:23,040 --> 01:52:24,160
Holy fuck.

1289
01:52:25,880 --> 01:52:29,840
- Who is De Lange?
- What is De Lange is a better question.

1290
01:52:29,960 --> 01:52:31,040
OK, what?

1291
01:52:31,160 --> 01:52:36,000
He's rich. It's an entrepreneur
with parking garages, call centers...

1292
01:52:36,120 --> 01:52:38,884
And what does he have
to do with Maurice De Hond?

1293
01:52:38,934 --> 01:52:40,531
It's in this contract.

1294
01:52:42,279 --> 01:52:46,600
'...that the collaboration aside
from the Deventer murder case...

1295
01:52:46,720 --> 01:52:50,720
will consist of the establishment of a
socio-political organization...

1296
01:52:50,840 --> 01:52:54,440
with the provisional name Wij 21.'

1297
01:52:56,736 --> 01:53:00,240
So Deventer as the starting shot
of a political movement?

1298
01:53:00,360 --> 01:53:05,040
It says 'Maurice de Hond will take on
the role of eye-catcher.'

1299
01:53:05,160 --> 01:53:07,040
Handy, then he can poll himself.

1300
01:53:08,520 --> 01:53:10,040
This is really sick.

1301
01:53:10,900 --> 01:53:14,320
And then point three:
De Lange also wants his money back.

1302
01:53:14,440 --> 01:53:18,360
Maurice must then conduct a damage
procedure against the OM or the state.

1303
01:53:18,800 --> 01:53:23,640
In other words: Maurice has to litigate
all the way. No choice.

1304
01:53:23,936 --> 01:53:25,480
This should be on the air.

1305
01:53:26,011 --> 01:53:27,560
Do we have this exclusive?

1306
01:53:27,829 --> 01:53:30,520
Joep Dohmen beat me.
It is in the NRC this afternoon.

1307
01:53:30,640 --> 01:53:33,917
- Will you manage before tonight?
- No, impossible.

1308
01:53:35,220 --> 01:53:36,520
Okay, then Thursday.

1309
01:53:36,837 --> 01:53:38,480
That broadcast is almost done.

1310
01:53:38,600 --> 01:53:42,206
Then I'll ask Ellen to start
and we turn it around

1311
01:53:44,316 --> 01:53:48,543
No, sorry, no more delay.
I can't do that, not again.

1312
01:53:57,160 --> 01:53:58,960
Yes that's OK. Yes.

1313
01:54:06,080 --> 01:54:07,360
Get out, Haan.

1314
01:54:07,480 --> 01:54:09,840
- Good luck, huh.
- Come on, let's start.

1315
01:54:12,120 --> 01:54:15,840
Live in five, four, three...

1316
01:54:18,600 --> 01:54:22,880
Exculpatory DNA evidence in the
Deventer murder case. This is Network.

1317
01:54:23,000 --> 01:54:26,400
Oh, Meike, it's starting.

1318
01:54:41,480 --> 01:54:44,160
<i>Hello, ladies and gentlemen.
Good evening.</i>

1319
01:54:44,280 --> 01:54:47,680
<i>New facts in the controversial
Deventer murder case.</i>

1320
01:54:47,908 --> 01:54:53,000
<i>A case that has grown into a battle
with supporters and opponents.</i>

1321
01:54:53,640 --> 01:54:58,160
<i>One is convinced that Ernest Louwes
has been rightly convicted.</i>

1322
01:54:58,280 --> 01:55:03,338
<i>The other thinks the murdered widow's
handyman must have done it.</i>

1323
01:55:03,920 --> 01:55:06,280
<i>What is the truth in this murder case?</i>

1324
01:55:06,605 --> 01:55:11,320
<i>Reporter Bas Haan investigated the case
and uncovered new facts...</i>

1325
01:55:11,440 --> 01:55:16,600
<i>about exculpatory DNA evidence
and a possible motive.</i>

1326
01:55:16,720 --> 01:55:20,120
<i>Seven years ago, the widow was murdered.</i>

1327
01:55:20,240 --> 01:55:23,800
<i>The Deventer murder case is now one
of the most sensational...</i>

1328
01:55:23,920 --> 01:55:26,760
<i>criminal cases, thanks to the
actions of Maurice de Hond.</i>

1329
01:55:26,880 --> 01:55:29,720
<i>Last week the widow's grave
was opened...</i>

1330
01:55:29,840 --> 01:55:33,520
<i>in search of the handyman's
murder weapon.</i>

1331
01:55:33,640 --> 01:55:38,720
<i>In vain. The handyman's lawyer is now
demanding a gag order against De Hond.</i>

1332
01:55:38,840 --> 01:55:44,087
<i>Just try defend yourself against
De Hond and such press offensive.</i>

1333
01:55:44,138 --> 01:55:45,320
<i>That's almost impossible.</i>

1334
01:55:45,422 --> 01:55:46,927
<i>I've done everything...</i>

1335
01:55:47,006 --> 01:55:51,878
<i>to update the Dutch
people via my website.</i>

1336
01:55:52,560 --> 01:55:55,919
<i>De Hond is convinced that the
DNA evidence is worthless.</i>

1337
01:55:56,160 --> 01:56:00,520
<i>But this story is not about
conspiracy theories, but about facts.</i>

1338
01:56:00,640 --> 01:56:06,120
<i>The DNA in this case is crucial.
And now comes another revelation.</i>

1339
01:56:06,240 --> 01:56:10,200
<i>Additional DNA testing
relieves the handyman.</i>

1340
01:56:10,320 --> 01:56:16,200
<i>It is absolutely impossible that the
handyman left the DNA on the nails.</i>

1341
01:56:16,320 --> 01:56:19,320
<i>This is rock solid technical proof...</i>

1342
01:56:19,920 --> 01:56:24,182
<i>that Michael de Jong cannot be
linked to the murder in any way.</i>

1343
01:56:58,735 --> 01:57:00,440
Well.

1344
01:57:00,840 --> 01:57:02,017
Yes.

1345
01:57:02,640 --> 01:57:03,708
Basje.

1346
01:57:04,120 --> 01:57:05,120
Gerda.

1347
01:57:06,506 --> 01:57:08,400
- Well done.
- Thank you.

1348
01:57:08,748 --> 01:57:11,120
- Hey, hoppakee.
- Nice man.

1349
01:57:11,454 --> 01:57:13,480
- Top.
- Thanks to you, huh.

1350
01:57:13,600 --> 01:57:16,640
- Let's go have a drink somewhere.
- Good plan.

1351
01:57:16,760 --> 01:57:19,240
Well done.

1352
01:57:24,320 --> 01:57:25,320
Come on.

1353
01:57:32,000 --> 01:57:33,520
Good? -Ja.

1354
01:57:33,640 --> 01:57:34,640
All right.

1355
01:57:49,600 --> 01:57:52,280
Sorry, are you perhaps Bas Haan?

1356
01:57:52,400 --> 01:57:53,560
Certainly.

1357
01:57:53,680 --> 01:57:57,080
Do you have
Richard Eikelenboom's number?

1358
01:57:58,842 --> 01:58:00,360
What do you need that for?

1359
01:58:01,122 --> 01:58:05,160
'Reporter' is going to make an hour and
a half special about the Deventer case.

1360
01:58:05,720 --> 01:58:07,040
Is there any news then?

1361
01:58:07,244 --> 01:58:13,080
An American DNA expert declares that
the evidence against Louwes is nothing.

1362
01:58:16,216 --> 01:58:19,250
So what does the expert say
about the combination...

1363
01:58:19,300 --> 01:58:22,080
of saliva, touch marks,
blood and nail dirt?

1364
01:58:22,880 --> 01:58:24,120
Which nail dirt?

1365
01:58:24,240 --> 01:58:26,113
Have you seen my report?

1366
01:58:26,654 --> 01:58:29,080
Or are you going to
say: Which report?

1367
01:58:33,361 --> 01:58:35,040
Do you still have
that number for me?

1368
01:58:35,679 --> 01:58:37,094
What do you think?

1369
01:58:42,800 --> 01:58:45,240
Better look at my report first, fool!

1370
01:58:46,600 --> 01:58:50,640
<i>Thank God it's Friday.</i>

1371
01:58:50,908 --> 01:58:53,914
<i>Tonight, Yolanthe Cabau van Kasbergen..</i>

1372
01:58:53,964 --> 01:58:56,861
<i>Arthur Japin, Javier Guzman...</i>

1373
01:58:57,119 --> 01:59:00,603
<i>Bastiaan Geleijnse,
Don Diego Powder...</i>

1374
01:59:00,653 --> 01:59:03,119
<i>Pieter Jan Hagens,
Maurice de Hond...</i>

1375
01:59:03,240 --> 01:59:05,640
<i>and Claudia de Breij.</i>

1376
01:59:06,640 --> 01:59:09,752
They didn't take anything away
from my broadcast.

1377
01:59:10,837 --> 01:59:12,799
They didn't even see it.

1378
01:59:15,448 --> 01:59:18,000
Like it never fucking aired.

1379
01:59:30,160 --> 01:59:33,471
<i>- Here is Maurice the Hond.</i>
- What the fuck.

1380
01:59:54,920 --> 01:59:57,960
<i>Maurice, yesterday sentenced to
two months conditional</i>

1381
01:59:58,080 --> 02:00:03,480
<i>Does his mean you can never say
again: the handyman did it?</i>

1382
02:00:03,600 --> 02:00:09,560
<i>If I don't comply with the ruling,
I will be jailed for two months.</i>

1383
02:00:09,680 --> 02:00:13,840
<i>Are you never going to say again:
Michael de Jong did it?</i>

1384
02:00:13,960 --> 02:00:17,640
<i>I am prepared to do a lot for
this program...</i>

1385
02:00:17,760 --> 02:00:20,485
<i>but not prison for two months.</i>

1386
02:00:20,535 --> 02:00:23,463
<i>No, but I was
wondering because you...</i>

1387
02:00:23,920 --> 02:00:29,280
<i>I admire your fanaticism in this case.
And your sense of justice.</i>

1388
02:00:29,400 --> 02:00:33,880
<i>If you can't say it, can you sing it?</i>

1389
02:00:34,000 --> 02:00:37,240
<i>- I think only Jan Smit.
- Only Jan Smit.</i>

1390
02:00:37,360 --> 02:00:41,360
<i>Because I was thinking about…</i>

1391
02:00:41,480 --> 02:00:42,480
<i>about...</i>

1392
02:00:43,920 --> 02:00:47,920
<i>thinking about 'the Deventer
murder case: the musical'.</i>

1393
02:02:03,760 --> 02:02:05,288
Fucking circus.

1394
02:02:06,446 --> 02:02:10,840
If more than 200,000 people have
watched that crap, I'll write a book.

1395
02:02:10,960 --> 02:02:12,360
- A book?
- A book.

1396
02:02:12,980 --> 02:02:16,760
No broadcast schedule, budget,
so few minutes to cram it all into.

1397
02:02:16,880 --> 02:02:20,800
Just a book. With all the facts about
the case. All the facts.

1398
02:02:20,920 --> 02:02:22,740
Do you think people
are waiting for that?

1399
02:02:22,790 --> 02:02:25,440
Yes, people want to know
what's really going on.

1400
02:02:25,560 --> 02:02:27,237
I firmly believe that.

1401
02:02:27,819 --> 02:02:32,360
But it is made them incredibly difficult
by people who throw sand in their eyes.

1402
02:02:32,480 --> 02:02:36,880
I want to be able to say: Do you want
the facts? There they are, in that book.

1403
02:02:37,000 --> 02:02:42,160
Researched, checked and checked again.
And if you want to ignore them...

1404
02:02:42,280 --> 02:02:44,995
they are still there.
Those facts exist...

1405
02:02:45,045 --> 02:02:47,360
are real, and are not going away.

1406
02:02:48,540 --> 02:02:49,569
What?

1407
02:02:49,620 --> 02:02:52,960
Do you know how many books are
published per year?

1408
02:02:53,080 --> 02:02:56,440
I'll make sure people know it's there.

1409
02:02:56,560 --> 02:02:58,473
If necessary, I will
enter the circus myself.

1410
02:02:59,035 --> 02:03:00,400
The circus?

1411
02:03:00,486 --> 02:03:02,698
January 2009

1412
02:03:35,680 --> 02:03:39,160
It is one of the most talked
about lawsuits of all time.

1413
02:03:39,280 --> 02:03:42,200
Who killed the wealthy widow
Wittenberg in 1999?

1414
02:03:42,320 --> 02:03:47,040
Ernest Louwes was convicted, acquitted
and then through DNA testing...

1415
02:03:47,160 --> 02:03:50,960
sentenced to 12 years.
29 judges were involved in the case.

1416
02:03:51,079 --> 02:03:53,524
But in the press, a campaign
led by Maurice de Hond

1417
02:03:53,574 --> 02:03:55,199
questioned
the course of justice.

1418
02:03:55,320 --> 02:03:57,400
The grave has even been opened.

1419
02:03:57,457 --> 02:04:00,691
Journalist Bas Haan wrote <i>'De Deventer
murder case: the conspiracy unraveled'</i>

1420
02:04:00,793 --> 02:04:01,817
Welcome

1421
02:04:01,920 --> 02:04:04,240
You have been on this case
for a long time.

1422
02:04:04,302 --> 02:04:08,184
Tonight I will ask you the question you
surely get asked all the time:

1423
02:04:08,917 --> 02:04:12,080
Who did it?
The handyman, or Ernest Louwes?

1424
02:04:15,357 --> 02:04:18,243
Maurice de Hond
was sentenced for libel,

1425
02:04:18,293 --> 02:04:21,639
and ordered to pay
35.000 Euro in compensation

1426
02:04:21,689 --> 02:04:24,962
to Michael de Jong
and his girlfriend Meike.

1427
02:04:25,048 --> 02:04:30,271
A, for Dutch standards,
exceptionally high figure.

1428
02:04:30,321 --> 02:04:36,196
He never retracted any of
his accusations against Michael de Jong.

1429
02:04:36,782 --> 02:04:39,383
Michael de Jong could
never find a job again.

1430
02:04:39,433 --> 02:04:41,496
Michael has an autoimmune disease.

1431
02:04:41,547 --> 02:04:45,731
Medical research has shown that
the chance of getting this disease

1432
02:04:45,781 --> 02:04:48,434
is greatly increased
by chronical stress.

1433
02:04:48,547 --> 02:04:54,120
The financial compensation of 35.000
Euro was entirely spend on legal costs.

1434
02:04:54,785 --> 02:04:59,213
Ernest Louwes served his sentence and
is currently an employed citizen again.

1435
02:04:59,263 --> 02:05:03,342
He still fights for his acquittal
through his lawyer Knoops.

1436
02:05:03,397 --> 02:05:10,626
In 2014 the Supreme court started researching
a possible re-opening of the case.

1437
02:05:10,889 --> 02:05:13,013
In consultation with Knoops,

1438
02:05:13,063 --> 02:05:17,708
an English DNA expert
has been appointed for a third opinion"".

1439
02:05:17,758 --> 02:05:19,553
In 2019, the expert also confirmed

1440
02:05:19,603 --> 02:05:23,112
the most important conclusions
of the NFI about the DNA evidence,

1441
02:05:23,162 --> 02:05:25,289
the basis for
the conviction of Louwes.

1442
02:05:25,844 --> 02:05:31,063
Bas Haan is currently
a research journalist for Nieuwsuur.

1443
02:05:31,118 --> 02:05:34,143
His reporting
has received numerous awards

1444
02:05:34,193 --> 02:05:39,978
Among them ""De Tegel"" three times, the
most important Dutch journalistic prize.

1445
02:05:40,028 --> 02:05:43,738
In 2015 he was chosen
as journalist of the year.

1446
02:05:44,238 --> 02:05:48,463
Nothing has been heard anymore
from the political movement ""Wij 21"",

1447
02:05:48,513 --> 02:05:51,113
which was founded by
de Hond en de Lange.

00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:12,590
Should I start?

2
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:19,632
How long have we been here?

3
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:21,559
I've been here since last night.

4
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:27,911
I'd have shaved in the morning.

5
00:00:29,720 --> 00:00:31,154
So five or six days at least.

6
00:00:31,360 --> 00:00:32,760
Maybe even a week.

7
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:37,397
I've been here for a week?

8
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:39,194
Tell me the story.

9
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:44,073
Jahangiri, I'm talking to you.

10
00:00:44,560 --> 00:00:46,870
I've been unconscious for a week?

11
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:49,552
What did you drug us with?

12
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:52,314
Start at the beginning.

13
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:54,079
I'll tell you the rest,

14
00:00:54,280 --> 00:00:56,272
from the moment you passed out.

15
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:03,272
You know the beginning.

16
00:01:04,840 --> 00:01:05,876
It started with you.

17
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:08,394
I know the whole story.

18
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:10,751
But it has to be recorded.

19
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:16,199
On Sunday morning,

20
00:01:18,440 --> 00:01:20,955
January 23, 1965,

21
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:24,550
Major...

22
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:33,755
Saeed Jahangiri ordered me to come here

23
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:36,393
to the island of Qeshm.

24
00:01:41,960 --> 00:01:44,350
- Are we still on Qeshm?
- Yes.

25
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:55,199
An exiled prisoner had hanged himself.

26
00:01:58,280 --> 00:01:59,509
Mustafa Samei.

27
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:03,831
I knew it was common

28
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:06,077
for exiles to commit suicide.

29
00:02:07,720 --> 00:02:10,519
But Mustafa Samei was different.

30
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:15,352
He only had two months left.

31
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:19,075
Only 62 days to freedom.

32
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:24,270
One day before, the Prime Minister

33
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:26,517
was killed in front of the parliament.

34
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:30,552
The case seemed suspicious.

35
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:34,392
Major Jahangiri ordered me

36
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:35,755
to come to Qeshm,

37
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:41,597
to examine the body

38
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:42,800
and to bury it.

39
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:49,836
What ensued did not accord

40
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:51,474
with those orders.

41
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:36,149
- Mr. Charaki?
- Hello Major.

42
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:37,960
- I'm Babak Hafizi.
- Pleased to meet you.

43
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:39,120
You too.

44
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:40,435
I owned a Chevrolet Impala

45
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:43,314
in Tehran when I was young, a beige one.

46
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:45,080
But yours looks better.

47
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:46,873
Thanks. Get in.

48
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:48,309
I've brought a worker

49
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:50,039
to help with the burial.

50
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:52,918
- Straight ahead?
- Straight ahead.

51
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:58,552
He asked to be moved from the village.

52
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:01,956
That was a while ago, almost three years.

53
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:05,119
They re-examined his file in Tehran

54
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:06,879
and did as he requested.

55
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:09,357
On Saturdays he'd come to the station,

56
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:11,392
sign in and return to the cemetery.

57
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:12,829
On foot.

58
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:15,557
It's 3.5 hours by foot.

59
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:17,594
You won't believe me,

60
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:18,916
but he was mad.

61
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:22,230
- Did he have visitors?
- Never.

62
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:24,719
No one at all.

63
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:26,549
He was alone.

64
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:28,672
Did anyone contact him from Tehran?

65
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,719
His mother.

66
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:32,149
She sent him books

67
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:34,359
and journals.

68
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:36,711
One time she sent a plastic bag

69
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:39,276
with small black seeds.

70
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:40,960
It was suspicious.

71
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:43,037
I threw them out the window.

72
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:44,799
A bunch of basil sprouted.

73
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:47,520
What about the village?

74
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:48,720
Did he socialize?

75
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:52,478
- With whom?
- The grocer, for instance.

76
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Or anyone.

77
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:55,833
No one mixes with the exiles here.

78
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:57,390
It's asking for trouble.

79
00:04:57,560 --> 00:04:58,560
So all these years

80
00:04:58,640 --> 00:05:00,836
he spoke to no one?

81
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:03,510
He'd talk to me. Gibberish.

82
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:05,480
I'm telling you,

83
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:07,552
he wanted to live on the cemetery.

84
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:10,394
He was insane.

85
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:13,314
He's better off dead.

86
00:06:21,640 --> 00:06:22,640
Hello.

87
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:26,480
Get him down.

88
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:30,994
Place him on this table.

89
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:49,720
Cut the rope.

90
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:54,239
Here we go...

91
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:10,636
Let us begin.

92
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:14,834
- Burial...
- We can't bury him here.

93
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:17,236
The village cemetery isn't far from here.

94
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:19,272
What difference does it make?

95
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:21,079
There's a thousand stories involved.

96
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:22,794
No one buries their dead here now.

97
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:25,158
I'll take care of the body myself.

98
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:26,510
I won't trouble you.

99
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:28,120
I have to bury him

100
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:29,640
and file my report.

101
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
I've travelled far.

102
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:32,435
Just bury him.

103
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:34,359
It'll be dark soon. It's a sin

104
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:36,279
to bury the dead after sunset.

105
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:38,756
This man was a Marxist-Leninist.

106
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:41,194
Just bury him.

107
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:51,355
I knew at once

108
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:53,040
that the suicide was a cover up.

109
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:55,993
He'd been murdered.

110
00:07:57,520 --> 00:08:00,115
They'd strangled him with a rope,

111
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,957
and then hanged him.

112
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:10,194
Should I elaborate?

113
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:11,836
Yes.

114
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:15,672
The bruise on his neck was horizontal.

115
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:20,230
It ran from below the throat

116
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:21,476
to the back of the neck.

117
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:25,433
If someone's hanged,

118
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:27,874
bruising isn't horizontal.

119
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:30,352
It runs from the larynx

120
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:31,994
up to the ears.

121
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:36,354
I know that, you know that...

122
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:38,600
Lieutenant Charaki

123
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:40,114
would have known it, too.

124
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:43,356
Only, why didn't he report it?

125
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:48,116
He said he'd touched nothing.

126
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:49,470
But you could tell that

127
00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:50,790
without investigating.

128
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:56,834
There was nonsense

129
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:59,271
written all over the walls,

130
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:02,032
lines from a story,

131
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:04,269
daily events,

132
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:08,310
he'd used the walls as a diary.

133
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:12,720
Let's go.

134
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:14,196
I said a prayer for him.

135
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:16,156
I'll stay the night

136
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:17,390
and take the first boat.

137
00:09:18,280 --> 00:09:19,919
- You can't stay here.
- Why not?

138
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:23,760
- It's a cemetery.
- It's very pleasant.

139
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:26,192
You go ahead. It'll be dark.

140
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:29,440
- Aren't you afraid all alone?
- No.

141
00:09:30,280 --> 00:09:34,559
- Write and file your report.
- Okay.

142
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:37,596
Mr. Charaki, what is this?

143
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:39,757
The photo, the geomancy and astrolabe?

144
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:41,917
The cemetery keeper used to live here.

145
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:43,554
It all belongs to him,

146
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:45,274
and the photo is of his daughter.

147
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:47,199
He killed his daughter.

148
00:09:47,560 --> 00:09:50,075
It's said her ghost haunts the place.

149
00:09:50,280 --> 00:09:52,556
A load of nonsense...

150
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:55,639
That's what I meant by a thousand stories.

151
00:09:56,840 --> 00:09:57,840
Goodbye.

152
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:00,920
Goodbye.

153
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,000
Sahib,

154
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:18,040
don't stay here.

155
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:20,074
Don't stay.

156
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:22,877
You'll be swallowed by the earth.

157
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:25,390
When a corpse goes into the ground,

158
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:27,637
the earth opens its mouth.

159
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:29,435
There'll be an earthquake.

160
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:31,279
This place is haunted.

161
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:33,677
Ghosts have no business with me.

162
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:36,674
Leave this place.

163
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:38,959
What did the worker say?

164
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:40,952
""... the earth opens its mouth

165
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:42,160
and there's a quake.""

166
00:10:42,520 --> 00:10:43,520
You stayed

167
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:45,273
to see the earth open its mouth.

168
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:47,200
I stayed to read

169
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:48,874
what he'd written on the walls.

170
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,435
There was a book on the table:

171
00:10:53,080 --> 00:10:54,400
""Paradise"".

172
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:57,636
He'd copied parts of it on the walls.

173
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:00,395
It was getting dark.

174
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:02,159
I stayed to read the book.

175
00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:29,750
<i>Last Wednesday at 11 o'clock...</i>

176
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:42,551
<i>a ghost entered Mr. Mavedat's body.</i>

177
00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:46,714
<i>It's easy to imagine</i>

178
00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:49,480
<i>Mr. Mavedat's shock at this event,</i>

179
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,798
<i>given the fact</i>

180
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,354
<i>that his face always</i>

181
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:59,635
<i>looks happy and surprised.</i>

182
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:06,109
<i>On that pleasant, moonlit evening,</i>

183
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:09,398
<i>Mr. Mavedat and three of his friends</i>

184
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:13,591
<i>had spread out a feast in the garden.</i>

185
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,275
<i>It was full moon,</i>

186
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:21,269
<i>a poetic light was cast over everything,</i>

187
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:24,560
<i>which threw mysterious shadows</i>

188
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:27,235
<i>and glistening sparkles on the river,</i>

189
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:31,716
<i>as if eternity were being created.</i>

190
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:46,273
A DRAGON ARRIVES!

191
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:50,994
A film by Mani Haghighi

192
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:54,113
Based on a true story

193
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:14,518
A pipe burst in my grandmother's house.

194
00:13:14,840 --> 00:13:17,116
The story begins before that,

195
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:19,471
but to me it began when the pipe burst.

196
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:22,798
Winter 2006.

197
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:25,312
A pipe had burst

198
00:13:25,520 --> 00:13:26,840
right over the room

199
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:29,714
where Father's movies were stored.

200
00:13:30,760 --> 00:13:34,151
I was worried about the films.

201
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:38,559
I called Mani, asked him to move them.

202
00:13:38,920 --> 00:13:40,400
I hurried to my grandmother's.

203
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:43,359
My brother helped me get the films out.

204
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:45,919
Ebrahim Golestan's films

205
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:47,156
were all in that room,

206
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:49,232
his industrial films, documentaries,

207
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:50,590
unfinished films,

208
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:51,800
and all the copies

209
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,480
of ""The Brick and The Mirror"".

210
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:57,435
I found a box there

211
00:13:57,640 --> 00:13:59,154
at the back of a closet.

212
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:01,556
A metal box about this big.

213
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:03,837
It was locked and there was no key.

214
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:05,756
Mani asked for the key.

215
00:14:05,960 --> 00:14:07,713
I'd never seen the box before.

216
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:11,391
I told him to break the lock

217
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:13,193
to see what was inside.

218
00:14:14,040 --> 00:14:16,600
There were a couple of tapes,

219
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:19,110
and some notebooks with German writing,

220
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:21,471
a piece of bone that we later

221
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:24,189
found out was a jackal's jawbone.

222
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:26,517
Some brass plates

223
00:14:26,680 --> 00:14:29,832
with prayers etched on them.

224
00:14:30,040 --> 00:14:32,714
A weekly literary journal

225
00:14:32,920 --> 00:14:36,231
with Bahram Sadeghi's ""Paradise"".

226
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:38,159
And a few pictures

227
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:41,319
of three young men with a baby.

228
00:14:41,960 --> 00:14:43,872
Why were these things in our house?

229
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:46,276
I recognized one of the men.

230
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:48,756
It was Keyvan Haddad with a beard.

231
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:51,912
He was the assistant sound engineer

232
00:14:52,120 --> 00:14:53,600
on ""The Brick and The Mirror"".

233
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:56,713
He had suddenly disappeared.

234
00:14:56,920 --> 00:14:57,990
The secret police had

235
00:14:58,160 --> 00:14:59,435
allegedly arrested him.

236
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:02,593
I knew someone at the State Archives.

237
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:05,395
All we had was a picture and a name.

238
00:15:05,560 --> 00:15:07,597
They sent us to the Prison Archives

239
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:09,877
of the Anti-terror Committee,

240
00:15:10,120 --> 00:15:12,157
where we finally found some clues.

241
00:15:12,760 --> 00:15:15,514
We found the most important clue

242
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:18,599
at the Anti-terror Prison Archives.

243
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:21,558
The arrest files of the three men

244
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:24,229
on the island of Qeshm in 1964,

245
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:27,478
the year Keyvan Haddad disappeared.

246
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:30,514
There we found the interrogation tapes

247
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:33,872
of the three men on the island.

248
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:35,080
It was clear

249
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:36,993
that this film had to be made.

250
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:38,873
The story

251
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:42,313
of my grandfather's sound engineer,

252
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:44,711
who'd disappeared while shooting

253
00:15:44,920 --> 00:15:47,754
""The Brick and The Mirror"".

254
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:17,520
This is all okay.

255
00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:18,949
Back up to ""This child

256
00:16:19,160 --> 00:16:21,197
is a piece of someone's heart.""

257
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:27,430
<i>She got in the cab. I didn't see the baby.</i>

258
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:28,600
<i>She paid and got out.</i>

259
00:16:28,760 --> 00:16:30,240
<i>Then I heard the baby crying.</i>

260
00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:32,079
<i>I got out and called after her,</i>

261
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:33,720
<i>but she was gone.</i>

262
00:16:34,640 --> 00:16:35,790
Jalal?

263
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:38,350
Mr. Moghaddam?

264
00:16:40,920 --> 00:16:42,559
Where did he go again?

265
00:16:42,760 --> 00:16:44,752
<i>He'll be right back. Here he is.</i>

266
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:46,195
<i>Sorry, I'm back again.</i>

267
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:47,629
Where you say, ""This child

268
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:49,160
is a piece of someone's heart.""

269
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:50,640
<i>The line sounded good.</i>

270
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:53,759
<i>- Not on my recording.
- Play it back.</i>

271
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:03,636
It's very interesting.

272
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:06,553
The poor woman...

273
00:17:07,120 --> 00:17:08,349
The poor woman...

274
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:12,396
How awful she must feel right now.

275
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:17,389
This child is a piece of her heart.

276
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,640
- Long time no see!
- I'm here now.

277
00:17:24,840 --> 00:17:27,958
We're honored by your presence!

278
00:17:28,120 --> 00:17:29,270
Does this film never end?

279
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:30,440
It just started.

280
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:31,920
You're even wearing earrings!

281
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:34,311
Is that my necklace? Stop it!

282
00:17:34,560 --> 00:17:35,755
That friend of yours...

283
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:37,314
Are you here to work?

284
00:17:37,680 --> 00:17:39,637
- The geologist.
- He's a civil engineer.

285
00:17:39,920 --> 00:17:40,920
Our honeymoon...

286
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,195
Hafizi is looking for him.

287
00:17:42,360 --> 00:17:43,760
- Who? Behnam?
- Yes.

288
00:17:44,520 --> 00:17:45,954
He's straight.

289
00:17:46,120 --> 00:17:47,554
He's only been back two weeks.

290
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:48,760
Don't worry.

291
00:17:48,920 --> 00:17:50,115
Don't get him involved.

292
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:51,595
We just have a few questions.

293
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,150
Hafizi was away on business.

294
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:54,874
There was an earthquake.

295
00:17:55,040 --> 00:17:56,190
It's mysterious...

296
00:17:56,360 --> 00:17:57,360
The Intelligence Agency

297
00:17:57,480 --> 00:17:58,550
has specific questions?

298
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:00,757
The Agency has nothing to do with it.

299
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:03,236
Hafizi hasn't reported anything yet.

300
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:05,999
He just has a few questions

301
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:07,160
about the quake.

302
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:09,795
Somewhere safe. Your father's print shop.

303
00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:12,115
Please. Do it for my sake.

304
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:15,030
For me.

305
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:16,754
This is something

306
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:20,636
that's tormented me for years.

307
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:24,877
If I hadn't insisted

308
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,913
that he did it for my sake,

309
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:31,589
maybe none of it would've happened.

310
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:33,800
And everyone would now

311
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,150
be somewhere else.

312
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:38,239
Jahangiri was an interesting case.

313
00:18:38,440 --> 00:18:40,272
There aren't many like him.

314
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:44,269
At least none that I know of.

315
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:45,675
To be able to infiltrate

316
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:47,832
the Secret Police Agency so deeply

317
00:18:48,040 --> 00:18:50,999
and to put together

318
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:52,634
his own group of people.

319
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:54,752
Especially with his biography,

320
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:57,077
having been born in northern Iran...

321
00:18:57,280 --> 00:19:01,240
All this made him a fascinating figure.

322
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:02,715
And that name!

323
00:19:02,920 --> 00:19:03,920
Hozvaresh!

324
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:08,199
I still don't know what it means.

325
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:09,400
Back then we thought

326
00:19:09,560 --> 00:19:10,676
it was an abbreviation.

327
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:14,592
Hozvaresh are Aramaic words

328
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:16,234
in Pahlavi script

329
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:18,199
which appear in Middle Persian texts.

330
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:20,712
If you read them in Farsi,

331
00:19:20,920 --> 00:19:22,559
they make no sense.

332
00:19:22,760 --> 00:19:24,717
That is, unless you memorize them.

333
00:19:24,920 --> 00:19:27,435
There are some 1000 Hozvaresh

334
00:19:27,640 --> 00:19:30,200
in Middle Persian texts.

335
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:34,189
""Ruler"", for instance, is ""Malka"",

336
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:37,677
""Man"" is ""Gabra"",

337
00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:40,873
""Night"" is ""Laylay"".

338
00:19:41,080 --> 00:19:44,471
It was a system of writing

339
00:19:44,680 --> 00:19:46,592
that not everyone could learn.

340
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,354
The interesting thing is,

341
00:19:48,560 --> 00:19:51,075
these members of Hozvaresh

342
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:54,591
would pass on secret information

343
00:19:54,840 --> 00:19:55,840
from within,

344
00:19:55,960 --> 00:19:59,032
to all opposition groups, regardless:

345
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:01,311
To the Islamic groups, the Communists,

346
00:20:01,560 --> 00:20:03,916
the Nationalists, everyone.

347
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:05,834
I'm not saying a thing.

348
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:08,875
Hafizi told it to Shahrzad,

349
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:12,319
and she believed him.

350
00:20:12,520 --> 00:20:15,194
- How is Shahrzad?
- She's vigilant.

351
00:20:15,680 --> 00:20:17,592
A secret agent told Shahrzad...

352
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:19,280
- Hafizi's not an agent.
- No?

353
00:20:19,480 --> 00:20:20,550
I already told you.

354
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:24,032
Then an infiltrator told Shahrzad that...

355
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:26,199
Mr. Haddad?

356
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:28,232
- Babak, come on up.
- Hello.

357
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:36,233
- Hello.
- How are you, Keyvan?

358
00:20:36,440 --> 00:20:37,556
Are you well?

359
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:40,916
- My friend Behnam Shokouhi.
- Hello.

360
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:47,829
I'm sorry we have to meet here.

361
00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:49,315
The matter is a bit delicate.

362
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:51,193
He'll have told you that already.

363
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:53,238
Yes, but my question is...

364
00:20:53,480 --> 00:20:54,960
I know. You're right.

365
00:20:55,160 --> 00:20:56,560
It's hard to believe.

366
00:20:56,760 --> 00:20:58,558
This is not about belief.

367
00:20:58,760 --> 00:21:00,717
My question relates to you yourself.

368
00:21:00,920 --> 00:21:03,560
- Behnam is not a problem.
- No...

369
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:05,717
Not in the least.

370
00:21:05,920 --> 00:21:07,673
I am very grateful.

371
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:09,274
I don't have a problem, either.

372
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:11,193
I just have a question for you.

373
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:15,956
What? Am I being too frank?

374
00:21:16,160 --> 00:21:19,278
- Let him speak first.
- Okay.

375
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:22,196
He explained everything.

376
00:21:22,360 --> 00:21:25,114
It was hard to believe at first.

377
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,000
I looked him in the eye

378
00:21:29,160 --> 00:21:31,277
while he told the story.

379
00:21:32,360 --> 00:21:34,795
I said to myself he wasn't lying.

380
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,480
He may be making a mistake,

381
00:21:36,680 --> 00:21:37,909
but he's not lying.

382
00:21:38,120 --> 00:21:39,713
Why didn't you file a report?

383
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:41,196
Why come to me?

384
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:43,750
Otherwise I won't learn what happened.

385
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:46,157
Such are the risks and dangers.

386
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:47,320
I don't want you

387
00:21:47,480 --> 00:21:49,312
to do anything or fix anything.

388
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:51,591
I just want a specialist to see

389
00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:53,871
the things I witnessed there.

390
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:55,594
Two specialists.

391
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:57,354
You can't go without me.

392
00:22:37,240 --> 00:22:40,790
<i>He loved to play with sounds.</i>

393
00:22:41,080 --> 00:22:43,276
<i>He'd say, ""Listen to the rain</i>

394
00:22:43,480 --> 00:22:44,596
<i>if you're feeling hot.</i>

395
00:22:45,160 --> 00:22:47,675
<i>It'll cool you.""</i>

396
00:22:48,160 --> 00:22:50,391
<i>He had a collection of silences</i>

397
00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:52,239
<i>from all around the world.</i>

398
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:54,870
<i>He said: ""Put the tape in</i>

399
00:22:55,240 --> 00:22:57,516
<i>and let it roll,</i>

400
00:22:57,720 --> 00:23:01,270
<i>I'll tell you where the sound is from.""</i>

401
00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:04,518
<i>I played the tape.</i>

402
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:06,552
<i>You couldn't hear a thing.</i>

403
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:08,717
<i>Keyvan listened and told me</i>

404
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:11,349
<i>this was Ali Sadr cave,</i>

405
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:17,157
<i>or the tomb of some mystic writer,</i>

406
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:19,517
<i>or the Chattanooga Restaurant</i>

407
00:23:19,720 --> 00:23:22,633
<i>at 2 in the morning.</i>

408
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:26,152
<i>That's how I fell in love with him.</i>

409
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:08,437
<i>We hadn't been together long</i>

410
00:24:08,800 --> 00:24:10,792
<i>when I had a bad car accident.</i>

411
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:14,238
<i>I was bedridden for a while.</i>

412
00:24:15,040 --> 00:24:18,795
<i>He'd come and record</i>

413
00:24:19,960 --> 00:24:23,158
<i>my breathing as I slept,</i>

414
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:25,750
<i>so as to listen to it back at home.</i>

415
00:24:26,760 --> 00:24:30,037
<i>Wouldn't you fall in love with him?</i>

416
00:25:23,160 --> 00:25:25,629
- What are you doing?
- Research.

417
00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:34,989
<i>The first thing I saw</i>

418
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:36,714
<i>was the writing on the walls.</i>

419
00:25:36,920 --> 00:25:38,752
<i>I couldn't believe it.</i>

420
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:41,555
<i>His handwriting was just like mine.</i>

421
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:44,514
<i>Not just similar. Exactly the same.</i>

422
00:25:45,640 --> 00:25:46,960
<i>As if, for three years,</i>

423
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:49,112
<i>I'd been locked up on this ship.</i>

424
00:25:50,560 --> 00:25:52,279
<i>As if they were my own memoirs</i>

425
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:53,480
<i>on the walls.</i>

426
00:25:53,960 --> 00:25:56,111
<i>As if I'd been asleep for three years</i>

427
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:58,472
<i>and could now read all my dreams here</i>

428
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:00,996
<i>and remember who I really was.</i>

429
00:26:01,920 --> 00:26:03,639
<i>We'd only just arrived,</i>

430
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:06,791
<i>but it was as if I were coming home.</i>

431
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:08,270
What's wrong?

432
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:11,560
I think some things have been moved about.

433
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:12,876
Like what?

434
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:15,193
I was reading a book.

435
00:26:30,520 --> 00:26:31,670
There was an earthquake.

436
00:26:31,880 --> 00:26:33,155
You're kidding.

437
00:26:33,320 --> 00:26:34,640
But there was only cracking

438
00:26:34,800 --> 00:26:35,800
at the cemetery.

439
00:26:35,920 --> 00:26:36,920
What do you mean?

440
00:26:37,160 --> 00:26:38,753
There was a 5 Richter earthquake,

441
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:40,000
but only at the cemetery.

442
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:41,395
The earth a few meters away

443
00:26:41,560 --> 00:26:42,560
is undisturbed.

444
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:43,875
- Is that possible?
- No.

445
00:26:44,680 --> 00:26:46,194
But it happened.

446
00:26:46,520 --> 00:26:48,591
What exactly did the worker say to you?

447
00:26:48,840 --> 00:26:50,399
When a body is buried,

448
00:26:50,600 --> 00:26:52,557
the earth opens its mouth and quakes.

449
00:26:53,160 --> 00:26:54,958
So we need a body now.

450
00:26:55,400 --> 00:26:57,790
He said: ""We need a body""

451
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,469
as if we were talking about a screwdriver.

452
00:27:02,440 --> 00:27:03,760
Simple as that.

453
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:05,832
A corpse, in that hell.

454
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:07,275
As I already said,

455
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:10,311
there was only cracking at the cemetery.

456
00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:14,079
This is impossible in an earthquake.

457
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:17,795
Earthquakes are huge.

458
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:19,400
If there's an earthquake here,

459
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:22,320
the ground is shaken over kilometers

460
00:27:22,520 --> 00:27:24,352
and you can see its traces.

461
00:27:24,560 --> 00:27:26,791
But this one was limited to the cemetery.

462
00:27:28,560 --> 00:27:30,552
I know it sounds strange,

463
00:27:30,760 --> 00:27:33,434
but to figure out what was going on

464
00:27:33,640 --> 00:27:35,871
we needed a body

465
00:27:36,800 --> 00:27:39,360
that we could bury at that cemetery.

466
00:27:39,560 --> 00:27:41,756
He walked around the graves,

467
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:45,076
tasting the earth in different places.

468
00:27:45,680 --> 00:27:47,399
When there's a crack in the earth,

469
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:49,034
it tastes different

470
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:50,953
due to gas coming from the ground.

471
00:27:53,040 --> 00:27:54,269
Then...

472
00:27:58,400 --> 00:27:59,629
he saw that huge ship

473
00:27:59,800 --> 00:28:02,520
and didn't ask why it was there.

474
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:03,960
We later found out

475
00:28:04,120 --> 00:28:05,952
he knew the story of the ship.

476
00:28:06,160 --> 00:28:08,391
Or pretended to know it.

477
00:28:09,080 --> 00:28:10,196
He's a master of deception.

478
00:28:10,760 --> 00:28:12,672
You never know if he's lying or not.

479
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:14,872
Do you know the story?

480
00:28:15,720 --> 00:28:16,949
What story?

481
00:28:17,320 --> 00:28:18,320
Of the ship and

482
00:28:18,400 --> 00:28:20,153
William Baffin's 231 victims.

483
00:28:20,800 --> 00:28:22,473
- Do you know it?
- Yes.

484
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:24,234
Britain's William Baffin

485
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:25,675
discovered Greenland.

486
00:28:25,880 --> 00:28:29,078
In 1622 the East India Company hires him

487
00:28:29,280 --> 00:28:30,475
to come to Iran

488
00:28:30,680 --> 00:28:32,911
and sign a silk trade agreement.

489
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:36,800
William Baffin convinces Shah Abbas

490
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:38,559
to expel the Portuguese

491
00:28:38,760 --> 00:28:40,194
from the Strait of Hormuz.

492
00:28:40,600 --> 00:28:43,160
Shah Abbas is to attack from land,

493
00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:45,920
and the British forces from the sea.

494
00:28:46,120 --> 00:28:48,032
They send William Baffin to Qeshm

495
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:50,675
to scout out the Portuguese forces.

496
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:52,030
They say that with

497
00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:53,759
only five British soldiers,

498
00:28:53,960 --> 00:28:56,236
William Baffin captured a Portuguese ship

499
00:28:56,400 --> 00:28:57,914
with 231 sailors on board.

500
00:28:58,120 --> 00:28:59,759
He forces them

501
00:28:59,960 --> 00:29:02,156
to pull their ship onto dry land,

502
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:06,998
all the way over to this cemetery.

503
00:29:07,640 --> 00:29:10,838
Then he decapitates all 231,

504
00:29:11,720 --> 00:29:13,598
and buries them right behind you.

505
00:29:15,280 --> 00:29:17,397
The next day the Portuguese attack

506
00:29:17,560 --> 00:29:19,438
and kill William Baffin.

507
00:29:19,640 --> 00:29:22,360
One of these graves must be his.

508
00:29:43,680 --> 00:29:46,149
<i>To find a corpse</i>

509
00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:48,551
<i>you need to know people.</i>

510
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:51,396
<i>I knew Charaki.</i>

511
00:29:51,800 --> 00:29:54,235
<i>I went out in search of him.</i>

512
00:29:54,520 --> 00:29:55,920
<i>They said he'd gone</i>

513
00:29:56,120 --> 00:29:57,713
<i>to see an ophthalmologist.</i>

514
00:29:57,880 --> 00:29:59,473
<i>I asked where that was.</i>

515
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:01,160
<i>They gave me an address,</i>

516
00:30:01,560 --> 00:30:04,200
<i>an hour and a half outside the village.</i>

517
00:30:04,440 --> 00:30:07,080
<i>The guy looked like anything but a doctor.</i>

518
00:30:09,480 --> 00:30:11,278
How many people live in the village?

519
00:30:13,240 --> 00:30:15,232
I haven't counted.

520
00:30:16,440 --> 00:30:18,432
Are any of them close to death?

521
00:30:24,040 --> 00:30:25,190
Close to death.

522
00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:27,511
Are any of them about to die?

523
00:30:28,600 --> 00:30:31,354
An old man? A sick child?

524
00:30:33,920 --> 00:30:35,991
Answer me, Charaki.

525
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:40,436
It'll happen sooner or later.

526
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:43,036
Why?

527
00:30:43,520 --> 00:30:45,352
What was that guy doing to you?

528
00:30:45,560 --> 00:30:47,631
Almas? He's an ophthalmologist.

529
00:30:48,800 --> 00:30:51,474
He hunts sharks, does circumcisions,

530
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:54,199
and is an ophthalmologist, too.

531
00:30:56,200 --> 00:30:58,920
He was treating my eyes.

532
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:02,074
He takes shark oil in his mouth

533
00:31:02,440 --> 00:31:04,636
and applies it to my eyes with his tongue.

534
00:31:05,680 --> 00:31:08,070
It's soothing. You should try it.

535
00:31:08,560 --> 00:31:09,560
No, thanks.

536
00:31:19,040 --> 00:31:21,236
I need a corpse.

537
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:23,319
Find me one.

538
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:25,274
<i>Day 1001.</i>

539
00:31:26,680 --> 00:31:28,911
<i>Today I went to the Valley of Stars.</i>

540
00:31:30,040 --> 00:31:31,793
<i>Someone was waiting for me.</i>

541
00:31:32,840 --> 00:31:35,036
<i>He was wearing a gray raincoat</i>

542
00:31:35,480 --> 00:31:37,551
<i>and he shot me in the neck.</i>

543
00:31:38,760 --> 00:31:40,831
<i>He felt sorry for me.</i>

544
00:31:41,280 --> 00:31:42,919
<i>He didn't give me the opportunity to say</i>

545
00:31:43,120 --> 00:31:44,873
<i>he'd left something behind.</i>

546
00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:48,317
<i>Day 743.</i>

547
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:50,439
<i>I decided to have breakfast today.</i>

548
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:52,757
<i>I walked to the station.</i>

549
00:31:53,080 --> 00:31:56,073
<i>Charaki had two eggs. He gave me one.</i>

550
00:31:56,760 --> 00:31:58,353
<i>I said: ""Charaki, on this island</i>

551
00:31:58,560 --> 00:31:59,914
<i>there are no chickens.</i>

552
00:32:00,120 --> 00:32:02,715
<i>Where did you get the eggs?""</i>

553
00:32:03,400 --> 00:32:05,198
<i>""Damn you"", he said.""With those words</i>

554
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:07,875
<i>you sent me straight into the abyss.""</i>

555
00:32:09,080 --> 00:32:10,912
<i>Day 67.</i>

556
00:32:12,840 --> 00:32:15,480
<i>I killed a fly as it was airborne.</i>

557
00:32:16,840 --> 00:32:18,718
<i>It's what they call a good death.</i>

558
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:21,397
<i>The last image it had of life</i>

559
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:22,670
<i>was of flying.</i>

560
00:32:24,080 --> 00:32:26,675
<i>What'll be the last image I see?</i>

561
00:33:51,400 --> 00:33:52,800
What's that for?

562
00:33:54,960 --> 00:33:56,314
Photography.

563
00:34:07,920 --> 00:34:09,240
What did he write?

564
00:34:09,400 --> 00:34:11,551
<i>What'll be the last image I see?</i>

565
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:14,832
<i>A stranded ship?</i>

566
00:34:15,360 --> 00:34:17,875
<i>An abandoned, haunted cemetery?</i>

567
00:34:18,520 --> 00:34:20,989
<i>964 crumbling headstones</i>

568
00:34:21,920 --> 00:34:24,913
<i>over an ocean of crushed bones?</i>

569
00:34:25,320 --> 00:34:26,879
<i>Does it make a difference?</i>

570
00:34:29,160 --> 00:34:31,311
<i>Day 1021.</i>

571
00:34:31,840 --> 00:34:32,990
<i>It's afternoon.</i>

572
00:34:33,240 --> 00:34:34,640
<i>I think it's July.</i>

573
00:34:35,200 --> 00:34:36,200
<i>I've been on this island</i>

574
00:34:36,360 --> 00:34:37,360
<i>almost three years</i>

575
00:34:37,480 --> 00:34:39,153
<i>and have never gone swimming.</i>

576
00:34:40,280 --> 00:34:41,475
<i>I'm lying in bed</i>

577
00:34:41,680 --> 00:34:43,194
<i>and think about swimming.</i>

578
00:34:43,400 --> 00:34:45,835
<i>I exercise my brain.</i>

579
00:34:46,040 --> 00:34:48,396
<i>But I wish I were a shark hunter, too.</i>

580
00:34:50,680 --> 00:34:52,592
<i>Day 313.</i>

581
00:34:53,440 --> 00:34:56,035
<i>Today I heard a motorcycle going by.</i>

582
00:34:56,320 --> 00:34:58,880
<i>It was nice, I liked it.</i>

583
00:35:03,080 --> 00:35:04,992
<i>Day 1201.</i>

584
00:35:05,800 --> 00:35:07,792
<i>She brought me some basil today.</i>

585
00:35:08,120 --> 00:35:10,760
<i>She was wearing a yellow floral dress.</i>

586
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:13,160
<i>We went out on deck together</i>

587
00:35:13,360 --> 00:35:14,840
<i>and looked at the graves.</i>

588
00:35:15,040 --> 00:35:17,475
<i>We ate bread, cheese and basil.</i>

589
00:35:54,040 --> 00:35:55,633
You're in luck.

590
00:35:55,840 --> 00:35:57,194
When she puts red oil

591
00:35:57,400 --> 00:35:59,039
on the forehead it's all over.

592
00:36:00,720 --> 00:36:02,552
Tell them we'll bury the body

593
00:36:02,760 --> 00:36:04,194
in the other cemetery.

594
00:36:04,560 --> 00:36:06,631
Don't tell them that.

595
00:36:07,360 --> 00:36:08,919
Why? It's just a cemetery.

596
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:10,794
It's not just any cemetery.

597
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:12,320
No one's been buried there

598
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:13,480
for a 100 years.

599
00:36:14,080 --> 00:36:15,309
Samei only went there

600
00:36:15,520 --> 00:36:17,477
so no one would disturb him.

601
00:36:17,680 --> 00:36:19,672
Just tell them. Offer them money.

602
00:36:19,880 --> 00:36:20,996
It's not that.

603
00:36:21,160 --> 00:36:22,674
Tell me what you want it for,

604
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:23,880
then we'll see.

605
00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:26,757
This man was once a village elder,

606
00:36:27,120 --> 00:36:29,396
he can't be buried in the devil's ground.

607
00:36:29,800 --> 00:36:31,200
Do you want to bury another person

608
00:36:31,400 --> 00:36:33,119
so the earth quakes again?

609
00:36:33,520 --> 00:36:35,830
Wasn't one earthquake enough?

610
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:37,070
I went to the ship

611
00:36:37,240 --> 00:36:38,754
when you left for Tehran.

612
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:40,873
You didn't report back to the Agency.

613
00:36:41,520 --> 00:36:43,591
- That's bold of you.
- Charaki...

614
00:36:44,920 --> 00:36:46,434
think it through.

615
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:47,870
A corpse.

616
00:36:48,080 --> 00:36:49,992
If not this one, then another.

617
00:36:50,200 --> 00:36:52,237
Or it'll be you and that'll be no fun.

618
00:36:57,400 --> 00:36:59,232
<i>The ground is like the sea,</i>

619
00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:01,033
<i>constantly in motion,</i>

620
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:02,998
<i>always shaking.</i>

621
00:37:03,160 --> 00:37:04,992
<i>Sometimes the shaking is stronger,</i>

622
00:37:05,200 --> 00:37:06,520
<i>they call it an earthquake.</i>

623
00:37:07,120 --> 00:37:09,589
<i>Sometimes it only shakes a little,</i>

624
00:37:09,800 --> 00:37:11,280
<i>like a slight itch,</i>

625
00:37:11,480 --> 00:37:13,711
<i>you can't tell if it's really there.</i>

626
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:15,718
<i>There's no name for this.</i>

627
00:37:16,600 --> 00:37:18,592
<i>I was searching for this,</i>

628
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:20,439
<i>for this nameless motion.</i>

629
00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:11,356
Babak!

630
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:14,120
Look at this.

631
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:19,960
What is it?

632
00:38:20,120 --> 00:38:22,351
A symbol. I think it's a name.

633
00:38:23,520 --> 00:38:24,590
Look.

634
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:26,075
<i>Halimeh.</i>

635
00:38:26,280 --> 00:38:27,680
Someone visited him here.

636
00:38:27,880 --> 00:38:29,030
It's on the walls too.

637
00:38:29,240 --> 00:38:30,720
He was in love.

638
00:38:33,560 --> 00:38:35,233
Charaki,

639
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:37,432
is there a Halimeh in the village?

640
00:38:38,920 --> 00:38:40,115
There are many Halimehs here.

641
00:38:40,920 --> 00:38:42,320
One that Samei knew?

642
00:38:44,120 --> 00:38:45,713
There was one. Almas's daughter.

643
00:38:46,280 --> 00:38:48,556
- Who's Almas?
- You met him.

644
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:49,880
He was cleaning my eyes.

645
00:38:50,240 --> 00:38:51,833
What was his daughter doing here?

646
00:38:52,640 --> 00:38:55,030
I never saw her here.

647
00:38:55,440 --> 00:38:57,238
- It was just talk.
- What kind of talk?

648
00:38:58,120 --> 00:38:59,474
Just gossip.

649
00:38:59,840 --> 00:39:02,230
What sort of gossip? Where is she now?

650
00:39:02,480 --> 00:39:04,153
She disappeared.

651
00:39:04,360 --> 00:39:06,636
She's dead, at least that's what they say.

652
00:39:06,880 --> 00:39:08,439
- I don't know.
- Look at me.

653
00:39:09,040 --> 00:39:11,077
What do you mean, you don't know?

654
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:13,078
It's their business.

655
00:39:13,280 --> 00:39:14,280
We keep out of it.

656
00:39:15,480 --> 00:39:16,720
And you're telling me this now?

657
00:39:17,600 --> 00:39:18,750
A girl disappeared and

658
00:39:18,920 --> 00:39:20,036
you didn't investigate?

659
00:39:20,280 --> 00:39:22,749
Lots of girls run away from here.

660
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:25,111
They take the night ferry for Bandar Abbas

661
00:39:26,080 --> 00:39:28,072
or for Ras al-Khaimah.

662
00:39:28,560 --> 00:39:30,836
Ask Almas about his daughter.

663
00:39:31,040 --> 00:39:33,794
He'll make mincemeat of you.

664
00:39:36,280 --> 00:39:38,033
<i>I went to see Almas,</i>

665
00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:40,550
<i>the ophthalmologist and shark hunter.</i>

666
00:39:41,640 --> 00:39:42,960
<i>He wasn't home.</i>

667
00:39:43,160 --> 00:39:45,231
<i>His house wasn't a home, either.</i>

668
00:39:45,440 --> 00:39:47,193
<i>It was a long corridor</i>

669
00:39:47,400 --> 00:39:49,278
<i>with an oil extraction lab on one side,</i>

670
00:39:49,480 --> 00:39:51,312
<i>and a doctor's practice on the other.</i>

671
00:39:51,840 --> 00:39:53,194
<i>It smelled strange,</i>

672
00:39:53,400 --> 00:39:56,757
<i>somewhere between sulfur and cloves.</i>

673
00:39:57,920 --> 00:39:59,320
<i>Charaki was right.</i>

674
00:40:00,360 --> 00:40:01,794
<i>I didn't belong there.</i>

675
00:40:07,560 --> 00:40:08,676
Hello.

676
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:13,199
Sorry, it was so hot I went inside.

677
00:40:14,080 --> 00:40:15,992
- Let me give you a hand.
- No need.

678
00:40:19,160 --> 00:40:20,230
I'm Charaki's colleague.

679
00:40:23,120 --> 00:40:24,395
I know you.

680
00:40:25,960 --> 00:40:27,314
But that isn't a shark.

681
00:40:27,520 --> 00:40:29,398
They say you're a shark hunter.

682
00:40:31,360 --> 00:40:33,352
It's not shark season now.

683
00:40:35,320 --> 00:40:37,551
Do you eat that? It looks weird.

684
00:40:39,040 --> 00:40:41,111
We coat ferries with its oil

685
00:40:41,520 --> 00:40:43,079
to make them waterproof.

686
00:40:43,320 --> 00:40:44,320
How many ferries

687
00:40:44,480 --> 00:40:45,755
do they build here a year?

688
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:48,354
Enough to make a living?

689
00:40:48,600 --> 00:40:49,954
God is merciful.

690
00:40:51,960 --> 00:40:53,713
How many children do you have?

691
00:40:54,600 --> 00:40:56,034
None.

692
00:40:56,280 --> 00:40:57,919
What about Halimeh?

693
00:41:02,480 --> 00:41:04,358
She is dead.

694
00:41:07,160 --> 00:41:08,355
Charaki only said

695
00:41:08,560 --> 00:41:10,916
- she is missing.
- She's dead.

696
00:41:11,480 --> 00:41:12,960
Charaki said she was missing.

697
00:41:13,480 --> 00:41:14,709
Where did you look for her?

698
00:41:16,480 --> 00:41:19,040
You don't look for a runaway.

699
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:21,434
How do you know she's dead?

700
00:41:21,640 --> 00:41:25,077
They all die. They run away at night

701
00:41:25,240 --> 00:41:26,594
and are eaten by wolves.

702
00:41:26,760 --> 00:41:28,399
And if they get to Ras al-Khaimah,

703
00:41:28,560 --> 00:41:29,960
it's worse than death.

704
00:41:32,840 --> 00:41:34,877
You knew Mustafa Samei.

705
00:41:37,720 --> 00:41:39,279
Mustafa Samei.

706
00:41:40,200 --> 00:41:41,600
The haunted cemetery.

707
00:41:41,800 --> 00:41:43,712
I don't know anyone.

708
00:41:44,040 --> 00:41:45,440
I hunt sharks.

709
00:41:49,880 --> 00:41:51,200
Go inside.

710
00:46:04,960 --> 00:46:06,155
Sit down.

711
00:46:06,560 --> 00:46:07,630
Sit down.

712
00:46:25,480 --> 00:46:26,516
Smoke this.

713
00:46:31,080 --> 00:46:32,080
Smoke it.

714
00:46:34,240 --> 00:46:35,560
You won't understand me

715
00:46:35,760 --> 00:46:37,558
until you smoke it.

716
00:46:39,080 --> 00:46:41,117
<i>She said: ""You won't understand me</i>

717
00:46:41,320 --> 00:46:42,595
<i>until you smoke it.""</i>

718
00:46:42,840 --> 00:46:44,593
<i>I lit a match.</i>

719
00:46:48,840 --> 00:46:49,840
<i>She said:</i>

720
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:51,753
<i>""I know you're looking for my Halimeh.</i>

721
00:46:52,160 --> 00:46:54,152
<i>Go to the Valley of Stars.</i>

722
00:46:54,400 --> 00:46:55,400
<i>Behind the opening</i>

723
00:46:55,520 --> 00:46:57,079
<i>that you looked through</i>

724
00:46:57,280 --> 00:46:58,794
<i>someone's waiting for you.</i>

725
00:46:59,440 --> 00:47:00,920
<i>Its leg is broken.</i>

726
00:47:01,440 --> 00:47:03,955
<i>Put five bullets in its brain</i>

727
00:47:04,160 --> 00:47:05,310
<i>and release it.</i>

728
00:47:05,520 --> 00:47:08,115
<i>Bury it in the haunted cemetery.</i>

729
00:47:08,320 --> 00:47:10,198
<i>Wait. The grave will say</i>

730
00:47:10,360 --> 00:47:11,635
<i>where Halimeh is.""</i>

731
00:47:13,840 --> 00:47:14,910
<i>That's what she said.</i>

732
00:47:15,120 --> 00:47:17,157
<i>At least, that's what I think she said.</i>

733
00:47:17,400 --> 00:47:20,279
<i>I don't know if it was a dream.</i>

734
00:49:43,080 --> 00:49:44,275
Fetch hot water

735
00:49:44,480 --> 00:49:46,870
and the leather bag from my suitcase!

736
00:50:06,800 --> 00:50:08,280
Take her.

737
00:50:20,680 --> 00:50:22,956
I held the baby in my arms.

738
00:50:26,080 --> 00:50:28,151
Her mother was down there.

739
00:50:32,040 --> 00:50:34,953
They pulled her body out.

740
00:50:36,120 --> 00:50:37,270
Babak said:

741
00:50:37,480 --> 00:50:39,711
""Here's the corpse you were looking for.""

742
00:50:39,880 --> 00:50:42,031
She told me her father had killed Samei.

743
00:50:42,400 --> 00:50:43,880
She was whispering.

744
00:50:44,080 --> 00:50:46,390
I brought my head closer. She took my hand

745
00:50:46,600 --> 00:50:49,399
and said Almas had killed Samei.

746
00:50:49,760 --> 00:50:51,558
We can lay out her body,

747
00:50:51,760 --> 00:50:52,830
take it to the village,

748
00:50:53,040 --> 00:50:54,235
to the station,

749
00:50:54,440 --> 00:50:56,159
and go after Almas.

750
00:50:56,840 --> 00:50:58,797
He'd come to kill them both,

751
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:01,276
but she'd hidden in the cellar.

752
00:51:05,160 --> 00:51:07,072
Does it make a difference

753
00:51:07,280 --> 00:51:09,317
if I take this body and arrest Almas?

754
00:51:10,240 --> 00:51:11,913
Does it?

755
00:51:13,680 --> 00:51:16,115
I want to know what's going on down there.

756
00:51:17,600 --> 00:51:19,273
Let's bury her.

757
00:51:36,080 --> 00:51:37,673
Don't be afraid.

758
00:51:40,560 --> 00:51:42,074
Don't be scared.

759
00:51:45,920 --> 00:51:47,991
I'll stay with you forever.

760
00:51:50,480 --> 00:51:51,596
I promise.

761
00:51:57,280 --> 00:51:59,511
<i>An Indian worker said:</i>

762
00:51:59,720 --> 00:52:01,837
<i>""When a corpse goes into the ground,</i>

763
00:52:02,720 --> 00:52:03,836
<i>the earth opens its mouth</i>

764
00:52:04,040 --> 00:52:05,554
<i>and there's an earthquake.""</i>

765
00:52:07,080 --> 00:52:09,470
<i>This is what they call a superstition.</i>

766
00:52:11,520 --> 00:52:13,273
<i>The corpse had been buried</i>

767
00:52:13,480 --> 00:52:15,472
<i>and the earth had shaken.</i>

768
00:52:15,680 --> 00:52:16,680
<i>Hafizi said</i>

769
00:52:16,840 --> 00:52:18,911
<i>he'd seen it with his own eyes.</i>

770
00:52:19,120 --> 00:52:21,237
<i>This is what they call a quotation.</i>

771
00:52:22,760 --> 00:52:24,831
<i>Now I had buried Halimeh</i>

772
00:52:25,040 --> 00:52:26,554
<i>with my own hands.</i>

773
00:52:27,360 --> 00:52:28,589
<i>I was afraid,</i>

774
00:52:28,800 --> 00:52:30,712
<i>as if there was another earthquake,</i>

775
00:52:32,360 --> 00:52:35,034
<i>it'd be what they call a nightmare.</i>

776
00:54:22,360 --> 00:54:24,477
There was an earthquake again.

777
00:54:24,680 --> 00:54:25,680
Really.

778
00:54:28,760 --> 00:54:30,160
You can laugh here,

779
00:54:30,440 --> 00:54:32,193
but you would've pissed yourself there.

780
00:54:32,560 --> 00:54:33,755
When the sun rose,

781
00:54:33,960 --> 00:54:35,679
we got into the Impala

782
00:54:35,880 --> 00:54:38,520
and drove all round the area.

783
00:54:39,040 --> 00:54:42,192
The earth had five new cracks

784
00:54:42,400 --> 00:54:44,312
and both seismometers

785
00:54:44,520 --> 00:54:47,115
showed a 6.2 Richter earthquake.

786
00:54:47,320 --> 00:54:49,710
But 200 meters away, it was again

787
00:54:49,920 --> 00:54:51,673
as if nothing had happened.

788
00:54:51,880 --> 00:54:53,200
We had to excavate to find out

789
00:54:53,440 --> 00:54:55,830
what was going on down there.

790
00:54:56,200 --> 00:54:58,237
There was no other way.

791
00:54:58,440 --> 00:55:01,114
You could've made a report to us.

792
00:55:01,320 --> 00:55:03,471
No, that wasn't an option.

793
00:55:03,640 --> 00:55:05,359
You'd have found out what was going on,

794
00:55:05,600 --> 00:55:06,600
we wouldn't have.

795
00:55:06,920 --> 00:55:09,276
The locals wouldn't have helped,

796
00:55:09,520 --> 00:55:11,637
and Babak didn't want anyone else.

797
00:55:11,800 --> 00:55:13,996
We brought workers from Bandar Abbas.

798
00:55:14,360 --> 00:55:16,477
When they heard the cemetery's name,

799
00:55:16,680 --> 00:55:18,717
they ran away.

800
00:55:19,680 --> 00:55:21,876
They wouldn't even talk to me.

801
00:55:24,160 --> 00:55:27,039
On the way back I met some Indians.

802
00:55:28,600 --> 00:55:29,920
They were musicians,

803
00:55:30,320 --> 00:55:32,437
they were just sitting around.

804
00:55:33,400 --> 00:55:34,400
They'd left India

805
00:55:34,600 --> 00:55:36,319
and were heading for Lebanon.

806
00:55:37,240 --> 00:55:38,276
They'd run out of money

807
00:55:38,520 --> 00:55:40,432
so they'd sold their instruments.

808
00:55:40,640 --> 00:55:42,438
They were stuck.

809
00:55:43,160 --> 00:55:46,153
I begged them and offered them money

810
00:55:46,320 --> 00:55:47,959
and they finally agreed.

811
00:55:48,160 --> 00:55:50,038
We boarded the ferry.

812
00:57:09,320 --> 00:57:10,320
This is the ship

813
00:57:10,520 --> 00:57:13,035
and this is the road you took here.

814
00:57:13,560 --> 00:57:15,995
I want your guys to dig here,

815
00:57:17,280 --> 00:57:18,634
here...

816
00:57:19,160 --> 00:57:20,799
and here.

817
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:25,995
And your guys will dig here and here.

818
00:57:27,320 --> 00:57:29,835
I want one person to dig over here.

819
00:57:36,920 --> 00:57:38,070
<i>As we left the port</i>

820
00:57:38,280 --> 00:57:40,431
<i>I could tell we were being watched.</i>

821
00:57:40,640 --> 00:57:41,756
<i>I didn't see anything,</i>

822
00:57:41,960 --> 00:57:43,633
<i>but I had a strange feeling.</i>

823
00:57:44,520 --> 00:57:47,877
<i>I thought someone was following us.</i>

824
00:57:49,840 --> 00:57:52,639
<i>I didn't see anyone when I turned round.</i>

825
00:57:53,360 --> 00:57:55,795
<i>I saw them when we got to the cemetery.</i>

826
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:58,560
<i>They were standing behind the cliffs</i>

827
00:57:58,760 --> 00:58:00,274
<i>and peering out.</i>

828
00:58:01,400 --> 00:58:03,437
<i>They were wearing jackets.</i>

829
00:58:03,600 --> 00:58:05,398
<i>Black jackets.</i>

830
00:58:05,880 --> 00:58:07,917
<i>One of them had a beard.</i>

831
00:58:08,320 --> 00:58:10,232
<i>His glasses reflected the light.</i>

832
00:58:10,440 --> 00:58:13,080
<i>When I looked again they were gone.</i>

833
00:58:15,480 --> 00:58:16,709
<i>They were there for a second</i>

834
00:58:16,960 --> 00:58:18,713
<i>and gone the next, like djinns.</i>

835
00:58:20,200 --> 00:58:22,920
<i>Then they'd appear somewhere else.</i>

836
00:58:23,400 --> 00:58:25,756
<i>I can't say how many there were.</i>

837
00:58:26,960 --> 00:58:28,599
<i>They were everywhere,</i>

838
00:58:29,680 --> 00:58:31,319
<i>and nowhere.</i>

839
00:58:31,960 --> 00:58:33,110
Behnam!

840
00:58:37,920 --> 00:58:39,832
- What is it?
- Come here.

841
00:58:44,200 --> 00:58:45,475
I'll mention a place,

842
00:58:45,720 --> 00:58:47,439
but don't look at it yet.

843
00:58:47,680 --> 00:58:49,080
In front of us, above the cliff,

844
00:58:49,280 --> 00:58:51,272
there's a crescent formation.

845
00:58:51,520 --> 00:58:54,080
Look at it but don't raise your head.

846
00:58:55,800 --> 00:58:56,836
What is it?

847
00:58:57,040 --> 00:59:00,556
- Can you see two people there?
- No.

848
00:59:01,160 --> 00:59:03,914
I think I saw two people there.

849
00:59:04,080 --> 00:59:06,037
Let's get a bit closer.

850
00:59:06,720 --> 00:59:10,157
Pretend we're having a lively discussion.

851
00:59:13,600 --> 00:59:15,796
Has the Agency got wind of it?

852
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:18,799
I doubt they could have this fast.

853
00:59:19,880 --> 00:59:21,633
But maybe Charaki...

854
00:59:21,840 --> 00:59:22,876
I saw someone.

855
00:59:23,080 --> 00:59:24,309
Is it him?

856
00:59:24,520 --> 00:59:26,193
I can't tell. He's too far away.

857
00:59:26,400 --> 00:59:27,754
A glint of eyeglasses, beard?

858
00:59:27,920 --> 00:59:30,196
He was wearing a jacket. I don't know.

859
00:59:33,800 --> 00:59:35,075
Maybe they were trailing me

860
00:59:35,280 --> 00:59:36,919
even before your arrival.

861
00:59:37,120 --> 00:59:38,918
The Hozvaresh Ring?

862
00:59:39,760 --> 00:59:41,717
There he is again!

863
00:59:43,080 --> 00:59:44,309
Charaki.

864
00:59:45,440 --> 00:59:46,874
Charaki is here.

865
00:59:58,720 --> 00:59:59,720
Hello.

866
00:59:59,920 --> 01:00:02,037
Where did you find these scrawny guys?

867
01:00:02,400 --> 01:00:03,993
Cold water!

868
01:00:04,200 --> 01:00:07,079
I've got cold water. Come over here!

869
01:00:07,320 --> 01:00:09,551
Hurry up and break this ice.

870
01:00:09,760 --> 01:00:10,876
Hello Charaki.

871
01:00:11,080 --> 01:00:13,800
I could have got workers for you.

872
01:00:15,400 --> 01:00:18,040
There are lots of unemployed men

873
01:00:18,200 --> 01:00:19,200
at the dock.

874
01:00:19,400 --> 01:00:22,438
The dock workers wouldn't come here.

875
01:00:22,920 --> 01:00:25,594
Anyway, I've brought you some cold water.

876
01:00:25,800 --> 01:00:28,076
Come drink some cool water.

877
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:30,434
Hurry up.

878
01:00:32,320 --> 01:00:34,755
Here's some cool water.

879
01:00:35,360 --> 01:00:37,556
It gets as hot as hell here.

880
01:00:41,200 --> 01:00:42,714
Wait.

881
01:00:50,680 --> 01:00:52,160
That's enough.

882
01:00:54,720 --> 01:00:56,598
Let the others drink, too.

883
01:00:58,280 --> 01:01:00,636
- Is Haddad in the ship?
- Yes.

884
01:01:02,280 --> 01:01:05,000
- What's he doing here?
- I don't know.

885
01:01:05,200 --> 01:01:06,953
And those two up there?

886
01:01:08,080 --> 01:01:10,151
Drink up and get to work.

887
01:01:10,360 --> 01:01:11,919
Go and see what he wants,

888
01:01:12,120 --> 01:01:13,998
I'll ask what these guys know.

889
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:18,469
Darshan, come here.

890
01:01:18,680 --> 01:01:20,637
Come drink some water.

891
01:01:21,400 --> 01:01:22,754
I already drank some.

892
01:01:22,960 --> 01:01:25,520
Don't be shy, come and drink.

893
01:01:25,720 --> 01:01:26,720
I'm not being shy.

894
01:01:26,920 --> 01:01:28,718
I was the first one to drink.

895
01:01:33,640 --> 01:01:35,871
Darshan!

896
01:01:38,080 --> 01:01:39,560
Someone get a rope,

897
01:01:39,760 --> 01:01:41,558
there's some behind the ship!

898
01:02:04,200 --> 01:02:05,680
Rope, rope!

899
01:02:09,160 --> 01:02:11,914
<i>They let me down on a rope.</i>

900
01:02:12,280 --> 01:02:13,714
<i>The deeper I went,</i>

901
01:02:14,840 --> 01:02:16,957
<i>the further I got from myself.</i>

902
01:02:21,000 --> 01:02:22,150
<i>I ended up not knowing</i>

903
01:02:22,320 --> 01:02:23,320
<i>where I was anymore.</i>

904
01:02:23,520 --> 01:02:26,513
<i>I'd have liked to stay there forever,</i>

905
01:02:26,680 --> 01:02:28,558
<i>in the darkness.</i>

906
01:02:28,880 --> 01:02:29,880
<i>I wanted to untie</i>

907
01:02:30,040 --> 01:02:31,997
<i>the rope around my waist</i>

908
01:02:32,400 --> 01:02:34,437
<i>when someone took my hand.</i>

909
01:02:35,840 --> 01:02:39,197
<i>He said, ""Darshan, don't be scared.</i>

910
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:41,400
<i>I'm here.""</i>

911
01:02:41,600 --> 01:02:43,796
<i>Then he hugged me tightly</i>

912
01:02:44,080 --> 01:02:45,080
<i>and pulled me out.</i>

913
01:02:45,400 --> 01:02:46,516
Pull him out.

914
01:02:51,880 --> 01:02:52,880
Careful.

915
01:02:53,040 --> 01:02:54,599
Fetch some water.

916
01:02:54,800 --> 01:02:55,800
Careful.

917
01:03:04,080 --> 01:03:05,150
Darshan?

918
01:03:46,880 --> 01:03:48,678
What does that mean?

919
01:03:49,200 --> 01:03:50,634
I saw a strange creature

920
01:03:50,840 --> 01:03:53,594
with scales as black as tar,

921
01:03:54,160 --> 01:03:57,870
and eyes red like fiery coal.

922
01:04:00,360 --> 01:04:02,192
He said this in German?

923
01:04:02,400 --> 01:04:03,629
He was in shock himself,

924
01:04:03,840 --> 01:04:05,320
like he couldn't understand

925
01:04:05,480 --> 01:04:06,480
what he was saying.

926
01:04:06,600 --> 01:04:08,671
It was like a tape recorder

927
01:04:08,920 --> 01:04:10,320
was playing someone's voice

928
01:04:10,520 --> 01:04:12,159
from within his body.

929
01:04:12,360 --> 01:04:14,477
I turned around

930
01:04:15,480 --> 01:04:17,995
and saw the workers talking to each other.

931
01:04:18,200 --> 01:04:20,112
They were scared.

932
01:04:20,320 --> 01:04:22,437
But I was even more scared

933
01:04:24,160 --> 01:04:25,355
because I could understand

934
01:04:25,600 --> 01:04:27,159
what they were saying.

935
01:04:27,360 --> 01:04:29,750
They were speaking in Urdu,

936
01:04:30,880 --> 01:04:32,155
and I could understand

937
01:04:32,320 --> 01:04:33,595
every word they said.

938
01:04:35,640 --> 01:04:38,109
As if under the ground,

939
01:04:38,360 --> 01:04:41,717
inside that well, something had shifted.

940
01:04:42,480 --> 01:04:44,199
Charaki came and introduced himself,

941
01:04:45,760 --> 01:04:48,229
saying he was Babak's colleague.

942
01:04:48,440 --> 01:04:50,591
He said he'd brought me some water.

943
01:04:50,800 --> 01:04:52,632
He handed me a small green flask

944
01:04:52,840 --> 01:04:54,593
and said it was cool water.

945
01:04:54,800 --> 01:04:56,678
I drank it,

946
01:04:58,000 --> 01:05:00,071
and asked how he'd found ice

947
01:05:00,240 --> 01:05:01,833
in this hellhole.

948
01:05:02,800 --> 01:05:04,951
He made a joke

949
01:05:06,480 --> 01:05:07,800
and said:

950
01:05:08,960 --> 01:05:10,189
""Just wait.""

951
01:05:10,840 --> 01:05:13,912
""You haven't seen hell yet.""

952
01:05:15,200 --> 01:05:18,193
Then he laughed and disappeared.

953
01:05:20,680 --> 01:05:22,239
I felt dizzy.

954
01:05:22,440 --> 01:05:25,080
I wanted to call the guys.

955
01:05:25,240 --> 01:05:27,596
Valieh felt like a huge stone in my arms.

956
01:05:27,800 --> 01:05:29,314
I couldn't get up.

957
01:05:30,240 --> 01:05:32,596
Then I saw myself standing at the door...

958
01:05:34,280 --> 01:05:35,475
calling Babak.

959
01:05:35,680 --> 01:05:38,240
I clearly remember, I called him twice.

960
01:05:40,840 --> 01:05:42,194
I thought, if it's me

961
01:05:42,400 --> 01:05:45,234
standing at the door and calling out,

962
01:05:45,440 --> 01:05:47,272
who's leaning against the wall

963
01:05:47,480 --> 01:05:49,073
and watching him?

964
01:05:49,600 --> 01:05:52,593
In the midst of this chaos I heard Haddad.

965
01:05:53,800 --> 01:05:55,314
He called my name.

966
01:05:55,840 --> 01:05:59,038
I turned around. There was no one there.

967
01:06:02,880 --> 01:06:05,520
I remember a wind was blowing,

968
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:08,560
or at least I could hear the wind.

969
01:06:09,600 --> 01:06:10,795
I heard him again.

970
01:06:12,840 --> 01:06:14,832
I walked towards the ship.

971
01:06:18,920 --> 01:06:21,071
When and how much did you drink?

972
01:06:22,520 --> 01:06:23,636
Water?

973
01:06:58,480 --> 01:06:59,960
Keyvan, what's wrong?

974
01:07:00,600 --> 01:07:01,829
Keyvan!

975
01:07:19,680 --> 01:07:21,034
Behnam!

976
01:07:28,920 --> 01:07:30,070
Behnam!

977
01:07:35,080 --> 01:07:37,640
Did you not see him?

978
01:07:41,280 --> 01:07:44,079
Did you not see our Sheikh?

979
01:07:46,440 --> 01:07:48,909
Did you not see our master?

980
01:07:52,480 --> 01:07:55,040
I can smell him but I cannot find him.

981
01:07:55,400 --> 01:07:56,470
Get up.

982
01:07:57,440 --> 01:07:58,669
Get up.

983
01:07:58,880 --> 01:08:00,109
Lift him up.

984
01:08:14,040 --> 01:08:16,111
Thank you, you can go.

985
01:08:25,880 --> 01:08:27,792
Would you like some water?

986
01:08:28,000 --> 01:08:29,514
Where is Valieh?

987
01:08:29,720 --> 01:08:31,200
- Who's Valieh?
- The baby.

988
01:08:31,360 --> 01:08:32,360
Don't worry. She's safe.

989
01:08:32,560 --> 01:08:34,199
I am worried. Where is she?

990
01:08:34,360 --> 01:08:36,352
- With her family.
- She has none.

991
01:08:36,560 --> 01:08:38,233
I'm her family.

992
01:08:38,440 --> 01:08:40,397
She's with her grandfather.

993
01:08:41,320 --> 01:08:43,198
With Almas?

994
01:08:44,560 --> 01:08:46,358
You took her to Almas?

995
01:08:46,560 --> 01:08:48,756
You gave her to Almas? You bastards!

996
01:08:48,960 --> 01:08:50,758
- How could you do that!
- Mr. Charaki.

997
01:08:50,960 --> 01:08:51,960
She's my child.

998
01:08:52,080 --> 01:08:53,434
Why did you give her to Almas?

999
01:08:53,600 --> 01:08:55,000
Let go of me!

1000
01:08:55,240 --> 01:08:59,200
You bastards, Charaki, you son of a bitch!

1001
01:09:01,440 --> 01:09:02,999
Where have you taken him?

1002
01:09:03,200 --> 01:09:05,431
Don't worry about that. Just answer me.

1003
01:09:07,720 --> 01:09:08,720
Where is Hafizi?

1004
01:09:09,880 --> 01:09:12,952
I ask the questions, you answer.

1005
01:09:13,560 --> 01:09:15,950
I won't say a thing until I see Hafizi.

1006
01:09:16,840 --> 01:09:18,320
Hafizi's already talked.

1007
01:09:18,480 --> 01:09:19,596
Now it's your turn.

1008
01:09:19,800 --> 01:09:23,271
Hafizi's talked? Play it back to me.

1009
01:09:31,120 --> 01:09:33,271
<i>I remember a wind was blowing,</i>

1010
01:09:33,480 --> 01:09:35,949
<i>or at least I could hear the wind.</i>

1011
01:09:36,520 --> 01:09:38,477
<i>I couldn't hear clearly.</i>

1012
01:09:39,120 --> 01:09:40,839
<i>I heard him again.</i>

1013
01:09:41,960 --> 01:09:43,758
<i>I walked towards the ship.</i>

1014
01:09:45,120 --> 01:09:47,840
<i>When and how much did you drink?</i>

1015
01:09:49,160 --> 01:09:50,310
<i>Water?</i>

1016
01:09:52,040 --> 01:09:54,953
<i>Jahangiri, forget about this stuff.</i>

1017
01:09:55,640 --> 01:09:57,040
<i>What was going on down there?</i>

1018
01:09:57,240 --> 01:10:00,199
I ask the questions and you answer them.

1019
01:10:00,920 --> 01:10:02,354
Saeed!

1020
01:10:04,200 --> 01:10:06,039
The interrogation breaks off here.

1021
01:10:06,240 --> 01:10:08,038
We listened to all the tapes

1022
01:10:08,280 --> 01:10:09,430
but found nothing.

1023
01:10:09,640 --> 01:10:10,915
We even went back to the

1024
01:10:11,160 --> 01:10:12,560
Anti-terror Committee's Archives,

1025
01:10:12,760 --> 01:10:14,672
thinking maybe we'd missed a tape.

1026
01:10:14,880 --> 01:10:16,997
But there was nothing.

1027
01:10:17,200 --> 01:10:20,477
The story would have remained open.

1028
01:10:21,760 --> 01:10:25,720
But an employee at the Archives

1029
01:10:25,920 --> 01:10:29,152
told one of my assistants

1030
01:10:29,400 --> 01:10:31,392
that Saeed Jahangiri was still alive.

1031
01:10:31,760 --> 01:10:34,195
I asked: ""How can that be?""

1032
01:10:34,360 --> 01:10:37,114
He was an interrogator fifty years ago.

1033
01:10:37,600 --> 01:10:40,399
Then we found out he was born in 1943.

1034
01:10:40,600 --> 01:10:42,034
He'd been only 23 then.

1035
01:10:42,400 --> 01:10:45,837
Mr. Haghighi asked me to play myself.

1036
01:10:46,040 --> 01:10:48,680
I said I'm not an actor.

1037
01:10:48,880 --> 01:10:50,519
Back then I was twenty years old,

1038
01:10:50,840 --> 01:10:51,840
I was a kid!

1039
01:10:52,000 --> 01:10:53,673
After all, it's 50 years ago.

1040
01:10:54,760 --> 01:10:56,080
Mr. Haghighi said

1041
01:10:56,240 --> 01:10:58,277
that age wasn't an issue,

1042
01:10:58,480 --> 01:10:59,480
that I knew best

1043
01:10:59,640 --> 01:11:01,393
what had happened in that room.

1044
01:11:01,760 --> 01:11:03,194
The age of the interrogator

1045
01:11:03,400 --> 01:11:05,756
in the film wasn't important to me.

1046
01:11:05,960 --> 01:11:07,519
But having a real person

1047
01:11:07,720 --> 01:11:10,872
play himself fifty years later

1048
01:11:11,080 --> 01:11:12,833
was very appealing.

1049
01:11:13,200 --> 01:11:15,351
All I could do back then was let them know

1050
01:11:15,560 --> 01:11:17,153
that they were in danger:

1051
01:11:17,400 --> 01:11:19,153
they were being taken to their deaths.

1052
01:11:19,360 --> 01:11:21,875
I sadly couldn't help Mr. Haghighi.

1053
01:11:22,080 --> 01:11:24,072
I don't really know what happened next.

1054
01:11:24,240 --> 01:11:26,835
Perhaps Shahrzad Besharat knows.

1055
01:11:27,400 --> 01:11:29,278
Hozvaresh had five members.

1056
01:11:29,480 --> 01:11:30,596
One was Saeed Jahangiri,

1057
01:11:30,840 --> 01:11:32,718
who's still alive.

1058
01:11:32,880 --> 01:11:34,633
One was Babak Hafizi,

1059
01:11:34,800 --> 01:11:36,598
whose fate is unknown.

1060
01:11:37,240 --> 01:11:40,074
Two members were Isfahan agents.

1061
01:11:40,280 --> 01:11:42,749
They were Morudijan und Peyman Hariri.

1062
01:11:43,080 --> 01:11:45,675
But I believe the most important person

1063
01:11:45,880 --> 01:11:47,758
was Shahrzad Besharat.

1064
01:11:48,240 --> 01:11:52,075
She turned her back on politics

1065
01:11:52,280 --> 01:11:54,556
and worked in theater.

1066
01:11:56,160 --> 01:12:01,872
She worked with well-known directors.

1067
01:12:02,240 --> 01:12:04,994
In '67 and '68 I no longer had

1068
01:12:05,200 --> 01:12:07,920
a connection to the Agency.

1069
01:12:09,160 --> 01:12:11,994
I spent my time with theater people.

1070
01:12:12,200 --> 01:12:14,157
I was a stage assistant

1071
01:12:14,360 --> 01:12:17,671
and sometimes played small parts.

1072
01:12:18,640 --> 01:12:23,317
In '68, Abbas Nalbandian's play

1073
01:12:23,760 --> 01:12:28,551
won the National Radio and TV Award

1074
01:12:28,760 --> 01:12:31,355
for the best script.

1075
01:12:32,080 --> 01:12:34,197
The play's title was:

1076
01:12:34,520 --> 01:12:39,231
""A Deep, Vast and New Insight

1077
01:12:39,640 --> 01:12:40,960
into Fossils of

1078
01:12:41,120 --> 01:12:43,396
the 25th Geological Cycle.""

1079
01:12:43,960 --> 01:12:46,350
On the opening night

1080
01:12:46,560 --> 01:12:48,199
everything changed for me.

1081
01:12:48,400 --> 01:12:50,676
There is a secret between you all.

1082
01:12:56,280 --> 01:12:59,034
Oh you thieves!

1083
01:13:00,560 --> 01:13:02,791
You have stolen his scent.

1084
01:13:03,040 --> 01:13:04,952
You have stolen a proud breeze

1085
01:13:05,160 --> 01:13:06,719
bearing his scent.

1086
01:13:06,920 --> 01:13:08,320
What are you saying?

1087
01:13:08,520 --> 01:13:10,671
Our patience is at an end!

1088
01:13:25,560 --> 01:13:27,711
We have packed our belongings.

1089
01:13:32,600 --> 01:13:35,240
Are you seeking someone?

1090
01:13:39,240 --> 01:13:41,994
You seem like an absolute stranger.

1091
01:13:45,120 --> 01:13:46,873
Are you seeking a woman?

1092
01:13:47,080 --> 01:13:50,471
How pained you look!

1093
01:13:50,680 --> 01:13:53,149
As if you haven't rested in months

1094
01:13:53,360 --> 01:13:55,591
in a woman's warm bed.

1095
01:14:09,080 --> 01:14:13,438
Fog fills and empties the stage.

1096
01:14:22,320 --> 01:14:27,634
<i>Oh trace of the holy One</i>

1097
01:14:28,000 --> 01:14:32,870
<i>Why do you flee from us?</i>

1098
01:14:33,080 --> 01:14:38,394
<i>You know the fate of your devotees</i>

1099
01:14:38,600 --> 01:14:42,879
<i>From the other world</i>

1100
01:14:43,880 --> 01:14:48,557
<i>For the sake of my warm tears</i>

1101
01:14:48,720 --> 01:14:53,715
<i>For the sake of my ashen face</i>

1102
01:14:56,440 --> 01:14:57,556
Behnam?

1103
01:14:58,480 --> 01:14:59,630
Hello.

1104
01:15:00,280 --> 01:15:03,159
Shahrzad, I have to tell you something.

1105
01:15:03,360 --> 01:15:04,760
Say nothing, ask nothing.

1106
01:15:04,960 --> 01:15:06,519
- Where is Keyvan?
- Listen to me.

1107
01:15:06,720 --> 01:15:08,632
I've found a way to leave Iran.

1108
01:15:08,840 --> 01:15:10,194
They're waiting for me below.

1109
01:15:10,360 --> 01:15:12,591
- Where is Keyvan?
- I know where he is.

1110
01:15:12,800 --> 01:15:14,120
I'll tell you,

1111
01:15:14,320 --> 01:15:15,754
but first you have to listen to me.

1112
01:15:15,960 --> 01:15:17,394
Tell Keyvan the following.

1113
01:15:17,560 --> 01:15:19,279
Will you listen?

1114
01:15:19,440 --> 01:15:21,477
Tell him everything's in Halimeh's grave.

1115
01:15:21,680 --> 01:15:23,080
- Meaning what?
- Do you understand?

1116
01:15:23,240 --> 01:15:24,240
Repeat it.

1117
01:15:24,440 --> 01:15:27,035
- Everything is in Halimeh's grave.
- Good.

1118
01:15:27,240 --> 01:15:28,879
What did you all do on Qeshm?

1119
01:15:29,200 --> 01:15:31,795
The less you know the better.

1120
01:15:32,160 --> 01:15:34,959
Keyvan is in Isfahan...

1121
01:15:35,160 --> 01:15:36,913
They might follow you. Be careful.

1122
01:15:37,120 --> 01:15:38,918
I'm crossing the border tomorrow.

1123
01:15:39,560 --> 01:15:41,199
Give me 24 hours.

1124
01:15:41,440 --> 01:15:42,635
Go to Isfahan tomorrow night.

1125
01:15:42,840 --> 01:15:43,990
Give Keyvan the message.

1126
01:15:44,840 --> 01:15:46,320
He'll follow you.

1127
01:15:46,520 --> 01:15:47,590
Repeat the sentence again.

1128
01:15:48,400 --> 01:15:49,993
Everything is in Halimeh's grave.

1129
01:16:52,480 --> 01:16:53,630
Behnam!

1130
01:16:56,480 --> 01:16:58,870
Hide it in Halimeh's grave!

1131
01:17:00,120 --> 01:17:01,998
A can of baby formula, please.

1132
01:17:08,200 --> 01:17:09,714
Excuse me.

1133
01:17:09,880 --> 01:17:11,758
You dropped this.

1134
01:17:18,160 --> 01:17:20,550
<i>Everything is in Halimeh's grave.</i>

1135
01:18:10,800 --> 01:18:12,598
<i>When he got back from Qeshm,</i>

1136
01:18:12,800 --> 01:18:14,075
<i>he visited me.</i>

1137
01:18:15,120 --> 01:18:17,680
<i>I'd waited for him for three years,</i>

1138
01:18:18,920 --> 01:18:21,196
<i>but now I didn't want to see him.</i>

1139
01:18:21,760 --> 01:18:24,036
<i>I was scared of him.</i>

1140
01:18:26,120 --> 01:18:29,113
<i>In the box that he had found</i>

1141
01:18:29,640 --> 01:18:32,155
<i>were some negatives.</i>

1142
01:18:32,680 --> 01:18:35,752
<i>He asked me if I could get him</i>

1143
01:18:35,960 --> 01:18:39,510
<i>the keys to the Golestan Studio.</i>

1144
01:18:40,680 --> 01:18:43,320
<i>He wanted to develop the negatives</i>

1145
01:18:43,520 --> 01:18:46,877
<i>in the darkroom there.</i>

1146
01:18:48,200 --> 01:18:52,114
<i>That was the last time I saw him.</i>

1147
01:18:55,520 --> 01:18:57,876
- Were you followed?
- No.

1148
01:18:59,240 --> 01:19:00,799
Are you going out?

1149
01:19:03,760 --> 01:19:05,160
What did Behnam say exactly?

1150
01:19:05,360 --> 01:19:06,360
I already told you.

1151
01:19:06,600 --> 01:19:08,751
He said everything is in Halimeh's grave.

1152
01:19:08,960 --> 01:19:10,280
Is that all?

1153
01:19:10,880 --> 01:19:12,872
There's nothing in this box.

1154
01:19:13,640 --> 01:19:15,472
The negatives are all destroyed,

1155
01:19:15,640 --> 01:19:17,359
the rest are just souvenir pictures.

1156
01:19:17,520 --> 01:19:19,716
- Take a look.
- I don't want to see.

1157
01:19:23,360 --> 01:19:25,477
A piece of bone,

1158
01:19:25,680 --> 01:19:27,080
""Paradise"",

1159
01:19:28,120 --> 01:19:30,589
Behnam's notes are all destroyed.

1160
01:19:32,480 --> 01:19:34,711
What was I to find here?

1161
01:19:34,920 --> 01:19:37,071
He didn't want you to give up on the case.

1162
01:19:37,240 --> 01:19:39,277
You are to finish what he couldn't.

1163
01:19:41,960 --> 01:19:44,031
Did he tell you anything else?

1164
01:19:46,080 --> 01:19:48,834
Did he say what happened to us that night?

1165
01:19:49,080 --> 01:19:51,720
He said it's better I don't know.

1166
01:19:52,440 --> 01:19:53,874
Sit down a minute.

1167
01:19:54,040 --> 01:19:55,440
They're waiting for me.

1168
01:19:55,640 --> 01:19:56,756
Sit.

1169
01:20:15,080 --> 01:20:17,117
I don't want to know anything.

1170
01:20:18,160 --> 01:20:19,833
They arrested all of us,

1171
01:20:20,040 --> 01:20:21,360
harassed us.

1172
01:20:22,120 --> 01:20:24,589
Jahangiri is still in jail.

1173
01:20:24,760 --> 01:20:26,638
I didn't say a thing.

1174
01:20:27,160 --> 01:20:30,358
But now I want to go. I want to live.

1175
01:20:32,080 --> 01:20:34,311
Are you going so as to now live?

1176
01:20:38,680 --> 01:20:41,752
- Did you speak to your source?
- Yes.

1177
01:20:42,560 --> 01:20:45,120
He didn't know a thing about the cemetery,

1178
01:20:45,320 --> 01:20:47,073
except they'd excavated something

1179
01:20:47,280 --> 01:20:48,350
after you all left.

1180
01:20:48,600 --> 01:20:50,876
- What?
- He didn't know.

1181
01:20:51,080 --> 01:20:53,356
A living thing. A creature.

1182
01:20:53,920 --> 01:20:55,991
He asked me to tell you to leave it be.

1183
01:20:56,200 --> 01:20:58,317
You can't find out anything else...

1184
01:20:59,480 --> 01:21:01,597
you have no possibilities.

1185
01:21:01,800 --> 01:21:03,951
He said they're still after you.

1186
01:21:04,120 --> 01:21:06,191
Whatever you did there

1187
01:21:06,680 --> 01:21:08,353
is still a serious issue for them.

1188
01:21:09,160 --> 01:21:11,470
He showed me a thick file

1189
01:21:12,200 --> 01:21:14,192
on your activities at the cemetery.

1190
01:21:15,960 --> 01:21:18,156
He made an allusion.

1191
01:21:18,400 --> 01:21:21,040
They obviously knew of Behnam's escape.

1192
01:21:21,560 --> 01:21:23,358
He's in Europe.

1193
01:21:23,640 --> 01:21:26,200
He went to Aachen for a few days,

1194
01:21:27,440 --> 01:21:28,590
stayed with old schoolmates.

1195
01:21:28,800 --> 01:21:30,598
Then he disappeared again.

1196
01:21:32,160 --> 01:21:34,834
He just wanted to show he could escape.

1197
01:21:35,680 --> 01:21:37,080
My source says

1198
01:21:37,280 --> 01:21:39,237
you should pretend to escape.

1199
01:21:42,680 --> 01:21:44,478
I won't run away.

1200
01:21:46,040 --> 01:21:47,156
Write me a letter.

1201
01:21:47,480 --> 01:21:49,312
In your own handwriting.

1202
01:21:49,520 --> 01:21:51,830
They read my letters. All of them.

1203
01:21:52,720 --> 01:21:54,234
I'll find a way to have

1204
01:21:54,400 --> 01:21:55,675
it sent from abroad.

1205
01:21:57,280 --> 01:21:58,794
It's easy.

1206
01:21:59,000 --> 01:22:00,320
This way they'll read the letter

1207
01:22:00,520 --> 01:22:02,876
and think you've also escaped.

1208
01:22:03,240 --> 01:22:04,640
Shahrzad...

1209
01:22:05,760 --> 01:22:07,797
I want to be with you.

1210
01:22:09,640 --> 01:22:11,677
I won't write a letter.

1211
01:22:13,520 --> 01:22:14,520
What?

1212
01:22:15,000 --> 01:22:17,071
I didn't hear from you for three years!

1213
01:22:17,440 --> 01:22:19,113
Everyone thought you were dead.

1214
01:22:19,320 --> 01:22:20,959
They were looking for your corpse.

1215
01:22:21,320 --> 01:22:23,312
I've left you, Keyvan.

1216
01:22:23,520 --> 01:22:25,432
You need to understand this.

1217
01:22:25,640 --> 01:22:28,474
- Understand me.
- No, you understand me!

1218
01:22:32,640 --> 01:22:33,790
Very well.

1219
01:22:34,000 --> 01:22:35,354
There's paper there.

1220
01:22:35,560 --> 01:22:37,040
I'll put myself in your place.

1221
01:22:37,240 --> 01:22:38,720
Write.

1222
01:22:39,480 --> 01:22:42,200
April 5, 1969.

1223
01:22:44,040 --> 01:22:46,077
Dear Shahrzad. Hello.

1224
01:22:46,960 --> 01:22:48,872
I hope you're well.

1225
01:22:49,080 --> 01:22:50,833
- Write!
- I'll write it myself.

1226
01:22:57,760 --> 01:23:00,275
April 5, 1969.

1227
01:23:03,960 --> 01:23:05,713
Dear Shahrzad.

1228
01:23:07,080 --> 01:23:08,309
Hello.

1229
01:23:11,240 --> 01:23:13,391
I hope you're well.

1230
01:23:15,600 --> 01:23:18,513
I hope you're as radiant as your smile.

1231
01:23:20,520 --> 01:23:23,035
I hope your smile is like the one

1232
01:23:23,240 --> 01:23:25,357
I dreamt of for three long years.

1233
01:23:26,520 --> 01:23:29,194
This is the beginning of a penance for me.

1234
01:23:29,400 --> 01:23:31,198
I never got the chance...

1235
01:23:33,640 --> 01:23:35,916
Life didn't give me the chance

1236
01:23:36,120 --> 01:23:37,839
to say goodbye to you.

1237
01:23:38,040 --> 01:23:39,633
Face to face.

1238
01:23:44,440 --> 01:23:46,193
They didn't give me the chance

1239
01:23:46,400 --> 01:23:48,437
to embrace you,

1240
01:23:52,080 --> 01:23:54,959
to tuck your hair behind your ears,

1241
01:23:58,160 --> 01:23:59,958
to kiss you,

1242
01:24:04,560 --> 01:24:06,597
to look at you,

1243
01:24:07,560 --> 01:24:09,597
and say: ""Shahrzad,

1244
01:24:12,800 --> 01:24:14,598
my dearest Shahrzad,

1245
01:24:18,200 --> 01:24:19,759
my love,

1246
01:24:21,760 --> 01:24:23,160
my lady,

1247
01:24:27,960 --> 01:24:29,713
I'm gone.

1248
01:24:31,120 --> 01:24:33,316
Gone, never to come back.

1249
01:24:36,400 --> 01:24:37,720
Goodbye.""

1250
01:24:40,000 --> 01:24:41,070
Stop filming.

1251
01:24:41,280 --> 01:24:42,555
Or she'll kick us out.

1252
01:24:42,760 --> 01:24:45,150
Don't worry. We'll ask permission first.

1253
01:24:45,360 --> 01:24:48,876
- Ask her first.
- That's the doorbell.

1254
01:24:53,440 --> 01:24:54,440
<i>Hello?</i>

1255
01:24:54,640 --> 01:24:57,235
<i>- Mr. Haghighi sent us.
- Come in.</i>

1256
01:24:59,760 --> 01:25:01,240
The shoot

1257
01:25:01,440 --> 01:25:03,557
was interrupted for nine months

1258
01:25:03,760 --> 01:25:06,832
because Jahangiri and Shahrzad didn't know

1259
01:25:07,040 --> 01:25:09,271
what had become of those three.

1260
01:25:09,480 --> 01:25:12,791
I was stuck, not sure what to do.

1261
01:25:13,000 --> 01:25:14,878
Until one morning

1262
01:25:15,080 --> 01:25:17,914
when I was checking messages at work,

1263
01:25:18,120 --> 01:25:20,589
I heard a message from a woman

1264
01:25:20,800 --> 01:25:23,679
saying she knew we were making a movie

1265
01:25:24,040 --> 01:25:25,713
and that she could help us.

1266
01:25:25,920 --> 01:25:27,320
Back then we received

1267
01:25:27,480 --> 01:25:28,994
many messages like that,

1268
01:25:29,200 --> 01:25:31,396
so I didn't take it too seriously.

1269
01:25:31,600 --> 01:25:34,434
I sent my assistants to check it out.

1270
01:25:36,480 --> 01:25:38,631
I found this among my father's things.

1271
01:25:40,560 --> 01:25:43,314
There was a note on it saying

1272
01:25:43,480 --> 01:25:46,678
if anyone came asking about this affair,

1273
01:25:46,880 --> 01:25:48,473
I should hand it to them.

1274
01:25:48,920 --> 01:25:51,754
I read that you were making a movie

1275
01:25:52,000 --> 01:25:53,320
about three young men

1276
01:25:53,520 --> 01:25:57,434
doing research at a cemetery in 1964.

1277
01:25:58,320 --> 01:25:59,913
I thought this must be it.

1278
01:26:03,120 --> 01:26:05,680
- Your father...
- Keyvan Haddad.

1279
01:26:05,880 --> 01:26:07,519
But he didn't have a wife or kids.

1280
01:26:07,880 --> 01:26:09,280
We researched this.

1281
01:26:09,480 --> 01:26:11,711
No he didn't. My father never married.

1282
01:26:11,920 --> 01:26:13,274
He adopted me.

1283
01:26:14,080 --> 01:26:16,914
- So you must be Valieh?
- That's right.

1284
01:26:17,480 --> 01:26:19,437
- Did your father pass away?
- Yes...

1285
01:26:19,640 --> 01:26:21,120
in the '87 rocket attacks,

1286
01:26:21,280 --> 01:26:22,280
along with my son.

1287
01:26:26,680 --> 01:26:28,399
Here's the envelope.

1288
01:26:43,120 --> 01:26:44,395
<i>Testing.</i>

1289
01:26:45,960 --> 01:26:47,189
<i>One, two three...</i>

1290
01:26:48,520 --> 01:26:49,556
<i>Okay.</i>

1291
01:26:50,560 --> 01:26:51,835
<i>Tehran,</i>

1292
01:26:53,120 --> 01:26:55,635
<i>December 22, 1982,</i>

1293
01:26:56,760 --> 01:26:59,229
<i>3:45 pm.</i>

1294
01:27:00,320 --> 01:27:02,198
<i>I'm sitting in front of it.</i>

1295
01:27:02,440 --> 01:27:04,397
<i>I've loved silence all my life,</i>

1296
01:27:04,760 --> 01:27:06,638
<i>but I'm hoping for a sound now...</i>

1297
01:27:07,640 --> 01:27:09,916
<i>so you'll believe it exists.</i>

1298
01:27:11,440 --> 01:27:12,920
<i>Believe that it's in front</i>

1299
01:27:13,080 --> 01:27:14,080
<i>of me right now,</i>

1300
01:27:14,200 --> 01:27:16,032
<i>this old dragon.</i>

1301
01:27:17,160 --> 01:27:19,914
<i>I've been looking for it for 20 years.</i>

1302
01:27:20,280 --> 01:27:22,476
<i>I finally found it today.</i>

1303
01:27:22,680 --> 01:27:24,831
<i>In a dark cell, right here in Tehran.</i>

1304
01:27:25,720 --> 01:27:27,154
<i>Once it was able</i>

1305
01:27:27,360 --> 01:27:30,000
<i>to shake an entire cemetery,</i>

1306
01:27:30,200 --> 01:27:33,079
<i>crack the earth and spill out its guts.</i>

1307
01:27:33,280 --> 01:27:35,112
<i>I saw it with my own eyes.</i>

1308
01:27:35,440 --> 01:27:37,159
<i>But now it can't move.</i>

1309
01:27:37,360 --> 01:27:39,591
<i>Its breath is silent.</i>

1310
01:27:40,960 --> 01:27:43,429
<i>A huge snake that just looks at me.</i>

1311
01:27:43,840 --> 01:27:46,150
<i>It slowly blinks once in a while.</i>

1312
01:27:46,320 --> 01:27:48,277
<i>Too bad I don't have a gun.</i>

1313
01:27:49,720 --> 01:27:51,837
<i>I'd shoot five bullets in its head</i>

1314
01:27:52,040 --> 01:27:53,394
<i>and release it.</i>

1315
01:27:53,600 --> 01:27:56,195
<i>But all I have is this flimsy microphone.</i>

1316
01:27:56,400 --> 01:27:58,915
<i>You wouldn't even believe me</i>

1317
01:27:59,120 --> 01:28:01,396
<i>if it made a sound I could record.</i>

1318
01:28:01,600 --> 01:28:03,831
<i>Nor even if you were to see it.</i>

1319
01:28:04,040 --> 01:28:06,316
<i>You'd think you were dreaming.</i>

1320
01:28:06,880 --> 01:28:08,280
<i>Maybe I'm dreaming, too.</i>

1321
01:28:12,000 --> 01:28:14,993
<i>My problem is that I know.</i>

1322
01:28:15,160 --> 01:28:17,595
<i>I know I'm awake.</i>

1323
01:28:18,000 --> 01:28:20,640
<i>I know it's here in front of me</i>

1324
01:28:20,840 --> 01:28:23,355
<i>and I can only listen to its silence.</i>

1325
01:28:24,680 --> 01:28:26,717
<i>For God knows how long.</i>

1326
01:28:34,480 --> 01:28:36,949
There's nothing else on this side.

1327
01:28:37,160 --> 01:28:38,992
Just absolute silence.

1328
01:28:39,160 --> 01:28:42,073
But this is the B side,

1329
01:28:42,280 --> 01:28:45,432
and what you might not notice at first

1330
01:28:45,640 --> 01:28:46,835
is that it's labeled:

1331
01:28:47,360 --> 01:28:49,591
""He who turns me over

1332
01:28:49,760 --> 01:28:52,116
will know my secret.""

1333
01:29:03,760 --> 01:29:05,592
<i>They separated us.</i>

1334
01:29:05,800 --> 01:29:08,793
<i>Took us separately to be interrogated.</i>

1335
01:29:09,000 --> 01:29:10,480
<i>Then they'd take us out again</i>

1336
01:29:10,840 --> 01:29:12,559
<i>and take another one in.</i>

1337
01:29:12,720 --> 01:29:15,792
<i>Suddenly Charaki came and said:</i>

1338
01:29:16,000 --> 01:29:18,117
<i>""We're to take you to Tehran.""</i>

1339
01:29:19,080 --> 01:29:21,470
Jahangiri, forget about this stuff.

1340
01:29:21,680 --> 01:29:22,875
What was going on down there?

1341
01:29:23,240 --> 01:29:25,197
I ask the questions and you answer them.

1342
01:29:25,600 --> 01:29:26,875
Saeed!

1343
01:29:28,760 --> 01:29:30,592
- Don't ask questions.
- What do you mean?

1344
01:29:30,840 --> 01:29:32,513
- Listen.
- What's going on here?

1345
01:29:32,680 --> 01:29:33,680
It's serious.

1346
01:29:33,800 --> 01:29:35,519
They'll soon know who we are.

1347
01:29:35,720 --> 01:29:37,598
Excuse me, Major, orders from Tehran:

1348
01:29:37,800 --> 01:29:40,031
We transfer them immediately.

1349
01:29:40,240 --> 01:29:41,674
The ferry is waiting at the port.

1350
01:29:41,880 --> 01:29:42,880
Get up!

1351
01:29:43,040 --> 01:29:44,599
This is an interrogation room.

1352
01:29:44,760 --> 01:29:45,760
I'm working.

1353
01:29:46,040 --> 01:29:48,271
Orders from the head of the Agency.

1354
01:29:48,480 --> 01:29:50,312
Get up, Mr. Hafizi.

1355
01:29:51,040 --> 01:29:52,918
I'm talking to you! Get up!

1356
01:30:00,440 --> 01:30:02,557
I forgot my glasses in there.

1357
01:30:04,520 --> 01:30:06,830
He says he forgot his glasses in there.

1358
01:30:07,040 --> 01:30:09,396
Tell him to come in. He has to sign this.

1359
01:30:09,800 --> 01:30:10,916
Go in.

1360
01:30:18,840 --> 01:30:20,399
Sign this.

1361
01:30:27,720 --> 01:30:28,915
Sign here.

1362
01:35:55,800 --> 01:35:56,916
What's he saying?

1363
01:36:01,280 --> 01:36:03,749
He says we left something behind.

1364
01:36:03,960 --> 01:36:05,155
What?

1365
01:36:13,320 --> 01:36:14,834
Valieh!

1366
01:36:16,520 --> 01:36:17,590
We have to go back!

1367
01:36:17,800 --> 01:36:19,757
We left Valieh behind!

1368
01:36:56,960 --> 01:36:58,519
Should I go?

1369
01:36:59,960 --> 01:37:01,076
I'll go.

1370
01:37:01,520 --> 01:37:02,520
Give it to me.

1371
01:38:08,440 --> 01:38:10,955
You got my message.

1372
01:38:11,200 --> 01:38:12,200
I was waiting for you.

1373
01:38:14,080 --> 01:38:16,072
Give me the gun and take the baby.

1374
01:39:03,600 --> 01:39:05,512
<i>She gave me her granddaughter</i>

1375
01:39:05,720 --> 01:39:06,949
<i>and took Babak's gun.</i>

1376
01:39:08,320 --> 01:39:10,437
<i>She fired five bullets</i>

1377
01:39:11,640 --> 01:39:13,313
<i>and killed Almas in his sleep.</i>

1378
01:39:15,320 --> 01:39:16,320
<i>I never found out</i>

1379
01:39:16,520 --> 01:39:18,671
<i>what she did with the sixth bullet.</i>

1380
01:39:20,960 --> 01:39:23,316
<i>When I got in the car, Behnam said:</i>

1381
01:39:24,000 --> 01:39:25,320
<i>""He's gone.""</i>

1382
01:39:27,120 --> 01:39:29,112
<i>I turned around.</i>

1383
01:39:30,640 --> 01:39:32,711
<i>Babak was dead.</i>

1384
01:39:34,200 --> 01:39:36,476
<i>His eyes were still open.</i>

1385
01:39:37,960 --> 01:39:40,429
<i>They shone in the light of the fire.</i>

1386
01:39:42,720 --> 01:39:44,837
<i>There was no time to bury him.</i>

1387
01:39:49,000 --> 01:39:50,992
<i>We drove to the gulf.</i>

You're too big for such games.

29
00:05:04,879 --> 00:05:06,439
I'm not too big.

30
00:06:05,839 --> 00:06:08,500
Go home. Your mother is probably waiting.

31
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:10,100
Hurry up!

32
00:06:27,199 --> 00:06:29,560
It's a very old coin.

33
00:06:30,839 --> 00:06:32,339
I found it one day.

34
00:06:34,879 --> 00:06:36,379
Take it, Milka.

35
00:07:10,319 --> 00:07:12,079
Why are you back so late?

36
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:15,997
I was about to go look for you.

37
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:24,001
Get some bread and butter
from the cupboard.

38
00:07:29,319 --> 00:07:30,994
What's that in your hand?

39
00:07:36,759 --> 00:07:38,259
Show me.

40
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:43,620
Very well.

41
00:07:45,279 --> 00:07:46,779
Go to bed.

42
00:08:43,759 --> 00:08:46,639
You're so big.

43
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:50,620
<i>Oh, Lord!</i>

44
00:08:51,559 --> 00:08:55,440
<i>It feels like a sharp thorn
is hurting my heart.</i>

45
00:08:56,639 --> 00:08:58,279
<i>Remove it, oh Lord.</i>

46
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:01,049
<i>Don't lead me to suffering.</i>

47
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:05,082
<i>Protect me, so I don't have to
burn with shame.</i>

48
00:09:05,919 --> 00:09:07,519
<i>Enlighten me, oh Lord.</i>

49
00:09:23,559 --> 00:09:25,279
It's good that it rains.

50
00:09:27,679 --> 00:09:29,179
Rain rinses the earth,

51
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:31,820
cleans it.

52
00:09:35,919 --> 00:09:37,419
If there was no rain

53
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:40,039
there would be no sun.

54
00:09:44,759 --> 00:09:47,200
Everything's connected.

55
00:09:49,799 --> 00:09:51,299
One thing

56
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:53,620
depends on the other.

57
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:19,986
Did you have time to tell your mother?

58
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:21,700
No, I didn't.

59
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:28,559
Mother sends me.
- Mother!

60
00:10:29,799 --> 00:10:31,299
Are you sure?

61
00:10:34,159 --> 00:10:36,638
She doesn't know what to do with hay.

62
00:10:37,919 --> 00:10:39,862
It'll rot with all that rain.

63
00:10:40,759 --> 00:10:43,171
Nothing we can do. We can't haul it.

64
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,559
We have to wait.

65
00:10:53,519 --> 00:10:55,529
Why don't you repair the roof?

66
00:10:58,519 --> 00:11:01,559
Rain doesn't fall in, sun doesn't burn.

67
00:11:07,240 --> 00:11:08,740
Rain does fall in.

68
00:11:28,919 --> 00:11:30,419
Take it, Milka.

69
00:11:36,039 --> 00:11:37,539
It's pretty.

70
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:01,795
What are you waiting for?

71
00:12:01,919 --> 00:12:04,331
I'll wait. Maybe it'll stop raining.

72
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:07,820
It won't.

73
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:12,661
Who do you make it for?

74
00:12:14,759 --> 00:12:16,259
For sale.

75
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:22,220
Can I stay here until it stops
raining so I don't get wet?

76
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:23,820
You can't.

77
00:12:29,759 --> 00:12:31,259
So I'm going.

78
00:13:09,519 --> 00:13:11,019
Why are you mad?

79
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:14,580
I long for my father.

80
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:19,240
Your father rests in peace.

81
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:21,020
Don't be sad.

82
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:22,620
It won't do any good.

83
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:25,919
Such end awaits us all.

84
00:14:48,399 --> 00:14:49,899
You can do it.

85
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:52,100
If you want to.

86
00:15:02,759 --> 00:15:04,501
You don't like me anymore?

87
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:36,860
Milka!

88
00:15:37,679 --> 00:15:39,240
Come to dinner!

89
00:16:07,039 --> 00:16:08,539
Wait.

90
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:11,980
I will be your wife.

91
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:14,661
I care for no one else.

92
00:16:15,279 --> 00:16:18,279
You're still so young. You have time.

93
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:21,786
You will meet another man. A good man.

94
00:16:23,480 --> 00:16:26,900
I don't want you. I want to
keep living without a wife.

95
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,608
That suits me perfectly.

96
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:36,240
<i>My chest is on fire
which cannot be doused.</i>

97
00:16:37,919 --> 00:16:40,264
<i>I shall not ask it to stop burning.</i>

98
00:16:41,879 --> 00:16:43,220
<i>Oh, Lord...</i>

99
00:16:43,320 --> 00:16:45,600
<i>please let it burn.</i>

100
00:17:52,279 --> 00:17:53,880
Goodbye.

101
00:18:15,079 --> 00:18:18,119
Milka! Try on your dress.

102
00:18:29,599 --> 00:18:31,960
Take a walk.

103
00:18:39,079 --> 00:18:40,579
You are very pretty.

104
00:18:43,480 --> 00:18:45,691
Maybe I shouldn't be saying that.

105
00:18:47,759 --> 00:18:50,238
Take it off. It still needs altering.

106
00:18:51,640 --> 00:18:54,240
You'll wear it in the spring.

107
00:20:50,319 --> 00:20:54,406
Krystian, take back the buggy
and say thank you on our behalf.

108
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:56,220
May I go with him?

109
00:20:56,920 --> 00:20:58,420
You may.

110
00:20:58,599 --> 00:21:01,145
Just be careful not to soil the dress.

111
00:21:21,079 --> 00:21:23,440
If you were my little daughter.

112
00:21:26,039 --> 00:21:27,982
I'd make you a pretty cradle.

113
00:21:29,920 --> 00:21:31,680
I'd keep you warm.

114
00:21:34,279 --> 00:21:35,779
Rock you to sleep,

115
00:21:36,440 --> 00:21:37,940
sing you songs.

116
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:42,460
You'd be happy.

117
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:48,182
Someone would remember me.

118
00:21:50,319 --> 00:21:51,839
Even after I'm gone.

119
00:21:53,759 --> 00:21:56,359
I will never love anyone but you.

120
00:22:57,680 --> 00:22:59,180
Come.

121
00:23:07,559 --> 00:23:09,059
It's time for you.

122
00:23:11,039 --> 00:23:12,539
Leave.

123
00:23:54,759 --> 00:23:56,501
I'll leave the meadow now.

124
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:59,345
I'll make you two something to eat.

125
00:24:22,440 --> 00:24:23,940
Milka!

126
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:28,742
Don't you like me anymore?

127
00:24:33,799 --> 00:24:35,299
I love you.

128
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:55,799
I've talked to Krystian.

129
00:25:56,839 --> 00:25:59,251
He'll help us renovate the new room.

130
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:02,220
And you know what?

131
00:26:03,880 --> 00:26:06,091
He doesn't want any money for it.

132
00:26:09,279 --> 00:26:11,155
Will I get a room of my own?

133
00:26:13,640 --> 00:26:15,140
You will.

134
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:13,544
Till the renovations are over...

135
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:25,091
Krystian will be staying with us.

136
00:27:25,680 --> 00:27:28,092
No need for him to walk all this way

137
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:30,730
just to return in the morning.

138
00:28:31,319 --> 00:28:32,839
Can I live here?

139
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:37,380
Not just yet.

140
00:28:42,359 --> 00:28:43,859
There is still time.

141
00:28:52,119 --> 00:28:54,200
Maybe you'll move in next year?

142
00:29:21,880 --> 00:29:24,640
You aren't the town's

143
00:29:25,279 --> 00:29:26,779
organist anymore?

144
00:29:27,279 --> 00:29:28,779
No.

145
00:29:29,480 --> 00:29:31,691
After my wife died, I quit my job

146
00:29:32,519 --> 00:29:34,998
and came back here where I come from.

147
00:29:47,920 --> 00:29:50,265
Krystian brought the rocking chair.

148
00:29:50,599 --> 00:29:52,480
He was repairing it for you?

149
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:55,119
I've made it. It's brand new.

150
00:29:57,200 --> 00:29:59,344
And I'll be the first to try it.

151
00:30:05,240 --> 00:30:06,740
Is it comfortable?

152
00:30:07,920 --> 00:30:09,420
Can I try?

153
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:26,880
You brought the chair

154
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,144
and now it's time for you to go.

155
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:33,707
I have a matter to discuss with the lady.

156
00:30:55,440 --> 00:30:56,940
I will think about it.

157
00:30:57,440 --> 00:30:59,584
It's hard to decide on the spot.

158
00:31:00,920 --> 00:31:02,620
I'll give you my answer in a month.

159
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:05,739
Such an important step
must be considered properly.

160
00:31:05,839 --> 00:31:07,759
I'll be waiting impatiently.

161
00:31:09,319 --> 00:31:12,359
I hope I'll find your answer satisfying.

162
00:31:13,640 --> 00:31:15,315
If the good Lord permits!

163
00:31:18,400 --> 00:31:19,900
Milka,

164
00:31:20,440 --> 00:31:23,455
what would you say
if I was to be your father?

165
00:31:27,039 --> 00:31:28,920
Goodbye, sir.

166
00:32:30,200 --> 00:32:32,720
It's late.

167
00:32:33,680 --> 00:32:35,180
Not that late.

168
00:32:41,759 --> 00:32:44,104
Mother was angry with the organist.

169
00:32:45,119 --> 00:32:46,619
Don't talk about it.

170
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:50,700
Come to see us.

171
00:32:51,319 --> 00:32:52,819
I will, I will.

172
00:32:54,799 --> 00:32:58,160
Your mother wants
to thank me for the chair.

173
00:32:59,240 --> 00:33:00,740
It is beautiful.

174
00:33:05,519 --> 00:33:07,880
I've made it for you.

175
00:33:39,359 --> 00:33:40,859
I love you.

176
00:33:45,240 --> 00:33:46,740
I!

177
00:33:47,559 --> 00:33:49,059
!love you, too.

178
00:33:56,839 --> 00:33:59,160
Aren't you cold?

179
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:26,960
I know you want it.

180
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:28,940
And you don't?

181
00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:36,480
I can! handle it.

182
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:40,780
I won't die from it.

183
00:34:59,360 --> 00:35:01,800
You've been gone a long time.

184
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:05,820
He is not angry.

185
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:11,770
He'll come to see us tomorrow.

186
00:35:12,719 --> 00:35:14,219
See?

187
00:35:14,679 --> 00:35:16,179
He is a good man.

188
00:35:18,920 --> 00:35:20,800
Better than the organist.

189
00:38:10,039 --> 00:38:11,539
<i>Oh, Lord!</i>

190
00:38:13,239 --> 00:38:14,840
<i>Protect me from evil.</i>

191
00:38:16,519 --> 00:38:18,119
<i>You can do it,</i>

192
00:38:18,559 --> 00:38:21,574
<i>for everything happens
according to your will.</i>

193
00:39:09,159 --> 00:39:11,960
Maybe I'll get married soon.

194
00:39:13,679 --> 00:39:15,559
Maybe we'll have a baby.

195
00:39:17,559 --> 00:39:19,059
A brother for you.

196
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:26,665
You're thinking about the organist?

197
00:39:28,039 --> 00:39:30,519
No. I won't be accepting him.

198
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:34,008
I'll get someone better.

199
00:39:37,119 --> 00:39:39,464
Though only God knows if I get him.

200
00:40:20,199 --> 00:40:21,699
So, Mila...

201
00:40:22,039 --> 00:40:24,786
I hear you will have a new father, right?

202
00:40:26,760 --> 00:40:30,199
One has to admit that
he is an honorable man.

203
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:34,300
You're pretty.

204
00:40:34,920 --> 00:40:38,806
Mum doesn't care about the organist.
- Of course, she does.

205
00:40:38,960 --> 00:40:41,480
She doesn't! He's so old!

206
00:40:45,719 --> 00:40:47,219
Milka!

207
00:40:49,199 --> 00:40:50,699
Milka!

208
00:41:09,400 --> 00:41:11,360
Mother, the organist!

209
00:41:13,639 --> 00:41:15,599
I'd rather he stopped coming.

210
00:41:38,599 --> 00:41:41,239
Did you consider my proposal?

211
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:45,423
I did, indeed.

212
00:41:46,023 --> 00:41:47,523
But what of it?

213
00:41:48,119 --> 00:41:49,920
You think you can have me?

214
00:41:51,559 --> 00:41:53,059
I may be wrong but

215
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:56,345
you're at such an age that it's not

216
00:41:56,760 --> 00:41:58,971
necessary for you to have a wife.

217
00:41:59,480 --> 00:42:02,440
And my heart lacks feelings

218
00:42:02,559 --> 00:42:04,502
your future wife should have.

219
00:42:06,079 --> 00:42:09,920
You must think that since
my husband died long ago

220
00:42:10,519 --> 00:42:12,462
you'll seize the opportunity,

221
00:42:13,519 --> 00:42:15,462
for I must be desiring a man.

222
00:42:17,920 --> 00:42:20,440
Be it as it may, I don't want you.

223
00:42:22,039 --> 00:42:24,180
And if I'm being frank, I doubt

224
00:42:24,280 --> 00:42:26,692
you will find a woman who wants you.

225
00:43:02,239 --> 00:43:04,260
Maybe someone will push me away

226
00:43:04,360 --> 00:43:06,639
just like I turned him down?

227
00:43:24,320 --> 00:43:25,820
Who would you want?

228
00:43:29,719 --> 00:43:31,219
I'll tell you later.

229
00:43:33,360 --> 00:43:35,571
If God allows and if he wants me.

230
00:43:38,920 --> 00:43:41,079
It all depends on him.

231
00:43:49,800 --> 00:43:53,016
Who would remember about us
if it wasn't for you.

232
00:43:53,280 --> 00:43:56,360
All the others come wanting something.

233
00:43:57,800 --> 00:44:00,740
You're the only one who comes
as a true friend.

234
00:44:00,840 --> 00:44:03,119
But I want something, too.

235
00:45:21,079 --> 00:45:22,579
Very soon!

236
00:45:25,039 --> 00:45:26,580
You will have a father.

237
00:45:37,760 --> 00:45:39,260
Mila!

238
00:45:46,880 --> 00:45:48,622
You're thinking about him?

239
00:45:49,199 --> 00:45:50,699
Yes.

240
00:45:51,480 --> 00:45:52,980
Who would be better?

241
00:46:21,840 --> 00:46:23,480
Milka, what's wrong?

242
00:46:25,599 --> 00:46:27,877
Something happened to your mother?

243
00:46:36,599 --> 00:46:38,099
Don't you like me?

244
00:46:40,239 --> 00:46:42,280
Why are you turning me down?

245
00:46:43,440 --> 00:46:45,159
I am not.

246
00:46:46,159 --> 00:46:47,659
I am all yours.

247
00:46:55,960 --> 00:46:58,305
And yet, you're marrying my mother.

248
00:47:05,079 --> 00:47:06,579
Marry me.

249
00:47:33,679 --> 00:47:35,179
Mila,

250
00:47:36,480 --> 00:47:38,139
do you still have that silver coin

251
00:47:38,239 --> 00:47:40,360
I gave you? You didn't lose it?

252
00:47:40,559 --> 00:47:42,059
No.

253
00:47:44,880 --> 00:47:46,380
You'll put it inside

254
00:47:47,840 --> 00:47:49,539
and push the halves together

255
00:47:49,639 --> 00:47:51,840
so they close.

256
00:47:51,960 --> 00:47:54,037
And they will never open again.

257
00:47:55,480 --> 00:47:56,980
And inside,

258
00:47:57,239 --> 00:47:59,119
there will be your coin.

259
00:49:04,639 --> 00:49:06,139
What's inside?

260
00:49:08,519 --> 00:49:10,019
I don't know.

261
00:49:11,480 --> 00:49:13,356
The sphere cannot be opened.

262
00:49:22,960 --> 00:49:24,460
Maybe he'll tell me.

263
00:50:19,639 --> 00:50:21,139
I just hope!

264
00:50:21,800 --> 00:50:23,944
That nothing bad happens to him.

265
00:50:35,280 --> 00:50:36,800
Go there and see.

266
00:50:39,199 --> 00:50:40,699
Tell him to come.

267
00:50:42,639 --> 00:50:44,139
I have to talk to him.

268
00:50:47,519 --> 00:50:49,019
Wait.

269
00:51:02,840 --> 00:51:04,340
I'll come with you.

270
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:12,459
Good morning.

271
00:51:12,559 --> 00:51:14,059
I don't see you often.

272
00:51:15,360 --> 00:51:17,236
There's always so much work.

273
00:51:18,199 --> 00:51:20,000
Where are you rushing to?

274
00:51:21,559 --> 00:51:23,301
To the end of the village.

275
00:51:23,880 --> 00:51:26,024
I have a matter to attend there.

276
00:51:26,280 --> 00:51:29,400
Come to see us on your way back.

277
00:51:29,519 --> 00:51:32,139
Milka, come here,
I'll show you something.

278
00:51:32,239 --> 00:51:33,739
I don't have time.

279
00:51:34,480 --> 00:51:37,440
You could go. He's an adult now.

280
00:51:38,920 --> 00:51:42,199
He fancies you. You'd have a good boy.

281
00:52:27,480 --> 00:52:28,980
So!

282
00:52:30,239 --> 00:52:31,739
He left us?

283
00:52:43,440 --> 00:52:44,940
Abandoned us?

284
00:52:45,480 --> 00:52:46,980
Us?

285
00:53:21,239 --> 00:53:23,000
We have each other, Mila.

286
00:53:27,199 --> 00:53:28,699
That's just the way

287
00:53:30,199 --> 00:53:31,699
it should be.

288
00:53:37,280 --> 00:53:39,239
Maybe only the body is weak

289
00:53:40,159 --> 00:53:42,000
and misses him.

290
00:53:44,360 --> 00:53:46,236
Maybe only the body is weak.

291
00:53:47,400 --> 00:53:50,750
But God gives strength
so the soul would be mighty.

292
00:53:51,079 --> 00:53:52,840
So it could fight.

293
00:53:57,000 --> 00:53:58,760
Maybe God knows!

294
00:53:59,280 --> 00:54:00,780
What we

295
00:54:01,760 --> 00:54:03,760
cannot comprehend.

296
00:54:23,960 --> 00:54:25,960
Milka, child!

297
00:54:26,519 --> 00:54:28,019
Wait!

298
00:54:29,079 --> 00:54:30,579
We'll talk.

299
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:33,599
God be with you, child.

300
00:54:35,400 --> 00:54:37,209
How is your mother feeling?

301
00:54:37,840 --> 00:54:39,340
How is she?

302
00:54:39,719 --> 00:54:41,219
She is fine.

303
00:54:41,559 --> 00:54:43,059
I see.

304
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:45,809
Maybe she wants me to come?

305
00:54:48,599 --> 00:54:50,099
That's the way it is.

306
00:54:50,559 --> 00:54:52,059
Yes.

307
00:54:53,280 --> 00:54:55,159
You're an adult woman now.

308
00:54:56,400 --> 00:54:58,276
Give my best to your mother.

309
00:55:01,920 --> 00:55:03,420
Remember!

310
00:55:03,920 --> 00:55:05,420
Give my best to her!

311
00:55:07,199 --> 00:55:08,699
Milka!

312
00:55:09,639 --> 00:55:11,139
My little miss.

313
00:55:16,079 --> 00:55:17,800
God punished me

314
00:55:19,800 --> 00:55:21,810
for I was bad to the organist.

315
00:55:24,159 --> 00:55:25,901
But how am I supposed to!?

316
00:55:27,159 --> 00:55:29,239
He is over sixty.

317
00:55:31,280 --> 00:55:32,880
And I'm not even forty.

318
00:55:35,199 --> 00:55:37,142
How could I have married him?

319
00:55:40,280 --> 00:55:42,480
Tell me, Mila.

320
00:55:43,280 --> 00:55:45,156
Did I make the wrong choice?

321
00:55:48,599 --> 00:55:50,099
No.

322
00:55:53,760 --> 00:55:55,760
I wouldn't take him either.

323
00:55:58,719 --> 00:56:00,719
How strange is human life.

324
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:04,809
You want to do a good thing

325
00:56:08,199 --> 00:56:10,159
and it turns out to be bad.

326
00:56:12,719 --> 00:56:14,059
Sometimes!

327
00:56:14,159 --> 00:56:17,308
A shard of happiness
comes over you unexpectedly

328
00:56:18,480 --> 00:56:21,320
but fate takes it away so fast!

329
00:56:24,880 --> 00:56:27,694
When your father walked
through the village

330
00:56:28,880 --> 00:56:32,840
the girls blushed,
happy that he looked at them.

331
00:56:34,599 --> 00:56:36,099
And I!

332
00:56:36,760 --> 00:56:39,800
Became his without even trying.

333
00:56:41,719 --> 00:56:43,219
But was it for long?

334
00:56:44,239 --> 00:56:45,739
Death took him

335
00:56:47,360 --> 00:56:48,860
so unexpectedly.

336
00:56:51,880 --> 00:56:53,380
He was a good man,

337
00:56:54,480 --> 00:56:57,227
though maybe not as good
as the other one.

338
00:56:58,960 --> 00:57:01,238
Forgive me God for saying that but

339
00:57:02,239 --> 00:57:04,852
apparently there wasn't enough sadness.

340
00:57:06,360 --> 00:57:09,174
And this pain occurs now
to even the score.

341
00:57:12,039 --> 00:57:14,250
Strange is the human heart, Mila.

342
00:57:16,079 --> 00:57:17,579
Just when you think

343
00:57:18,400 --> 00:57:20,209
that it's already fulfilled

344
00:57:21,840 --> 00:57:24,320
it keeps desiring

345
00:57:25,719 --> 00:57:27,320
and is never done.

346
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:34,546
It's hard to foresee God's judgements.

347
00:57:37,719 --> 00:57:39,400
For God is judging us.

348
00:57:42,679 --> 00:57:46,079
He weighs the good against the evil.

349
00:57:50,039 --> 00:57:51,539
And nothing

350
00:57:54,599 --> 00:57:56,140
can be hidden from him.

351
00:58:12,199 --> 00:58:15,214
I came to ask if you
need help with haymaking.

352
00:58:38,440 --> 00:58:40,383
Why didn't you invite him in?

353
00:58:42,719 --> 00:58:44,219
Mila?

354
00:58:45,679 --> 00:58:48,225
Can't you see the way he looks at you?

355
00:58:49,440 --> 00:58:50,960
I don't care for him.

356
00:59:07,119 --> 00:59:08,619
Mila...

357
00:59:09,400 --> 00:59:11,119
Oh, Mila... I love you.

358
00:59:12,320 --> 00:59:13,840
Why are you like this?

359
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:17,059
I will marry you.
You won't find anyone better.

360
00:59:17,159 --> 00:59:19,638
Idiot! Let go or I'll call my mother.

361
00:59:29,000 --> 00:59:30,500
Mila!

362
00:59:32,320 --> 00:59:33,820
Milka!

363
00:59:57,480 --> 00:59:58,980
Milka...

364
01:00:01,599 --> 01:00:03,475
Why is your belly like that?

365
01:00:07,000 --> 01:00:08,500
Milka,

366
01:00:09,880 --> 01:00:11,380
who were you with?

367
01:00:12,119 --> 01:00:13,619
I'm not blind.

368
01:00:15,480 --> 01:00:16,980
Milka!

369
01:00:20,360 --> 01:00:21,860
But that's just

370
01:00:22,039 --> 01:00:23,539
impossible!

371
01:00:25,519 --> 01:00:27,639
She didn't have anyone.

372
01:00:28,760 --> 01:00:31,480
She didn't have anyone apart from him.

373
01:00:33,280 --> 01:00:34,780
Maybe!

374
01:00:36,280 --> 01:00:38,860
Maybe it was Stefek who slept with you.

375
01:00:38,960 --> 01:00:40,460
Or maybe Krystian.

376
01:00:43,199 --> 01:00:47,000
How is it possible that you! Milka?

377
01:00:47,679 --> 01:00:49,179
Milka,

378
01:00:49,360 --> 01:00:51,320
you're with child!

379
01:00:52,199 --> 01:00:54,519
Who were you with?

380
01:00:55,679 --> 01:00:57,179
I was with no one.

381
01:00:58,840 --> 01:01:00,340
Tell me!

382
01:01:00,760 --> 01:01:02,260
Tell me!

383
01:01:03,360 --> 01:01:06,320
Did you lie with him?

384
01:01:07,159 --> 01:01:09,159
Did you and him! Tell me!

385
01:01:11,159 --> 01:01:13,039
You visited Krystian often!

386
01:01:14,239 --> 01:01:15,920
What did you do there?

387
01:01:16,280 --> 01:01:18,519
Tell me. Tell me!

388
01:01:19,039 --> 01:01:20,780
What are you thinking about?

389
01:01:20,880 --> 01:01:23,320
Tell me you didn't do anything!

390
01:01:23,559 --> 01:01:25,960
Tell me you didn't!

391
01:01:26,440 --> 01:01:28,584
With Krystian. What is it about?

392
01:01:48,760 --> 01:01:51,239
You gave yourself to him, didn't you?

393
01:01:52,599 --> 01:01:54,099
You got undressed.

394
01:01:56,079 --> 01:01:57,579
Right?

395
01:01:58,960 --> 01:02:01,760
You spread your legs and gave!

396
01:02:06,039 --> 01:02:07,539
Milka!

397
01:02:13,400 --> 01:02:14,900
My Milka!

398
01:02:16,400 --> 01:02:17,900
My little daughter.

399
01:02:25,639 --> 01:02:27,247
I didn't sleep with him.

400
01:02:28,880 --> 01:02:30,519
I gave myself to no one.

401
01:02:32,920 --> 01:02:35,265
I don't know what you want from me.

402
01:02:36,840 --> 01:02:39,760
I lay with no one, no one caressed me.

403
01:02:42,039 --> 01:02:43,539
You are pregnant.

404
01:02:46,679 --> 01:02:48,800
You will have a baby.

405
01:02:50,400 --> 01:02:51,900
I didn't know.

406
01:02:57,639 --> 01:02:59,139
You spread your legs

407
01:03:01,360 --> 01:03:03,504
and gave yourself to him, right?

408
01:03:03,840 --> 01:03:05,340
You don't believe me?

409
01:03:09,360 --> 01:03:10,860
I do.

410
01:03:11,880 --> 01:03:13,380
I believe you.

411
01:03:16,719 --> 01:03:18,219
I wasn't laying!

412
01:03:18,920 --> 01:03:20,420
I wasn't!

413
01:04:12,440 --> 01:04:14,785
<i>I'm carrying a child under my heart</i>

414
01:04:15,519 --> 01:04:17,019
<i>and so I beg you Lord</i>

415
01:04:17,239 --> 01:04:19,880
<i>don't abandon us.</i>

416
01:04:20,920 --> 01:04:22,420
<i>Be a Father!</i>

417
01:04:23,159 --> 01:04:24,920
<i>Be my child's protection.</i>

418
01:04:25,840 --> 01:04:28,880
<i>Don't forsake us. Don't forget us.</i>

419
01:04:44,599 --> 01:04:46,760
You will manage hauling hay.

420
01:04:46,880 --> 01:04:48,380
The weather is good.

421
01:04:49,079 --> 01:04:52,295
I hope you'll manage
with the hay while it lasts.

422
01:04:59,280 --> 01:05:00,780
Is she sick?

423
01:05:03,000 --> 01:05:04,519
She's changed a lot.

424
01:05:26,559 --> 01:05:28,059
Your belly has grown.

425
01:05:33,239 --> 01:05:35,159
Why should people know?

426
01:06:15,079 --> 01:06:16,579
Leave us, Stefek!

427
01:06:16,760 --> 01:06:18,099
And you, Milka!

428
01:06:18,199 --> 01:06:19,699
Leave us for a moment.

429
01:06:20,159 --> 01:06:22,169
I want to talk to your mother.

430
01:06:22,679 --> 01:06:25,091
I have a matter to discuss with her.

431
01:06:25,519 --> 01:06:27,019
Let's sit.

432
01:06:32,960 --> 01:06:35,159
Come to the new room.
- No, come!

433
01:07:15,119 --> 01:07:16,619
Milka, what are you!?!

434
01:07:26,519 --> 01:07:28,019
I know.

435
01:07:29,119 --> 01:07:30,679
You will have a baby!

436
01:07:32,639 --> 01:07:34,139
Who's baby is it?

437
01:07:36,000 --> 01:07:37,500
Krystian's?

438
01:07:39,719 --> 01:07:41,219
Milka.

439
01:07:42,280 --> 01:07:43,780
Milka!

440
01:07:44,480 --> 01:07:46,222
What will you tell me now?

441
01:07:49,440 --> 01:07:51,048
You're talking nonsense!

442
01:07:55,840 --> 01:07:57,340
Mila!

443
01:07:58,519 --> 01:08:00,019
My Mila!

444
01:08:00,559 --> 01:08:02,636
Why didn't you let me kiss you?

445
01:08:09,119 --> 01:08:10,639
Take off your skirt!

446
01:08:12,239 --> 01:08:13,920
It's nothing to you.

447
01:08:15,000 --> 01:08:16,500
Take it off!

448
01:08:17,399 --> 01:08:18,899
We'll have some fun.

449
01:08:20,039 --> 01:08:22,359
Take off your skirt! You bitch!

450
01:08:26,439 --> 01:08:27,740
Bitch!

451
01:08:27,840 --> 01:08:29,340
Bitch!

452
01:08:56,840 --> 01:08:58,340
Maybe!

453
01:08:58,760 --> 01:09:02,159
Maybe! who knows if something's happened.

454
01:09:02,560 --> 01:09:04,060
Don't cry.

455
01:09:05,039 --> 01:09:07,159
It will all turn out all right.

456
01:09:09,520 --> 01:09:12,000
No matter what happens.

457
01:09:12,840 --> 01:09:15,079
Sit down, rest.

458
01:09:17,079 --> 01:09:19,620
I'll tell the landlady
to take those wet clothes.

459
01:09:19,720 --> 01:09:21,399
You'll catch a cold.

460
01:09:21,520 --> 01:09:24,079
My little miss!
- Don't call her.

461
01:09:25,920 --> 01:09:27,528
I won't be staying long.

462
01:09:27,960 --> 01:09:29,501
I'll be on my way soon.

463
01:09:29,800 --> 01:09:31,300
No need to call her.

464
01:09:55,239 --> 01:09:56,739
Is that possible?

465
01:09:57,199 --> 01:09:58,800
Are you with child?

466
01:09:59,680 --> 01:10:01,180
Tell me.

467
01:10:03,800 --> 01:10:05,300
I am.

468
01:10:05,760 --> 01:10:07,260
Yes, I am.

469
01:10:09,079 --> 01:10:10,579
Take me as you wife.

470
01:10:13,560 --> 01:10:15,299
It was probably like this.

471
01:10:15,399 --> 01:10:18,615
You had fun with a boy.
You forgot to be careful.

472
01:10:19,239 --> 01:10:20,739
It happens.

473
01:10:21,720 --> 01:10:23,540
Yes, I can see now.

474
01:10:23,640 --> 01:10:25,140
No.

475
01:10:25,359 --> 01:10:27,369
I wasn't with anyone. I swear.

476
01:10:28,479 --> 01:10:30,154
Why don't you believe me?

477
01:10:30,399 --> 01:10:31,620
Impossible.

478
01:10:31,720 --> 01:10:33,328
Such cases do not exist.

479
01:10:33,439 --> 01:10:34,939
You're mocking me.

480
01:10:35,920 --> 01:10:38,199
I'm too old for such stories.

481
01:10:38,319 --> 01:10:41,039
I am not lying. It's the truth.

482
01:10:47,880 --> 01:10:50,159
Take me as your wife!

483
01:10:52,439 --> 01:10:54,985
Take me as your wife, I'm begging you.

484
01:10:57,800 --> 01:10:59,300
Take me.

485
01:11:01,600 --> 01:11:03,141
Who would have thought?

486
01:11:03,600 --> 01:11:06,840
I asked for a mother,
and I'm getting a daughter.

487
01:11:07,640 --> 01:11:09,259
But how is it to be?

488
01:11:09,359 --> 01:11:12,720
Am I to be a husband so suddenly?

489
01:11:27,159 --> 01:11:28,659
You can lie down.

490
01:11:29,680 --> 01:11:31,180
You can take me.

491
01:11:37,119 --> 01:11:38,619
It's not proper.

492
01:11:39,319 --> 01:11:40,700
How could I?

493
01:11:40,800 --> 01:11:43,000
But, as it can be seen!

494
01:11:43,239 --> 01:11:44,739
I am!

495
01:11:45,279 --> 01:11:46,779
But I couldn't.

496
01:11:47,279 --> 01:11:48,779
I couldn't possibly.

497
01:11:51,079 --> 01:11:52,379
Get up, Milka.

498
01:11:52,479 --> 01:11:53,979
Get dressed.

499
01:11:54,560 --> 01:11:56,060
I see.

500
01:11:56,520 --> 01:11:59,399
Of course I know. That's why.

501
01:12:13,840 --> 01:12:15,340
Drink this.

502
01:12:18,479 --> 01:12:20,623
Drink so you don't catch a cold.

503
01:12:23,399 --> 01:12:25,880
You can still change your mind.

504
01:12:27,920 --> 01:12:29,420
You're still young.

505
01:12:31,039 --> 01:12:32,539
A little miss.

506
01:12:33,199 --> 01:12:34,699
Anyone can see.

507
01:12:57,199 --> 01:12:58,699
Thank you.

508
01:13:37,039 --> 01:13:39,786
Mother, the organist will come to see us.

509
01:13:42,079 --> 01:13:44,893
He gave me that coat.
He'll come to get it.

510
01:13:46,920 --> 01:13:49,399
You didn't tell him I don't want him?

511
01:13:50,039 --> 01:13:51,539
An old fart.

512
01:13:52,039 --> 01:13:53,539
He is a good man.

513
01:13:55,319 --> 01:13:56,819
Him too?

514
01:13:57,439 --> 01:14:00,186
It's possible that also he is a good man.

515
01:14:00,680 --> 01:14:02,180
What about me?

516
01:14:02,439 --> 01:14:03,939
Am I not good?

517
01:14:13,119 --> 01:14:14,619
I will marry him.

518
01:14:19,359 --> 01:14:20,859
Mother!

519
01:14:35,520 --> 01:14:37,061
We have to consider it.

520
01:14:38,439 --> 01:14:39,939
That's good.

521
01:14:41,399 --> 01:14:43,141
Of course, he'll take you.

522
01:14:43,319 --> 01:14:45,960
After all, you're a big girl now.

523
01:14:47,000 --> 01:14:48,541
You know perfectly well

524
01:14:49,720 --> 01:14:52,333
what should and what shouldn't be done.

525
01:14:54,520 --> 01:14:58,071
I was stricken with grief,
you understand that, right?

526
01:15:01,359 --> 01:15:04,106
A human being is a child until his death.

527
01:15:04,439 --> 01:15:06,640
He won't change or get wiser.

528
01:15:09,079 --> 01:15:10,579
It's windy.

529
01:15:12,079 --> 01:15:14,800
Despair can knock a person down

530
01:15:16,560 --> 01:15:19,000
like wind cuts flowers from bushes

531
01:15:20,079 --> 01:15:22,625
and spreads them around unnecessarily.

532
01:15:24,399 --> 01:15:26,939
There is no help. There is no saving us.

533
01:15:27,039 --> 01:15:29,585
There is no mercy for the unfortunate.

534
01:15:30,920 --> 01:15:32,863
I will take him as a husband.

535
01:15:34,920 --> 01:15:36,420
The organist.

536
01:15:37,680 --> 01:15:39,180
That's good.

537
01:15:39,960 --> 01:15:41,460
My poor child!

538
01:15:43,079 --> 01:15:44,888
Maybe it's better this way.

539
01:15:53,479 --> 01:15:54,979
Milka!

540
01:16:03,079 --> 01:16:04,579
Wait, don't go!

541
01:16:05,399 --> 01:16:07,580
I have nothing to say to you.

542
01:16:07,680 --> 01:16:08,780
Mila,

543
01:16:08,880 --> 01:16:10,880
if you promise me something

544
01:16:11,520 --> 01:16:14,066
I'll tell no one that you're pregnant.

545
01:16:14,720 --> 01:16:16,720
Everyone will know anyway.

546
01:16:17,560 --> 01:16:19,503
Besides, I'm getting married.

547
01:16:22,039 --> 01:16:23,539
To whom?

548
01:16:28,359 --> 01:16:30,302
When are you getting married?

549
01:16:30,880 --> 01:16:32,880
To whom?
- You'll see.

550
01:17:01,920 --> 01:17:03,420
Oh, well.

551
01:17:04,520 --> 01:17:06,020
Yes.

552
01:17:07,199 --> 01:17:08,807
God be with you, ladies.

553
01:17:11,720 --> 01:17:13,220
Sit down.

554
01:17:22,399 --> 01:17:23,940
This is where we stand.

555
01:17:24,880 --> 01:17:27,024
It's about my marriage to Milka.

556
01:17:27,399 --> 01:17:28,899
Miss Milka.

557
01:17:29,479 --> 01:17:31,556
If she hasn't changed her mind.

558
01:17:32,359 --> 01:17:34,600
I, well, I thought it through

559
01:17:35,439 --> 01:17:36,939
and I accept.

560
01:17:39,720 --> 01:17:41,220
What say you?

561
01:17:42,279 --> 01:17:44,039
What am I to say?

562
01:17:45,880 --> 01:17:49,800
Milka's state is obvious.

563
01:17:52,199 --> 01:17:55,199
Though she doesn't admit

564
01:17:55,640 --> 01:17:57,140
to being with anyone.

565
01:18:01,399 --> 01:18:02,899
God be with you.

566
01:18:03,720 --> 01:18:05,220
Yes.

567
01:18:08,319 --> 01:18:11,520
God will bless you.

568
01:18:14,000 --> 01:18:15,920
Yes!

569
01:18:17,359 --> 01:18:18,859
God will!

570
01:18:21,159 --> 01:18:23,303
He knows best how it really was.

571
01:18:24,000 --> 01:18:25,500
Who knows.

572
01:18:25,920 --> 01:18:30,007
The Bible teaches us that
something like that happened before.

573
01:18:31,439 --> 01:18:33,520
God works in mysterious ways!

574
01:18:50,920 --> 01:18:52,420
Goodbye.

575
01:18:53,000 --> 01:18:54,500
Milka, wait.

576
01:18:55,920 --> 01:18:59,079
Talk to Stefek. He needs you.

577
01:19:07,239 --> 01:19:09,960
Try reaching an understanding with him.

578
01:19:10,720 --> 01:19:12,220
He loves you.

579
01:20:17,079 --> 01:20:18,960
May Jesus have mercy on us.

580
01:20:21,079 --> 01:20:23,119
That's the way it is.

581
01:20:25,520 --> 01:20:28,119
My darling, God will have mercy.

582
01:21:40,720 --> 01:21:42,220
Milka!

583
01:21:44,520 --> 01:21:46,020
Little miss!

584
01:21:49,199 --> 01:21:50,699
My little wife!

585
01:21:51,920 --> 01:21:53,420
Do you hear?

586
01:21:58,640 --> 01:22:00,140
It's time!

587
01:22:02,319 --> 01:22:03,819
I can't.

588
01:22:05,359 --> 01:22:06,859
I can't.

589
01:22:15,720 --> 01:22:18,800
You're thinking to do it differently?

590
01:22:22,279 --> 01:22:23,779
Do you?

591
01:22:25,439 --> 01:22:26,939
Mila?

592
01:22:43,720 --> 01:22:45,220
Darling.

593
01:22:46,800 --> 01:22:48,300
I'm not mad.

594
01:22:49,720 --> 01:22:51,261
I understand perfectly.

595
01:22:52,399 --> 01:22:53,899
I'm forgiving.

596
01:22:54,960 --> 01:22:56,460
Oh, well.

597
01:22:57,520 --> 01:22:59,199
Maybe you're sensitive.

598
01:23:01,479 --> 01:23:02,979
Innocent.

599
01:23:03,119 --> 01:23:04,619
How should I say it!

600
01:23:14,880 --> 01:23:16,421
It will be winter soon,

601
01:23:17,319 --> 01:23:18,994
and we feel so good here.

602
01:23:20,359 --> 01:23:21,880
Marriage, my Milka!

603
01:23:22,960 --> 01:23:24,903
What can be better than that?

604
01:23:26,439 --> 01:23:28,680
It's where the happiness is.

605
01:23:29,560 --> 01:23:31,060
For sure.

606
01:23:31,800 --> 01:23:33,300
It's a fact.

607
01:23:36,119 --> 01:23:39,319
My first wife is dead and buried.

608
01:23:41,159 --> 01:23:44,079
There is also my name on that gravestone.

609
01:23:45,800 --> 01:23:47,300
We'll all go there.

610
01:23:58,760 --> 01:24:00,260
She was good.

611
01:24:01,720 --> 01:24:03,220
Yes.

612
01:24:05,960 --> 01:24:08,372
Doors of heaven were opened for her.

613
01:24:09,760 --> 01:24:11,279
She surely went there.

614
01:24:16,520 --> 01:24:18,061
I think it's like this:

615
01:24:18,960 --> 01:24:20,680
Marriage is sacred.

616
01:24:22,039 --> 01:24:24,987
Nothing can keep a person
warm like love can.

617
01:24:25,560 --> 01:24:27,760
That's pure warmth.

618
01:24:28,359 --> 01:24:29,859
Do you understand?

619
01:24:35,239 --> 01:24:38,600
<i>Oh, Lord, take bitterness
out of our hearts.</i>

620
01:24:39,439 --> 01:24:42,454
<i>Let the sun shine once more
through our souls.</i>

621
01:24:43,039 --> 01:24:44,560
<i>Don't forsake us.</i>

622
01:24:45,520 --> 01:24:47,760
<i>Bring peace to my mother's heart.</i>

623
01:24:48,560 --> 01:24:50,369
<i>Move away the sea of tears.</i>

624
01:24:50,640 --> 01:24:52,319
<i>Don't forget us.</i>

625
01:24:55,199 --> 01:24:56,720
Who will he look like?

626
01:25:01,039 --> 01:25:02,539
Who knows!

627
01:25:04,720 --> 01:25:06,220
Maybe it's a boy?

628
01:25:10,640 --> 01:25:12,140
He did it.

629
01:25:14,680 --> 01:25:16,180
He put it.

630
01:25:22,840 --> 01:25:24,340
He's so talented!

631
01:25:25,600 --> 01:25:27,279
Or here!

632
01:25:32,159 --> 01:25:33,659
It wasn't easy.

633
01:25:36,239 --> 01:25:37,739
But he managed.

634
01:25:38,640 --> 01:25:40,140
Yes.

635
01:25:40,600 --> 01:25:42,100
He knew how.

636
01:25:42,920 --> 01:25:45,640
He knew how, I know he did.

637
01:25:54,439 --> 01:25:56,479
Not everyone is like that.

638
01:25:58,600 --> 01:26:00,100
He's the best.

639
01:26:07,720 --> 01:26:09,680
He did this all by himself.

640
01:26:11,119 --> 01:26:12,619
Yes.

641
01:26:14,800 --> 01:26:16,300
He knew how.

642
01:26:25,640 --> 01:26:27,140
What's inside?

643
01:26:29,119 --> 01:26:30,660
It's buzzing strangely.

644
01:26:33,119 --> 01:26:34,619
He knows.

645
01:26:35,680 --> 01:26:38,279
He hid his secret there,

646
01:26:39,359 --> 01:26:41,101
so no one can discover it.

647
01:26:44,880 --> 01:26:46,756
It's a strange hiding place.

648
01:26:47,359 --> 01:26:51,119
No one can know what's inside.

649
01:26:55,319 --> 01:26:57,159
But do they have to know?

650
01:27:47,479 --> 01:27:48,979
When will it be born?

651
01:27:49,600 --> 01:27:51,100
I don't know.

652
01:27:51,520 --> 01:27:53,720
You have to know more or less.

653
01:27:55,399 --> 01:27:58,399
It's all right, no use talking about it.

654
01:27:58,840 --> 01:28:01,319
It'll be born when the time is right.

655
01:28:46,279 --> 01:28:48,000
Milka is having a baby.

656
01:28:49,680 --> 01:28:51,180
She's in labour.

657
01:28:52,880 --> 01:28:54,380
Her pain has started.

658
01:28:55,600 --> 01:28:57,680
I hope everything goes well.

659
01:28:58,960 --> 01:29:00,560
I was in labour once

660
01:29:00,680 --> 01:29:05,359
and I have to admit that
I wouldn't want to do it again.

661
01:29:07,119 --> 01:29:10,920
That's how God punishes
people since Paradise.

662
01:29:13,039 --> 01:29:16,680
There must be pain and tears.

663
01:30:17,119 --> 01:30:18,619
Milka!

664
01:30:34,039 --> 01:30:35,539
Milka!

665
01:30:37,039 --> 01:30:38,539
Milka!

666
01:30:39,319 --> 01:30:40,819
Come!

667
01:30:42,399 --> 01:30:43,899
Come here!

668
01:30:45,079 --> 01:30:46,579
Come!

669
01:30:47,359 --> 01:30:48,859
Milka.

670
01:30:51,159 --> 01:30:52,659
Milka.

671
01:31:20,439 --> 01:31:21,939
My son!

672
01:31:24,079 --> 01:31:25,579
My little boy!

673
01:31:25,840 --> 01:31:28,159
Look, that's the table.

674
01:31:28,920 --> 01:31:32,119
This here. It's a table.

675
01:31:32,840 --> 01:31:34,783
Of course he doesn't know it.

676
01:31:35,520 --> 01:31:37,920
A table; It's a table.

677
01:31:38,039 --> 01:31:39,539
Yes, yes.

678
01:31:40,439 --> 01:31:41,580
Of course.

679
01:31:41,680 --> 01:31:43,623
He'll learn when he's bigger.

680
01:31:44,920 --> 01:31:48,000
And here, look! Don't cry. Don't cry.

681
01:31:48,520 --> 01:31:50,020
Look here.

682
01:31:50,520 --> 01:31:52,159
It's a book.

683
01:31:52,760 --> 01:31:54,260
A book.

684
01:31:54,560 --> 01:31:56,680
Just a book.

685
01:31:58,319 --> 01:32:00,600
He doesn't understand that yet.

686
01:32:02,520 --> 01:32:04,560
Isn't he a beautiful child?

687
01:32:08,079 --> 01:32:09,579
My little boy.

688
01:32:10,560 --> 01:32:12,060
My son.

689
01:32:13,479 --> 01:32:15,239
He is like a flower.

690
01:32:17,000 --> 01:32:18,742
His cheeks are like roses.

691
01:32:19,520 --> 01:32:21,020
Like roses!

692
01:32:22,680 --> 01:32:25,720
Just think, in ten years
he will be a big boy.

693
01:32:26,239 --> 01:32:27,700
Strong, honest.

694
01:32:27,800 --> 01:32:29,300
I'm sure he will be.

695
01:32:30,039 --> 01:32:31,760
You can already see it.

696
01:32:33,760 --> 01:32:35,260
He'll be like a hawk.

697
01:32:36,479 --> 01:32:37,979
He looks like it.

698
01:32:55,720 --> 01:32:57,220
Krystian!

699
01:32:59,239 --> 01:33:00,960
We shall meet again.

700
01:33:07,119 --> 01:33:09,560
I might have forsaken my own hopes!

701
01:33:10,680 --> 01:33:12,180
Or are they still!

702
01:33:14,199 --> 01:33:16,039
Are they still within me?

703
01:33:26,800 --> 01:33:28,439
Don't count my sins.

704
01:33:30,039 --> 01:33:31,539
My beloved!

705
01:33:33,439 --> 01:33:34,939
My friend!

706
01:33:41,560 --> 01:33:45,319
He is! so beautiful.

707
01:33:46,800 --> 01:33:48,300
Yes, beautiful.

708
01:34:13,359 --> 01:34:14,880
I went to church.

709
01:34:16,640 --> 01:34:18,359
I met old friends.

710
01:34:20,680 --> 01:34:22,422
I stopped by the vicarage.

711
01:34:30,680 --> 01:34:34,000
He is the joy of my days.

712
01:34:36,039 --> 01:34:38,652
Who would believe that I'd be a father.

713
01:34:40,079 --> 01:34:42,199
He is all I can think about.

714
01:34:46,039 --> 01:34:49,359
My first wife, my darling Mila!

715
01:34:51,319 --> 01:34:52,860
We've tried every night

716
01:34:53,680 --> 01:34:55,891
but she couldn't give me a child.

717
01:34:57,079 --> 01:34:58,579
But you!

718
01:35:00,520 --> 01:35:02,530
In a month, guests will arrive

719
01:35:02,880 --> 01:35:04,380
for the christening.

720
01:35:05,051 --> 01:35:06,726
That's what I've decided.

721
01:35:22,914 --> 01:35:24,414
I'm so sorry.

722
01:35:25,840 --> 01:35:28,439
Could you rub my legs?

723
01:35:31,615 --> 01:35:34,764
I don't want to tire you.
You're tired yourself.

724
01:35:36,039 --> 01:35:37,539
I'm all right.

725
01:38:23,720 --> 01:38:25,720
<i>You didn't want to know me.</i>

726
01:38:27,159 --> 01:38:30,520
<i>You didn't want to take me in your arms.</i>

727
01:38:32,359 --> 01:38:35,880
<i>I've walked away from you.</i>

728
01:38:37,640 --> 01:38:40,760
<i>My spirit returned to me.</i>

729
01:38:42,399 --> 01:38:44,359
<i>My longing made me stronger.</i>

730
01:38:45,800 --> 01:38:47,439
<i>My heart grew strong.</i>

731
01:38:48,720 --> 01:38:52,119
<i>Pain and despair
allowed me to rise again.</i>

732
01:38:52,920 --> 01:38:56,239
<i>I leave you now.</i>

HIDDEN DIARY

2
00:01:07,670 --> 00:01:09,172
Audrey!

3
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:21,587
Are you well?
Your mother couldn't come.

4
00:01:24,085 --> 00:01:26,290
- A pleasant journey?
- Yes.

5
00:01:29,558 --> 00:01:31,061
You look wonderful.

6
00:01:31,226 --> 00:01:33,863
Martine Laurencin
General practitioner

7
00:01:39,468 --> 00:01:40,536
- Everything ok?
- Fine.

8
00:01:40,703 --> 00:01:43,608
- Is Audrey here?
- Yes, she's out in the garden.

9
00:01:43,772 --> 00:01:45,509
What have you made for dinner?

10
00:01:45,674 --> 00:01:47,344
Hold on, l just finished work!

11
00:01:47,509 --> 00:01:49,947
- Ok, forget it.
- l'll go out.

12
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:53,952
l hurried things up.

13
00:01:55,017 --> 00:01:57,621
Had a good journey?
You must be tired.

14
00:01:57,787 --> 00:02:00,224
No, l slept on the plane.

15
00:02:00,389 --> 00:02:04,096
- Longer hair suits you.
- Thanks.

16
00:02:04,259 --> 00:02:05,895
He's a funny dog.

17
00:02:06,061 --> 00:02:07,931
Yes, he's young.

18
00:02:08,698 --> 00:02:11,102
l took your things up
to your room.

19
00:02:11,266 --> 00:02:12,669
Thank you.

20
00:02:18,708 --> 00:02:20,243
Here we are...

21
00:02:20,877 --> 00:02:23,315
lf you had told us

22
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:26,352
that you were coming
a little sooner

23
00:02:26,516 --> 00:02:28,419
we'd have taken time off.

24
00:02:28,585 --> 00:02:31,390
lt's a miracle
l managed to get away.

25
00:02:31,554 --> 00:02:33,491
But l have to work too.

26
00:02:33,656 --> 00:02:36,194
- To your visit!
- Can't you take 10 days off

27
00:02:36,359 --> 00:02:40,200
No, just before l lea,
they gave me a great project.

28
00:02:40,363 --> 00:02:42,934
l'd have cancelled.

29
00:02:43,099 --> 00:02:47,240
l didn't want to.
l wanted to see you.

30
00:02:51,174 --> 00:02:55,015
This is for you both.

31
00:03:06,089 --> 00:03:10,564
l don't take photos.
Your father can have it.

32
00:03:13,864 --> 00:03:15,499
ls it a digital one?

33
00:03:15,666 --> 00:03:20,307
Yes, it's very easy to use.
The definition is wonderful.

34
00:03:20,471 --> 00:03:22,474
l don't understand a word.

35
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:26,381
You could take photos
of the garden. It's beautiful.

36
00:03:26,544 --> 00:03:29,650
The garden's your mother.

37
00:03:31,715 --> 00:03:34,554
No, if you feed him,
we'll never get any peace.

38
00:03:34,718 --> 00:03:36,288
l can't believe that...

39
00:03:36,454 --> 00:03:37,789
That's enough!

40
00:03:39,256 --> 00:03:41,693
No, Tiger, come here!

41
00:03:41,859 --> 00:03:44,931
Michel, you could
try training him.

42
00:03:45,096 --> 00:03:47,768
We could have him put down too.

43
00:04:34,045 --> 00:04:36,683
- You can't sleep?
- No.

44
00:04:38,950 --> 00:04:42,324
- Want a sleeping pill?
- No thanks.

45
00:07:42,970 --> 00:07:44,539
Everything ok?

46
00:07:44,706 --> 00:07:47,310
l can't concentrate in my room.

47
00:07:47,474 --> 00:07:50,213
There's a lot of bronchitis about.

48
00:07:51,478 --> 00:07:55,052
l passed Grand dad's house earlier.
It's empty, isn't it?

49
00:07:55,216 --> 00:07:57,554
lt's uninhabitable.

50
00:07:58,453 --> 00:08:00,390
l can't get anything done here.

51
00:08:00,555 --> 00:08:01,990
You just got here!

52
00:08:02,156 --> 00:08:07,199
Relax for a couple of days,
then get back to your work.

53
00:08:08,763 --> 00:08:12,136
You always asked me
to go to Granddad's with you,

54
00:08:12,301 --> 00:08:16,175
as if to avoid being
alone with him.

55
00:08:19,607 --> 00:08:22,779
l took you
because he wanted to see you.

56
00:08:24,011 --> 00:08:26,816
He was fond of you.

57
00:08:26,982 --> 00:08:30,555
He always asked about you.
You know that.

58
00:08:32,254 --> 00:08:35,928
So he'd be happy to see me
in his house.

59
00:08:39,161 --> 00:08:41,198
l couldn't come to the funeral.

60
00:08:41,363 --> 00:08:43,533
l really couldn't get away

61
00:08:43,698 --> 00:08:46,905
and I�m sorry that l wasn't with you.

62
00:08:47,069 --> 00:08:49,741
I�ve worked a lot
these last for years. Sorry.

63
00:08:49,905 --> 00:08:51,507
This wasn't planned either.

64
00:08:51,673 --> 00:08:54,444
The engineer just found
a clever way

65
00:08:54,610 --> 00:08:56,279
to save even more water.

66
00:08:56,444 --> 00:08:59,884
lt's a really great project.
Sorry, but l need quiet.

67
00:09:00,048 --> 00:09:02,553
You sound like an old maid.

68
00:09:07,390 --> 00:09:09,393
Right, l'll get back to work.

69
00:09:11,326 --> 00:09:15,468
The keys are in the kitchen,
the ring with Tintin's rocket.

70
00:10:15,959 --> 00:10:18,129
- We'll deliver tomorrow.
- Thank you.

71
00:10:27,804 --> 00:10:30,041
You scared me!

72
00:10:31,342 --> 00:10:32,811
Aren't you working?

73
00:10:32,976 --> 00:10:35,581
Yes, but l close at seven.

74
00:10:35,745 --> 00:10:37,882
lt's already seven?

75
00:10:38,047 --> 00:10:40,252
l haven't stopped.

76
00:10:40,417 --> 00:10:42,387
l came to see
if you were comfortable.

77
00:10:42,552 --> 00:10:44,789
You don't waste time.

78
00:10:46,056 --> 00:10:48,493
- Want a coffee?
- No thanks.

79
00:10:49,527 --> 00:10:51,731
Will you have room to work?

80
00:10:51,896 --> 00:10:54,935
Are you making fun?

81
00:10:55,099 --> 00:10:59,474
No, I�m glad to see
someone living here.

82
00:11:00,437 --> 00:11:04,378
Even if l'd prefer to see you
staying with us.

83
00:11:07,244 --> 00:11:08,780
ls life good?

84
00:11:08,946 --> 00:11:11,050
Of course. Why?

85
00:11:11,649 --> 00:11:13,084
l don't know.

86
00:11:13,250 --> 00:11:17,391
You seem like
you want to avoid us.

87
00:11:17,556 --> 00:11:18,491
Got problems?

88
00:11:18,656 --> 00:11:22,029
Not at all.
l came here to see you, l swear.

89
00:11:22,192 --> 00:11:25,566
But l have to work too,
make phone calls at night...

90
00:11:25,729 --> 00:11:29,135
I�ve been in Toronto 10 years
and you've never been over.

91
00:11:29,300 --> 00:11:33,642
lf it were up to me,
we'd have come long ago.

92
00:11:33,804 --> 00:11:37,035
lf you insisted,
maybe she'd fly for once.

93
00:11:37,050 --> 00:11:40,800
No, l don't think so.

94
00:11:40,935 --> 00:11:46,322
Last year, l got us tickets
to go to Florence by train.

95
00:11:46,484 --> 00:11:48,187
At the last minute,

96
00:11:48,353 --> 00:11:51,292
l found her sitting next to
her bag, refusing to leave.

97
00:11:51,456 --> 00:11:53,226
With her father's illness,

98
00:11:53,391 --> 00:11:55,996
even going to Bordeaux
stressed her.

99
00:11:56,161 --> 00:11:59,433
Apart from work,
nothing interests her.

100
00:12:18,316 --> 00:12:21,055
- You can't leave it here!
- Suzanne...

101
00:12:21,219 --> 00:12:23,156
Don't shout.
It's a delivery for me.

102
00:12:23,321 --> 00:12:24,156
Hello. l won't take long.

103
00:12:24,322 --> 00:12:26,860
l couldn't have known.

104
00:12:27,025 --> 00:12:29,329
lt holds for you too, you know.

105
00:12:29,495 --> 00:12:32,667
Parking here
is strictly forbidden.

106
00:12:32,831 --> 00:12:34,066
All right.

107
00:12:37,470 --> 00:12:38,538
Mind out.

108
00:12:49,181 --> 00:12:54,291
This is no good at all.
There's no hook-up.

109
00:12:54,453 --> 00:12:56,490
The pipes need changing.

110
00:12:56,656 --> 00:12:58,926
The dish washer
was a bad idea then.

111
00:12:59,091 --> 00:13:02,130
lt'll take years to redo it,
right?

112
00:13:02,727 --> 00:13:04,831
lt's a day's work for a plumber.

113
00:13:04,997 --> 00:13:09,205
l could try to help out
but this needs a professional.

114
00:13:09,368 --> 00:13:11,405
Thank you. l'll manage.

115
00:13:11,570 --> 00:13:13,373
I�m sorry.

116
00:13:13,539 --> 00:13:14,707
Let's go.

117
00:14:10,863 --> 00:14:14,103
Roast pork with prunes

118
00:14:14,267 --> 00:14:20,545
A new school year

119
00:15:21,235 --> 00:15:26,044
Suzanne, thank you for the fruit.

120
00:15:28,743 --> 00:15:31,615
There's far too much of it for me.

121
00:15:33,281 --> 00:15:38,057
And l prefer to pick it
before the birds gorge on it.

122
00:15:38,219 --> 00:15:40,089
lf someone can use it...

123
00:15:40,254 --> 00:15:42,091
That's kind.

124
00:15:42,825 --> 00:15:45,563
You live in America, l hear?

125
00:15:45,727 --> 00:15:47,697
ln Canada.

126
00:15:47,862 --> 00:15:50,132
Quite a success.

127
00:15:50,932 --> 00:15:53,470
Do you want some sugar?

128
00:15:53,635 --> 00:15:55,371
No.

129
00:15:56,772 --> 00:15:59,276
lt's nice to have family photos.

130
00:15:59,441 --> 00:16:02,680
I�ve always liked them.

131
00:16:02,845 --> 00:16:04,982
My parents have taken very few

132
00:16:05,146 --> 00:16:09,355
and l think my grandfather
burnt his after his wife leave.

133
00:16:09,518 --> 00:16:11,889
l don't know what he did.

134
00:16:12,053 --> 00:16:14,691
You and Louise were neighbours.

135
00:16:14,857 --> 00:16:17,495
Maybe you didn't talk much?

136
00:16:17,659 --> 00:16:18,994
We'd say hello.

137
00:16:19,161 --> 00:16:21,932
No one's ever told me much
about her.

138
00:16:22,097 --> 00:16:23,666
All my mother told me

139
00:16:23,832 --> 00:16:27,639
is that she leave just after
a new kitchen was put in for her.

140
00:16:27,803 --> 00:16:31,978
That's possible.
He used to spoil her so much.

141
00:16:32,140 --> 00:16:34,310
He loved her, l think.

142
00:16:34,476 --> 00:16:37,014
Do you know why she leave?

143
00:16:37,179 --> 00:16:38,681
No.

144
00:16:38,848 --> 00:16:43,489
She certainly was rather distant.

145
00:16:43,652 --> 00:16:46,157
She was a beautiful woman.

146
00:16:49,157 --> 00:16:53,766
She came
from a very modest background

147
00:16:53,929 --> 00:16:58,571
and marrying your grandfather was
a wonderful opportunity for her.

148
00:16:58,735 --> 00:17:01,239
He'd make her outfits...

149
00:17:01,403 --> 00:17:02,639
You should have seen them.

150
00:17:03,439 --> 00:17:07,847
l often wondered
what could have become of her.

151
00:17:08,010 --> 00:17:11,684
lt was rare
to see someone leave like that.

152
00:17:18,888 --> 00:17:21,193
''The new kitchen has been made.

153
00:17:21,357 --> 00:17:24,296
''lf only he could understand me,

154
00:17:25,060 --> 00:17:28,634

I hate him for it.

00:17:30,566 --> 00:17:32,803
''A fee_in9 ofemptinen.''

156
00:17:36,773 --> 00:17:38,776
''Gilles has omered me a suit,

158
00:17:45,615 --> 00:17:49,122
''There is dangerous,
it makes my head spin,''

159
00:17:57,627 --> 00:17:59,330
''My darlings,

160
00:17:59,495 --> 00:18:01,933
''I�ve decided to go away

161
00:18:02,098 --> 00:18:04,402
''to think...''

162
00:18:05,101 --> 00:18:10,277
''My loves, I�m leaving this house,
l feel so bad...''

163
00:18:11,442 --> 00:18:14,881
''My darling children,
I�m going away or a whole

164
00:18:15,044 --> 00:18:20,287
''to try to find a new life
where we will be happy at last.''

165
00:18:28,024 --> 00:18:30,896
''A mother isn't necessary happy

00:18:31,060 --> 00:18:33,598
''with the father ofher children.

167
00:18:37,334 --> 00:18:41,675
''That doesn't mean she isn't happy
with her children,''

00:20:45,464 --> 00:20:48,169
Let's see... StuMng...

169
00:20:49,001 --> 00:20:50,704
A quarter pound

170
00:20:50,870 --> 00:20:54,009
of father bacon...

171
00:20:54,640 --> 00:21:02,655
A quarter pound of father bacon...

172
00:21:41,021 --> 00:21:43,258
Hello.

173
00:21:55,769 --> 00:21:57,439
Goodbye, doctor. Thank you.

174
00:22:02,409 --> 00:22:05,314
- l just wanted a quick word.
- Come in.

175
00:22:06,546 --> 00:22:08,616
- Are you well?
- Yes, very well.

176
00:22:08,782 --> 00:22:10,385
Just a second...

177
00:22:16,991 --> 00:22:20,263
l just told a woman she has cancer.

178
00:22:21,761 --> 00:22:26,070
And l have patients with nothing
who moan all day long.

179
00:22:26,234 --> 00:22:28,872
They're more depressing.

180
00:22:29,036 --> 00:22:31,941
They confide in you.
It's important for them.

181
00:22:32,830 --> 00:22:36,313
Sometimes l get tired
of all this misey.

182
00:22:37,111 --> 00:22:39,215
Have you managed to rest a little?

183
00:22:39,379 --> 00:22:40,815
A little.

184
00:22:40,982 --> 00:22:42,819
You look a bit off-colour.

185
00:22:42,984 --> 00:22:45,154
Yes, l worked late.

186
00:22:45,318 --> 00:22:46,988
ls it going well?

187
00:22:47,154 --> 00:22:49,759
Slowly.

188
00:22:51,525 --> 00:22:56,534
Your skin is blotchy.
Do you use sunscreen?

189
00:22:56,697 --> 00:22:58,132
Yes, always.

190
00:22:58,299 --> 00:23:02,507
At your age, you should be
more careful. Here.

191
00:23:02,670 --> 00:23:04,273
Thank you.

192
00:23:04,805 --> 00:23:06,475
Come to dinner tonight.

193
00:23:06,641 --> 00:23:09,213
Not tonight.
We're going to my brother's.

194
00:23:09,377 --> 00:23:12,349
l said you might come.
They'd like to see you.

195
00:23:12,513 --> 00:23:14,583
Why don't you all come over?

196
00:23:14,749 --> 00:23:18,756
The least l can do
is invite G�rard, right?

197
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:21,690
You're impossible...

198
00:23:24,259 --> 00:23:26,596
''Chop half pound of a liver

199
00:23:26,761 --> 00:23:29,433
''and a quarter pound
of bacon.''

200
00:23:37,072 --> 00:23:40,913
''Put the bacon and liver
in a lime boiling stock,

201
00:23:41,076 --> 00:23:43,313
''Boil it for 5 minutes.''

202
00:24:00,595 --> 00:24:04,536
''Chop neatly and place
the mixture in a mortar.''

203
00:24:06,835 --> 00:24:08,838
lt's us!

204
00:24:12,175 --> 00:24:14,279
Thank you.

205
00:24:15,911 --> 00:24:17,648
- You're alone?
- Mum's on the beach.

206
00:24:17,813 --> 00:24:19,183
- They're not here yet?
- No.

207
00:24:19,349 --> 00:24:20,651
They won't be long.

208
00:24:20,816 --> 00:24:22,653
l just put the duck in the oven.

209
00:24:22,818 --> 00:24:24,821
Duck...

210
00:24:27,823 --> 00:24:31,263
l found an old recipe book
that belonged to Louise.

211
00:24:31,426 --> 00:24:32,294
Really?

212
00:24:32,461 --> 00:24:37,972
lt's a sort of diay too.
Maybe l should give it to them.

213
00:24:38,134 --> 00:24:41,440
No, l don't think
that would be a good idea.

214
00:24:41,603 --> 00:24:45,544
Your grandfather's death
upset your mother

215
00:24:45,708 --> 00:24:49,615
and l don't think this is the time
to remind her of Louise.

216
00:24:53,583 --> 00:24:56,655
- How's the shop doing?
- Fine.

217
00:24:56,819 --> 00:24:59,190
lt's a pain when people buy

218
00:24:59,355 --> 00:25:01,760
more ugly pairs of specs
instead of one

219
00:25:01,924 --> 00:25:04,529
but l have loyal customers.

220
00:25:04,694 --> 00:25:07,499
Your friend Samira
came to see me today.

221
00:25:07,663 --> 00:25:10,100
Really?

222
00:25:10,266 --> 00:25:13,906
She has lovely daughters.

223
00:25:16,873 --> 00:25:18,243
Sorry.

224
00:25:46,136 --> 00:25:48,006
Audrey, don't move!

225
00:26:09,393 --> 00:26:10,796
lt's so beautiful!

226
00:26:10,961 --> 00:26:13,766
Hurry, we'll be late
for mass again!

227
00:26:14,998 --> 00:26:16,166
A photo!

228
00:26:16,333 --> 00:26:19,005
A photo, please!
Come on, children.

229
00:26:22,373 --> 00:26:23,675
Smile, Martine, please.

230
00:26:23,841 --> 00:26:26,111
Martine, please,
we haven't much time.

231
00:26:26,910 --> 00:26:28,346
Ok, let's go.

232
00:26:37,621 --> 00:26:39,558
That'll do, won't it?

233
00:26:41,192 --> 00:26:42,894
That smells so good!

234
00:26:43,962 --> 00:26:47,335
lt's a fairly old recipe.
Does it remind you of anything?

235
00:26:47,499 --> 00:26:49,035
No.

236
00:26:52,370 --> 00:26:55,042
What's this dishwasher?

237
00:26:55,206 --> 00:26:56,976
- It doesn't work?
- No.

238
00:26:57,141 --> 00:26:59,311
You messed the kitchen up
to put this in?

239
00:26:59,477 --> 00:27:02,516
The plumbing's rotten.
l can't hook it up.

240
00:27:02,680 --> 00:27:06,153
And you need a dishwasher
just for you?

241
00:27:06,317 --> 00:27:09,156
l wanted to improve the kitchen.

242
00:27:09,320 --> 00:27:11,257
The layout is perfect.

243
00:27:11,422 --> 00:27:13,727
lt just needs
some modern appliances.

244
00:27:14,592 --> 00:27:18,065
l don't want you
touching anything here.

245
00:27:26,671 --> 00:27:29,643
lt's a hand-embroidered cloth,
we can't use it.

246
00:27:29,807 --> 00:27:31,810
Want to hang it on a wall?

247
00:27:31,976 --> 00:27:34,715
Help me
instead of contradicting me.

248
00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:43,957
Martine, C�dric got his diploma.

249
00:27:44,123 --> 00:27:47,095
He had good marks.
The Grand Hotel has taken him on.

250
00:27:47,259 --> 00:27:48,761
Really?

251
00:27:59,405 --> 00:28:01,142
Tell me, Audrey...

252
00:28:01,307 --> 00:28:05,048
- Do you have someone?
- Me?

253
00:28:05,844 --> 00:28:07,714
No.

254
00:28:07,880 --> 00:28:10,451
A man or a woman
can blossom alone.

255
00:28:10,615 --> 00:28:11,350
Nonsense.

256
00:28:11,517 --> 00:28:16,326
You know, Audrey,
l met my wife

257
00:28:16,488 --> 00:28:18,158
at the age of 40.

258
00:28:18,324 --> 00:28:20,327
For years l drifted
from one affair to another

259
00:28:20,492 --> 00:28:23,197
until the right person came along...

260
00:28:24,497 --> 00:28:27,134
And she's the right person!

261
00:28:27,299 --> 00:28:30,071
Until the day you're ready,
when desire wins.

262
00:28:30,235 --> 00:28:32,138
l'd had my eye on him for years.

263
00:28:32,304 --> 00:28:34,509
But he was so way of women.

264
00:28:34,673 --> 00:28:38,246
His mother abandoning him
didn't help.

265
00:28:40,280 --> 00:28:42,450
Let's finish setting the table.

266
00:28:42,616 --> 00:28:44,786
She was brave to leave like that.

267
00:28:44,950 --> 00:28:48,757
lt was a real scandal.

268
00:28:48,921 --> 00:28:51,693
Our mother didn't agree
because she was heartless,

269
00:28:51,857 --> 00:28:53,660
not to be free.

270
00:28:53,826 --> 00:28:57,466
A mother doesn�t just abandon her kids.
She has to be crazy.

271
00:28:57,631 --> 00:28:59,701
l think she love for a man.

272
00:28:59,865 --> 00:29:01,568
lt devastated her husband.

273
00:29:01,734 --> 00:29:05,308
You didn't get over it back then.

274
00:29:05,472 --> 00:29:07,375
Maybe.

275
00:29:07,540 --> 00:29:09,343
lt's delicious.

276
00:29:09,509 --> 00:29:11,746
lt's duck 'a la paulus'.

277
00:29:11,911 --> 00:29:15,350
Here's to Audrey...

278
00:29:16,483 --> 00:29:17,986
for coming to see us.

279
00:29:18,151 --> 00:29:18,785
Thank you.

280
00:29:18,952 --> 00:29:23,761
Here's to you
and to freedom for women...

281
00:29:24,824 --> 00:29:26,727
And to Paulus!

282
00:29:28,061 --> 00:29:31,300
We can talk normally at this table
for once.

283
00:29:31,464 --> 00:29:34,336
As kids, we weren't
allowed to say a word.

284
00:29:34,502 --> 00:29:36,037
Could you at least
respect Dad's memory

285
00:29:36,202 --> 00:29:38,640
in his own home?

286
00:29:38,805 --> 00:29:40,942
Say what you like elsewhere.

287
00:29:41,107 --> 00:29:45,683
He's not doing anything, Martine,
he's not saying anything.

288
00:29:46,380 --> 00:29:49,184
Do you like the Grand Hotel,
C�dric?

289
00:29:49,350 --> 00:29:50,452
Yeah.

290
00:29:50,618 --> 00:29:54,492
Yes, congratulations.

291
00:29:54,655 --> 00:29:57,360
His money helped set up
your restaurant.

292
00:29:57,525 --> 00:29:59,095
Admit that at least.

293
00:29:59,260 --> 00:30:00,161
Cut it out, Martine,

294
00:30:00,327 --> 00:30:03,433
it wasn't easy
accepting that money.

295
00:30:03,597 --> 00:30:06,736
l only took it because the bank
refused our loan.

296
00:30:06,900 --> 00:30:08,703
He ended up giving me
a little cash.

297
00:30:08,868 --> 00:30:10,404
l was almost 40 then.

298
00:30:10,571 --> 00:30:11,839
l don't hassle you
about the house.

299
00:30:12,006 --> 00:30:14,543
lt's good Audrey's here.

300
00:30:15,109 --> 00:30:16,946
No one uses it otherwise.

301
00:30:17,111 --> 00:30:20,350
lf it's empty year round,
it will deteriorate.

302
00:30:20,514 --> 00:30:22,551
We agreed we wouldn't sell it.

303
00:30:22,717 --> 00:30:26,391
Maybe we could decide
to do it up and rent it out.

304
00:30:26,554 --> 00:30:27,957
Yes, it needs a little work.

305
00:30:28,122 --> 00:30:29,357
Who can afford it?

306
00:30:29,523 --> 00:30:32,295
We can always sell the furniture.

307
00:30:32,460 --> 00:30:36,936
l'd rather sell the house instead!

308
00:30:37,098 --> 00:30:38,734
Whatever, l don't care.

309
00:30:38,899 --> 00:30:40,836
That's settled then.

310
00:30:43,638 --> 00:30:46,577
More duck, anyone?

311
00:30:46,742 --> 00:30:50,416
C�dric, you could
bring friends here this summer.

312
00:30:50,579 --> 00:30:52,816
And enjoy all night!

313
00:30:56,618 --> 00:30:59,690
Sorry, l have a headache.
I�m going home.

314
00:30:59,854 --> 00:31:01,691
Martine, listen...

315
00:31:09,531 --> 00:31:11,568
Darling...

316
00:31:12,334 --> 00:31:13,836
Mum, you can�t just leave.

317
00:31:14,002 --> 00:31:17,541
Enough. You're starting
to get on my nerves!

318
00:31:41,631 --> 00:31:43,735
lt's delicious, Louise.

319
00:31:48,538 --> 00:31:50,975
Too bad you don't cook more oAen.

320
00:32:24,774 --> 00:32:28,581
He won't let me help at the shop.
He won't let me work.

321
00:32:28,744 --> 00:32:31,015
Soon, he won't let me speak.

322
00:32:34,884 --> 00:32:37,255
These models are lovely. Look.

323
00:32:40,256 --> 00:32:43,295
This suit is gorgeous, isn't it?

324
00:32:46,162 --> 00:32:48,132
Use it as inspiration.

325
00:32:48,297 --> 00:32:50,267
You know what l'd like, Gilles?

326
00:32:50,433 --> 00:32:51,936
To help at the shop,

327
00:32:52,101 --> 00:32:55,440
I work behind the counter
receive the customers,

328
00:32:55,606 --> 00:32:58,110
choose the fabrics with you...

329
00:32:58,274 --> 00:33:01,380
Many couples run shops.

330
00:33:09,085 --> 00:33:11,790
l'll make this model for you.

331
00:33:25,502 --> 00:33:27,105
l hear that in big cities,

332
00:33:27,271 --> 00:33:29,274
a woman doesn�t always need

333
00:33:29,439 --> 00:33:32,178
her husband's perminion to work.

334
00:33:37,916 --> 00:33:39,318
Thank you.

335
00:33:44,054 --> 00:33:45,556
You've lost weight.

336
00:33:48,492 --> 00:33:50,062
Forgive me.

337
00:33:55,800 --> 00:33:57,670
Still no kids yet?

338
00:33:57,835 --> 00:34:00,005
No.

339
00:34:00,170 --> 00:34:04,211
This world's too harsh.
I�m not brave enough.

340
00:34:04,374 --> 00:34:06,679
Are you afraid of
being alone later?

341
00:34:06,844 --> 00:34:09,415
No, I�ve never thought of that.

342
00:34:10,147 --> 00:34:12,351
l hadn't thought of it either.

343
00:34:12,517 --> 00:34:14,621
But after Paul went away,

344
00:34:14,786 --> 00:34:18,527
l realized that l had my daughters
and they had me

345
00:34:18,690 --> 00:34:21,027
and that we were strong together.

346
00:34:21,191 --> 00:34:22,627
lt's silly.

347
00:34:22,794 --> 00:34:24,697
No, l understand.

348
00:34:29,567 --> 00:34:31,904
I�m pregnant.

349
00:34:34,939 --> 00:34:38,746
I�m mo months gone.
I�m totally lost.

350
00:34:38,910 --> 00:34:42,117
Only natural.
It's such a weird condition.

351
00:34:42,280 --> 00:34:44,183
But once the baby's there,

352
00:34:44,349 --> 00:34:46,753
you'll wonder
why you waited so long.

353
00:34:46,919 --> 00:34:49,089
Personally,

354
00:34:49,253 --> 00:34:52,125
l'd have had more
if my man hadn't walked out.

355
00:34:52,290 --> 00:34:54,160
l wish l could be that simple.

356
00:34:54,325 --> 00:34:56,395
First off, I�m not simple.

357
00:34:56,561 --> 00:34:58,899
And why is it
more complicated for you?

358
00:34:59,063 --> 00:35:02,068
Without my work, I�m lost.

359
00:35:02,233 --> 00:35:04,470
I�m horribly self-centered.

360
00:35:06,972 --> 00:35:08,307
And the father?

361
00:35:08,473 --> 00:35:11,111
We're not together.
He's just a friend..

362
00:35:11,275 --> 00:35:13,680
- Is he married?
- No.

363
00:35:14,613 --> 00:35:17,117
To be honest,
I�m not made for this.

364
00:35:17,281 --> 00:35:19,251
And neither is he.

365
00:35:20,953 --> 00:35:25,027
''Night is too short.
And what if l abandoned it''

366
00:35:25,189 --> 00:35:27,961
''This sniveling baby''

367
00:35:28,126 --> 00:35:31,900
A Japanese poem l came across
just before leaving.

368
00:35:32,063 --> 00:35:35,670
lt gets easier
after the first months.

369
00:35:35,834 --> 00:35:38,406
We're hungry, Mum, we're going.

370
00:35:38,570 --> 00:35:41,142
All right,
give me a minute or mo.

371
00:35:44,309 --> 00:35:46,413
They're waiting.

372
00:35:48,313 --> 00:35:50,517
Keep in touch.

373
00:35:56,923 --> 00:35:59,294
Got all your things?

374
00:36:14,674 --> 00:36:16,878
l'd like Martine to study,

375
00:36:17,043 --> 00:36:20,282
to get an education.

376
00:36:23,083 --> 00:36:27,926
She has to learn.
She�s so stubborn, she can succeed.

377
00:36:32,058 --> 00:36:34,463
I'd like her to be me.''

378
00:36:36,463 --> 00:36:41,306
Women have always worked
in my family, even for a pimance,

379
00:37:04,024 --> 00:37:05,726
ls that Dad's dress?

380
00:37:05,893 --> 00:37:08,163
Yes. So?

381
00:37:08,328 --> 00:37:10,565
You don't wear it to the beach.

382
00:37:11,397 --> 00:37:13,334
You don't know anything.

383
00:37:15,635 --> 00:37:16,536
You're mad!

384
00:37:16,704 --> 00:37:19,275
Don't talk to your mother
like that!

385
00:37:19,974 --> 00:37:21,777
You hurt me.

386
00:37:47,835 --> 00:37:49,872
You have such a character...

387
00:37:50,037 --> 00:37:52,509
A character like that
will take you far.

388
00:37:52,673 --> 00:37:54,643
What does that mean?

389
00:37:54,808 --> 00:37:58,448
You can study, work,
fulfill yourself. It's important.

390
00:37:58,612 --> 00:38:01,484
You have to study, Martine.

391
00:38:01,649 --> 00:38:05,523
You too, G�rard,
but it's easier for boys.

392
00:38:06,420 --> 00:38:08,423
You're a good student.

393
00:38:08,589 --> 00:38:11,728
You have to carry on like that.

394
00:38:11,825 --> 00:38:13,628
You promise?

395
00:38:13,794 --> 00:38:15,364
Yes.

396
00:38:36,985 --> 00:38:39,690
People are so disgusting.

397
00:38:41,656 --> 00:38:43,358
A few weeks back

398
00:38:43,525 --> 00:38:47,866
l found a pair of bride.
Can you believe it?

399
00:38:48,029 --> 00:38:51,068
Come in for coffee. l have decaf.

400
00:39:06,448 --> 00:39:09,420
Back when she was around,

401
00:39:09,584 --> 00:39:13,758
l never had much opportunity
to come in here.

402
00:39:16,192 --> 00:39:18,262
That's right.

403
00:39:18,426 --> 00:39:21,900
She had a camera.

404
00:39:22,064 --> 00:39:26,305
She had even decided
she wanted to be an assistant

405
00:39:26,468 --> 00:39:30,743
to Mr. Lebedel, the photographer.

406
00:39:30,906 --> 00:39:34,345
The fuss that caused!

407
00:39:34,944 --> 00:39:37,883
She had an affair, you mean?

408
00:39:40,783 --> 00:39:44,322
She spent a lot of time there
but no one really knew.

409
00:39:45,988 --> 00:39:48,993
But people talked.

410
00:39:49,158 --> 00:39:50,895
First, it was photography,

411
00:39:51,060 --> 00:39:54,867
then English lessons...

412
00:39:56,999 --> 00:40:01,308
A woman like that
is a real plague...

413
00:40:02,605 --> 00:40:04,976
She was learning English?

414
00:40:05,141 --> 00:40:07,246
l think so.

415
00:40:07,810 --> 00:40:11,684
She went by bus. That wasn't done.

416
00:40:11,847 --> 00:40:14,619
Can you say,
''He's gone for a walk''?

417
00:40:14,784 --> 00:40:16,254
Of course.

418
00:40:26,595 --> 00:40:27,663
You can't say it!

419
00:40:27,830 --> 00:40:29,833
- l can.
- You can't.

420
00:40:31,001 --> 00:40:33,038
That's not the right word.

421
00:40:33,203 --> 00:40:35,006
You can't say it.

422
00:40:40,643 --> 00:40:42,480
l'd like a word.

423
00:40:57,260 --> 00:41:00,366
l can't let you go
to your lessons by bus.

424
00:41:02,666 --> 00:41:04,569
You don't trust me?

425
00:41:05,370 --> 00:41:06,705
l do.

426
00:41:06,870 --> 00:41:10,142
But my customers gossip.

427
00:41:10,308 --> 00:41:12,445
They're real chatter boxes.

428
00:41:14,044 --> 00:41:17,985
l can't lose custom
because of your English lessons.

429
00:41:18,148 --> 00:41:19,818
l just can't.

430
00:41:20,884 --> 00:41:22,654
l understand.

431
00:41:36,033 --> 00:41:38,237
You didn't continue?

432
00:41:38,403 --> 00:41:40,206
No.

433
00:41:41,772 --> 00:41:44,879
l took up photography,
more or less by chance.

434
00:41:50,915 --> 00:41:52,417
lt's for my husband.

435
00:41:52,582 --> 00:41:54,552
He wants a photo for his shop.

436
00:41:54,719 --> 00:41:56,288
l can see why.

437
00:41:56,453 --> 00:41:59,458
lt's hard being away from
a pretty wife.

438
00:42:12,470 --> 00:42:14,139
ls a camera like this expensive?

439
00:42:14,305 --> 00:42:16,410
Yes, fairly expensive.

440
00:42:18,109 --> 00:42:20,380
But l can lend you one
if you want.

441
00:42:20,545 --> 00:42:24,486
l could never accept.

442
00:42:24,649 --> 00:42:27,521
l can even teach you the basics.

443
00:43:50,636 --> 00:43:52,373
The look on your face...

444
00:44:03,649 --> 00:44:05,954
lt was a big funeral.

445
00:44:06,119 --> 00:44:07,822
He was very popular.

446
00:44:07,987 --> 00:44:10,091
He was a good tailor.

447
00:44:12,492 --> 00:44:14,630
This plant matches the stone.

448
00:44:14,794 --> 00:44:17,064
We chose pink granite.

449
00:44:17,230 --> 00:44:18,700
lt's brighter than black.

450
00:44:18,865 --> 00:44:20,835
Yes, it's more colourful.

451
00:44:24,203 --> 00:44:25,973
What's wrong?

452
00:44:27,840 --> 00:44:29,643
lt's the heat.

453
00:44:43,656 --> 00:44:46,728
Have you called a plumber
about the dishwasher?

454
00:44:46,893 --> 00:44:49,965
A plumber, you mean.

455
00:44:50,130 --> 00:44:51,966
He's busy until next week.

456
00:44:52,132 --> 00:44:55,271
That's the problem.
Everything's so complicated.

457
00:44:55,436 --> 00:44:57,306
And they complain about the Poles!

458
00:44:57,471 --> 00:44:59,675
What Poles?

459
00:45:01,342 --> 00:45:05,416
lt's funny, this old love of yours
for kitchen things.

460
00:45:05,579 --> 00:45:09,854
You always said technical progress
had helped to liberate women.

461
00:45:12,086 --> 00:45:14,791
You had
all the housewife's paraphernalia.

462
00:45:15,789 --> 00:45:18,293
You used to call it your dowry.

463
00:45:18,392 --> 00:45:21,097
l may have it
stored away somewhere.

464
00:45:25,532 --> 00:45:28,572
When Granddad died,
did Louise get in touch?

465
00:45:28,736 --> 00:45:30,405
What are you saying?

466
00:45:30,572 --> 00:45:31,172
Hold on.

467
00:45:31,338 --> 00:45:35,413
We'll put them on this.
It's handier.

468
00:45:36,511 --> 00:45:38,046
She could have...

469
00:45:38,212 --> 00:45:39,949
What?

470
00:45:40,114 --> 00:45:42,051
Come back.

471
00:45:42,216 --> 00:45:44,521
That's absurd!

472
00:45:54,396 --> 00:45:57,033
Didn't you find anything
in the house?

473
00:45:59,167 --> 00:46:03,141
Your grandfather threw
her things out when she lea.

474
00:46:03,304 --> 00:46:07,445
Audrey, you're annoying me.
Why bring this up again?

475
00:46:13,581 --> 00:46:14,917
Thanks.

476
00:46:21,322 --> 00:46:23,727
I�ve found an exercise book,

477
00:46:23,892 --> 00:46:25,996
with rough copies of letters

478
00:46:26,161 --> 00:46:28,331
and things she wrote
about herself,

479
00:46:28,496 --> 00:46:31,201
about you, about her life...

480
00:46:31,366 --> 00:46:32,569
Really?

481
00:46:32,734 --> 00:46:34,737
- Do you want to see it?
- No.

482
00:46:34,903 --> 00:46:36,238
You're not interested?

483
00:46:36,404 --> 00:46:39,744
No, but l think Evelyne will love it.

484
00:46:40,676 --> 00:46:44,517
l found it in the kitchen,
behind a dresser.

485
00:46:44,680 --> 00:46:48,621
She wasn't as insensitive
as you think.

486
00:46:48,783 --> 00:46:52,757
l don't care. She lea.
It's not my problem now.

487
00:46:53,689 --> 00:46:57,162
ls that why you're at the house?
To nose around...

488
00:46:57,326 --> 00:47:00,732
You should look to the future.
At this rate,

489
00:47:00,895 --> 00:47:04,402
you'll end up alone and that
really upsets me, you know.

490
00:47:08,437 --> 00:47:11,342
l came across it by chance.

491
00:47:11,507 --> 00:47:13,444
You can spend your life
Looking back.

492
00:47:13,609 --> 00:47:16,314
Time stretches out to infinity...

493
00:47:17,580 --> 00:47:19,650
What will it get you?

494
00:47:22,885 --> 00:47:26,859
- Are you still in therapy?
- No.

495
00:47:27,623 --> 00:47:30,362
You're making progress.
That's good.

496
00:47:30,526 --> 00:47:32,864
l'll start again after this.

497
00:47:34,597 --> 00:47:38,706
To go and cy some more
about your wicked mother

498
00:47:38,868 --> 00:47:42,374
who preferred her patients
to her daughter?

499
00:47:43,806 --> 00:47:45,943
You enjoy that?

500
00:47:46,108 --> 00:47:48,445
Wallowing in misery...

501
00:47:48,612 --> 00:47:51,083
Why do you attack me?
It's unbearable.

502
00:47:51,247 --> 00:47:54,387
You're the one
always looking for a flight!

503
00:47:54,551 --> 00:47:57,690
l can see you can't stand me.
I�m not blind!

504
00:47:57,853 --> 00:48:02,562
lt's not that, Mum, but it's tiring
being unable to talk normally.

505
00:48:03,493 --> 00:48:06,999
l come home and l can tell
everything's a problem.

506
00:48:07,163 --> 00:48:09,368
Being in the house annoys you!

507
00:48:09,533 --> 00:48:12,705
lf l buy stuff to make you happy,
that annoys you!

508
00:48:12,868 --> 00:48:15,306
Dinner annoys you,
even the table cloth!

509
00:48:15,472 --> 00:48:17,943
Everything! It's all wrong!

510
00:48:18,275 --> 00:48:21,347
l cross half the world to see you
but you're still as hard

511
00:48:21,444 --> 00:48:24,550
and authoritarian.
It's a real pain!

512
00:48:24,681 --> 00:48:27,787
You're incredible!

513
00:48:27,951 --> 00:48:30,789
l can't believe I�m hearing this
from a daughter who abandoned me.

514
00:48:30,954 --> 00:48:32,189
You're insane!

515
00:48:32,355 --> 00:48:34,692
No wonder you're alone.
Who'd put up with you?

516
00:48:34,858 --> 00:48:38,966
Okay, I�m going.
l think it's for the best.

517
00:48:41,766 --> 00:48:44,504
We've never got along anyway.

518
00:48:44,669 --> 00:48:48,943
You've always held me responsible
always blamed me!

519
00:48:54,244 --> 00:48:57,183
lt wasn't easy moving so far away.

520
00:48:57,347 --> 00:49:01,589
lt was an opportunity.
l took it and l don't regret it.

521
00:49:01,752 --> 00:49:05,024
You didn't decide my life.
It doesn't revolve around you.

522
00:49:05,188 --> 00:49:08,127
Your mother leaved
because her life was killing her.

523
00:49:08,292 --> 00:49:10,028
Not because of you.

524
00:49:10,193 --> 00:49:12,831
Guilt is just a human emotion.

525
00:49:12,996 --> 00:49:14,699
l don't consider you guilty.

526
00:49:14,866 --> 00:49:18,940
l feel guilty too but
you've never given me any choice.

527
00:49:45,196 --> 00:49:46,832
The same again?

528
00:49:46,998 --> 00:49:48,266
No, thank you.

529
00:49:48,432 --> 00:49:52,641
Could you pay then?
I�m finishing my shier.

530
00:49:52,804 --> 00:49:54,306
Yes, of course.

531
00:50:02,280 --> 00:50:03,616
Thank you.

532
00:50:11,890 --> 00:50:13,727
What are you looking for?

533
00:50:13,892 --> 00:50:14,960
A dress for Mum.

534
00:50:15,126 --> 00:50:17,431
l haven't seen her for a while.

535
00:50:17,596 --> 00:50:20,535
l don't really know
what she'd like.

536
00:50:20,699 --> 00:50:23,571
This one's different.
It would suit her.

537
00:50:23,735 --> 00:50:26,907
You think so?
With the Eiffel Tower...

538
00:50:27,071 --> 00:50:28,908
She hates big cities.

539
00:50:29,541 --> 00:50:31,578
She never likes my gift anyway.

540
00:50:31,743 --> 00:50:34,381
So treat yourself instead.

541
00:50:34,546 --> 00:50:38,620
l'd like to make her happy one day.
l don't want to get it wrong.

542
00:50:38,784 --> 00:50:40,587
lt's beautiful.

543
00:50:44,723 --> 00:50:47,028
Do you have any looser clothes

544
00:50:47,192 --> 00:50:49,931
that a pregnant woman could wear?

545
00:50:52,431 --> 00:50:54,234
Here, try this.

546
00:50:54,399 --> 00:50:55,735
Thanks.

547
00:51:01,073 --> 00:51:04,680
Even as a girl,
it was hard making her happy.

548
00:51:04,844 --> 00:51:07,950
She was sad to see me unhappy
and its didn't help.

549
00:51:10,516 --> 00:51:12,051
Why didn't you come back?

550
00:51:12,217 --> 00:51:14,789
To cancelled it all out
to start a new?

551
00:51:14,954 --> 00:51:17,325
No, forgetting was impossible.

552
00:51:17,490 --> 00:51:20,429
But staying wasn't possible either.

553
00:51:20,593 --> 00:51:22,897
Your mother never forgave me.

554
00:51:23,061 --> 00:51:24,697
l think l'd have to leave too.

555
00:51:24,864 --> 00:51:27,936
l tried to reason with myself.

556
00:51:28,100 --> 00:51:30,738
You don't need to flee.

557
00:51:30,903 --> 00:51:32,239
You're free.

558
00:51:32,405 --> 00:51:35,344
Me? It's different for me.

559
00:51:35,508 --> 00:51:37,345
I�m scared.

560
00:51:41,748 --> 00:51:44,353
l'll just take the dress.

561
00:51:44,517 --> 00:51:46,287
Are you ok, Audrey?

562
00:51:46,452 --> 00:51:48,556
l feel a bit weird.

563
00:51:51,057 --> 00:51:54,496
You have a really pretty shop.

564
00:51:54,660 --> 00:51:57,766
No one tells me
what to put in my window.

565
00:51:58,498 --> 00:52:02,305
l work with young designers,
l try to support them

566
00:52:02,468 --> 00:52:04,973
and there's a market for it.

567
00:52:05,138 --> 00:52:06,607
The prices are the problem.

568
00:52:06,774 --> 00:52:09,378
We can't compete with
the chain stores.

569
00:52:09,542 --> 00:52:11,914
My grandfather
thought like that too.

570
00:52:12,078 --> 00:52:16,152
He tried to resist ready-to-wear,
he worked all the time...

571
00:52:19,787 --> 00:52:21,389
Hi.

572
00:52:22,155 --> 00:52:23,257
How are you?

573
00:52:23,423 --> 00:52:25,226
Great, thanks.

574
00:52:25,391 --> 00:52:26,794
Who's that?

575
00:52:26,960 --> 00:52:30,334
A sort of cousin.
She lives in America.

576
00:52:30,497 --> 00:52:32,300
How do you mean, sort opt

577
00:52:32,466 --> 00:52:34,870
She's G�rard's sister's daughter.

578
00:52:35,035 --> 00:52:39,844
She's loaded but she's still single.
She's kind of weird.

579
00:52:40,808 --> 00:52:42,611
She's a beautiful woman anyhow.

580
00:52:45,646 --> 00:52:47,349
Have a good evening.

581
00:57:58,163 --> 00:58:00,200
The look on your faces!

582
00:58:03,001 --> 00:58:05,639
There was no letter when she leave?

583
00:58:06,438 --> 00:58:08,207
No.

584
00:58:08,974 --> 00:58:11,813
- Can l keep this?
- Of course.

585
00:58:16,548 --> 00:58:17,716
What is it?

586
00:58:17,883 --> 00:58:20,688
Old recipes...

587
00:58:20,852 --> 00:58:22,020
ls Martine ok?

588
00:58:22,188 --> 00:58:24,024
Yes, l think so.

589
00:58:24,190 --> 00:58:25,959
Your mother's so tough.

590
00:58:26,125 --> 00:58:29,464
She chills my blood.
But l hear she's a good doctor...

591
00:58:29,628 --> 00:58:31,198
Yes.

592
00:58:42,808 --> 00:58:45,613
- Can l keep it?
- l just said you could.

593
01:03:05,408 --> 01:03:09,516
lf only l could do something
to make my children proud.

594
01:03:11,880 --> 01:03:14,987
I like to know, like those women
whose books l read.

595
01:03:15,151 --> 01:03:17,255
They're intelligent
and independent.

596
01:03:17,420 --> 01:03:21,896
My life is at home,
I�m not even a good housewife.

597
01:03:25,695 --> 01:03:27,565
Other women seem happy.

598
01:03:27,732 --> 01:03:29,969
They smile in any case,

599
01:03:33,470 --> 01:03:36,409
G�rard has grown a lot lately.

600
01:03:36,573 --> 01:03:38,476
Martine too.

601
01:03:41,645 --> 01:03:45,084
My daughter is as reactionary
as the others.

602
01:03:45,248 --> 01:03:47,920
She judges me and hates me,

603
01:03:48,084 --> 01:03:51,424
Me-too, end up hating her.

604
01:03:51,589 --> 01:03:54,226
She defends her father against me,

605
01:04:43,474 --> 01:04:46,012
My loves, I�m leaving this house,

606
01:04:46,177 --> 01:04:48,347
l feel so bad.

607
01:04:48,512 --> 01:04:50,950
My darling children,

608
01:04:51,115 --> 01:04:53,553
I�m going away for a while

609
01:04:53,718 --> 01:04:55,655
to try to find a new life

610
01:04:55,821 --> 01:05:01,399
where we will be happy at last.

611
01:05:08,232 --> 01:05:10,403
l would like some tomatoes.

612
01:05:29,887 --> 01:05:31,257
These aren't bad.

613
01:05:31,423 --> 01:05:38,236
The trouble starts when you
hesitate bemeen mo pairs.

614
01:05:39,431 --> 01:05:41,468
Sorry.

615
01:05:41,633 --> 01:05:43,069
That's right. Unless...

616
01:05:43,235 --> 01:05:44,771
l think these are ideal for you.

617
01:05:44,936 --> 01:05:49,712
Try them on again.
They're both serious and playful.

618
01:05:49,876 --> 01:05:52,413
intelligent glasses.

619
01:05:55,547 --> 01:05:57,618
I�m not saying she has an excuse

620
01:05:57,783 --> 01:05:59,620
but you're being a pain too.

621
01:05:59,785 --> 01:06:02,757
Why? Is tying to find out wrong?

622
01:06:02,921 --> 01:06:06,795
Her mother walked out
50 years ago. What of it?

623
01:06:06,958 --> 01:06:08,494
Why pester her?

624
01:06:08,661 --> 01:06:10,664
I�m sure she knows stuff.

625
01:06:10,830 --> 01:06:14,304
Why are you so obsessed by Louise?

626
01:06:14,467 --> 01:06:18,040
Because she was a mother
yet leave anyway?

627
01:06:18,203 --> 01:06:20,441
So you think your mother

628
01:06:20,606 --> 01:06:25,983
hasn't been maternal enough
and so on...

629
01:06:26,545 --> 01:06:29,851
You're starting to piss me off
with all this.

630
01:06:30,616 --> 01:06:32,018
Because...

631
01:06:32,184 --> 01:06:34,922
if her father had leave,

632
01:06:35,087 --> 01:06:36,722
no one would have given a damn!

633
01:06:36,889 --> 01:06:38,826
What are you so upset about?

634
01:06:38,991 --> 01:06:41,729
No one gives a damn
about the father!

635
01:06:42,628 --> 01:06:45,166
l stayed at home
while your mother worked.

636
01:06:45,331 --> 01:06:50,274
l cooked for you,
l helped you with your homework...

637
01:06:50,436 --> 01:06:52,540
You've forgotten all that.

638
01:06:52,705 --> 01:06:55,644
The father doesn't count.

639
01:06:55,809 --> 01:06:58,681
Even having a kid without a father

640
01:06:58,845 --> 01:07:00,848
wouldn't be a problem for you,
l bet.

641
01:07:01,013 --> 01:07:03,685
What are you talking about?

642
01:07:06,753 --> 01:07:08,890
You're pregnant, right?

643
01:07:14,461 --> 01:07:17,332
Look at the state you're in.

644
01:07:17,497 --> 01:07:20,101
Your mother has realized.

645
01:07:23,069 --> 01:07:26,008
You turn up here and say nothing.

646
01:07:27,307 --> 01:07:29,310
We have to bring things to a head

647
01:07:29,476 --> 01:07:32,682
to find out a little about your life

648
01:07:32,846 --> 01:07:35,585
and what you're going through.

649
01:07:36,249 --> 01:07:38,286
Personally,

650
01:07:38,452 --> 01:07:41,024
I�m hurt that you haven't told us.

651
01:08:29,470 --> 01:08:31,473
Something smells good.

652
01:08:31,639 --> 01:08:34,143
lt's a new recipe.

653
01:08:34,308 --> 01:08:36,745
You're turning into
a real cordon bleu

654
01:08:36,911 --> 01:08:38,714
in your new kitchen.

655
01:08:40,248 --> 01:08:42,685
Gilles.

656
01:08:43,251 --> 01:08:47,359
Things are getting better.
l feel good, l keep busy...

657
01:08:47,522 --> 01:08:51,363
But...l'd like my own bank account.

658
01:08:51,526 --> 01:08:53,596
What for?

659
01:08:53,761 --> 01:08:56,666
You spoil me
but l was a bit short yesterday

660
01:08:56,831 --> 01:08:59,169
and l hate having to ask
each time.

661
01:08:59,333 --> 01:09:00,468
l manage the budget well

662
01:09:00,635 --> 01:09:02,840
and l'd like to have
my own account

663
01:09:03,005 --> 01:09:05,743
but l need your agreement.

664
01:09:05,908 --> 01:09:07,878
l'll think about it.

665
01:09:09,243 --> 01:09:11,580
l could give you surprises too.

666
01:09:13,414 --> 01:09:15,584
l'd like to be able to spoil you.

667
01:09:15,751 --> 01:09:18,155
What l'd really like

668
01:09:18,319 --> 01:09:20,857
is to see you have friends round

669
01:09:21,023 --> 01:09:25,231
and organize gatherings,
the way other wives do.

670
01:09:27,830 --> 01:09:32,071
We have a beautiful home,
you should be proud of it.

671
01:09:33,702 --> 01:09:35,071
You're right.

672
01:09:47,249 --> 01:09:50,688
She writes well
for someone without an education.

673
01:09:50,853 --> 01:09:51,888
That's true.

674
01:09:52,054 --> 01:09:54,559
But what she says is so sad.

675
01:09:54,723 --> 01:09:56,660
She shouldn't have married him.

676
01:09:56,825 --> 01:09:59,130
But we can't help that.

677
01:09:59,728 --> 01:10:02,166
isn�t it odd
that she lea without it?

678
01:10:02,331 --> 01:10:04,768
And without the money?

679
01:10:04,934 --> 01:10:08,106
She was probably upset
and forgot it.

680
01:10:08,270 --> 01:10:11,342
What could this money be?

681
01:10:12,075 --> 01:10:15,114
She probably had money
for the week.

682
01:10:15,277 --> 01:10:17,681
Money to do the shopping...

683
01:10:17,847 --> 01:10:20,084
This is too much.

684
01:10:24,286 --> 01:10:26,289
Have you shown your mother?

685
01:10:26,455 --> 01:10:28,626
She doesn't want to know.

686
01:10:32,494 --> 01:10:34,164
l understand that.

687
01:10:36,298 --> 01:10:38,736
Martine suffered a lot over it.

688
01:10:38,902 --> 01:10:40,839
No more than you.

689
01:10:41,871 --> 01:10:44,308
l was younger.

690
01:10:45,975 --> 01:10:48,313
l guess she protected me.

691
01:10:48,978 --> 01:10:51,717
She was a second mother to me.

692
01:10:51,881 --> 01:10:54,519
ln my memories,
they merge together.

693
01:10:54,684 --> 01:10:57,088
Was Louise hard with you?

694
01:10:57,253 --> 01:10:58,955
No.

695
01:10:59,123 --> 01:11:02,162
She was tender
but she was sad too.

696
01:11:02,325 --> 01:11:04,395
But may be l imagined her
as being sad

697
01:11:04,561 --> 01:11:06,131
After she leave.

698
01:11:08,098 --> 01:11:09,500
The way she writes...

699
01:11:10,067 --> 01:11:13,908
l tried to find her.
l went to the cops, in vain.

700
01:11:14,871 --> 01:11:18,578
Certain songs make me
think of her now.

701
01:11:19,742 --> 01:11:20,911
She dressed well.

702
01:11:21,078 --> 01:11:24,384
She always dressed well,
l remember.

703
01:11:26,249 --> 01:11:28,219
l found her beautiful.

704
01:11:40,798 --> 01:11:42,535
lt doesn't matter, dear.

705
01:11:42,700 --> 01:11:44,637
Hurry up now.

706
01:12:01,485 --> 01:12:03,655
Let's get to work.

707
01:12:42,459 --> 01:12:43,962
- Hello, madam.
- Hello.

708
01:12:44,129 --> 01:12:48,538
l'd like to empty my account
to buy my husband a new car.

709
01:12:48,700 --> 01:12:50,369
The whole amount?

710
01:12:50,535 --> 01:12:52,472
Yes, please.

711
01:12:52,637 --> 01:12:55,308
He's dreamt of it for so long.

712
01:12:55,473 --> 01:12:58,211
- Can you give me a minute?
- Of course.

713
01:13:12,757 --> 01:13:14,727
l handle such amounts myself.

714
01:13:14,893 --> 01:13:16,730
l understand. Thank you.

715
01:14:18,325 --> 01:14:20,495
You went to the bank?

716
01:14:23,296 --> 01:14:25,767
l wanted to buy you a new car.

717
01:14:26,565 --> 01:14:30,039
What an idiot l was to trust you.

718
01:14:30,203 --> 01:14:32,740
Leave this house now, Louise.

719
01:14:32,905 --> 01:14:35,277
Leave immediately.

720
01:14:35,441 --> 01:14:37,711
You're not happy,
you want to work,

721
01:14:37,877 --> 01:14:40,048
so leave.

722
01:14:40,780 --> 01:14:43,051
Keep the money.

723
01:14:43,216 --> 01:14:45,854
But never try to come back,
you hear.

724
01:14:46,452 --> 01:14:48,689
l don't want to see you again.

725
01:14:50,791 --> 01:14:52,728
l'll demand custody
of the children.

726
01:14:52,893 --> 01:14:55,564
l won't let you take my children.

727
01:14:55,729 --> 01:14:58,533
You're incapable of
Looking after them.

728
01:15:01,435 --> 01:15:03,606
You're right.

729
01:15:03,770 --> 01:15:06,474
Maybe they're better
with you for now.

730
01:15:48,182 --> 01:15:49,417
I�m really sorry.

731
01:15:49,583 --> 01:15:51,286
l'll get some napkins.

732
01:16:01,128 --> 01:16:02,330
lt's all right.

733
01:16:02,497 --> 01:16:05,069
I�m soaked but it's all right.

734
01:16:07,502 --> 01:16:09,305
Do you want to borrow a sweater?

735
01:16:09,470 --> 01:16:10,906
Yes, please.

736
01:16:20,449 --> 01:16:22,018
Thank you.

737
01:16:23,284 --> 01:16:25,321
lt's sweet of you.

738
01:16:28,756 --> 01:16:31,728
Don't worry, it doesn't matter.

739
01:16:32,327 --> 01:16:34,964
You're really kind too.

740
01:16:35,129 --> 01:16:37,934
l could lose my job over this.

741
01:16:38,099 --> 01:16:40,237
Shall l get you another?

742
01:16:40,402 --> 01:16:43,207
No, thank you, l have to go.

743
01:16:43,372 --> 01:16:45,843
l'll bring your sweater back.

744
01:16:46,007 --> 01:16:50,549
lf l forget, I�m on Avenue
de la Mer, number 15.

745
01:17:12,568 --> 01:17:15,106
- Are you married?
- No.

746
01:17:15,671 --> 01:17:18,676
- You don't have a guy?
- No.

747
01:17:24,713 --> 01:17:27,317
Your skin's so soft.

748
01:17:27,483 --> 01:17:29,285
You smell good.

749
01:17:37,092 --> 01:17:40,299
l'd like it to be functional,
for a reasonable price.

750
01:17:40,463 --> 01:17:41,965
Good morning.

751
01:17:42,130 --> 01:17:45,370
l rang the bell.
l thought you'd gone out.

752
01:17:45,535 --> 01:17:47,805
No, l was sleeping.

753
01:17:48,571 --> 01:17:50,241
lt's late to be getting up.

754
01:17:50,406 --> 01:17:52,943
I�m resting. l need it.

755
01:17:54,177 --> 01:17:57,783
- We won't be long.
- Take as long as you like.

756
01:17:59,948 --> 01:18:02,153
Changing the kitchen?

757
01:18:02,318 --> 01:18:04,021
l know you like it

758
01:18:04,187 --> 01:18:07,660
but if we may do it
along with the plumbing.

759
01:18:10,827 --> 01:18:12,964
- You spoke to G�rard about it?
- No.

760
01:18:18,468 --> 01:18:20,138
Evelyne decides.

761
01:18:20,303 --> 01:18:22,641
Their place is absolutely hideous.

762
01:18:22,805 --> 01:18:25,176
You're renting it out?

763
01:18:25,341 --> 01:18:28,513
This house causes
no end of needless tension.

764
01:18:28,678 --> 01:18:31,984
We'll do it up and then we'll see.

765
01:18:32,148 --> 01:18:34,786
Don't tell my brother.
l'll pay for it.

766
01:18:34,951 --> 01:18:37,423
- You should let him know.
- Yes.

767
01:18:38,354 --> 01:18:40,459
l think l have everything.

768
01:18:40,624 --> 01:18:42,627
l'll send you an estimate.

769
01:18:43,760 --> 01:18:45,463
See you soon.

770
01:18:45,629 --> 01:18:47,164
Goodbye.

771
01:18:51,602 --> 01:18:54,541
- Are you well?
- Yes.

772
01:18:54,704 --> 01:18:57,176
The work won�t begin right away.

773
01:18:57,341 --> 01:18:58,643
When are you leaving?

774
01:18:58,808 --> 01:18:59,910
ln mo days.

775
01:19:00,076 --> 01:19:02,848
- You must be pleased.
- Why?

776
01:19:03,012 --> 01:19:06,352
lt's natural to be pleased
to be going home.

777
01:19:08,352 --> 01:19:09,187
l'll go now.

778
01:19:09,353 --> 01:19:11,657
l have something for you.

779
01:19:17,628 --> 01:19:19,631
l hope you'll like it.

780
01:19:19,797 --> 01:19:21,366
Thank you.

781
01:19:21,532 --> 01:19:22,533
Shall l open it?

782
01:19:22,700 --> 01:19:25,338
Maybe not.

783
01:19:26,170 --> 01:19:27,840
Right...

784
01:20:05,376 --> 01:20:07,780
lt's silly,
l forgot it in the car.

785
01:20:08,979 --> 01:20:11,117
Thank you...

786
01:20:11,716 --> 01:20:14,221
Right, l'll let you work.

787
01:20:14,918 --> 01:20:17,089
ls something wrong?

788
01:20:17,255 --> 01:20:19,459
No, not at all.

789
01:20:19,624 --> 01:20:23,031
But l have a lot to do

790
01:20:23,194 --> 01:20:25,431
and you have your consultations.

791
01:20:25,597 --> 01:20:29,204
No, I�m free all day.

792
01:20:30,235 --> 01:20:32,138
What's wrong?

793
01:20:32,303 --> 01:20:33,873
I�m bleeding.

794
01:20:34,038 --> 01:20:36,977
- A lot?
- A little.

795
01:20:37,142 --> 01:20:39,145
All right, that can happen.

796
01:20:39,310 --> 01:20:41,247
Don't panic
but it's best to check.

797
01:20:41,412 --> 01:20:43,750
Get dressed. l'll wait for you.

798
01:21:49,081 --> 01:21:50,583
Everything's fine.

799
01:21:55,622 --> 01:21:57,826
Thanks for taking me.

800
01:21:57,990 --> 01:22:01,029
l feared it might be
an entopic pregnancy.

801
01:22:01,193 --> 01:22:05,100
You lose the fetus
and you end up in hospital.

802
01:22:05,264 --> 01:22:07,636
lt can leave you sterile too.

803
01:22:07,801 --> 01:22:09,938
We can be happy it's not that.

804
01:22:10,102 --> 01:22:12,307
l feel so tired, Mum.

805
01:22:13,406 --> 01:22:16,345
Don't move. What do you need?

806
01:22:16,509 --> 01:22:20,082
l'd like my thick sweater.
It's up in my room.

807
01:22:40,300 --> 01:22:42,470
Dad?

808
01:22:42,636 --> 01:22:45,008
What time is it?

809
01:22:45,806 --> 01:22:48,778
Yes, she was with me.

810
01:22:48,942 --> 01:22:51,146
l don't know. l fell asleep.

811
01:23:03,456 --> 01:23:05,527
Where did you find it?

812
01:23:07,895 --> 01:23:10,199
Behind the kitchen dresser.

813
01:23:12,198 --> 01:23:14,970
lt's Dad.
He's looking all over for you.

814
01:23:18,972 --> 01:23:20,442
Yes.

815
01:23:21,575 --> 01:23:23,378
Everything's fine.

816
01:23:23,544 --> 01:23:25,214
l won't be long.

817
01:23:51,806 --> 01:23:53,643
Are you ok, Mum?

818
01:23:55,476 --> 01:23:57,814
Just leave me alone now.

819
01:24:21,937 --> 01:24:23,573
Yes, Mum.

820
01:24:24,171 --> 01:24:26,308
What's happening?

821
01:24:26,808 --> 01:24:28,378
Where are you?

822
01:24:47,362 --> 01:24:49,566
You know, Audrey, I�ve tried...

823
01:24:49,731 --> 01:24:52,069
to pass on a taste for freedom
to you.

824
01:24:53,101 --> 01:24:55,538
lt's what my mother wanted too.

825
01:24:58,240 --> 01:25:02,448
When G�rard and l went anywhere,
people would whisper about us.

826
01:25:02,611 --> 01:25:04,614
l became hardened.

827
01:25:04,781 --> 01:25:08,554
l wanted them to know
we were managing without her.

828
01:25:10,820 --> 01:25:14,861
But, inside, l tried to be someone
she could be proud of.

829
01:25:18,260 --> 01:25:22,167
l also wanted you to be strong,
independent...

830
01:25:30,073 --> 01:25:32,678
Mum, why did she leave the money?

831
01:25:43,853 --> 01:25:44,955
Why did she leave it?

832
01:25:45,120 --> 01:25:47,925
l don't know.

833
01:25:48,091 --> 01:25:51,264
He called her a thief,
said she took his money...

834
01:25:51,427 --> 01:25:53,397
But she didn't take it.

835
01:25:53,563 --> 01:25:56,335
He said she had vanished,
that he'd looked for her...

836
01:25:56,499 --> 01:25:58,135
But he didn't call the police

837
01:25:58,301 --> 01:26:01,941
and her family
didn't hear from her either.

838
01:26:03,606 --> 01:26:05,843
He should have called the police.

839
01:26:06,877 --> 01:26:10,016
He said he'd looked for her
all day.

840
01:26:10,179 --> 01:26:15,188
But why did he look for her

841
01:26:15,351 --> 01:26:18,657
since her suitcase was
in her room?

842
01:26:20,456 --> 01:26:22,560
What suitcase?

843
01:26:28,632 --> 01:26:31,069
When G�rard and l
got home from school,

844
01:26:32,235 --> 01:26:34,773
the door wasn't locked.

845
01:26:35,973 --> 01:26:39,079
There was no one home
but the door was unlocked.

846
01:26:41,277 --> 01:26:44,317
lt was Suzanne's son's
birthday party

847
01:26:44,481 --> 01:26:46,685
but l didn't want us to go.

848
01:26:46,850 --> 01:26:48,853
l was ashamed
my mother wasn't there.

849
01:26:49,019 --> 01:26:52,559
l felt so ashamed of her.

850
01:26:52,723 --> 01:26:57,566
l thought that she might be
asleep, so l went to their room.

851
01:26:57,728 --> 01:27:00,533
The suitcase was there
with her things.

852
01:27:04,601 --> 01:27:07,975
isn�t it strange
she took nothing with her?

853
01:27:09,606 --> 01:27:13,480
Without a word
and without taking anything.

854
01:27:16,680 --> 01:27:20,187
l was in the kitchen.
My father got home late.

855
01:27:20,350 --> 01:27:22,822
He seemed very odd.

856
01:27:22,987 --> 01:27:24,990
He said she'd robbed him.

857
01:27:25,156 --> 01:27:28,028
He asked why l wasn't in bed.

858
01:27:28,193 --> 01:27:31,032
He didn't ask
if she had come back.

859
01:27:34,966 --> 01:27:36,703
He was filthy,

860
01:27:36,868 --> 01:27:39,172
covered in mud...

861
01:27:39,336 --> 01:27:42,910
He had dirt on his hands.
They were filthy.

862
01:27:43,074 --> 01:27:45,011
And his eyes...

863
01:27:45,176 --> 01:27:46,979
scared me.

864
01:27:47,145 --> 01:27:49,583
He looked mad.

865
01:27:53,151 --> 01:27:55,322
The next morning,

866
01:27:55,486 --> 01:27:58,325
he said she'd called...

867
01:27:58,489 --> 01:28:02,230
to say she wouldn't be back.

868
01:28:02,393 --> 01:28:05,232
And he burnt all her things.

869
01:28:06,898 --> 01:28:09,203
We have nothing.

870
01:28:10,236 --> 01:28:13,241
l didn't lie to you,
we have nothing of hers.

871
01:28:21,546 --> 01:28:24,418
He took the secret to his grave.

872
01:28:32,091 --> 01:28:35,430
- Walk me home.
- Of course, Mum.

873
01:29:16,269 --> 01:29:19,742
- Martine, what's wrong?
- Nothing. Nothing's wrong.

874
01:29:30,582 --> 01:29:32,552
What happened?

875
01:29:33,219 --> 01:29:35,089
He killed her.

876
01:29:38,858 --> 01:29:42,431
Gilles killed Louise.

877
01:29:45,165 --> 01:29:47,168
That's not possible...

878
01:29:48,835 --> 01:29:51,239
You should go up and see Mum.

879
01:29:55,041 --> 01:29:56,878
Want to sleep here?

880
01:29:57,043 --> 01:29:59,080
No, l'd rather go back.

881
01:31:07,748 --> 01:31:09,618
Her blood pressure is low.

882
01:31:09,784 --> 01:31:12,723
Make sure she eats
and stays nearby.

883
01:31:12,887 --> 01:31:14,390
All right.

884
01:31:33,707 --> 01:31:38,950
At first, he was always barking
and never obeyed.

885
01:31:39,114 --> 01:31:42,186
You've trained him well.

886
01:31:42,350 --> 01:31:44,654
l haven't finished yet

887
01:31:46,054 --> 01:31:48,391
but I�m pleased with him.

888
01:31:51,426 --> 01:31:53,931
She's strong, you know.

889
01:32:02,037 --> 01:32:04,107
l won't take them.

890
01:32:04,272 --> 01:32:06,142
They ease the pain.

891
01:32:06,308 --> 01:32:08,846
I�m just tired.

892
01:33:11,807 --> 01:33:13,877
l had considered it, of course.

893
01:33:16,112 --> 01:33:18,416
Not seriously.

894
01:33:26,055 --> 01:33:28,493
ln any case,
he never mentioned her.

895
01:33:33,029 --> 01:33:35,166
We can never prove it anyway.

896
01:33:43,005 --> 01:33:45,710
l'd never seen
my sister cry before.

897
01:33:50,314 --> 01:33:51,849
l have to be going.

898
01:33:58,388 --> 01:33:59,757
Love to Evelyne.

899
01:33:59,922 --> 01:34:01,358
All right.

900
01:34:12,970 --> 01:34:14,840
Mum, it's me. Can l come in?

901
01:34:15,005 --> 01:34:16,407
Yes.

902
01:34:23,981 --> 01:34:25,651
Let me help.

903
01:34:26,817 --> 01:34:28,854
- Has G�rard gone?
- Yes.

904
01:34:29,019 --> 01:34:30,856
He's gone to work.

905
01:34:31,021 --> 01:34:33,291
Evelyne will worry.

906
01:34:33,458 --> 01:34:37,599
lf he's away more than an hour,
she gets frantic.

907
01:34:39,029 --> 01:34:41,934
l'll lock the house up.

908
01:34:44,602 --> 01:34:47,407
I�m going to stay here a while.

909
01:35:50,802 --> 01:35:54,175
You see, she put the dress on.

00:02:05,429 --> 00:02:07,257
Aunt Pat!

2
00:02:07,301 --> 00:02:08,650
Aunt Pat!

3
00:02:40,116 --> 00:02:41,726
Stop it!

4
00:04:26,396 --> 00:04:28,137
Hey.

5
00:04:31,314 --> 00:04:32,663
What's wrong.

6
00:04:32,707 --> 00:04:34,796
Oh my god, why are you shaking?

7
00:04:34,839 --> 00:04:36,101
It's happening again.

8
00:04:36,145 --> 00:04:37,581
What's happening again?

9
00:04:40,410 --> 00:04:42,847
I was in the tub and I
thought I heard somebody

10
00:04:42,891 --> 00:04:44,109
or something.

11
00:04:44,153 --> 00:04:45,546
I don't know.

12
00:04:45,589 --> 00:04:47,722
It was there and it touched
me and then I ran out

13
00:04:47,765 --> 00:04:49,637
of the bathroom, and when
I came back the mirror

14
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:51,334
was busted.

15
00:04:51,378 --> 00:04:53,597
Oh my god, are you serious?

16
00:05:02,606 --> 00:05:04,565
Come on Lex.

17
00:05:04,608 --> 00:05:06,436
What the hell are you doing
taking a bath in 200 degree

18
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:08,090
water for?

19
00:05:08,133 --> 00:05:10,571
It's obvious you opened the
door too fast and you let

20
00:05:10,614 --> 00:05:12,790
the cold air in,
and it's cracked.

21
00:05:13,574 --> 00:05:15,532
- Are you seriously
saying that right now?

22
00:05:16,185 --> 00:05:17,665
Look at it Paul.

23
00:05:22,104 --> 00:05:24,193
- Look, I don't know,
it's just physics.

24
00:05:24,541 --> 00:05:26,151
Just breath.

25
00:05:26,195 --> 00:05:27,936
- Don't tell me
to fucking breath.

26
00:05:28,415 --> 00:05:30,504
I'm sick of you always
acting like I'm crazy,

27
00:05:30,547 --> 00:05:32,549
when I'm showing
you these things!

28
00:05:45,954 --> 00:05:47,477
- I'm sorry.

29
00:05:49,523 --> 00:05:51,176
- What are you apologizing for?

30
00:05:51,220 --> 00:05:53,048
- I don't know I just am.

31
00:05:56,834 --> 00:05:59,054
Just breath.

32
00:05:59,097 --> 00:06:00,838
- Alexis?

33
00:06:00,882 --> 00:06:02,231
- I'm getting dressed.

34
00:06:05,147 --> 00:06:06,714
- Oh, hey Paul.

35
00:06:06,757 --> 00:06:08,280
- Hi aunt Pat.

36
00:06:08,324 --> 00:06:10,239
- You're almost
done packing huh?

37
00:06:14,025 --> 00:06:16,158
What's going on?

38
00:06:26,342 --> 00:06:27,212
Are you okay?

39
00:06:27,256 --> 00:06:28,953
What happened?

40
00:06:32,174 --> 00:06:34,350
- I must of had the
bathroom too hot,

41
00:06:34,394 --> 00:06:38,093
and when I opened the
door, I cracked the glass.

42
00:06:40,138 --> 00:06:41,226
- Oh, well.

43
00:06:41,270 --> 00:06:42,619
I'll take care of that later.

44
00:06:42,663 --> 00:06:45,143
Just be careful in there okay?

45
00:06:45,666 --> 00:06:47,319
- Okay.

46
00:06:47,363 --> 00:06:50,888
- Oh, the lawyer is going to
give you the deed and the keys

47
00:06:50,932 --> 00:06:52,803
to the house in
Victorville tomorrow.

48
00:06:52,847 --> 00:06:54,762
Have you decided what
your'e gonna do with it?

49
00:06:56,633 --> 00:06:59,375
- You know what aunt Pat,
I think I'm gonna keep it.

50
00:06:59,767 --> 00:07:01,290
Live in it.

51
00:07:01,333 --> 00:07:03,901
I mean it is the house
I grew up in after all.

52
00:07:03,945 --> 00:07:05,425
- Only if you're ready.

53
00:07:05,468 --> 00:07:06,469
Okay?

54
00:07:06,817 --> 00:07:08,253
- Okay.

55
00:07:08,297 --> 00:07:10,342
- Stay for dinner Paul,
I'm making meatloaf

56
00:07:10,386 --> 00:07:12,127
and apple cobbler for dessert.

57
00:07:12,432 --> 00:07:13,824
- Hmm.

58
00:07:13,868 --> 00:07:16,044
Homemade meatloaf or ramen
noodles at the dorms.

59
00:07:16,827 --> 00:07:18,612
I choose homemade meatloaf.

60
00:07:18,916 --> 00:07:20,352
- Good choice.

61
00:07:32,016 --> 00:07:35,324
- So I was thinking that
I would take a road trip

62
00:07:35,367 --> 00:07:36,717
with Paul,

63
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:40,721
and see Dorian after
we sign the paperwork.

64
00:07:42,374 --> 00:07:44,333
Maybe give him some money.

65
00:07:44,376 --> 00:07:47,945
- Sweetheart, that man is gonna
be locked in that nuthouse

66
00:07:47,989 --> 00:07:49,686
for the rest of his life.

67
00:07:50,382 --> 00:07:52,080
He don't need money.

68
00:07:52,733 --> 00:07:54,474
- He needs things.

69
00:07:54,517 --> 00:07:56,388
I'm sure there's
stuff he wants to buy.

70
00:07:56,432 --> 00:07:58,042
Like personal items.

71
00:07:58,608 --> 00:08:00,741
Besides it's his money too.

72
00:08:01,132 --> 00:08:04,353
- Well, even after
all that's happening,

73
00:08:04,396 --> 00:08:06,355
guess he's still
your stepfather.

74
00:08:07,356 --> 00:08:09,924
I'm just happy you
keeping us in your home.

75
00:08:10,272 --> 00:08:11,926
- You're my family.

76
00:08:12,666 --> 00:08:15,059
- Even though my brother
doesn't deserve a daughter

77
00:08:15,103 --> 00:08:16,452
like you.

78
00:08:32,903 --> 00:08:36,472
- Well, here are your
keys to the house,

79
00:08:36,516 --> 00:08:38,692
and we're done here.

80
00:08:39,301 --> 00:08:40,128
- Thank you.

81
00:08:40,171 --> 00:08:40,824
- Congratulations.

82
00:08:40,868 --> 00:08:41,869
- Thank you mister.

83
00:08:41,912 --> 00:08:43,131
- So good seeing you.

84
00:08:43,174 --> 00:08:44,480
- Good to see you.

85
00:08:55,447 --> 00:08:57,362
Oh I'm gonna miss you honey.

86
00:08:57,406 --> 00:08:58,712
- I'm gonna miss you too.

87
00:08:58,755 --> 00:09:00,452
We'll see each other lots okay.

88
00:09:00,496 --> 00:09:02,411
- Alright you take care.

89
00:09:02,672 --> 00:09:04,195
Now be careful.

90
00:09:05,414 --> 00:09:07,242
Take care of my baby.

91
00:09:34,399 --> 00:09:36,140
- You good?

92
00:09:36,401 --> 00:09:37,925
- Yeah.

93
00:09:37,968 --> 00:09:40,014
- Whens the last
time you seen him?

94
00:09:43,539 --> 00:09:45,410
- I think I was 15.

95
00:09:46,629 --> 00:09:49,589
He moved in right after
my dad's overdose.

96
00:09:51,112 --> 00:09:53,462
He was really there
for me and my mom.

97
00:09:57,945 --> 00:10:00,512
I guess that's why I
keep trying so hard.

98
00:10:02,123 --> 00:10:03,907
- Of course you keep trying.

99
00:10:03,951 --> 00:10:05,605
He's the only dad you've known.

100
00:10:06,780 --> 00:10:08,695
- Thank you for coming.

101
00:10:08,738 --> 00:10:10,522
I know this isn't a
normal way a guy meets his

102
00:10:10,566 --> 00:10:12,089
girlfriends father.

103
00:10:12,829 --> 00:10:14,570
- I'm here for you.

104
00:10:23,971 --> 00:10:25,973
- We don't normally do
visitations like this.

105
00:10:27,278 --> 00:10:29,367
Have a seat Dorian.

106
00:10:41,249 --> 00:10:43,425
- You look good, Dad.

107
00:10:44,034 --> 00:10:45,732
Really good.

108
00:10:48,038 --> 00:10:49,997
This is my boyfriend Paul.

109
00:10:51,259 --> 00:10:53,217
- It's good to meet you sir.

110
00:10:59,963 --> 00:11:02,096
- You're not even
gonna shake his hand?

111
00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:15,022
I came to bring
you money Dorian.

112
00:11:27,034 --> 00:11:29,819
- I never thought
I'd see you again.

113
00:11:33,649 --> 00:11:36,086
- What happened, Dad?

114
00:11:45,574 --> 00:11:47,445
- Why did you let her in?

115
00:11:47,489 --> 00:11:49,143
- Dorian this is
your stepdaughter.

116
00:11:49,186 --> 00:11:51,014
- Why is she in here!

117
00:11:51,058 --> 00:11:52,886
- Hey man she's just
trying to reach out to you.

118
00:11:52,929 --> 00:11:54,583
You're the only family she has.

119
00:11:54,844 --> 00:11:57,064
- Don't say anything
else to him.

120
00:12:03,331 --> 00:12:05,202
What happened in that house?

121
00:12:07,117 --> 00:12:08,292
- No.

122
00:12:09,076 --> 00:12:11,078
I didn't understand it then.

123
00:12:13,602 --> 00:12:15,647
- What happened to my mother?

124
00:12:15,691 --> 00:12:17,345
- I didn't understand.

125
00:12:17,388 --> 00:12:18,955
- Tell me!

126
00:12:18,999 --> 00:12:20,783
- Ms. King, I'm gonna have to
ask you to lower your voice

127
00:12:20,827 --> 00:12:22,437
you're upsetting my patient.

128
00:12:23,090 --> 00:12:25,135
Dorian, hands in your lap.

129
00:12:25,179 --> 00:12:27,094
Remember your calming words.

130
00:12:33,187 --> 00:12:35,102
- When you can talk to
me like a real person

131
00:12:35,145 --> 00:12:36,625
you contact me.

132
00:12:37,539 --> 00:12:39,323
I'm not coming back here.

133
00:12:40,020 --> 00:12:41,108
- Hey.

134
00:12:43,850 --> 00:12:45,895
- I didn't wanna believe it.

135
00:12:45,939 --> 00:12:48,332
I didn't wanna believe
it till it was too late.

136
00:12:51,161 --> 00:12:52,989
But now I see.

137
00:12:53,860 --> 00:12:56,427
The truth is digging
it's way out it's grave.

138
00:12:58,429 --> 00:12:59,909
- I wish it was you.

139
00:13:01,432 --> 00:13:04,218
I wish it was that
was dead not her.

140
00:13:04,261 --> 00:13:05,872
- No, let's go.

141
00:13:10,877 --> 00:13:12,835
- No!

142
00:13:16,926 --> 00:13:18,536
- Get off me!

143
00:13:21,931 --> 00:13:22,802
- Are you okay?

144
00:13:22,932 --> 00:13:24,281
Alexis are you alright?

145
00:13:51,178 --> 00:13:52,483
It's big.

146
00:13:52,527 --> 00:13:53,876
- Mhm.

147
00:13:55,312 --> 00:13:57,314
- You ready?

148
00:13:58,185 --> 00:13:59,969
- Do I have a choice?

149
00:14:00,578 --> 00:14:02,189
- Yeah.

150
00:14:02,493 --> 00:14:04,060
- Come on.

151
00:14:31,566 --> 00:14:32,306
- Nice.

152
00:14:33,829 --> 00:14:35,135
You're aunt really kept this
place up all these years.

153
00:14:37,224 --> 00:14:38,268
- Yeah.

154
00:14:38,312 --> 00:14:39,574
She did.

155
00:14:40,314 --> 00:14:41,750
- Hm.

156
00:15:10,257 --> 00:15:12,172
How do you feel?

157
00:15:13,086 --> 00:15:16,393
- I feel, surprised.

158
00:15:19,222 --> 00:15:21,529
Surprised that I feel at home.

159
00:15:23,444 --> 00:15:27,535
It's been 13 years
since I've been here.

160
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:31,974
- I'm surprised there
aren't any rodents running

161
00:15:32,018 --> 00:15:32,844
around here.

162
00:15:32,888 --> 00:15:34,672
- There better not be sir.

163
00:15:36,065 --> 00:15:38,111
Come on lets start unpacking
before it gets too late.

164
00:15:41,114 --> 00:15:42,289
- Alright.

165
00:16:30,163 --> 00:16:32,208
Hey.

166
00:16:32,252 --> 00:16:33,644
Where do you want it?

167
00:16:36,212 --> 00:16:38,998
- I guess we should see
which room we're sleeping in.

168
00:17:13,249 --> 00:17:14,946
- Nice.

169
00:17:16,209 --> 00:17:18,167
- It's my Dad's room.

170
00:17:19,647 --> 00:17:21,301
Look at this.

171
00:17:23,825 --> 00:17:25,392
- You look just like her.

172
00:17:29,613 --> 00:17:31,746
Is that you?

173
00:17:32,225 --> 00:17:33,530
Cute.

174
00:17:34,705 --> 00:17:36,229
- No that's my brother.

175
00:17:38,274 --> 00:17:39,493
- Oh.

176
00:17:39,536 --> 00:17:41,843
- I haven't seen a
picture of him in ages.

177
00:17:44,933 --> 00:17:46,543
Joshua.

178
00:17:47,805 --> 00:17:49,938
- You remember him at all?

179
00:17:54,029 --> 00:17:55,596
- I do.

180
00:17:58,251 --> 00:18:01,254
You say I'm a crybaby,
no he was a crybaby.

181
00:18:06,259 --> 00:18:09,305
The silence in this house
was so heavy when he died.

182
00:18:13,266 --> 00:18:15,398
- Nothing's the same
after a baby's death.

183
00:18:15,442 --> 00:18:18,314
- Yeah but my mom really
blamed herself you know?

184
00:18:43,252 --> 00:18:46,125
- He drowned in that
tub right there.

185
00:18:55,830 --> 00:18:57,701
Jesus.

186
00:19:00,313 --> 00:19:01,662
- Alexis,

187
00:19:01,705 --> 00:19:03,533
Are you sure you're
ready for this?

188
00:19:07,015 --> 00:19:09,235
- There are three rooms.

189
00:19:09,887 --> 00:19:12,281
This one's this biggest
so I'll take this one.

190
00:19:12,325 --> 00:19:15,284
Kira can have my old room
and I remember my mother

191
00:19:15,328 --> 00:19:18,505
used the other one as a
sewing room after Joshua died.

192
00:19:19,854 --> 00:19:21,334
I think.

193
00:19:21,899 --> 00:19:23,640
- Let's go check it out.

194
00:19:44,879 --> 00:19:47,186
- I don't know why I'm scared.

195
00:20:02,418 --> 00:20:04,551
It's exactly how I left it.

196
00:20:12,254 --> 00:20:13,473
- Do you remember it?

197
00:20:13,516 --> 00:20:14,909
Any of it?

198
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:20,480
- It's weird I don't but
I feel like I lived here

199
00:20:20,523 --> 00:20:22,003
my whole life.

200
00:20:23,222 --> 00:20:24,832
Like I never left.

201
00:21:11,922 --> 00:21:14,273
I remember that tree.

202
00:21:15,274 --> 00:21:17,450
- Tell Kira
to keep the bed.

203
00:21:17,493 --> 00:21:19,278
She's a little girl anyway.

204
00:21:27,938 --> 00:21:29,592
Alexis.

205
00:21:30,158 --> 00:21:32,291
I said do you want
Chinese for dinner?

206
00:21:33,335 --> 00:21:35,163
- Yeah that's fine.

207
00:22:54,024 --> 00:22:55,461
- Whoa.

208
00:22:55,852 --> 00:22:59,029
- It's the basement
but it's locked.

209
00:22:59,552 --> 00:23:01,684
- You know what they
say about basements.

210
00:23:01,728 --> 00:23:03,338
- What?

211
00:23:04,470 --> 00:23:06,907
- I didn't really have an
answer prepared for that.

212
00:23:06,950 --> 00:23:08,256
Hey.

213
00:23:08,299 --> 00:23:10,911
One thing we must
do is kiss in there.

214
00:23:11,825 --> 00:23:16,830
Every single room in this house.

215
00:23:19,485 --> 00:23:21,443
- Every single room?

216
00:23:22,575 --> 00:23:24,403
Every nook.

217
00:23:24,577 --> 00:23:26,100
And closet.

218
00:23:26,492 --> 00:23:27,797
- Really?

219
00:23:28,494 --> 00:23:30,757
Better get to it before
my roommate gets here.

220
00:24:33,559 --> 00:24:35,125
Damn Lex!

221
00:24:36,562 --> 00:24:38,520
I think you drew blood.

222
00:24:46,180 --> 00:24:48,095
- Peace offering?

223
00:25:02,283 --> 00:25:04,459
I'm really sorry.

224
00:25:06,069 --> 00:25:07,810
- Forget it.

225
00:25:21,084 --> 00:25:23,522
- How bad do you
think this house is?

226
00:25:23,565 --> 00:25:25,219
Maintenance wise?

227
00:25:25,872 --> 00:25:27,090
- It's not good,

228
00:25:27,134 --> 00:25:29,049
but it's not bad.

229
00:25:30,180 --> 00:25:32,443
- Well that's a good thing
of having a new boyfriend.

230
00:25:34,402 --> 00:25:36,317
- I gotta be good for something.

231
00:25:39,102 --> 00:25:40,060
- No.

232
00:25:40,103 --> 00:25:41,583
Wait till after we eat.

233
00:25:41,627 --> 00:25:43,150
- No do it now.

234
00:25:43,411 --> 00:25:47,067
And whatever it says lets
follow it with in bed.

235
00:25:48,111 --> 00:25:49,112
- Alright.

236
00:25:55,641 --> 00:25:57,251
It says...

237
00:25:58,774 --> 00:26:01,734
New and exciting
adventures await you.

238
00:26:03,344 --> 00:26:04,693
In bed.

239
00:26:04,737 --> 00:26:05,825
- Hell yeah.

240
00:26:05,868 --> 00:26:07,087
- It's about time.

241
00:26:07,130 --> 00:26:08,175
- Hey.

242
00:26:08,218 --> 00:26:09,742
- Kidding, do yours.

243
00:26:21,014 --> 00:26:22,885
- It says...

244
00:26:23,146 --> 00:26:26,323
Hope for the best
except the worst.

245
00:26:26,367 --> 00:26:27,890
What kind of fortune
cookie is that?

246
00:26:27,934 --> 00:26:29,196
- You forgot to say in bed.

247
00:26:29,239 --> 00:26:30,676
- Hell no.

248
00:26:30,719 --> 00:26:32,242
We'll share yours.

249
00:26:32,286 --> 00:26:34,288
- Here you can have it, I
don't like the way they taste.

250
00:26:35,419 --> 00:26:36,725
Good lord.

251
00:26:38,161 --> 00:26:39,772
My roomie's here.

252
00:26:42,688 --> 00:26:43,514
Kira!

253
00:26:46,169 --> 00:26:48,128
- Hey Alexis.

254
00:26:48,171 --> 00:26:49,738
Home sweet home huh?

255
00:26:51,174 --> 00:26:54,090
This place is awesome!

256
00:26:55,526 --> 00:26:58,355
It's got just the
right amount of creepy.

257
00:26:58,834 --> 00:27:00,270
- Come on I'll
show you your room,

258
00:27:00,314 --> 00:27:01,750
or you can pick one there's two.

259
00:27:01,794 --> 00:27:04,057
- I take it you already
got the biggest one.

260
00:27:04,100 --> 00:27:05,493
- Of course.

261
00:27:08,452 --> 00:27:10,672
- Yo man
you need some help?

262
00:27:11,847 --> 00:27:13,457
- Nah, I'm good bro.

263
00:27:16,330 --> 00:27:17,287
- Come on.

264
00:27:18,549 --> 00:27:21,204
- It's like a time
capsule in here.

265
00:27:22,466 --> 00:27:24,294
- I know we probably
should have waited.

266
00:27:24,338 --> 00:27:25,774
- No, I like it.

267
00:27:29,082 --> 00:27:30,823
- Hey where do you
want all your crap?

268
00:27:32,215 --> 00:27:34,261
- Right there is fine.

269
00:27:34,304 --> 00:27:35,654
- Perfect.

270
00:27:35,915 --> 00:27:38,004
- I'll help you unpack the car.

271
00:27:48,971 --> 00:27:51,191
- Alright that's it.

272
00:27:51,234 --> 00:27:52,801
All your craps in the house.

273
00:27:52,845 --> 00:27:54,194
- Thank you darling.

274
00:27:54,237 --> 00:27:55,195
- Your welcome.

275
00:27:55,238 --> 00:27:56,805
Alright I'm heading back to LA.

276
00:27:56,849 --> 00:27:58,067
- Why?

277
00:27:58,111 --> 00:28:00,156
- 'Cause there's nothing
to do in fumblefuck.

278
00:28:00,200 --> 00:28:01,505
I mean Victorville.

279
00:28:02,332 --> 00:28:05,727
- There is plenty to
do in Victorville.

280
00:28:05,771 --> 00:28:06,946
- Oh yeah?

281
00:28:06,989 --> 00:28:09,209
- Not in my little
bed you don't.

282
00:28:09,252 --> 00:28:12,603
- Might as well stay man,
they're not gonna let you go.

283
00:28:13,256 --> 00:28:15,258
I feel like I've
been trapped here.

284
00:28:19,045 --> 00:28:21,656
- Now you're over the
limit, you have to stay.

285
00:28:21,700 --> 00:28:22,483
- Oh yeah?

286
00:28:22,526 --> 00:28:24,267
Well, in that case.

287
00:28:24,877 --> 00:28:26,574
Cheers.

288
00:28:29,620 --> 00:28:32,145
So how'd your mom get so rich?

289
00:28:32,188 --> 00:28:33,320
- I don't know.

290
00:28:33,363 --> 00:28:35,539
- We should invest.

291
00:28:35,583 --> 00:28:37,367
- It's we now?

292
00:28:37,890 --> 00:28:38,629
- Yes.

293
00:28:38,673 --> 00:28:39,761
We are one.

294
00:28:39,805 --> 00:28:41,807
One million dollars in one.

295
00:28:42,372 --> 00:28:44,984
- You don't have any life
insurance policies on me do you?

296
00:28:45,027 --> 00:28:46,289
- You're life is full
of drama already.

297
00:28:46,333 --> 00:28:48,248
No need to add this
to the Lifetime movie.

298
00:28:48,291 --> 00:28:49,728
- What?

299
00:28:52,034 --> 00:28:54,123
- I'm sorry babe.

300
00:28:54,167 --> 00:28:55,995
- Wait, what happened?

301
00:28:58,562 --> 00:29:03,306
- I went to visit my father
today and he attacked me.

302
00:29:03,916 --> 00:29:05,700
- Shit Lex.

303
00:29:05,744 --> 00:29:07,267
You think he killed your mom?

304
00:29:07,310 --> 00:29:08,659
- I don't know.

305
00:29:09,312 --> 00:29:11,924
I don't remember him to
be that type of person.

306
00:29:12,968 --> 00:29:15,405
I consider him to be my father.

307
00:29:16,406 --> 00:29:17,886
- It happens all the time.

308
00:29:17,930 --> 00:29:19,758
- Yeah but he wasn't
there when I...

309
00:29:35,425 --> 00:29:37,340
- When you what?

310
00:29:38,733 --> 00:29:40,082
- Can we not talk about that,

311
00:29:40,126 --> 00:29:41,823
I'm trying to put
that all behind me.

312
00:29:41,867 --> 00:29:44,043
- I agree, let's
lighten up the mood,

313
00:29:44,086 --> 00:29:45,479
and play a game.

314
00:29:45,827 --> 00:29:47,220
- Play a game?

315
00:29:47,263 --> 00:29:48,221
What game?

316
00:29:48,264 --> 00:29:49,613
- Hide and seek.

317
00:29:50,092 --> 00:29:51,702
- Hide and seek?

318
00:29:52,878 --> 00:29:54,488
- In the dark?

319
00:29:54,749 --> 00:29:56,838
- Yes, in the dark.

320
00:29:56,882 --> 00:29:59,449
What other way is there
to play hide and seek?

321
00:30:00,320 --> 00:30:02,670
Besides it'll help me
get to know the house.

322
00:30:03,018 --> 00:30:04,324
- No but what if we--

323
00:30:04,367 --> 00:30:06,456
- You guys are
thinking too much.

324
00:30:07,066 --> 00:30:10,373
- Hey Lex, your bedroom
fits this kid perfectly.

325
00:30:14,508 --> 00:30:15,639
- One,

326
00:30:15,901 --> 00:30:17,250
two,

327
00:30:17,293 --> 00:30:18,904
three,

328
00:30:18,947 --> 00:30:20,862
four,

329
00:30:20,906 --> 00:30:22,429
five,

330
00:30:22,472 --> 00:30:24,474
six,

331
00:30:24,518 --> 00:30:26,650
seven,

332
00:30:27,651 --> 00:30:29,349
eight,

333
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:31,830
nine,

334
00:30:33,657 --> 00:30:35,398
ten.

335
00:31:34,849 --> 00:31:37,678
- Ready or not, here I come.

336
00:31:39,201 --> 00:31:41,421
Who's upstairs?

337
00:32:09,928 --> 00:32:11,886
- I found you!

338
00:32:13,235 --> 00:32:15,063
I found you huh!

339
00:32:19,111 --> 00:32:20,460
- Find your own spot.

340
00:32:20,503 --> 00:32:21,852
- No.

341
00:32:24,551 --> 00:32:25,813
- Let's get them back.

342
00:32:25,856 --> 00:32:27,119
- What are you talking about?

343
00:32:27,162 --> 00:32:27,989
- Now don't play this
with me, we both know

344
00:32:28,033 --> 00:32:28,903
what they're doing.

345
00:32:28,947 --> 00:32:29,773
Lets get them back.

346
00:32:29,817 --> 00:32:31,601
- Stop.

347
00:32:35,301 --> 00:32:37,956
- God.

348
00:32:40,306 --> 00:32:42,090
Crazy bitch.

349
00:32:51,186 --> 00:32:52,971
Son of a...

350
00:33:07,594 --> 00:33:09,074
- Ha!

351
00:33:09,117 --> 00:33:10,640
Gotcha.

352
00:33:24,567 --> 00:33:26,743
Seriously?

353
00:33:26,787 --> 00:33:28,310
You didn't even try.

354
00:33:28,354 --> 00:33:30,530
- I'm fine with all
the losers alright.

355
00:33:30,573 --> 00:33:32,271
Wasn't even here.

356
00:33:32,967 --> 00:33:34,099
- You're out.

357
00:33:34,142 --> 00:33:35,578
You lose.

358
00:33:37,102 --> 00:33:39,321
- Let me get
a chance to hide.

359
00:34:02,518 --> 00:34:04,303
- Alexis.

360
00:34:05,869 --> 00:34:07,784
- What happened?

361
00:34:11,962 --> 00:34:14,095
- I saw...

362
00:34:15,009 --> 00:34:16,228
- A what?

363
00:34:20,058 --> 00:34:22,190
- I thought
I saw a mouse.

364
00:34:22,234 --> 00:34:23,757
- A mouse?

365
00:34:23,800 --> 00:34:26,151
- Oh come on Lex,
are you serious?

366
00:34:26,194 --> 00:34:28,240
- I'll let you know, I'd
probably scream like a girl too.

367
00:34:28,283 --> 00:34:29,850
I hate mice.

368
00:34:31,025 --> 00:34:33,419
- I'll just go find some
mouse traps or something.

369
00:34:34,159 --> 00:34:35,508
- Oh man.

370
00:34:40,034 --> 00:34:40,991
- What?

371
00:34:41,035 --> 00:34:43,124
It wasn't a mouse, was it?

372
00:34:45,039 --> 00:34:46,780
Was it?

373
00:35:02,491 --> 00:35:04,363
- What's wrong?

374
00:35:04,406 --> 00:35:05,886
- It wasn't a mouse.

375
00:35:05,929 --> 00:35:07,670
- Oh come on Kira.

376
00:35:07,714 --> 00:35:09,324
I don't want to hear
shit about a ghost.

377
00:35:09,368 --> 00:35:10,673
- No ghosts?

378
00:35:10,717 --> 00:35:12,501
After what happened here?

379
00:35:13,676 --> 00:35:14,851
- Did you guys find it?

380
00:35:16,157 --> 00:35:18,028
- What the hell
are you gonna with that?

381
00:35:18,072 --> 00:35:20,509
- Hm, if you'd like I
can demonstrate on you.

382
00:35:21,510 --> 00:35:23,033
How do you deal
with this girl man?

383
00:35:23,077 --> 00:35:25,079
All she does is talk
about ghosts and shit.

384
00:35:25,123 --> 00:35:27,386
- He used to believe
Ray, and I'll get you

385
00:35:27,429 --> 00:35:28,430
to believe too.

386
00:35:28,474 --> 00:35:29,344
- Oh yeah? No.

387
00:35:29,388 --> 00:35:31,172
I'm far too sane for that shit.

388
00:35:32,391 --> 00:35:34,044
- Listen if Alexis is
seeing something she needs

389
00:35:34,088 --> 00:35:35,437
to let me know.

390
00:35:35,481 --> 00:35:36,525
- If Alexis is seeing
something she needs to be

391
00:35:36,569 --> 00:35:38,092
in a looney bin.

392
00:35:39,659 --> 00:35:41,400
- I can't believe
you would say that.

393
00:35:41,443 --> 00:35:42,488
- I'm serious.

394
00:35:42,531 --> 00:35:44,054
No ghost stories.

395
00:35:44,098 --> 00:35:45,317
We're all adults here.

396
00:35:45,360 --> 00:35:47,188
- Yeah, all adults
playing hide and seek.

397
00:35:47,232 --> 00:35:48,798
- Seriously, I think
we should order a psychic

398
00:35:48,842 --> 00:35:50,365
to come in and
cleanse the house.

399
00:35:50,409 --> 00:35:51,584
Just in case.

400
00:35:51,627 --> 00:35:53,151
- No.

401
00:35:53,977 --> 00:35:55,588
- You know I think that
you should leave since

402
00:35:55,631 --> 00:35:57,198
you don't live here.

403
00:36:00,897 --> 00:36:03,204
- You wanna be crazy,
do it by yourself.

404
00:36:08,296 --> 00:36:09,950
- Don't get
in the middle of it.

405
00:36:09,993 --> 00:36:11,125
Ray!

406
00:36:12,648 --> 00:36:14,389
- He's right.

407
00:36:14,433 --> 00:36:16,348
There are no ghosts.

408
00:36:17,087 --> 00:36:18,567
Ever since I've been back
in this house I've been

409
00:36:18,611 --> 00:36:21,701
I guess you could say
remembering things.

410
00:36:23,398 --> 00:36:24,617
- That's normal.

411
00:36:24,660 --> 00:36:27,228
Being here is triggering
childhood memories.

412
00:36:27,533 --> 00:36:29,404
I mean Lex,

413
00:36:33,147 --> 00:36:35,193
your baby brother died in here,

414
00:36:36,281 --> 00:36:38,457
and you found your mother dead.

415
00:36:38,500 --> 00:36:41,199
That's the most traumatizing
thing I can think of.

416
00:36:41,677 --> 00:36:44,158
- I don't remember being
that close to my mother.

417
00:36:45,072 --> 00:36:46,160
- What?

418
00:36:46,204 --> 00:36:48,249
- I don't think...

419
00:36:48,293 --> 00:36:51,078
I don't feel like I
lost somebody I love.

420
00:36:51,513 --> 00:36:52,732
I don't know.

421
00:36:52,775 --> 00:36:54,473
I don't have any fond
childhood memories

422
00:36:54,516 --> 00:36:56,039
because of--

423
00:36:56,083 --> 00:36:59,434
- Listen, I'm sure you and
your mother were close.

424
00:37:00,174 --> 00:37:02,132
The memories, they're
probably masked by the most

425
00:37:02,176 --> 00:37:03,482
daunting memory.

426
00:37:04,570 --> 00:37:06,224
Finding her dead,

427
00:37:06,789 --> 00:37:09,183
and that's very, very
traumatizing Lex.

428
00:37:10,184 --> 00:37:12,491
You have to give yourself
credit for even being able

429
00:37:12,534 --> 00:37:14,232
to sleep here.

430
00:37:15,668 --> 00:37:17,583
- I have nightmares.

431
00:37:17,626 --> 00:37:19,149
Bad ones.

432
00:37:19,976 --> 00:37:22,152
Not only that, even
when I'm awake.

433
00:37:22,196 --> 00:37:25,634
It's almost like hallucinations.

434
00:37:26,069 --> 00:37:29,769
- Well, a drowning and a
suicide occurred in this house.

435
00:37:31,074 --> 00:37:33,512
If your mother and brother
spirits are lingering--

436
00:37:33,555 --> 00:37:35,296
- Don't talk like that.

437
00:37:37,298 --> 00:37:40,258
- Listen, all that psychology
babble they taught you

438
00:37:40,301 --> 00:37:43,783
in school may help
you rationalize,

439
00:37:44,131 --> 00:37:47,047
but Lex, there are
somethings in this world

440
00:37:47,090 --> 00:37:49,267
that are way beyond
our understanding.

441
00:37:51,747 --> 00:37:54,881
I think we should order
a psychic to come in

442
00:37:54,924 --> 00:37:56,622
and cleanse the house.

443
00:37:57,231 --> 00:37:59,364
I do have to live here to.

444
00:37:59,407 --> 00:38:01,191
- Oh, well thank you.

445
00:38:01,235 --> 00:38:03,237
I'm sure that will help
you sleep at night.

446
00:38:03,281 --> 00:38:05,065
- Anyways.

447
00:38:06,153 --> 00:38:08,286
You'll thank me later.

448
00:38:09,809 --> 00:38:11,201
Did he leave?

449
00:38:11,245 --> 00:38:12,986
- No he's out back smoking.

450
00:38:13,029 --> 00:38:14,944
- Stay here with her.

451
00:38:14,988 --> 00:38:17,120
- Yeah, don't get
in the middle of it.

452
00:38:32,614 --> 00:38:34,834
Alright, I'ma take off.

453
00:38:53,809 --> 00:38:56,334
- Alexis is gonna
kill you for smoking.

454
00:38:59,293 --> 00:39:00,903
- I don't care.

455
00:39:04,516 --> 00:39:06,344
- You good?

456
00:39:07,170 --> 00:39:08,433
- Yeah.

457
00:39:09,521 --> 00:39:11,305
How about you?

458
00:39:11,349 --> 00:39:12,915
- Good.

459
00:39:14,439 --> 00:39:16,266
I broke up with Ray.

460
00:39:16,310 --> 00:39:17,616
- What?

461
00:39:17,659 --> 00:39:19,792
- What the hell are you
two doing here then?

462
00:39:21,315 --> 00:39:23,404
- He doesn't know it yet.

463
00:39:24,971 --> 00:39:26,407
What?

464
00:39:26,451 --> 00:39:28,583
I do live in bumblefuck now.

465
00:39:33,240 --> 00:39:35,329
I don't love him.

466
00:39:38,463 --> 00:39:41,770
Don't you think you should...

467
00:39:43,032 --> 00:39:44,991
- I'm gonna marry her.

468
00:39:45,818 --> 00:39:47,776
- You know what?

469
00:39:47,820 --> 00:39:49,169
I don't get guys.

470
00:39:49,212 --> 00:39:51,301
You call her crazy and
psycho behind her back

471
00:39:51,345 --> 00:39:54,261
hell to her face and
yet, I don't get it.

472
00:39:54,783 --> 00:39:56,263
What?

473
00:39:56,306 --> 00:39:58,352
You feel like hero for
sticking by the crazy chick?

474
00:39:59,440 --> 00:40:01,616
- She's not the
craziest chick I know.

475
00:40:02,051 --> 00:40:03,618
- I'm sick of you Paul.

476
00:40:03,662 --> 00:40:05,315
So what are you saying?

477
00:40:05,359 --> 00:40:07,361
You're really gonna marry her?

478
00:40:09,929 --> 00:40:12,497
I guess her inheritance
sealed that deal.

479
00:40:12,540 --> 00:40:14,977
- You don't know what the
fuck you're talking about.

480
00:40:16,109 --> 00:40:17,850
- What about me?

481
00:40:17,893 --> 00:40:20,243
I thought you wanted
to be with me?

482
00:40:21,984 --> 00:40:23,856
- She needs me.

483
00:40:26,424 --> 00:40:29,296
- Well then next time your
psycho flips out on you,

484
00:40:29,339 --> 00:40:32,473
don't come running into my bed.

485
00:41:00,196 --> 00:41:02,460
- I don't have a peace offering.

486
00:41:04,723 --> 00:41:06,942
What you're not
talking to me now?

487
00:41:36,276 --> 00:41:38,234
- Paul?

488
00:41:42,848 --> 00:41:44,589
Paul?

489
00:42:43,909 --> 00:42:45,867
- What's wrong?

490
00:42:48,435 --> 00:42:50,350
- It was so real.

491
00:42:51,481 --> 00:42:53,266
- What was so real?

492
00:42:55,007 --> 00:42:57,009
- I saw my mother.

493
00:42:58,663 --> 00:43:01,056
The way I found her
when I was eight.

494
00:43:02,362 --> 00:43:04,277
I was right there.

495
00:43:07,976 --> 00:43:09,412
It was so real.

496
00:43:11,327 --> 00:43:13,112
- Let's go to sleep.

497
00:43:26,516 --> 00:43:29,345
- I really hope Ray brings
my mattress like he promised.

498
00:43:30,085 --> 00:43:32,305
He can be such a
douche sometimes.

499
00:43:32,348 --> 00:43:35,874
You gotta tell me what
you want to keep in here.

500
00:43:36,701 --> 00:43:39,007
I'd hate to throw away
anything memorable.

501
00:43:39,312 --> 00:43:41,357
- Just get rid of it all.

502
00:43:41,706 --> 00:43:43,316
- You sure?

503
00:43:43,359 --> 00:43:44,796
- Yeah.

504
00:43:45,318 --> 00:43:46,928
- Okay.

505
00:44:00,289 --> 00:44:01,334
- Hey.

506
00:44:01,377 --> 00:44:02,814
Nice touch.

507
00:44:02,857 --> 00:44:04,511
Like the mattress.

508
00:44:18,656 --> 00:44:21,180
- Upstairs to the left.

509
00:44:26,228 --> 00:44:28,491
- Oh fuck this man.

510
00:44:28,970 --> 00:44:30,319
I just came to drop it off.

511
00:44:30,363 --> 00:44:31,843
She can take it from here.

512
00:44:31,886 --> 00:44:33,235
- Come on man.

513
00:44:33,279 --> 00:44:34,019
- No.

514
00:44:34,062 --> 00:44:35,803
Let her go.

515
00:44:36,108 --> 00:44:37,457
- Great now I have
to deal with this.

516
00:44:37,500 --> 00:44:39,024
- No you don't.

517
00:44:39,067 --> 00:44:39,851
No drama.

518
00:44:39,894 --> 00:44:40,634
No meddling.

519
00:44:40,678 --> 00:44:41,417
- Yes I do.

520
00:44:41,461 --> 00:44:43,158
I don't want Ray to...

521
00:44:43,202 --> 00:44:44,594
- To what?

522
00:44:44,856 --> 00:44:46,814
- I don't want him
to break up with her.

523
00:44:46,858 --> 00:44:48,511
- No meddling.

524
00:44:51,689 --> 00:44:53,647
I have to carry
this shit by myself.

525
00:44:54,169 --> 00:44:55,388
What a dick.

526
00:45:22,197 --> 00:45:24,460
You know I could talk
to him if you want.

527
00:45:26,549 --> 00:45:28,073
- No.

528
00:45:28,116 --> 00:45:29,596
It's fine.

529
00:45:30,423 --> 00:45:32,425
You have your own
relationship to deal with.

530
00:45:52,837 --> 00:45:54,403
- Hey aunt Pat.

531
00:45:54,447 --> 00:45:56,841
- So, hows the
settling coming along?

532
00:45:56,884 --> 00:45:59,452
- Good, we're do the
whole out with the old,

533
00:45:59,495 --> 00:46:01,019
in with the new thing.

534
00:46:01,062 --> 00:46:03,021
I'm not getting rid of too
much, just making it mine,

535
00:46:03,064 --> 00:46:03,978
you know?

536
00:46:04,022 --> 00:46:05,501
- Yeah, I understand.

537
00:46:05,545 --> 00:46:07,852
Hey why don't I bring
you kids some dinner?

538
00:46:07,895 --> 00:46:10,158
- No, you don't have to
come all the way out here.

539
00:46:10,202 --> 00:46:11,899
- I won't have you
starving to death.

540
00:46:11,943 --> 00:46:13,466
- I'll be fine.

541
00:46:13,509 --> 00:46:15,468
I'm gonna rest later anyways.

542
00:46:15,511 --> 00:46:17,600
- Just don't forget about
your old auntie okay?

543
00:46:17,905 --> 00:46:18,993
- I'm not.

544
00:46:19,037 --> 00:46:20,125
I love you.

545
00:46:20,168 --> 00:46:21,604
- Love you too honey.

546
00:46:30,918 --> 00:46:33,094
- I'm gonna check the
roof and the foundation.

547
00:46:33,138 --> 00:46:34,530
See if any repairs
need to be made.

548
00:46:34,574 --> 00:46:35,793
- Okay.

549
00:46:35,836 --> 00:46:36,968
- You alright?

550
00:46:37,011 --> 00:46:39,274
- Yeah I just hope Kira's okay.

551
00:46:39,492 --> 00:46:41,450
- Seriously, how many
times have they broken up?

552
00:46:41,973 --> 00:46:43,496
I'll be back.

553
00:47:11,306 --> 00:47:13,004
- Hey.

554
00:47:13,047 --> 00:47:14,266
What are you doing?

555
00:47:14,309 --> 00:47:16,050
- Just scrubbing the floor.

556
00:47:16,094 --> 00:47:18,183
- What do you want me
to do with this stuff?

557
00:47:18,618 --> 00:47:20,707
- Just put it in the
dumpster out back?

558
00:47:21,621 --> 00:47:23,536
- Okey dokey.

559
00:48:46,619 --> 00:48:47,968
You gotta go.

560
00:48:48,012 --> 00:48:49,883
- What are you doing?

561
00:48:51,363 --> 00:48:53,365
- I'm cutting down
this old bird house.

562
00:48:53,408 --> 00:48:55,106
The wood is rotten, besides
it's bad to feed the birds--

563
00:48:55,149 --> 00:48:57,456
- What is wrong with you?

564
00:48:57,499 --> 00:48:59,066
I'm not gonna get
rid of everything.

565
00:48:59,110 --> 00:49:00,981
Can you have a little
consideration and ask me before

566
00:49:01,025 --> 00:49:02,635
you get rid of stuff?

567
00:49:03,462 --> 00:49:04,854
- Fine.

568
00:49:05,551 --> 00:49:07,031
Cuckoo.

569
00:49:49,769 --> 00:49:51,466
Hey.

570
00:49:52,815 --> 00:49:55,383
Why the hell did
you leave like that?

571
00:49:58,691 --> 00:50:02,477
- Paul, there are no
pictures of me in this house.

572
00:50:03,565 --> 00:50:04,523
- What?

573
00:50:04,566 --> 00:50:06,046
- Pictures.

574
00:50:06,090 --> 00:50:08,222
There are no pictures
anywhere of me in this house.

575
00:50:09,136 --> 00:50:10,746
They're all boxed up.

576
00:50:10,790 --> 00:50:13,271
- I saw some
hanging around somewhere.

577
00:50:13,923 --> 00:50:15,621
- No, those are my brother.

578
00:50:15,664 --> 00:50:17,101
Joshua.

579
00:50:19,929 --> 00:50:21,192
I don't understand why
they wouldn't have pictures

580
00:50:21,235 --> 00:50:22,932
of me hanging up everywhere.

581
00:50:24,021 --> 00:50:26,197
- I don't know Lex.

582
00:50:26,240 --> 00:50:29,243
Look, try not to stress over it.

583
00:50:30,114 --> 00:50:31,202
Ask your aunt.

584
00:50:31,245 --> 00:50:32,725
I'm sure she knows what's up.

585
00:50:33,117 --> 00:50:35,206
- She doesn't have any
pictures of me this young.

586
00:50:35,249 --> 00:50:36,729
- Let me see this picture.

587
00:50:38,252 --> 00:50:39,471
Were you an ugly baby?

588
00:50:39,514 --> 00:50:40,863
- No!

589
00:50:40,907 --> 00:50:42,952
I was an adorable baby.

590
00:50:44,128 --> 00:50:45,781
Stop.

591
00:50:45,825 --> 00:50:47,218
- Alright.

592
00:50:47,261 --> 00:50:48,132
You good?

593
00:50:48,175 --> 00:50:49,742
I'm gonna head out.

594
00:50:49,785 --> 00:50:54,051
- Well, it was good to
spend some time with you.

595
00:50:54,921 --> 00:50:56,270
- I know.

596
00:50:56,314 --> 00:50:58,055
- It's like you
live another state.

597
00:50:58,098 --> 00:51:01,362
- I was thinking that after
you get out of your classes

598
00:51:01,406 --> 00:51:03,321
you could move down here.

599
00:51:04,061 --> 00:51:05,584
In here.

600
00:51:06,019 --> 00:51:07,455
- Hm.

601
00:51:07,499 --> 00:51:08,978
- Unless you know, you have
to go work with your dad

602
00:51:09,022 --> 00:51:10,502
and I get it.

603
00:51:10,545 --> 00:51:12,069
- No, no.

604
00:51:12,112 --> 00:51:14,071
It's actually not a bad idea.

605
00:51:14,767 --> 00:51:17,204
I can start my own
construction company.

606
00:51:17,900 --> 00:51:20,033
Make him proud.

607
00:51:25,386 --> 00:51:27,562
- Hey you two.

608
00:51:27,606 --> 00:51:29,042
- Hey.

609
00:51:29,086 --> 00:51:30,652
Oh look.

610
00:51:34,047 --> 00:51:36,093
- I've never seen a
baby photo of you.

611
00:51:36,136 --> 00:51:37,398
Cute.

612
00:51:38,269 --> 00:51:40,749
Someone thinks it's cute.

613
00:51:40,793 --> 00:51:42,011
- I didn't say a word.

614
00:51:42,055 --> 00:51:44,362
Alright, I'll see you
guys later alright.

615
00:51:44,405 --> 00:51:46,015
- Goodnight.

616
00:51:48,148 --> 00:51:51,064
Well, it's just me and you.

617
00:51:52,587 --> 00:51:56,025
- Come on lets go
start this new chapter

618
00:51:56,069 --> 00:51:57,592
in our lives.

619
00:51:59,203 --> 00:52:03,337
Law school for me, psycho
babble school for you.

620
00:52:03,381 --> 00:52:05,034
Lets.

621
00:54:31,703 --> 00:54:33,357
- Hey.

622
00:54:35,272 --> 00:54:36,751
What time is your first class?

623
00:54:36,795 --> 00:54:38,405
Did you wanna carpool?

624
00:54:40,886 --> 00:54:43,062
- It's not till 10.

625
00:54:43,105 --> 00:54:45,020
- You good?

626
00:54:46,892 --> 00:54:48,241
- I'll see you later.

627
00:54:48,285 --> 00:54:49,982
- Okay, see ya.

628
00:56:51,277 --> 00:56:53,366
- Leave me alone!

629
00:56:54,062 --> 00:56:56,674
- Jesus Lexi what the
hell is wrong with you?

630
00:56:57,022 --> 00:56:57,979
- I'm sorry.

631
00:56:58,023 --> 00:56:59,894
Let me get you a towel.

632
00:57:00,199 --> 00:57:02,114
- I cannot deal with this.

633
00:57:03,202 --> 00:57:05,160
- I'm sorry.

634
00:57:54,558 --> 00:57:56,124
- Dammit.

635
00:57:56,168 --> 00:57:57,691
Fucking shit.

636
00:58:28,592 --> 00:58:30,550
- Hey whats up?

637
00:58:31,290 --> 00:58:32,465
What's wrong?

638
00:58:32,509 --> 00:58:33,466
- It's Alexis.

639
00:58:33,510 --> 00:58:34,249
- How is she?

640
00:58:34,293 --> 00:58:35,555
- Not good.

641
00:58:35,599 --> 00:58:37,122
- Shit.

642
00:58:52,877 --> 00:58:54,574
Jesus Christ, Lex.

643
00:58:58,012 --> 00:59:00,101
- Where's Alexis?

644
00:59:14,333 --> 00:59:16,161
Alexis.

645
00:59:32,656 --> 00:59:35,180
Mind if I crash here tonight?

646
00:59:35,484 --> 00:59:37,269
- Of course not.

647
00:59:47,888 --> 00:59:52,589
You know I think my
manifestations will go away

648
00:59:53,111 --> 00:59:55,200
now that I figured it out.

649
00:59:56,505 --> 00:59:58,159
- Do you think you
need to see somebody?

650
00:59:58,203 --> 01:00:00,161
Like a doctor or something?

651
01:00:00,205 --> 01:00:01,902
- I'm fine.

652
01:00:03,208 --> 01:00:04,949
- Okay.

653
01:00:07,255 --> 01:00:10,171
Well maybe we can focus on
being a little normal now.

654
01:00:11,869 --> 01:00:14,306
- You don't like normal,
that's why you're with me.

655
01:00:14,741 --> 01:00:16,613
- That's not why I'm with you.

656
01:00:18,702 --> 01:00:19,877
- Hm.

657
01:00:19,920 --> 01:00:21,443
I don't wanna know
why you're with me,

658
01:00:21,487 --> 01:00:23,402
I just wanna know that you are.

659
01:00:42,334 --> 01:00:44,379
Are you leaving?

660
01:00:44,423 --> 01:00:45,206
- Yeah.

661
01:00:45,250 --> 01:00:46,425
I have class.

662
01:00:46,468 --> 01:00:47,818
So do you.

663
01:00:47,861 --> 01:00:49,558
- What time is it?

664
01:00:49,602 --> 01:00:51,299
- Six.

665
01:00:51,343 --> 01:00:54,302
If I leave now, I should
make it to LA by tomorrow.

666
01:00:54,563 --> 01:00:56,653
- It's not that far.

667
01:01:00,439 --> 01:01:02,833
- See you soon babe.

668
01:01:35,343 --> 01:01:38,956
- Oh my god.

669
01:02:20,301 --> 01:02:21,041
What!

670
01:02:21,085 --> 01:02:21,868
- Hey.

671
01:02:21,912 --> 01:02:23,043
Are you up?

672
01:02:23,087 --> 01:02:24,088
- Yeah.

673
01:02:24,131 --> 01:02:25,393
- What times your first class?

674
01:02:25,437 --> 01:02:26,307
Wanna carpool?

675
01:02:26,351 --> 01:02:27,395
You're right by my job.

676
01:02:27,439 --> 01:02:29,049
- It's not the way.

677
01:02:29,876 --> 01:02:31,269
- Lex.

678
01:02:33,097 --> 01:02:35,534
- I really figured
it out this time.

679
01:02:35,839 --> 01:02:36,883
- Lex.

680
01:02:36,927 --> 01:02:39,843
I don't like to
see you like this.

681
01:03:28,239 --> 01:03:30,067
- Hold your horses.

682
01:03:30,545 --> 01:03:31,938
Hold your horses.

683
01:03:37,770 --> 01:03:39,250
Hello?

684
01:03:39,293 --> 01:03:42,340
- Hello, may I speak
to Patricia King please?

685
01:03:42,383 --> 01:03:43,384
- This is she.

686
01:03:43,428 --> 01:03:44,864
Who is this?

687
01:03:44,908 --> 01:03:45,996
- This is nurse
Amy I'm calling regarding

688
01:03:46,039 --> 01:03:47,867
your brother Dorian.

689
01:04:11,195 --> 01:04:12,979
- Hey.

690
01:04:14,067 --> 01:04:16,417
I didn't think
you'd beat me home.

691
01:04:16,853 --> 01:04:18,463
How are your classes?

692
01:04:18,942 --> 01:04:20,334
- Good.

693
01:04:20,813 --> 01:04:22,902
- Well, I don't
have a lot of time.

694
01:04:24,948 --> 01:04:27,254
I can make you some dinner.

695
01:04:27,602 --> 01:04:29,430
Before I go if you'd like.

696
01:04:29,691 --> 01:04:31,128
- It's fine.

697
01:04:39,963 --> 01:04:43,140
- I'm telling
you Ray, something's up.

698
01:04:43,183 --> 01:04:44,706
I don't think she
went to class today.

699
01:04:44,750 --> 01:04:46,360
She's wearing the same clothes.

700
01:04:46,708 --> 01:04:48,449
I don't know what to do.

701
01:04:48,493 --> 01:04:49,755
- Did you call her aunt?

702
01:04:49,798 --> 01:04:51,452
She takes some pretty
heavy pills doesn't she?

703
01:04:51,496 --> 01:04:52,410
- Yeah.

704
01:04:52,453 --> 01:04:53,498
Mood disorder stuff.

705
01:04:53,541 --> 01:04:55,456
Stuff I don't wanna deal with.

706
01:04:56,544 --> 01:04:59,330
I really, really should
have gotten my own place.

707
01:05:00,418 --> 01:05:02,899
This place is starting
to creep me out.

708
01:05:03,116 --> 01:05:05,292
She said she's
already seen ghosts.

709
01:05:05,597 --> 01:05:07,425
- Oh come on.

710
01:05:07,773 --> 01:05:09,383
- Seriously.

711
01:05:10,080 --> 01:05:12,082
I think she's possessed.

712
01:05:12,125 --> 01:05:14,954
- Alright look just, stop
being as nutty as she is

713
01:05:14,998 --> 01:05:16,434
and call her aunt.

714
01:05:16,782 --> 01:05:18,305
- Whatever.

715
01:05:19,132 --> 01:05:20,742
I wanna see you.

716
01:05:20,786 --> 01:05:22,353
- Ha, yeah right.

717
01:05:22,788 --> 01:05:24,833
You miss Pauly.

718
01:05:24,877 --> 01:05:26,966
- Would you stop that?

719
01:05:27,271 --> 01:05:29,360
I really wanna see you.

720
01:05:31,405 --> 01:05:34,365
- Manana, I gotta go.

721
01:05:45,071 --> 01:05:47,030
- She locked me away.

722
01:05:47,073 --> 01:05:48,901
- Who Alexis?

723
01:05:55,516 --> 01:05:57,997
- She's at the
bottom of the stairs.

724
01:05:58,867 --> 01:06:00,652
He will be too.

725
01:06:02,132 --> 01:06:04,699
- Alexis maybe you
should lie back down.

726
01:06:05,309 --> 01:06:07,006
- You don't see her.

727
01:06:07,702 --> 01:06:09,574
Not like I do.

728
01:06:10,053 --> 01:06:12,098
- Okay, I'm calling your aunt.

729
01:06:12,142 --> 01:06:13,665
- Don't call her.

730
01:06:15,319 --> 01:06:17,234
I don't wanna worry her.

731
01:06:18,670 --> 01:06:22,413
Besides, no one
will believe you.

732
01:06:23,980 --> 01:06:27,374
- Alexis, you're really
fucking scary me.

733
01:06:27,418 --> 01:06:28,636
- Shit.

734
01:06:30,725 --> 01:06:32,684
She's here.

735
01:06:33,119 --> 01:06:35,165
- No one is here.

736
01:06:37,080 --> 01:06:38,820
No one is here.

737
01:06:39,778 --> 01:06:42,215
Lex I can't just
leave you like this.

738
01:06:42,259 --> 01:06:43,651
Lex?

739
01:07:23,778 --> 01:07:25,998
- Are you
ready for your bath?

740
01:07:40,230 --> 01:07:42,014
- What's up?

741
01:07:42,058 --> 01:07:43,450
What's the emergency now?

742
01:07:43,494 --> 01:07:45,104
- She's babbling.

743
01:07:45,148 --> 01:07:46,584
I don't know what she's saying.

744
01:07:46,627 --> 01:07:48,455
You need to help her.

745
01:07:52,503 --> 01:07:55,593
I think she needs you.

746
01:07:57,464 --> 01:07:59,423
- Okay.

747
01:08:26,537 --> 01:08:27,886
Stop!

748
01:08:27,929 --> 01:08:29,540
Stop!

749
01:08:32,369 --> 01:08:33,457
It's me.

750
01:09:20,243 --> 01:09:22,201
She's sleeping.

751
01:09:23,811 --> 01:09:25,726
- It's never been like this.

752
01:09:25,770 --> 01:09:27,337
I was so scared.

753
01:09:27,380 --> 01:09:29,252
Thank god you came.

754
01:11:36,988 --> 01:11:38,772
- What are you doing here?

755
01:11:38,816 --> 01:11:39,991
- You said you missed me.

756
01:11:40,034 --> 01:11:41,209
- Really?

757
01:11:41,253 --> 01:11:43,255
You hung up on me,
I don't miss that.

758
01:11:43,777 --> 01:11:46,258
- Come on babe,
I'm making amends.

759
01:11:49,653 --> 01:11:53,309
Okay, well I'll come inside,
see as that you won't let me.

760
01:11:55,920 --> 01:11:56,921
- Shh.

761
01:11:56,964 --> 01:11:58,923
Paul's sleeping on the couch.

762
01:11:58,966 --> 01:12:00,228
- What?

763
01:12:00,272 --> 01:12:00,968
Why the hell is he
sleeping on the couch?

764
01:12:01,012 --> 01:12:01,534
- Would you stop.

765
01:12:01,578 --> 01:12:02,840
- What?

766
01:12:02,883 --> 01:12:04,232
It's 11 o'clock yo bro
wake up, I got beer.

767
01:12:04,276 --> 01:12:05,321
- I told you
something happened with Lex.

768
01:12:08,193 --> 01:12:09,803
- Shit.

769
01:12:09,847 --> 01:12:11,327
Damn she do that?

770
01:12:11,631 --> 01:12:12,850
- Yes.

771
01:12:12,893 --> 01:12:14,155
- I didn't know it
was that serious.

772
01:12:14,199 --> 01:12:16,157
- That's because you
don't listen to me.

773
01:12:16,636 --> 01:12:18,421
- It took me a while,

774
01:12:18,464 --> 01:12:20,248
to calm her down.

775
01:12:20,466 --> 01:12:21,380
- Alright.

776
01:12:21,424 --> 01:12:22,642
That's it,

777
01:12:22,686 --> 01:12:23,991
You guys need to have
this girl committed.

778
01:12:24,035 --> 01:12:25,166
- It's not her.

779
01:12:25,210 --> 01:12:26,385
It's this house.

780
01:12:26,429 --> 01:12:27,343
- Would you stop.

781
01:12:27,386 --> 01:12:28,866
It's her.

782
01:12:28,909 --> 01:12:30,346
She's crazy okay, just like
her mother and her father.

783
01:12:30,650 --> 01:12:32,304
And I don't know what...

784
01:12:32,870 --> 01:12:35,220
- Sorry I didn't mean
to scare you guys.

785
01:12:36,264 --> 01:12:38,354
- How you feeling?

786
01:12:39,572 --> 01:12:40,965
- Much better.

787
01:12:41,008 --> 01:12:42,227
Thank you.

788
01:12:43,489 --> 01:12:45,361
- Hey Ray, thanks
for coming over.

789
01:12:45,404 --> 01:12:47,232
- Hey Lexi, how you doing?

790
01:12:47,493 --> 01:12:49,190
- Good, thanks.

791
01:12:49,234 --> 01:12:50,366
- Good, good.

792
01:12:51,541 --> 01:12:54,282
I'ma take this to the fridge.

793
01:12:57,329 --> 01:12:59,113
- I'll be back.

794
01:13:00,376 --> 01:13:01,202
- Hey.

795
01:13:01,246 --> 01:13:02,552
I didn't--

796
01:13:02,595 --> 01:13:03,770
- Hey, it's okay.

797
01:13:03,814 --> 01:13:05,816
I'm gonna grab a
beer, do you want one?

798
01:13:06,382 --> 01:13:07,426
- I don't think it's a
good idea that you drink

799
01:13:07,470 --> 01:13:08,340
with the medication.

800
01:13:08,384 --> 01:13:10,255
- Will you stop?

801
01:13:12,866 --> 01:13:15,303
Don't do that, okay honey.

802
01:13:17,262 --> 01:13:18,872
I've been going through a lot.

803
01:13:18,916 --> 01:13:21,266
Just been a little
distraught that's all.

804
01:13:22,136 --> 01:13:23,486
I'm fine now.

805
01:13:23,529 --> 01:13:24,878
Okay.

806
01:13:36,281 --> 01:13:37,848
- Oh fuck.

807
01:13:59,478 --> 01:14:00,740
- I knew you'd come around Kira.

808
01:14:00,784 --> 01:14:02,263
Fuck, Lex.

809
01:14:02,481 --> 01:14:03,482
What are you doing here?

810
01:14:03,526 --> 01:14:04,570
Paul's in the other room.

811
01:14:04,614 --> 01:14:06,398
- You were right about them.

812
01:14:07,181 --> 01:14:09,749
So let's get them back.

813
01:14:10,750 --> 01:14:13,318
- No, no, no, no.

814
01:14:14,058 --> 01:14:16,103
- They're fucking Ray.

815
01:14:16,147 --> 01:14:18,062
You and I both know it.

816
01:14:20,717 --> 01:14:22,632
- No, no they're not.

817
01:14:23,328 --> 01:14:24,460
- You're psycho.

818
01:14:24,503 --> 01:14:26,070
Why the fuck would
I listen to you?

819
01:14:26,113 --> 01:14:27,506
- Why do people always do that?

820
01:14:27,550 --> 01:14:29,639
Call someone else crazy.

821
01:14:29,900 --> 01:14:32,337
You came to me first.

822
01:14:32,685 --> 01:14:35,079
So wouldn't that
make you crazy too?

823
01:14:43,435 --> 01:14:44,871
- Fuck you.

824
01:14:56,535 --> 01:14:58,537
Fuck it man this bitch.

825
01:14:58,581 --> 01:14:59,712
Fuck.

826
01:14:59,756 --> 01:15:01,105
Fuck!

827
01:15:03,890 --> 01:15:05,762
Crazy ass motherfucker.

828
01:17:40,307 --> 01:17:42,309
- I don't know if...

829
01:17:46,662 --> 01:17:49,142
I'm thinking of moving to
Colorado after graduation.

830
01:17:50,187 --> 01:17:51,754
There's a company there
that offered me a project

831
01:17:51,797 --> 01:17:53,364
manager position.

832
01:17:53,407 --> 01:17:55,061
A real good job.

833
01:17:58,151 --> 01:17:59,849
- Okay.

834
01:18:01,589 --> 01:18:03,330
I'll come with you.

835
01:18:07,726 --> 01:18:10,207
- I think you need to stay here.

836
01:18:10,990 --> 01:18:12,557
And get some help.

837
01:18:13,079 --> 01:18:14,515
- Hey.

838
01:18:14,559 --> 01:18:16,430
I'll be fine.

839
01:18:20,478 --> 01:18:22,436
I'm making it through this.

840
01:18:33,491 --> 01:18:34,492
Hello?

841
01:18:34,535 --> 01:18:36,015
- Are you okay?

842
01:18:36,059 --> 01:18:37,364
- Yeah I'm fine aunt Pat.

843
01:18:37,408 --> 01:18:38,583
What's wrong?

844
01:18:38,626 --> 01:18:40,977
- It's Dorian,
you're step father,

845
01:18:41,020 --> 01:18:42,413
I don't know how he did it.

846
01:18:42,456 --> 01:18:44,110
He's out Lex.

847
01:18:44,241 --> 01:18:46,069
He was here in my house.

848
01:18:46,112 --> 01:18:48,027
He attacked me.

849
01:18:48,071 --> 01:18:50,029
- Okay I'll send
Paul to come get you.

850
01:18:50,073 --> 01:18:52,031
- No, no he said
he's coming for you.

851
01:18:52,075 --> 01:18:54,251
You've got to get
out of that house!

852
01:18:55,513 --> 01:18:56,775
- Lex what's wrong?

853
01:18:56,819 --> 01:18:58,255
- It's Dorian.

854
01:18:58,298 --> 01:18:59,735
He's coming after me.

855
01:18:59,778 --> 01:19:00,474
- Wait.

856
01:19:00,518 --> 01:19:01,388
What?

857
01:19:01,432 --> 01:19:02,607
- We have to get out of here.

858
01:19:02,650 --> 01:19:04,087
He's dangerous.

859
01:19:04,130 --> 01:19:06,176
- Oh fuck man!

860
01:19:12,486 --> 01:19:14,271
- She locked me away.

861
01:19:14,314 --> 01:19:16,664
She locked me away to
keep him from getting me.

862
01:19:17,796 --> 01:19:19,537
- Oh damn man!

863
01:19:24,368 --> 01:19:27,110
Yo Ray, come on man we gotta go.

864
01:19:29,634 --> 01:19:31,723
I'm serious man we gotta
get the fuck out of here.

865
01:19:31,767 --> 01:19:33,812
Lex's crazy ass pops
is on the loose!

866
01:19:35,901 --> 01:19:37,947
You drunk ass motherfucker!

867
01:19:40,950 --> 01:19:42,865

868
01:19:42,908 --> 01:19:44,214

872
01:19:47,870 --> 01:19:49,001
Oh my god.

873
01:19:49,045 --> 01:19:50,133
Ray!

874
01:19:53,179 --> 01:19:55,442
- Alexis what the
hell is going on?

875
01:19:57,488 --> 01:19:59,795
- He's coming after me.

876
01:20:01,187 --> 01:20:02,841
I'm sorry.

877
01:20:02,885 --> 01:20:04,538
- What?

878
01:20:04,800 --> 01:20:07,237
- Alexis, Kira we gotta get

879
01:20:10,501 --> 01:20:12,024

881
01:20:13,286 --> 01:20:14,374

886
01:20:22,165 --> 01:20:23,601

887
01:20:25,081 --> 01:20:26,430
- Oh fuck.

888
01:20:36,570 --> 01:20:37,833
Oh shit.

889
01:20:37,876 --> 01:20:39,356
Fuck!

890
01:20:39,399 --> 01:20:40,879

We gotta get the fuck

893
01:20:46,189 --> 01:20:47,407
- We have to go!

894
01:20:47,451 --> 01:20:49,279
- No I can't just
leave him like this.

895
01:20:51,977 --> 01:20:53,544
- Paul do something!

896
01:20:54,762 --> 01:20:55,938
Do something!

897
01:20:55,981 --> 01:20:56,895
- Okay!

898
01:20:56,939 --> 01:20:57,853
Alright.

899
01:20:57,896 --> 01:20:59,376
Fucking help me pick him up.

900
01:20:59,419 --> 01:21:01,030
Get the legs, get legs

901
01:21:01,073 --> 01:21:02,422
- Wait, wait.

Lets go.

906
01:21:08,864 --> 01:21:10,213
- Can you be careful!

907
01:21:10,256 --> 01:21:11,997
Fucking idiot.

908
01:21:12,215 --> 01:21:13,259

01:21:38,415 --> 01:21:40,721
- Paul do something.

01:21:40,765 --> 01:21:42,201
- I don't know what to do man!

914
01:21:42,245 --> 01:21:43,724
We gotta get the

915
01:21:43,768 --> 01:21:45,204
Kira we gotta go leave him!

916
01:21:45,248 --> 01:21:46,075
- No!

917
01:21:46,118 --> 01:21:47,293
- Come on!

918
01:21:47,337 --> 01:21:48,947
What the fuck!

919
01:21:49,382 --> 01:21:50,731
Fuck man!

920
01:21:51,254 --> 01:21:53,343
He's already dead we have to go!

921
01:21:54,170 --> 01:21:55,432
Fuck man!

922
01:21:55,475 --> 01:21:57,260
Oh my god.

923
01:21:57,651 --> 01:21:58,522
What am I gonna do?

924
01:21:58,565 --> 01:21:59,653
What am I gonna do?

925
01:21:59,697 --> 01:22:00,611
What do I do?

926
01:22:00,654 --> 01:22:02,134
What do I do?

927
01:22:02,656 --> 01:22:04,354
Fuck.

928
01:22:05,355 --> 01:22:08,053
Where the fuck did Alexis go!

929
01:22:08,836 --> 01:22:10,447
Shit man!

930
01:22:13,798 --> 01:22:15,495
- Oh my god.

931
01:22:23,329 --> 01:22:25,201
- Alexis?

932
01:22:25,462 --> 01:22:27,246
Alexis!

933
01:22:35,037 --> 01:22:36,299
Alexis?

934
01:22:41,347 --> 01:22:42,870
Alexis?

935
01:23:01,324 --> 01:23:02,760
Alexis?

936
01:23:02,803 --> 01:23:04,283
Alexis?

937
01:24:16,442 --> 01:24:18,096
Alexis?

938
01:24:58,919 --> 01:25:00,921
- Where are you?

939
01:25:03,794 --> 01:25:06,927
You sick bastard.

940
01:25:19,505 --> 01:25:21,203
Where are you?

941
01:27:11,226 --> 01:27:13,619
- It's got to stop!

942
01:28:57,941 --> 01:29:00,030
- Aunt Pat look what I found.

943
01:29:01,423 --> 01:29:03,599
I'm clumsy though, do
you have another frame?

944
01:29:03,642 --> 01:29:05,601
- Oh, look how cute.

945
01:29:07,733 --> 01:29:09,256
I'm sure I have a frame
in the attic, I'll check.

946
01:29:09,300 --> 01:29:10,649
- Thank you.

947
01:29:10,693 --> 01:29:13,260
Don't wait up, I have
internship after class.

948
01:29:13,304 --> 01:29:14,914
- You work too hard.

949
01:29:14,958 --> 01:29:19,354
- You know aunt Pat, I really
don't think I need those.

950
01:29:20,964 --> 01:29:22,357
- You're right.

951
01:29:22,400 --> 01:29:24,533
I don't want you over
medicated you have to focus.

952
01:29:25,055 --> 01:29:26,448
Go on get out of here.

953
01:29:26,491 --> 01:29:28,101
Don't be late.

954
01:29:55,738 --> 01:29:57,174
Dearest Dorian.

955
01:29:57,217 --> 01:29:58,828
- Dorian I
hope this letter finds it's

956
01:29:58,871 --> 01:30:00,438
way to you somehow.

957
01:30:00,482 --> 01:30:03,398
Not just physically
but, in understanding.

958
01:30:04,529 --> 01:30:07,010
I don't want to harm Alexis.

959
01:30:07,314 --> 01:30:09,142
She's my child.

960
01:30:09,534 --> 01:30:11,710
But what else can I do?

961
01:30:11,971 --> 01:30:14,452
Who would believe the
evil that's inside her?

962
01:30:18,761 --> 01:30:19,675
No!

963
01:30:19,718 --> 01:30:21,067
Josh no!

964
01:30:21,111 --> 01:30:23,853
I tried to tell you
a million times.

965
01:30:23,896 --> 01:30:26,595
I think she had something to
do with her father's death.

966
01:30:27,770 --> 01:30:30,512
I thought he was crazy
when he tried to warn me

967
01:30:30,555 --> 01:30:32,035
about her.

968
01:30:34,124 --> 01:30:36,431
I really don't know how.

969
01:30:37,388 --> 01:30:39,956
And I know it sounds crazy but,

970
01:30:42,349 --> 01:30:44,526
she drowned Joshua.

971
01:30:47,529 --> 01:30:50,053
Then she came for me.

972
01:30:52,969 --> 01:30:55,058
You were next.

973
01:31:40,538 --> 01:31:41,713
- Baby?

974
01:31:41,757 --> 01:31:42,801
Baby?

975
01:31:42,845 --> 01:31:43,976
Baby, wake up!

976
01:31:44,020 --> 01:31:44,499
- No one would believe me.

977
01:31:46,588 --> 01:31:48,894
No one will believe you.

978
01:31:49,808 --> 01:31:54,813
No one will ever believe
evil is born and lives

979
01:31:55,510 --> 01:31:57,294
in this child.

980
01:31:58,687 --> 01:32:01,864
No one will ever believe.

981
01:32:04,867 --> 01:32:05,345
- Stop!

982
01:32:05,389 --> 01:32:06,303
Stop!

983
01:32:06,346 --> 01:32:07,609
I'm not gonna hurt you.

984
01:32:08,435 --> 01:32:10,002
Where is she?

985
01:32:10,046 --> 01:32:12,222
- She lives in the
house in Victorville.

986
01:32:12,788 --> 01:32:14,311
Dorian!

987
01:32:15,834 --> 01:32:19,055
- Aunt Pat, what are you doing?

7
00:01:36,563 --> 00:01:39,237
<i>and later, Minister of the Interior.</i>

8
00:01:43,837 --> 00:01:44,815
<i>Yes.</i>

9

<i>Your Royal Highness,</i>

20
00:03:46,259 --> 00:03:49,331

21
00:03:49,429 --> 00:03:53,673
<i>It might interest you
that our little son weighed</i>

22
00:03:54,234 --> 00:03:59,206

seven pounds, 200 grams.</i>

23

<i>He measured 52 cm.</i>

24
00:04:01,708 --> 00:04:04,917
<i>Thank God, he's very lively
and always hungry.</i>

25
00:04:14,454 --> 00:04:21,770
<i>September 4, 1906. Heinrich started
grade one at the Cathedral School.</i>

<i>Heinrich was often ill with mono,
measles, pneumonia, mumps,</i>

27
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:30,179
<i>but he caught up,
with the help of Miss Rudelt</i>

28
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:32,944
<i>and passed with a B.</i>

29
00:04:37,844 --> 00:04:40,381
<i>March 12, 1910.</i>

30
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:46,726

00:04:49,689 --> 00:04:52,727

<i>Russia, France, and Belgium
against Germany and Austria.</i>

45
00:05:49,816 --> 00:05:52,126
<i>I lost 10 million.</i>

46
00:05:52,218 --> 00:05:55,529
<i>The game is fascinating

<i>Falk and I want to join the brawl.</i>

60
00:06:56,215 --> 00:06:58,491
<i>At 5:00 pm, Mom and Dad
drove to the train station</i>

61
00:06:58,584 --> 00:07:01,463
<i>to hand out refreshments
to the wounded soldiers.</i>

62
00:07:05,458 --> 00:07:09,406
<i>Gebhard was allowed to go with them,</i>

63
00:07:09,495 --> 00:07:11,270
<i>which made me jealous.</i>

64
00:07:11,831 --> 00:07:16,905
<i>It's not 70,000 Russians
captured in East Prussia but 90,000.</i>

65
00:07:17,003 --> 00:07:19,643
<i>They multiply like vermin.</i>

<i>I Went home with a headache
and didn't go back in the afternoon.</i>

70
00:07:38,458 --> 00:07:40,301
<i>Instead I went' to bed.</i>

71
00:07:41,594 --> 00:07:44,905
<i>People in Landshut
are so dumb and cowardly.</i>

72
00:07:44,997 --> 00:07:48,376
<i>Even the idea
of the troop withdrawal from Paris</i>

73
00:07:48,468 --> 00:07:52,848
<i>made them shit their pants.</i>

74
00:07:52,939 --> 00:07:56,079
<i>I would have expected that
least of all from the Bavarians,</i>

75
00:07:56,175 --> 00:07:58,712
<i>since they are usually so rowdy.</i>

76
00:07:58,811 --> 00:08:01,314
<i>Even a wounded soldier said so.</i>

77
00:08:02,815 --> 00:08:07,457
<i>Gebhard turns 17 today
and joins the Landsturm (militia).</i>

78
00:08:07,553 --> 00:08:12,730
<i>I wish I was the right age.
I'd have gone ages ago.</i>

79
00:08:12,825 --> 00:08:14,532
<i>I look forward to joining them.</i>

80
00:08:14,627 --> 00:08:18,200
<i>I can be useful
to the fatherland out there.</i>

81
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:34,287
People don't like me.

82
00:08:35,448 --> 00:08:40,488
<i>Citizens! Gather to protest
the shame of Versailles!</i>

83
00:08:40,586 --> 00:08:43,590
<i>Germany must give up its colonies!</i>

84
00:08:43,689 --> 00:08:47,466
<i>Germany alone
must accept guilt for the war!</i>

85
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:51,303
<i>Germany must pay billions in reparations!</i>

86
00:08:51,397 --> 00:08:54,344
<i>Germany must eliminate its army!</i>

87

<i>Sick. Fainted this morning.</i>

90
00:09:06,746 --> 00:09:08,521
<i>Horrible night.</i>

91
00:09:08,614 --> 00:09:13,256
<i>Cramps. Stomach pain.
I was moody and depressed.</i>

92
00:09:13,553 --> 00:09:18,093
<i>I never reveal my troubled thoughts
and my struggling soul.</i>

93
00:09:18,190 --> 00:09:22,696
<i>I'm pessimistic about politics,
very pessimistic.</i>

<i>November 10, 1919.</i>

96

<i>I don't know
who I am studying for right now.</i>

97
00:09:36,175 --> 00:09:38,917
<i>I study because it is my duty.</i>

98
00:09:42,949 --> 00:09:46,624
<i>Today I started to regain my equilibrium.</i>

99
00:09:46,953 --> 00:09:49,866
<i>I was accepted into the Apollo fraternity.</i>

100
00:09:49,956 --> 00:09:54,371
<i>It has a very decent national attitude.
Father was also a member.</i>

101
00:09:54,994 --> 00:09:57,736
<i>At the gathering
I sat at the leaders' table.</i>

102
00:09:57,830 --> 00:10:00,208
<i>Conversations about
land reform, degeneracy,</i>

103
00:10:00,299 --> 00:10:02,370
<i>homosexuality, the Jewish question.</i>

104
00:10:02,935 --> 00:10:05,438
<i>I volunteered for special activities.</i>

105
00:10:05,538 --> 00:10:10,578
<i>I drank two mugs of beer
and thanked the chairman.</i>

106
00:10:11,410 --> 00:10:13,117
<i>He said, in a farsighted way,</i>

107
00:10:13,212 --> 00:10:16,716
<i>that it wouldn't be
the last time I'd speak.</i>

108
00:10:22,288 --> 00:10:25,462
<i>7:00. Went to a fencing match.</i>
I <i>wasn't nervous.</i>

109
00:10:25,558 --> 00:10:28,937
<i>I fought quite well,
and technically, I fenced fine.</i>

110
00:10:32,498 --> 00:10:35,945
<i>It turned out
I had five cuts that were bleeding.</i>

111
00:10:36,702 --> 00:10:39,012
<i>I didn't even twitch.</i>

112
00:10:39,438 --> 00:10:41,418
<i>Now I'm happy-</i>

113
00:10:44,677 --> 00:10:48,284
<i>At 3:00 pm We Went for a useless drive
with the other students.</i>

114
00:10:48,381 --> 00:10:52,955
<i>We went to the Reich's Eagle Bar.
It was crawling with Jews.</i>

115
00:10:53,052 --> 00:10:55,498
<i>A dancer came up to us.</i>

116
00:10:56,055 --> 00:10:59,901
<i>She was quiet and simple,
not vain or snobbish.</i>

117
00:10:59,992 --> 00:11:02,472
<i>She's from Vienna, but Jewish.</i>

118
00:11:02,561 --> 00:11:06,008
<i>Still, there was nothing
Jewish in her behavior.</i>

119
00:11:06,098 --> 00:11:10,672
<i>I made some remarks about Jews,
not thinking she was one.</i>

120
00:11:10,770 --> 00:11:14,582
<i>She teased me a bit,
but in a delightful Way.</i>

121
00:11:14,674 --> 00:11:18,053
<i>In a word, that girl deserves respect.</i>

122
00:11:19,712 --> 00:11:23,387
<i>The girls were generally pretty.
Some were even beautiful.</i>

123
00:11:23,482 --> 00:11:25,052
<i>Slutty but stunning.</i>

124
00:11:25,151 --> 00:11:26,687
<i>The horrible thing
about Germany today is</i>

125
00:11:26,786 --> 00:11:29,699
<i>that women don't want
to be mothers anymore.</i>

126
00:11:33,859 --> 00:11:37,033
<i>February 22, 1922.</i>

127
00:11:37,630 --> 00:11:41,305
<i>At 9:00, Apollo voted. I wasn't elected.</i>

128
00:11:41,901 --> 00:11:43,539
<i>Bad feeling in the pit of my stomach.</i>

129
00:11:43,636 --> 00:11:46,480
<i>A terrible feeling of
dissatisfaction and disgust.</i>

130
00:11:46,572 --> 00:11:49,416
<i>People don't like me.</i>

131
00:11:49,875 --> 00:11:51,980
<i>Why? Because I talk too much.</i>

132
00:11:52,078 --> 00:11:55,287
<i>I'm such a chatter-box,
I can never shut my mouth.</i>

133
00:11:55,381 --> 00:11:57,088
<i>Thoughtless and immature.</i>

134
00:11:57,183 --> 00:12:00,596
<i>When will I get a grip on myself?</i>

135
00:12:03,055 --> 00:12:06,002
<i>Last night
I was very somber and depressed.</i>

136
00:12:06,092 --> 00:12:08,834
<i>I wanted to get up at 5:30
to fire a machine gun, but overslept.</i>

137
00:12:08,928 --> 00:12:10,965
<i>I didn't hear the alarm.</i>

138
00:12:11,063 --> 00:12:14,101
<i>I'm ashamed! Is that soldier-like?</i>

139
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:17,044
<i>I'm so weak-minded.</i>

140
00:12:17,136 --> 00:12:21,710
<i>You star?' to think,
“If only there was a war again,</i>

141
00:12:21,807 --> 00:12:26,347
<i>if only I could put my life
on the line, fight,</i>

142
00:12:26,445 --> 00:12:28,516
<i>it would be a pleasure.”</i>

143
00:12:32,618 --> 00:12:34,825
<i>I went to visit Hugo.</i>

144
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:38,925
<i>His little daughter Irmgard
jumps around naked before bed.</i>

145
00:12:39,024 --> 00:12:41,368
<i>I disapprove of a three-year-old
behaving like that.</i>

146
00:12:41,460 --> 00:12:44,669
<i>Children should be taught modesty.</i>

147
00:12:45,164 --> 00:12:50,944
<i>Hugo pinched me because I said
I never flirted, and called me a eunuch.</i>

148
00:12:52,638 --> 00:12:57,280
<i>The young, undisciplined generation
is a serious threat to Germany.</i>

149
00:12:57,376 --> 00:13:00,118
<i>Dear God, turn it back
to how it was before.</i>

150
00:13:03,849 --> 00:13:07,661
<i>Got books. They give me peace of mind.</i>

151
00:13:09,355 --> 00:13:13,064
<i>Read Rudolph Stratz's
The Light in the East.</i>

152
00:13:13,159 --> 00:13:17,471
<i>Everyone has the urge to grow,
but our space is limited.</i>

153
00:13:18,297 --> 00:13:22,803
<i>So, the fight to breed begins,
the fight for space.</i>

154
00:13:23,936 --> 00:13:26,712
<i>When there's another campaign in the east,
I will join it.</i>

155
00:13:26,806 --> 00:13:31,812
<i>The east is most important for us.
We must fight for it and settle it.</i>

156
00:13:36,282 --> 00:13:39,991
<i>Tacitus' Germania,
new translation by Dr. Ludwig Wilser.</i>

157
00:13:40,085 --> 00:13:46,127
<i>An admirable picture: how great,
how morally pure our ancestors were.</i>

158
00:13:46,225 --> 00:13:49,968
<i>We should be like that again,
at least some of us.</i>

159
00:13:50,963 --> 00:13:55,036
<i>Read</i> Oscar Wilde's

<i>He is not only the most talented man,</i>

165

<i>the man of the Nordic race

<i>Dear old comrade,
I had an inhuman amount of work today.</i>

186
00:15:53,953 --> 00:15:59,801
<i>I had to lead and restructure
all of Lower Bavaria.</i>

187
00:16:00,426 --> 00:16:06,069
<i>It is an act of selflessness
serving a great idea, a great cause.</i>

188
00:16:07,032 --> 00:16:11,742
<i>Yesterday I drove to Vilsbiburg.
The coachman picked me up.</i>

189

00:26:11,102 --> 00:26:15,676
<i>Dear, dear child,
I don't write these words carelessly.</i>

331
00:26:15,774 --> 00:26:20,086
<i>I can predict the horrors of the future.</i>

332
00:26:21,913 --> 00:26:26,658
<i>My mercenary will never improve,
but he is loved the way he is,</i>

333
00:26:26,751 --> 00:26:29,391
<i>and your love, if it belongs to me,</i>

334
00:26:29,487 --> 00:26:32,161
<i>gives me the strength and courage
to suffer through everything.</i>

335
00:26:32,257 --> 00:26:34,601
<i>I shall proudly endure my destiny.</i>

336
00:26:34,693 --> 00:26:37,799
<i>I love you very much, Marga.</i>

337
00:26:46,504 --> 00:26:49,951
How marvelous our life will be.

338
00:26:58,216 --> 00:27:00,753
<i>My dear, pure, gracious wife,</i>

339
00:27:01,219 --> 00:27:04,564
<i>this morning I had a meeting
with a party member about the SS'</i>

340
00:27:04,656 --> 00:27:07,933
<i>and the financial opportunities.</i>

341
00:27:08,760 --> 00:27:11,570
<i>When the Jew gives you
the money for the clinic,</i>

342
00:27:11,663 --> 00:27:13,006
<i>please send it to me.</i>

343
00:27:13,098 --> 00:27:15,738
<i>I need it to expand the house.</i>

344
00:27:18,637 --> 00:27:21,777
<i>Hauschild hasn't paid me
for the clinic yet.</i>

345
00:27:21,873 --> 00:27:23,784
<i>A Jew remains a Jew.</i>

346
00:27:23,875 --> 00:27:27,618
<i>Sometimes I worry about
how crass those people are.</i>

347
00:27:27,712 --> 00:27:30,488
<i>ls everyone as bad as my pack of Jews?</i>

348
00:27:32,584 --> 00:27:35,292
<i>My charming, cute little wife,</i>

349
00:27:35,387 --> 00:27:37,890
<i>money is such a necessity.</i>

350
00:27:37,989 --> 00:27:40,162
<i>How nasty and cursed it is.</i>

351
00:27:40,258 --> 00:27:43,034
<i>Don't be annoyed by your Jew anymore.</i>

352
00:27:46,665 --> 00:27:49,339
<i>Letter no. 145.</i>

353
00:27:49,834 --> 00:27:53,179
<i>You good, sweet little wife.</i>

354
00:27:53,271 --> 00:27:57,151
<i>Dear darling, how lovely our home will be.</i>

355
00:27:57,442 --> 00:27:59,285
<i>How fine.</i>

356
00:27:59,377 --> 00:28:02,620
<i>The trees and shrubs have grown.</i>

357
00:28:02,714 --> 00:28:06,560
<i>I'll handle the details
with the painter and electrician tomorrow.</i>

358
00:28:06,651 --> 00:28:09,962
<i>I left you a note
with the windows' measurements.</i>

359
00:28:10,055 --> 00:28:15,164
<i>The kitchen I specified yellowish,
the stairs, blue-gray,</i>

360
00:28:15,260 --> 00:28:19,675
<i>the bedroom, fright green,
the maid's room, a lighter color,</i>

361
00:28:19,764 --> 00:28:22,574
<i>and the guest room, a lighter color too.</i>

362
00:28:23,234 --> 00:28:25,145
<i>How marvelous our life will be.</i>

363
00:28:25,236 --> 00:28:29,651
<i>Our pure, deep love of body and soul.</i>

364
00:28:29,741 --> 00:28:31,846
<i>Dearest wife, how I love you.</i>

365
00:28:31,943 --> 00:28:36,688
<i>All filth will be kept
out of our home, our castle.</i>

366
00:28:37,282 --> 00:28:39,091
<i>Your husband.</i>

367
00:28:44,622 --> 00:28:48,001
<i>As per the order of our Fuhrer
on January 6, 1929,</i>

368
00:28:48,093 --> 00:28:51,336
<i>I have taken over the leadership
of the SS of the NSDAP.</i>

369
00:28:51,429 --> 00:28:54,035
<i>When recruiting SS members</i>

370
00:28:54,132 --> 00:28:57,375
<i>I demand the following criteria:</i>

371
00:28:57,469 --> 00:28:59,608
<i>The minimum age will be 23,</i>

372
00:28:59,704 --> 00:29:02,378
<i>minimum height, 1.70m,</i>

373
00:29:02,474 --> 00:29:04,920
<i>one year of party membership,</i>

374
00:29:05,009 --> 00:29:09,151
<i>written testimony of two witnesses
willing to vouch for the man.</i>

375
00:29:09,247 --> 00:29:12,319
<i>He must also be a good and decent person.</i>

376
00:29:12,417 --> 00:29:16,593
<i>Out of 100 men,
we can take no more than 10 to 15.</i>

377
00:29:16,688 --> 00:29:20,966
<i>We demand a report
on the family's political affiliations.</i>

378
00:29:21,059 --> 00:29:23,665
<i>We require a family tree
going back to 7750.</i>

379
00:29:23,762 --> 00:29:26,800
<i>We will gather as many people as possible</i>

380
00:29:26,898 --> 00:29:31,540
<i>who have the desired bloodline
of the German nation,</i>

381
00:29:31,636 --> 00:29:34,207
<i>and discipline them as soldiers.</i>

382
00:29:34,305 --> 00:29:39,846
<i>Through the land of Germany we march</i>

383
00:29:39,944 --> 00:29:45,553
<i>We fight for Adolf Hitler</i>

384
00:29:45,650 --> 00:29:51,225
<i>The Red Front, beat them to a pulp</i>

385
00:29:51,322 --> 00:29:53,427
<i>The SA is on the march</i>

386
00:29:53,525 --> 00:29:57,473
<i>Beware
Clear the road</i>

387
00:30:02,333 --> 00:30:07,146
<i>So comrades, come rally</i>

388
00:30:07,238 --> 00:30:11,243
<i>And the last fight let us face</i>

389
00:30:11,342 --> 00:30:16,087
<i>The Internationale</i>

390
00:30:16,181 --> 00:30:18,991

<i>Letter no. 152.</i>

392
00:30:22,353 --> 00:30:23,661
<i>Dear Marga,</i>

393
00:30:23,755 --> 00:30:24,961
<i>I went to my parents</i>

394
00:30:25,056 --> 00:30:29,300
<i>to explain the dire need
for street fighting to my father.</i>

395
00:30:29,394 --> 00:30:32,773
<i>Fighting and working
never caused me any harm.</i>

396
00:30:32,864 --> 00:30:36,835
<i>We strive for the revolution.
That's our goal.</i>

397
00:30:39,470 --> 00:30:42,679
<i>I read in the papers about
the street fights in Brunswick.</i>

398
00:30:43,241 --> 00:30:46,313
<i>Why do you want to pick up
the bloodthirsty knife?</i>

399
00:30:46,411 --> 00:30:50,951
<i>Dearly beloved, are you good and decent?</i>

400
00:30:52,317 --> 00:30:54,820
<i>There is one thing you cannot ask of me.</i>

401
00:30:54,919 --> 00:30:59,891
<i>I can? always be as good
as you want me to be.</i>

402
00:31:00,859 --> 00:31:07,071
<i>You should always remain honest.
You nasty man with the black soul.</i>

403
00:31:09,801 --> 00:31:12,873
<i>Gudrun Margaret
Elfriede Emma Anna</i>

404
00:31:12,971 --> 00:31:16,248
<i>was born on August 8, 1929,</i>

405
00:31:16,341 --> 00:31:20,118
<i>by cesarean section in a Munich hospital.</i>

406
00:31:20,211 --> 00:31:25,126
<i>She weighed 3,625 grams
and was 54 cm long.</i>

407
00:31:25,216 --> 00:31:29,255
<i>Blond, blue-eyed, with rosy little nails.</i>

408
00:31:33,091 --> 00:31:38,598
<i>Our good child sneezes just like
her daddy every day, twice in a row.</i>

409
00:31:39,631 --> 00:31:41,872
<i>January 12, 1930.</i>

410
00:31:41,966 --> 00:31:45,209
<i>She now raises her head
on her own and tries to laugh.</i>

411
00:31:45,303 --> 00:31:48,750
<i>She loves baths
and she splashes water everywhere.</i>

412
00:31:48,840 --> 00:31:51,116
<i>All in all, she's very lively.</i>

413
00:31:53,645 --> 00:31:58,025
<i>Before each even)',
the SS lines up in two rows by height'.</i>

414
00:31:59,817 --> 00:32:03,094
<i>SS evenings are followed
by obedience exercises</i>

415
00:32:03,187 --> 00:32:04,632
<i>for at least 45 minutes.</i>

416
00:32:04,722 --> 00:32:06,201
<i>They drill:</i>

417
00:32:06,291 --> 00:32:10,899
<i>standing at attention, turns,
counting, Salutations, et cetera.</i>

418
00:32:10,995 --> 00:32:12,872
<i>Singing is to be practiced as well.</i>

419
00:32:12,964 --> 00:32:16,502
<i>I expect all commands
to be obeyed at all times.</i>

420
00:32:21,606 --> 00:32:24,485
<i>Gudrun's birthday party.
August 8, 1930.</i>

421
00:32:25,076 --> 00:32:29,047
<i>Her grandparents came by bus at 2:30,
as did the Schonbohms.</i>

422
00:32:35,353 --> 00:32:41,065
<i>Gudrun's hand on her first birthday.
She didn't stop moving as I drew.</i>

423
00:32:44,495 --> 00:32:47,408
<i>April 13, 1931.</i>

424
00:32:47,498 --> 00:32:49,569
<i>She likes to visit the chickens.</i>

425
00:32:49,667 --> 00:32:52,773
<i>She's not afraid of them,
not even of the big turkey.</i>

426
00:32:52,870 --> 00:32:56,113
<i>She plays with the livestock
and feeds them happily.</i>

427
00:32:56,207 --> 00:32:59,245
<i>She has learned a lot lately.</i>

428
00:32:59,344 --> 00:33:02,018
<i>She understands most of what she is told.</i>

429
00:33:02,113 --> 00:33:06,357
<i>She likes to work and to help.</i>

430
00:33:06,451 --> 00:33:09,694
<i>She loves her daddy above all.</i>

431
00:33:09,787 --> 00:33:14,497
<i>She always asks, ”Where's Daddy?”
then sadly says, “Daddy is away.”</i>

432
00:33:14,592 --> 00:33:16,970
<i>June 2, 1932.</i>

433
00:33:17,862 --> 00:33:21,207
<i>Darling, your evil husband
can't write you often.</i>

434
00:33:21,299 --> 00:33:25,372
<i>The time until the elections will be terrible.
Don't get angry.</i>

435
00:33:25,470 --> 00:33:29,646
<i>Darling, we will fight for our love,
and everything will go well.</i>

436
00:33:29,741 --> 00:33:32,187
<i>Our paradise,
the one we built for ourselves,</i>

437
00:33:32,276 --> 00:33:34,483
<i>cannot be destroyed by anyone.</i>

438
00:33:48,393 --> 00:33:50,805
Must Uncle Hitler also die?

439
00:34:01,506 --> 00:34:03,918
<i>Chancellor Adolf Hitler.</i>

440
00:34:05,043 --> 00:34:07,717
<i>The leader of young Germany.</i>

441
00:34:09,947 --> 00:34:12,052
<i>Our nation,</i>

442
00:34:12,150 --> 00:34:14,221
<i>our fatherland,</i>

443
00:34:14,318 --> 00:34:16,423
<i>and our fuhrer!</i>

444
00:34:19,457 --> 00:34:22,961
<i>It was already 10:30 pm,
and Gudrun wasn't asleep yet.</i>

445
00:34:23,061 --> 00:34:27,567
<i>Suddenly she said,
“Must Uncle Hitler also die?”</i>

446
00:34:27,665 --> 00:34:31,909
<i>I calmed her and said,
“Uncle Hitler will live for a long time. ”</i>

447
00:34:32,003 --> 00:34:33,482
<i>Delighted, she called out,</i>

448
00:34:33,571 --> 00:34:38,020
<i>”100 years! Very long!
No, Mommy, I know. 200 years!”</i>

449
00:34:39,077 --> 00:34:41,990
<i>When I said, ”Of course,”
she was satisfied.</i>

450
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:45,220
<i>She lay down quietly and soon fell asleep.</i>

451
00:34:53,691 --> 00:34:56,501
<i>That is why
you are doing a good thing</i>

452
00:34:57,728 --> 00:35:03,474
<i>by putting the demons of the past
to the flames.</i>

453
00:35:04,168 --> 00:35:08,446
<i>It is a powerful, great, symbolic act.</i>

454
00:35:13,611 --> 00:35:17,923
<i>My dear son,
you finally gained ground in the fortress.</i>

455
00:35:18,015 --> 00:35:22,361
<i>You too shall receive our heartfelt
and sincere congratulations</i>

456
00:35:22,453 --> 00:35:24,763
<i>for the success and victory

<i>My dear son,</i>

460

<i>I take joy in congratulating you,</i>

<i>now that you
and all your ambitions have been fulfilled,</i>

462
00:35:41,706 --> 00:35:46,280
<i>and our Fuhrer
has won the longed-for victory.</i>

463
00:35:46,377 --> 00:35:50,450
<i>May he continually be granted luck
and God's blessing.</i>

464
00:35:50,548 --> 00:35:53,290
<i>And for you, my dear son,</i>

465
00:35:53,384 --> 00:35:55,057
<i>I wish from the bottom of my heart</i>

466
00:35:55,153 --> 00:36:00,933
<i>that with all the hassle

467
00:36:01,025 --> 00:36:03,767
<i>With tender and loving care,</i>

<i>Dear Heinrich,</i>

470
00:36:18,576 --> 00:36:20,578
<i>may we ask you to forward</i>

<i>our most intimate

<i>for his picture

473
00:36:26,751 --> 00:36:30,062
<i>as we are not allowed

474
00:36:31,189 --> 00:36:36,036
<i>How pleased we are with
every picture of you, my dear Heinrich,</i>

475
00:36:36,127 --> 00:36:41,076
<i>and for the reports on the radio

<i>I cordially greet and kiss you with love.</i>

477

<i>Your mother, Heil Hitler.</i>

478
00:36:51,075 --> 00:36:53,817
<i>I know that there are some people
in Germany</i>

479
00:36:53,911 --> 00:36:57,188
<i>who get sick
when they see our black uniforms.</i>

480
00:36:59,684 --> 00:37:04,827
<i>We understand
and don't expect to be loved by many.</i>

481
00:37:05,756 --> 00:37:09,431
<i>All those who cherish Germany
will and should respect us.</i>

482
00:37:10,561 --> 00:37:12,734
<i>Only those
with the slightest pangs of conscience</i>

483
00:37:12,830 --> 00:37:17,040
<i>for acting against the nation
and the fuhrer need to fear us.</i>

484
00:37:17,501 --> 00:37:20,107
<i>Reichsfuhrer-SS H. Himmler.</i>

485
00:37:26,210 --> 00:37:28,451
THE JEWS ARE OUR MISFORTUNE

486
00:37:32,016 --> 00:37:34,121
DON'T BUY IN JEWISH SHOPS

487
00:37:34,218 --> 00:37:39,065
<i>It is a small international group
without any roots</i>

488
00:37:39,156 --> 00:37:40,863
<i>which sets nation against nation.</i>

489
00:37:40,958 --> 00:37:41,993
<i>Jews!</i>

490
00:37:42,093 --> 00:37:48,374
<i>They are the only group

491
00:37:48,466 --> 00:37:52,778
<i>because they do business everywhere.</i>

492
00:37:59,777 --> 00:38:02,087
<i>We don't have enough children.</i>

493
00:38:02,179 --> 00:38:06,821
<i>A good, racially pure nation

<i>A nation that has many children</i>

496

<i>has the benefit of world power
and world domination.</i>

497
00:38:19,697 --> 00:38:25,409
<i>For a good and healthy marriage,

<i>every SS leader</i>

500
00:38:32,777 --> 00:38:38,250
<i>should adopt
racially, hereditarily healthy children</i>

501
00:38:38,783 --> 00:38:42,196
<i>and raise them in the spirit
of national socialism.</i>

502
00:38:59,236 --> 00:39:01,910
<i>May 10, 1933.</i>

503
00:39:02,807 --> 00:39:06,812
<i>On Friday, our foster son
Gerhard von der Ahé came to live with us.</i>

504
00:39:06,911 --> 00:39:08,720
<i>He is a handsome, lively boy.</i>

505
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:11,317
<i>Puppi wanted to fondle and mother him,</i>

506
00:39:11,415 --> 00:39:15,295
<i>but he disliked it, so he hit her,
and the big fight started.</i>

507
00:39:15,386 --> 00:39:18,060
<i>Unfortunately, they quarrel often.</i>

508
00:39:19,590 --> 00:39:21,729
<i>The boy wants to have everything,</i>

509
00:39:21,826 --> 00:39:24,432
<i>and, although Puppi
gives him some of her toys,</i>

510
00:39:24,528 --> 00:39:27,304
<i>she is quite jealous.</i>

511
00:39:28,065 --> 00:39:31,205
<i>What I demand of you is order,</i>

512
00:39:31,969 --> 00:39:35,883
<i>order in big things,
and order in small things.</i>

513
00:39:35,973 --> 00:39:42,151
<i>Order creates the nation, the culture,
and order creates the state.</i>

514
00:39:42,246 --> 00:39:46,422
<i>The soldier whose uniform is disorderly
will no longer be obedient,</i>

515
00:39:46,517 --> 00:39:49,191
<i>like the soldiers of Bolshevism are not.</i>

516
00:39:49,286 --> 00:39:51,232
<i>We will teach all these things.</i>

517
00:39:51,322 --> 00:39:54,792
<i>Even decent eating,
we will teach the commanders.</i>

518
00:39:54,892 --> 00:39:59,568
<i>I also demand to persevere with education.</i>

519
00:39:59,663 --> 00:40:01,472
<i>No reward without effort.</i>

520
00:40:01,565 --> 00:40:05,980
<i>I expect human kindness.</i>

521
00:40:06,070 --> 00:40:07,879
<i>See yourself as helpers</i>

<i>Dear Heinrich,</i>

539
00:41:40,331 --> 00:41:42,834
<i>you must be thinking,
“It's my father again.”</i>

540
00:41:43,300 --> 00:41:45,576
<i>Dr. Weber, my successor,</i>

541
00:41:45,669 --> 00:41:49,708
<i>spoke to me on Saturday
about a personal matter.</i>

542
00:41:49,807 --> 00:41:52,185
<i>I know for sure that he and his family</i>

543
00:41:52,276 --> 00:41:55,416
<i>always had and still have

544
00:41:55,513 --> 00:42:01,589
<i>Only his eldest son Franz,
a lawyer, strayed.</i>

545
00:42:01,685 --> 00:42:04,632
<i>His parents worked hard
so that he doesn't starve.</i>

546
00:42:04,722 --> 00:42:08,761
<i>He was probably misled by his wife,
to earn some money,</i>

547
00:42:08,859 --> 00:42:13,035
<i>and Went to defend Communists,
though he is not a Communist.</i>

548
00:42:13,130 --> 00:42:17,601
<i>His poor mother was shocked
when, early this Sunday,</i>

549
00:42:17,701 --> 00:42:20,910
<i>six people, and three more later,
showed up at her door</i>

550
00:42:21,005 --> 00:42:24,179
<i>to search the apartment
for weapons, documents, et cetera,</i>

551
00:42:24,275 --> 00:42:26,687

00:42:31,615 --> 00:42:32,958
<i>Dear Father,</i>

554
00:42:33,050 --> 00:42:36,588

556
00:42:40,024 --> 00:42:43,335

557
00:42:43,894 --> 00:42:47,432
<i>Thank you very much.
You were merciful.</i>

558
00:42:49,433 --> 00:42:51,037
<i>Dear Heinrich,</i>

559
00:42:51,502 --> 00:42:55,609
<i>all these petitions are a burden

560
00:42:55,706 --> 00:42:57,686
<i>They depress me.</i>

561
00:42:58,375 --> 00:43:02,585
<i>Today at noon

00:43:05,449 --> 00:43:09,397
<i>concerning the arrest of his son.</i>

564

<i>Please help this respectable man.</i>

565
00:43:12,389 --> 00:43:16,963
<i>Father, the arrest of Brunner's son
was essential.</i>

566
00:43:19,630 --> 00:43:24,773
<i>Dear Heini, on his name day</i>

567
00:43:24,868 --> 00:43:29,010

DEATH NOTICE FOR GEBHARD HIMMLER

570
00:44:18,255 --> 00:44:23,728
H. is absolutely right.
Better to aggravate others than yourself.

571
00:44:40,110 --> 00:44:44,217
<i>Today we are having dinner with 25 guests.</i>

572
00:44:44,314 --> 00:44:48,990
<i>Everything is done poorly.
Heini is livid.</i>

573
00:44:49,086 --> 00:44:52,033
<i>The staff here is terrible.</i>

574
00:44:52,122 --> 00:44:56,229
<i>There are still people like that
in the Third Reich! God, those people!</i>

575
00:44:56,326 --> 00:44:59,796
<i>Heini is absolutely right.
Better to aggravate others than yourself.</i>

576
00:45:01,732 --> 00:45:04,076
<i>Heinrich had to leave early.</i>

577
00:45:04,168 --> 00:45:08,173
<i>He works day and night.
How does he manage?</i>

578
00:45:08,272 --> 00:45:11,685
<i>He is so tired and tense
from all the troubles.</i>

579
00:45:11,775 --> 00:45:16,019
<i>I always think he's not fully appreciated.</i>

580
00:45:18,115 --> 00:45:20,891
<i>All sexual matters</i>

581
00:45:20,984 --> 00:45:24,022
<i>are no longer private.</i>

582
00:45:24,121 --> 00:45:28,763
<i>They are a matter of life and death
for the nation.</i>

583
00:45:29,259 --> 00:45:31,569
<i>Here's a real life example.</i>

584
00:45:32,096 --> 00:45:36,476
<i>Department Head X is homosexual</i>

585
00:45:36,567 --> 00:45:40,140
<i>and is looking for an assistant
from the young clerks.</i>

586
00:45:40,237 --> 00:45:43,184
<i>He won't choose someone
based on his merits.</i>

587
00:45:43,273 --> 00:45:45,776
<i>He won't look for the best legal mind.</i>

588
00:45:45,876 --> 00:45:50,347
<i>He will select another homosexual.</i>

589
00:45:50,447 --> 00:45:54,122
<i>Those people can recognize their kind
across a room.</i>

590
00:45:54,218 --> 00:45:59,896
<i>Homosexuality undermines
the states achievements</i>

591
00:45:59,990 --> 00:46:03,528
<i>and destroys its foundations.</i>

592
00:46:04,762 --> 00:46:08,039
<i>Sadly, we don't have it
as easy as our ancestors.</i>

593
00:46:08,132 --> 00:46:12,308
<i>They only dealt with
a few cases of this perversion,</i>

594
00:46:12,402 --> 00:46:14,780
<i>and homosexuals
were drowned in the swamp.</i>

595
00:46:15,472 --> 00:46:18,316
<i>I've decided.</i>

596
00:46:18,709 --> 00:46:22,213
<i>They will be sent to a concentration camp
per my order,</i>

597
00:46:22,312 --> 00:46:25,657
<i>and shot on the spot
as if they attempted to escape.</i>

<i>Puppi and Riischen

602
00:46:47,838 --> 00:46:50,250
<i>and were so happy.</i>

603
00:46:50,340 --> 00:46:53,150
<i>Time passes quickly with the children.</i>

604
00:46:53,710 --> 00:46:57,385
<i>They switch from sweet to nasty,
from bickering to getting along.</i>

605
00:46:57,481 --> 00:47:00,485

608

<i>We invited the Wedels, the Oswalds,
and Berta and her husband.</i>

609
00:47:21,638 --> 00:47:24,744
<i>We ate dinner
to the strains of Gypsy music.</i>

610
00:47:26,543 --> 00:47:29,649
<i>March 12, 1938.</i>

611
00:47:30,314 --> 00:47:32,555
<i>Heini went hunting today.</i>

612
00:47:36,453 --> 00:47:39,229
<i>We listened to the radio till 2:00 am.</i>

613
00:47:39,323 --> 00:47:41,963
<i>Heini was the first to enter Vienna.</i>

614
00:47:42,659 --> 00:47:44,866
<i>Now Austria is part of the German Reich.</i>

615
00:47:59,543 --> 00:48:03,355
<i>Heini called. He is doing well,

616
00:48:03,447 --> 00:48:07,589
<i>During the night Puppi got ill
and had a fever. I couldn't sleep.</i>

617
00:48:07,684 --> 00:48:11,257
<i>I sat by her bed

618
00:48:11,355 --> 00:48:13,665
<i>so she should try
to get some sleep.</i>

619
00:48:13,757 --> 00:48:17,569
<i>She said,
“At this time yesterday, Daddy went in!”</i>

620
00:48:17,661 --> 00:48:20,198
<i>She meant Vienna.</i>

621
00:48:20,297 --> 00:48:24,837
<i>Obviously the girl

622
00:48:34,144 --> 00:48:36,124
<i>As long as there are people on earth,</i>

623
00:48:36,213 --> 00:48:40,218
<i>humans and sub-humans will be at war.</i>

624
00:48:40,317 --> 00:48:45,198
<i>Biologically, the sub-human
seems to be the same kind of creature,</i>

625
00:48:45,289 --> 00:48:49,237
<i>with arms and legs,
some kind of a brain, eyes and mouth,</i>

626
00:48:49,326 --> 00:48:53,570
<i>but emotionally and spiritually
inferior to any animal.</i>

627
00:48:55,265 --> 00:48:58,303
<i>The sub-human hates the work of others.</i>

628
00:48:58,402 --> 00:49:01,781
<i>He rages against it secretly like a thief,</i>

629
00:49:01,872 --> 00:49:04,785
<i>and publicly
like a blasphemer and murderer.</i>

630
00:49:04,875 --> 00:49:07,947
<i>The sub-human's desires are eternal:</i>

631
00:49:08,045 --> 00:49:09,956
<i>That everything will turn to wasteland,</i>

632
00:49:10,047 --> 00:49:14,325
<i>and the light of knowledge will turn dark.</i>

633
00:49:17,821 --> 00:49:19,801
<i>Regarding the Jews,</i>

634
00:49:19,890 --> 00:49:24,339
<i>when will those scoundrels finally leave,

<i>As long as I run the SS,</i>

<i>during this war
there will be no draft dodgers</i>

642
00:50:15,479 --> 00:50:18,983
<i>or individuals

643
00:50:19,082 --> 00:50:22,222
<i>A master race
must be able to eliminate individuals</i>

644
00:50:22,319 --> 00:50:25,493
<i>who are harmful to society.</i>

645
00:50:25,589 --> 00:50:27,660
<i>We must show no mercy.</i>

646
00:50:27,758 --> 00:50:31,900
<i>It doesn't matter if 7, 000
must be eliminated in one town.</i>

647
00:50:32,696 --> 00:50:34,334
<i>I will certainly do that.</i>

648
00:50:42,305 --> 00:50:46,378

that he is finally being recognized.</i>

660
00:51:56,313 --> 00:52:00,261
<i>I was in Poznan, Lodz and Warsaw.</i>

661
00:52:00,617 --> 00:52:03,063
<i>Muhlenhavel and its surroundings
look terrible.</i>

662
00:52:03,153 --> 00:52:04,530
<i>All is falling apart.</i>

663
00:52:04,621 --> 00:52:08,501
<i>During the Polish era,
nothing was done.</i>

664
00:52:08,592 --> 00:52:10,572
<i>There is so much to do.</i>

665
00:52:11,161 --> 00:52:15,439
<i>These Jewish scoundrels, the Pollocks,
don't even look human.</i>

666
00:52:15,532 --> 00:52:18,706
<i>Pollocks don't die as easily
from diseases.</i>

667
00:52:18,802 --> 00:52:19,803
<i>They are immune.</i>

668
00:52:19,903 --> 00:52:23,942
<i>It is an enormous task
to establish order there.</i>

669
00:52:24,040 --> 00:52:26,077
<i>Heini has too much work.</i>

670
00:52:26,176 --> 00:52:30,818
<i>People will speak of this
a thousand years hence.</i>

671

<i>You may take one suitcase,

Today we visited
the SS concentration camp in Dachau.

686
00:54:01,805 --> 00:54:05,343
POETRY

687
00:54:09,446 --> 00:54:12,256
<i>Your parents' home
should be your home.</i>

688
00:54:12,349 --> 00:54:15,626
<i>Your mom.
Gmund, Tegernsee.</i>

689
00:54:18,521 --> 00:54:22,731
<i>You must always be decent,
brave and kind.</i>

690
00:54:22,826 --> 00:54:27,866
<i>Your father. Gmund, May 18, 1941.</i>

691
00:54:36,539 --> 00:54:40,112
<i>The Lindenfycht home in Gmund.
My parents' house.</i>

692
00:54:40,210 --> 00:54:44,989
<i>All of the SS men address me now
formally as “Miss Gudrun.”</i>

693
00:54:45,081 --> 00:54:47,118
<i>It sounds so strange.</i>

694
00:54:51,921 --> 00:54:55,596
<i>When peace returns,
We will probably get a farm in the east.</i>

695
00:54:55,692 --> 00:54:58,138
<i>That would bring in more money.</i>

696
00:54:58,228 --> 00:55:01,903
<i>Maybe we can even get
a house in Obersalzberg.</i>

697
00:55:01,998 --> 00:55:05,878
<i>The Lindenfycht home
will someday be mine.</i>

698
00:55:06,670 --> 00:55:09,708
<i>Yes, when peace comes,</i>

699
00:55:09,806 --> 00:55:12,787
<i>but that will take a long time,
a very long time,</i>

700
00:55:12,876 --> 00:55:14,753
<i>two to three years.</i>

701
00:55:22,786 --> 00:55:26,996
<i>Today we visited
the SS concentration camp in Dachau:</i>

702
00:55:27,090 --> 00:55:33,097
<i>Mommy, Aunt Lydia, Aunt Frieda,
Roschen, Inge Hammer! and me.</i>

703
00:55:39,536 --> 00:55:45,418
<i>We saw everything.
The vegetable patch, the mill, the bees.</i>

704
00:55:45,508 --> 00:55:50,753
<i>Then we saw the books,
from the 16th century until today.</i>

705
00:55:50,847 --> 00:55:55,159
<i>Then, the pictures that the prisoners painted.
They're beautiful.</i>

706
00:55:55,952 --> 00:55:57,954
<i>Then We ate, a lot.</i>

707
00:55:59,189 --> 00:56:01,226
<i>Then everyone got a gift.</i>

708
00:56:01,691 --> 00:56:03,693
<i>h' was so nice.</i>

709
00:56:04,427 --> 00:56:07,169
<i>A very large operation.</i>

710
00:56:15,372 --> 00:56:17,249
<i>Aunt Lydia and I are alone again.</i>

711
00:56:18,341 --> 00:56:21,550
<i>Daddy is in the east.
Mommy is in Paris.</i>

712
00:56:22,712 --> 00:56:26,387
<i>Yesterday I sat in the last row
in biology class.</i>

713
00:56:26,483 --> 00:56:28,429
<i>During a test,
I copied from a note I had.</i>

714
00:56:28,518 --> 00:56:31,522
<i>Mrs. Zimmer saw it but said nothing.</i>

715
00:56:32,255 --> 00:56:34,599
<i>I thought it was very decent other.</i>

716
00:56:36,292 --> 00:56:40,763
<i>June 15, 1941. My wonderful Mommy.</i>

717
00:56:40,864 --> 00:56:43,344
<i>Before I leave
I wanted to send you a note</i>

718
00:56:43,433 --> 00:56:45,538
<i>and some flowers.</i>

719
00:56:45,635 --> 00:56:49,014
<i>The next time I write,
it will be from Russia.</i>

720
00:56:49,105 --> 00:56:53,383
<i>Here are five chocolate bars
I promised for the children.</i>

721
00:56:53,476 --> 00:56:56,423
<i>Lots of love and kisses.
Yours, Daddy.</i>

722
00:57:11,428 --> 00:57:13,465
<i>My dearest love,</i>

723
00:57:13,563 --> 00:57:18,945
<i>Puppi is only 12 years old,
so she cannot even imagine the war.</i>

724
00:57:19,035 --> 00:57:20,946
<i>She mentions her birthday every day.</i>

725
00:57:21,438 --> 00:57:24,715
<i>With love and kisses.
Yours, Marga.</i>

726
00:57:33,950 --> 00:57:35,588
<i>My wonderful Mommy,</i>

727
00:57:35,685 --> 00:57:39,132
<i>the trip to the Baltic states
was very interesting.</i>

728
00:57:39,923 --> 00:57:44,872
<i>I also think it is good
that our Puppi doesn't fully grasp the war,</i>

729
00:57:44,961 --> 00:57:48,465
<i>but you should tell her about it.</i>

730
00:57:48,565 --> 00:57:50,101
<i>There are huge tasks ahead,</i>

731
00:57:50,200 --> 00:57:53,181
<i>and, as far as distance,
we are only at the beginning.</i>

732
00:57:53,269 --> 00:57:57,240
<i>I sent a package today for Puppi,
our sweetheart.</i>

733
00:57:58,708 --> 00:58:02,019
<i>Lots of love and kisses.
Yours, Daddy.</i>

734
00:58:02,712 --> 00:58:04,988
<i>My dear, beloved Daddy,</i>

735
00:58:05,548 --> 00:58:10,497
<i>I'm so sad you left again
to fight the war.</i>

736
00:58:11,087 --> 00:58:13,624
<i>I hope that you are well.</i>

737
00:58:13,723 --> 00:58:17,068
<i>It is terrible that we are at war
with the Russians.</i>

738
00:58:17,160 --> 00:58:19,265
<i>They were once our allies.</i>

739
00:58:19,362 --> 00:58:22,241
<i>Please be careful and be safe.</i>

740
00:58:22,332 --> 00:58:24,812
<i>You do not need to send us more chocolate.</i>

741
00:58:24,901 --> 00:58:27,507
<i>The postman brought so much.</i>

742
00:58:27,604 --> 00:58:29,311
<i>Thank you.</i>

743
00:58:31,875 --> 00:58:34,412
<i>How the Russians feel,
how the Czechs feel,</i>

744
00:58:34,511 --> 00:58:37,458
<i>does not concern me at all.</i>

745
00:58:37,547 --> 00:58:41,393
<i>Whether other nations
live in prosperity or die from hunger</i>

746
00:58:41,484 --> 00:58:47,162
<i>interests me only insofar
as we need them as slaves for our culture.</i>

747
00:58:48,424 --> 00:58:50,563
<i>If they dare harm one of us,</i>

748
00:58:50,660 --> 00:58:55,370
<i>they and all Polish men
in their village will die.</i>

749
00:58:56,065 --> 00:59:01,913
<i>We will never be cruel
when it is unnecessary.</i>

750
00:59:02,705 --> 00:59:04,912
<i>We Germans
are the only nation in the world</i>

751
00:59:05,008 --> 00:59:07,420
<i>with a decent attitude toward animals,</i>

752
00:59:07,510 --> 00:59:11,424
<i>and we will have a decent attitude
toward these human animals.</i>

753
00:59:13,550 --> 00:59:16,258
<i>Ten or 20
or 100 years from today,</i>

754
00:59:16,352 --> 00:59:19,128
<i>the current German border
will be left far behind.</i>

755
00:59:19,222 --> 00:59:25,434
<i>We will create pure Germanic areas,
just like our ancestors did.</i>

756
00:59:30,266 --> 00:59:34,908
<i>August 8, 1941. My birthday.</i>

757
00:59:35,004 --> 00:59:41,421
<i>We lit 13 candles and the Yule lamp.
Every SS man should have one.</i>

758
00:59:41,511 --> 00:59:45,220
<i>From Daddy I got pictures
of all the German emperors,</i>

759
00:59:45,315 --> 00:59:47,693
<i>stilts, turtles,</i>

760
00:59:47,784 --> 00:59:51,027
<i>a book of traditional costumes
and a basket of roses.</i>

761
00:59:51,554 --> 00:59:54,228
<i>Elke gave me a Shetland pony.</i>

762
00:59:54,324 --> 00:59:57,237
<i>Daddy won't let me keep it</i>

763
00:59:57,327 --> 01:00:01,332
<i>because Elke's parents
want to benefit from our friendship.</i>

764
01:00:01,431 --> 01:00:05,538
<i>Daddy says I 'll get a horse
when there is peace.</i>

765
01:00:14,143 --> 01:00:19,650
<i>Here I am in all my glory!
No tree has leaves like me!</i>

766
01:00:20,483 --> 01:00:23,157
<i>It is evening.</i>

767
01:00:23,987 --> 01:00:29,665
<i>The Jew walks through the forest
with his long beard, carrying a sack.</i>

768
01:00:30,693 --> 01:00:34,368
<i>He picks all the leaves,
puts them in his sack,</i>

769
01:00:34,464 --> 01:00:37,775
<i>and leaves the poor tree naked.</i>

770
01:00:56,819 --> 01:01:01,029
Despite all the work
lam doing fine and I sleep well.

771
01:01:03,526 --> 01:01:06,097
<i>Household expenditures:</i>

772
01:01:06,195 --> 01:01:08,607
<i>salaries, 90 marks,</i>

<i>donations, five marks,</i>

776
01:01:22,245 --> 01:01:23,747
<i>My dear Mommy,</i>

777
01:01:23,846 --> 01:01:28,090
<i>I am so sorry that I forgot
our wedding anniversary for the first time,</i>

778
01:01:28,184 --> 01:01:30,562
<i>but I was so busy these past few days.</i>

779
01:01:31,554 --> 01:01:34,763
<i>I wake up at 9:00, and at 10:00
I get dressed, eat breakfast</i>

780
01:01:34,857 --> 01:01:39,135
<i>and shave while Dr. Brandt
reads the morning mail to me.</i>

781
01:01:41,397 --> 01:01:46,574
<i>8:30-9:30, wake up, tidy up,
stroll through the garden,</i>

782
01:01:46,669 --> 01:01:48,307
<i>discuss all the work
that must get done.</i>

783
01:01:48,404 --> 01:01:50,077
<i>Crafts.</i>

784
01:01:50,373 --> 01:01:54,014
<i>Then working and governing
by phone, radio and telegraph.</i>

785
01:01:54,110 --> 01:02:00,425
<i>In the afternoon, Puppi and I
read the books you sent us.</i>

786
01:02:00,516 --> 01:02:03,588
<i>Every other day at 1 :00 pm,
I drive to the Fuhrer,</i>

787
01:02:03,686 --> 01:02:05,791
<i>arriving at 2:00, and eat.</i>

788
01:02:05,888 --> 01:02:09,836
<i>4:00-5:00pm, work on train on the way home.</i>

789
01:02:12,929 --> 01:02:15,432
<i>Saturday to Tuesday
I visited the training sites</i>

790
01:02:15,531 --> 01:02:17,875
<i>and saw very interesting
new shooting procedures.</i>

791
01:02:18,935 --> 01:02:22,348
<i>In between,
trips of three or more days</i>

792
01:02:22,438 --> 01:02:26,944
<i>to Lublin, Lemberg,
Dubno, Rowno, Luzk.</i>

793
01:03:39,215 --> 01:03:40,888
<i>My dear Mommy,</i>

794
01:03:40,983 --> 01:03:43,088
<i>enclosed please find
a very interesting report</i>

795
01:03:43,186 --> 01:03:46,292
<i>in which our Gerhard plays a role.</i>

796
01:03:46,722 --> 01:03:50,795
<i>He probably can? help it,
but his willingness to lie is typical.</i>

797
01:03:51,460 --> 01:03:55,636
<i>When I write to Gerhard,
should I still sign, “Mother”?</i>

798
01:03:55,731 --> 01:03:59,144
<i>For now I wouldn't sign with ""Mother?</i>

799
01:04:00,403 --> 01:04:03,873
<i>If his behavior improves you may again.</i>

800
01:04:03,973 --> 01:04:07,614
<i>He'll be going to Kovno, Riga and Minsk.</i>

801
01:04:08,311 --> 01:04:12,157
<i>Despite all the work,
lam doing fine and I sleep Well.</i>

802
01:04:12,682 --> 01:04:14,628
<i>Lots of kisses.</i>

803
01:04:14,717 --> 01:04:17,027
<i>With love. Yours, Heini.</i>

804
01:04:37,807 --> 01:04:40,720
<i>Thank you for your lovely letter.</i>

805
01:04:40,810 --> 01:04:44,622
<i>Look, in this picture
you're making a funny face.</i>

806
01:04:44,714 --> 01:04:47,490
<i>You look so, so sweet in h'.</i>

807
01:04:47,583 --> 01:04:52,259
<i>When I look at the picture,
you look straight back at me.</i>

808
01:04:52,355 --> 01:04:55,928
<i>Daddy, come back to us soon.</i>

809
01:04:58,728 --> 01:05:02,369
<i>Letter no. 99a
to the Reichsfuhrer-SS.</i>

810
01:05:02,465 --> 01:05:07,539
<i>I send the following interim report
regarding General von den Bach.</i>

811
01:05:08,738 --> 01:05:10,979
<i>He suffers from hallucinations</i>

812
01:05:11,073 --> 01:05:14,418
<i>related to the shooting
of Jews he conducted</i>

813
01:05:14,510 --> 01:05:17,116
<i>and other harsh experiences in the east.</i>

814
01:05:17,813 --> 01:05:22,319
<i>The severe exhaustion,
and the nerves in particular,</i>

815
01:05:22,418 --> 01:05:26,366
<i>seen in this patient, coming from
the Eastern Front is apparent.</i>

816
01:05:26,455 --> 01:05:30,562
<i>His bowels had to be emptied manually,</i>

817
01:05:30,660 --> 01:05:35,439
<i>as is common when the intestine
has been immobilized with opium.</i>

818
01:05:36,732 --> 01:05:37,733
<i>My dear Mommy,</i>

819
01:05:37,833 --> 01:05:41,645
<i>I had a bad stomachache,
but I'm feeling well again.</i>

820
01:05:41,737 --> 01:05:44,479
<i>These intestinal issues are so disgusting.</i>

821
01:05:44,573 --> 01:05:47,986
<i>Dozens of people on the front
also suffer from it.</i>

822
01:05:48,811 --> 01:05:49,881
<i>Yours, Heini.</i>

823
01:05:58,087 --> 01:06:00,397
<i>Orders to all commanders:</i>

824
01:06:00,856 --> 01:06:05,066
<i>The sacred duty of commanders
is to personally ensure</i>

825
01:06:05,161 --> 01:06:09,075
<i>that none of our men
charged with this grave duty</i>

826
01:06:09,165 --> 01:06:13,307
<i>ever suffers from it,
mentally or emotionally.</i>

827
01:06:14,003 --> 01:06:15,414
<i>This is to be achieved</i>

828
01:06:15,504 --> 01:06:18,610
<i>with the strictest discipline
when performing official duties</i>

829
01:06:18,708 --> 01:06:23,487
<i>and through friendly gatherings
in the evenings.</i>

830
01:06:23,579 --> 01:06:26,355
<i>The nights should be devoted
to German customs,</i>

831
01:06:26,449 --> 01:06:32,229
<i>with the men gathered around tables to eat,
enjoying music, lectures</i>

832
01:06:32,321 --> 01:06:35,325
<i>and the beautiful world
of the German intellect,</i>

833
01:06:35,424 --> 01:06:37,631
<i>to fill their leisure time with joy.</i>

834
01:06:43,332 --> 01:06:45,073
<i>Secret Affairs of the Reich.</i>

835
01:06:45,167 --> 01:06:47,169
<i>To the Reichsfuhrer-SS.</i>

836
01:06:47,269 --> 01:06:50,716
<i>The inspection of the cars
in Group C and D is completed.</i>

837
01:06:50,806 --> 01:06:53,753
<i>Killing with gas was not done correctly.</i>

838
01:06:53,843 --> 01:06:55,823
<i>To complete the action faster,</i>

839
01:06:55,911 --> 01:06:58,084
<i>they push down on the accelerator.</i>

840
01:06:58,180 --> 01:07:01,718
<i>This way,
the prisoners die of asphyxiation,</i>

841
01:07:01,817 --> 01:07:05,162
<i>rather than being slowly put to sleep.</i>

842
01:07:05,254 --> 01:07:06,790
<i>It is now proved</i>

843
01:07:06,889 --> 01:07:10,268
<i>that, when done this way,
death occurs faster,</i>

844
01:07:10,359 --> 01:07:12,771
<i>and the prisoners fall asleep peacefully.</i>

845
01:07:12,862 --> 01:07:17,868
<i>The distorted faces and excretions
are no longer evident.</i>

846
01:07:18,834 --> 01:07:21,872
<i>I'd like to draw your attention
to the following.</i>

847
01:07:21,971 --> 01:07:26,784
<i>The cars are now recognized
and referred to as “death cars.”</i>

848
01:07:36,385 --> 01:07:40,356
<i>It is a horrible slight
for a German to watch.</i>

849
01:07:40,456 --> 01:07:44,199
<i>That's how it is,
and, if it were not so terrible for us,</i>

850
01:07:44,293 --> 01:07:47,900
<i>we would not be Germans,
or even Germanic.</i>

851
01:07:47,997 --> 01:07:50,170
<i>If we lack the nerve now,</i>

852
01:07:50,266 --> 01:07:52,837
<i>our bad nerves
will be passed on to our sons</i>

853
01:07:52,935 --> 01:07:55,245
<i>and our grandsons.</i>

854
01:08:08,451 --> 01:08:12,456
If only they knew how bitter life is.

855
01:08:13,422 --> 01:08:15,231
<i>Dear Sister,</i>

856
01:08:15,324 --> 01:08:20,865
<i>unfortunately, the exceptional circumstances
caused by this war</i>

857
01:08:20,963 --> 01:08:24,376
<i>make it impossible to discuss
the content of this letter in person.</i>

858
01:08:24,967 --> 01:08:27,174
<i>Christmas 1938.</i>

859
01:08:27,269 --> 01:08:30,409
<i>Heinrich and I had a talk</i>

860
01:08:30,506 --> 01:08:33,953
<i>in which we confessed
that we love each other deeply.</i>

861
01:08:34,043 --> 01:08:37,718
<i>ll ls very unlikely that he will divorce.</i>

862
01:08:37,813 --> 01:08:39,759
<i>His daughter is only 13 years old.</i>

863
01:08:40,382 --> 01:08:44,057
<i>His wife can't give him more children.</i>

864
01:08:44,153 --> 01:08:45,928
<i>She is already 48.</i>

865
01:08:46,322 --> 01:08:48,734
<i>The only ones who know our secret
are the Fuhrer,</i>

866
01:08:48,824 --> 01:08:51,270
<i>Martin Bormann and Karl Wolff.</i>

867
01:08:52,228 --> 01:08:54,299
<i>Your sister, Hedwig.</i>

868
01:08:58,267 --> 01:09:00,008
<i>My beloved bunny,</i>

869
01:09:00,302 --> 01:09:04,751
<i>you gave me your dear beloved heart
and your entire self.</i>

870
01:09:04,840 --> 01:09:06,410
<i>I have just one wish.</i>

871
01:09:06,509 --> 01:09:08,352
<i>Despite the obstacles,</i>

872
01:09:08,444 --> 01:09:11,516
<i>may you be as happy as you made me
and make me every day.</i>

873
01:09:11,614 --> 01:09:15,061
<i>I kiss your dear, fine hands
and your sweet mouth.</i>

874
01:09:15,151 --> 01:09:16,789
<i>Yours, H.</i>

875
01:09:20,156 --> 01:09:21,533
<i>My dear, good husband,</i>

876
01:09:21,624 --> 01:09:24,195
<i>I attach Puppi's Christmas wish list.</i>

877
01:09:24,293 --> 01:09:28,366
<i>You can check off what you plan to buy her
and send it back to me.</i>

878
01:09:28,964 --> 01:09:32,434
<i>Now the Christmas gifts
for the SS are being bought.</i>

879
01:09:32,535 --> 01:09:34,947
<i>10,000 bars of chocolate.</i>

880
01:09:35,905 --> 01:09:39,318
<i>Do you know what I want
from you this Christmas?</i>

881
01:09:39,408 --> 01:09:41,217
<i>Yours, Marga.</i>

882
01:09:44,680 --> 01:09:48,321
<i>This year We will celebrate
our first Christmas without Daddy.</i>

883
01:09:48,884 --> 01:09:50,886
<i>Gerhard is coming too.</i>

884
01:09:50,986 --> 01:09:52,932
<i>Daddy called us.</i>

885
01:09:53,022 --> 01:09:57,266
<i>Previously, when I asked Daddy
for my Christmas present,</i>

886
01:09:57,359 --> 01:10:01,569
<i>he said he got me a block of wood
so that I wouldn't be cold.</i>

887
01:10:02,064 --> 01:10:04,635
<i>Will the war be over by next Christmas?</i>

888
01:10:04,733 --> 01:10:06,679
<i>God, keep our daddy safe.</i>

889
01:10:08,370 --> 01:10:10,043
<i>My dear,</i>

890
01:10:10,139 --> 01:10:15,054
<i>I received a package from E. Lorenz.</i>

891
01:10:15,144 --> 01:10:17,124
<i>It was a giant bird.</i>

892
01:10:17,213 --> 01:10:19,625
<i>At first I was shocked by the sight of it,</i>

893
01:10:19,715 --> 01:10:22,423
<i>because I saw myself eating it
for the next eight days.</i>

894
01:10:22,518 --> 01:10:26,625
<i>When I went to thank Erika for the gift,</i>

895
01:10:26,722 --> 01:10:29,225
<i>she told me that it was from you.</i>

896
01:10:29,325 --> 01:10:30,770
<i>Yours, H.</i>

897
01:10:33,195 --> 01:10:36,369
<i>Midnight, and again I cannot sleep.</i>

898
01:10:36,465 --> 01:10:38,843
<i>Thoughts, thoughts.</i>

899
01:10:38,934 --> 01:10:40,675
<i>Mops Wedel died in battle.</i>

900
01:10:40,769 --> 01:10:44,182
<i>Eighteen years old, SS.
His poor mother.</i>

901
01:10:44,273 --> 01:10:47,948
<i>I have not heard anything from Heini
in the last two days.</i>

902
01:10:48,043 --> 01:10:50,683
<i>Mrs. Berkelmann wrote me today.
She's getting a divorce.</i>

903
01:10:50,779 --> 01:10:53,623
<i>Her husband is having a child
with another woman.</i>

904
01:10:54,416 --> 01:10:57,420
<i>Every young girl longs for a husband.</i>

905
01:10:57,519 --> 01:11:00,830
<i>If only they knew how bitter life is.</i>

906
01:11:07,796 --> 01:11:11,437
<i>Well, Sister, the important thing
is that since late June</i>

907
01:11:11,533 --> 01:11:14,514
<i>I'm sure that our wish is fulfilled.</i>

908
01:11:14,603 --> 01:11:17,982
<i>Our child is growing inside me.</i>

909
01:11:18,073 --> 01:11:21,316
<i>How satisfying it feels when it moves.</i>

910
01:11:21,410 --> 01:11:26,883
<i>I love imaging myself holding it in my arms,
and how I will care for it.</i>

911
01:11:26,982 --> 01:11:29,053
<i>I can't even describe it to you.</i>

912
01:11:29,551 --> 01:11:31,997
<i>The way he takes care of me
is so touching.</i>

913
01:11:32,087 --> 01:11:35,000
<i>Sometimes ifs too much,
not even pleasant.</i>

914
01:11:35,324 --> 01:11:37,395
<i>Your sister, Hedwig.</i>

MOTHER: HEDWIG POTTHAST
FATHER: UNKNOWN

917
01:11:49,805 --> 01:11:51,113
<i>My dear bunny,</i>

918
01:11:51,206 --> 01:11:54,949
<i>soon I will call you
so I can hear your sweet voice.</i>

919
01:11:55,044 --> 01:11:59,254
<i>The package does not contain any valuables,
but everything in it was carefully chosen.</i>

920
01:11:59,348 --> 01:12:03,558
<i>I hope our child
will not hurt itself with the rattle.</i>

921
01:12:04,119 --> 01:12:07,032
<i>I love you endlessly.
Yours, H.</i>

922
01:12:09,825 --> 01:12:14,535
<i>Heini was nearby for two days
and didn't even call.</i>

923
01:12:14,630 --> 01:12:18,043
<i>I will suffer and endure everything
for my child.</i>

924
01:12:18,133 --> 01:12:21,945
<i>She is only 13
and should not know how serious life is.</i>

925
01:12:22,037 --> 01:12:24,574
<i>She hears enough things
she doesn't need to know.</i>

926
01:12:24,673 --> 01:12:27,483
<i>Can you still trust and believe a person?</i>

927
01:12:27,576 --> 01:12:29,522
<i>Time will tell.</i>

<i>Letter no. 122a.</i>

930
01:12:37,386 --> 01:12:38,831
<i>Dear Mr. Reichsfuhrer,</i>

931
01:12:38,921 --> 01:12:44,371
<i>it is my obligation to report to you
on the progress of my research.</i>

932
01:12:45,427 --> 01:12:46,633
<i>The method I created</i>

933
01:12:46,729 --> 01:12:50,802
<i>to sterilize the female body
without surgery</i>

934
01:12:50,899 --> 01:12:53,072
<i>is just about done.</i>

935
01:12:53,168 --> 01:12:56,012
<i>This method will enable us
to sterilize hundreds,</i>

936
01:12:56,105 --> 01:12:59,086
<i>if not thousands, of Jews per day.</i>

937
01:12:59,174 --> 01:13:01,780
<i>Out of the 10 million Jews
living in Europe,</i>

938
01:13:01,877 --> 01:13:06,917
<i>two to three million should be sterilized,
and kept alive for labor.</i>

939
01:13:07,750 --> 01:13:09,286
<i>Secret Affairs.</i>

940
01:13:09,385 --> 01:13:10,762
<i>Honorable Herr Professor,</i>

941
01:13:10,853 --> 01:13:13,231
<i>the Jewish females are to know nothing.</i>

942
01:13:13,322 --> 01:13:15,563
<i>As part of a general examination,</i>

943
01:13:15,657 --> 01:13:18,365
<i>you could administer
the appropriate syringes.</i>

944
01:13:18,460 --> 01:13:20,963
<i>About the effectiveness of the sterilization,</i>

945
01:13:21,063 --> 01:13:25,239
<i>in-depth tests are to be performed</i>

946
01:13:25,334 --> 01:13:30,147
<i>in which a female Jew
is locked in with a male Jew.</i>

947
01:13:30,239 --> 01:13:32,651
<i>We can then observe the outcome.</i>

948
01:13:32,741 --> 01:13:33,879
<i>Heil Hitler.</i>

949
01:13:37,146 --> 01:13:38,989
<i>Dear Sister,</i>

950
01:13:39,081 --> 01:13:41,527
<i>I wanted to find a new job</i>

951
01:13:41,617 --> 01:13:44,564
<i>and try to achieve a certain independence.</i>

952
01:13:45,554 --> 01:13:49,468
<i>King Heinrich commented on my plan</i>

953
01:13:49,558 --> 01:13:53,370
<i>that the very thought of me
earning my own bread</i>

954
01:13:53,462 --> 01:13:55,169
<i>was intolerable to him.</i>

955
01:13:55,264 --> 01:13:58,643
<i>Once the war is over,
he wants to buy us a country home</i>

956
01:13:58,734 --> 01:14:01,408
<i>that will always be a warm refuge for us.</i>

957
01:14:01,503 --> 01:14:07,010
<i>He thought of installing a small nursery
or breeding small animals</i>

958
01:14:07,109 --> 01:14:09,111
<i>to make it profitable.</i>

959
01:14:09,845 --> 01:14:11,882
<i>Your sister, Hedwig.</i>

960
01:14:22,724 --> 01:14:26,763
Our good little daughter
should get the gold bracelet.

961
01:14:30,899 --> 01:14:34,244
<i>On the evening of May 20
we were sitting on the terrace,</i>

962
01:14:34,336 --> 01:14:38,045
<i>playing cards and listening to the news.</i>

963
01:14:38,140 --> 01:14:40,211
<i>Someone honked loudly.</i>

964
01:14:40,309 --> 01:14:43,290
<i>”Who has the nerve to do that?”
we wondered.</i>

965
01:14:43,378 --> 01:14:45,585
<i>It was Daddy.</i>

966
01:14:47,649 --> 01:14:51,620
<i>We spent three nights together.
Puppi was ecstatic.</i>

967
01:14:52,488 --> 01:14:56,527
<i>Daddy brought us plenty of fruit,
vegetables, and 150 tulips.</i>

968
01:14:56,625 --> 01:14:59,799
<i>They were striped and jagged,
in two colors.</i>

969
01:15:00,395 --> 01:15:03,467
<i>Mommy showed Daddy the whole garden.</i>

970
01:15:03,565 --> 01:15:06,444
<i>I hadn't seen Daddy
in civilian clothes for so long.</i>

971
01:15:06,535 --> 01:15:08,515
<i>h' was beautiful.</i>

972
01:15:09,037 --> 01:15:11,574
<i>Daddy left this morning.</i>

973
01:15:15,277 --> 01:15:17,553
<i>Headquarters, July 1942.</i>

974
01:15:18,313 --> 01:15:20,987
<i>I order the deportation
of the entire Jewish population</i>

975
01:15:21,083 --> 01:15:23,256
<i>of the General Government.</i>

976
01:15:23,952 --> 01:15:26,762
<i>As of December 31, 1942,</i>

977
01:15:26,855 --> 01:15:31,804
<i>no one of Jewish origin
is allowed in the General Government.</i>

978
01:15:31,894 --> 01:15:35,239
<i>These measures are necessary
for the reorganization of Europe</i>

979
01:15:35,330 --> 01:15:38,777
<i>by its people's ethnic distinctions,</i>

980
01:15:38,867 --> 01:15:42,576
<i>in the interest of safety
and cleanliness in the German Reich</i>

981
01:15:42,671 --> 01:15:45,015
<i>and its areas of interest, as necessary.</i>

982

<i>Requests from other departments
for amendments and exceptions</i>

983
01:15:48,844 --> 01:15:51,347
<i>must be submitted to me personally.</i>

01:15:51,446 --> 01:15:55,519
<i>Heil Hitler.
Signed, H. Himmler.</i>

985
01:16:26,748 --> 01:16:29,752
<i>We have taken the wealth they had.</i>

986
01:16:29,851 --> 01:16:33,765
<i>Obviously, this wealth
was transferred to the Reich,</i>

987
01:16:33,855 --> 01:16:35,232
<i>not to ourselves.</i>

988
01:16:35,324 --> 01:16:39,295
<i>We have a moral right,
an obligation to our people,</i>

989
01:16:39,394 --> 01:16:43,274
<i>to take the people who want to kill us
and kill them,</i>

990
01:16:43,799 --> 01:16:47,372
<i>but We have no right
to enrich ourselves with a single fur,</i>

991
01:16:47,469 --> 01:16:53,215
<i>a watch, a single mark,
a cigarette, or anything else.</i>

992
01:17:03,051 --> 01:17:04,962
<i>August 10, 1942.</i>

993
01:17:05,053 --> 01:17:08,728
<i>My dear Mommy, with the package
you will receive a short note.</i>

994
01:17:08,824 --> 01:17:12,067
<i>The belt is for you.
The basket is for you.</i>

995
01:17:12,160 --> 01:17:16,074
<i>You may like the silver tray,
the bowl, and the silk cloth</i>

996
01:17:16,164 --> 01:17:19,543
<i>in black, blue and white,
and the blue handbag.</i>

997
01:17:19,635 --> 01:17:24,641
<i>Our good little daughter should get
the gold bracelet and the sports dress.</i>

998
01:17:24,740 --> 01:17:29,189
<i>A fur coat is on its way,
as is a cabinet and blue wool fabric.</i>

999
01:17:29,277 --> 01:17:31,985
<i>With love. Yours, Heini.</i>

1000
01:17:47,229 --> 01:17:52,611
Over the next few days I'll be in Lublin,
Zamosch, Auschwitz, Lemberg.

1001
01:18:00,609 --> 01:18:04,716
<i>We were at the gates of Stalingrad,
and now we are behind Kiev.</i>

1002
01:18:04,813 --> 01:18:06,793
<i>What a difference.</i>

1003
01:18:06,882 --> 01:18:10,227
<i>There is a shortage of Weapons
and ammunition everywhere.</i>

1004
01:18:10,318 --> 01:18:12,320
<i>The air force is still terrible.</i>

1005
01:18:12,854 --> 01:18:16,802
<i>Goring cares about nothing.
That flashy guy.</i>

1006
01:18:16,892 --> 01:18:21,136
<i>Goebbels is doing a great deal,
but he is so condescending.</i>

1007
01:18:23,832 --> 01:18:27,541
<i>Soon I will be 50 years old.
I've experienced so much trouble.</i>

1008
01:18:27,636 --> 01:18:30,640
<i>The war has entered a serious stage.</i>

1009
01:18:31,373 --> 01:18:36,254
<i>Stalingrad was the warning sign.
What else is going to happen?</i>

1010
01:18:37,312 --> 01:18:39,292
<i>I believe in the fuhrer.</i>

1011
01:18:39,381 --> 01:18:42,021
<i>Our people are not supposed to die.</i>

1012
01:18:42,117 --> 01:18:45,690
<i>They won't,
even if the internal situation seems harsh.</i>

1013
01:18:46,822 --> 01:18:51,635
<i>We have no allies in Europe.
We are entirely on our own.</i>

1014
01:18:51,727 --> 01:18:55,334
<i>Just imagine what will happen if we lose.</i>

1015
01:18:55,430 --> 01:18:58,309
<i>Some high ranking officers
have already been killed.</i>

1016
01:18:58,400 --> 01:19:01,244
<i>If Daddy -
No, don't even imagine that.</i>

1017
01:19:12,447 --> 01:19:15,291
<i>My dear Mommy, a few quick lines.</i>

1018
01:19:15,383 --> 01:19:18,921
<i>Enclosed are two packages
and a piece of fruitcake.</i>

1019
01:19:19,020 --> 01:19:21,694
<i>Over the next few days
I will be in Lublin, Zamosch,</i>

1020
01:19:21,790 --> 01:19:23,895
<i>Auschwitz and Lemberg.</i>

1021
01:19:24,426 --> 01:19:27,873
<i>I wonder if I will be able to call.</i>

1022
01:19:27,963 --> 01:19:31,467
<i>I'll be around 2,000 km from Gmund.</i>

1023
01:19:31,566 --> 01:19:35,810
<i>All my love. Have good days
in Gmund with our dear daughter.</i>

1024
01:19:36,671 --> 01:19:39,743
<i>Many warm greetings and kisses.
Yours, Daddy.</i>

1025
01:19:45,714 --> 01:19:47,955
<i>Dear party member Himmler,</i>

1026
01:19:48,049 --> 01:19:51,030
<i>in the wake of my visit
to the Auschwitz camp,</i>

1027
01:19:51,119 --> 01:19:54,498
<i>I am willing to allocate the following
on a one-time basis only:</i>

1028
01:19:54,589 --> 01:19:57,263
<i>1,000 tons of structural steel,</i>

1029
01:19:57,359 --> 01:20:00,897
<i>about 100 tons of water pipe.</i>

1030
01:20:00,996 --> 01:20:04,967
<i>This steel is for the expansion
of the concentration camps only,</i>

1031
01:20:05,066 --> 01:20:07,706
<i>Auschwitz in particular.</i>

1032
01:20:07,803 --> 01:20:10,647
<i>Heil Hitler!
Yours, Speer.</i>

1033
01:20:12,073 --> 01:20:16,283
<i>Dear party comrade Speer,
thank you very much for your letter</i>

1034
01:20:16,378 --> 01:20:19,086
<i>and for the allocation
of additional amounts of steel,</i>

1035
01:20:19,181 --> 01:20:22,253
<i>particularly for the expansion
of the Auschwitz camp.</i>

1036
01:20:22,350 --> 01:20:24,523
<i>Your words have strengthened
my conviction</i>

1037
01:20:24,619 --> 01:20:26,758
<i>that there is still justice in the world.</i>

1038
01:20:26,855 --> 01:20:30,029
<i>Heil Hitler!
Yours, H. Himmler.</i>

1039
01:20:44,039 --> 01:20:47,680
<i>My dear husband,
there were air raids.</i>

1040
01:20:47,776 --> 01:20:49,255
<i>Thank you.</i>

1041
01:20:49,945 --> 01:20:53,188
<i>Please order at least
four food coupons for us.</i>

1042
01:20:53,281 --> 01:20:55,488
<i>We are entitled to them.</i>

1043
01:20:55,584 --> 01:20:58,258
<i>We have alarms almost every day,</i>

1044
01:20:58,353 --> 01:21:00,663
<i>once every four hours.</i>

1045
01:21:02,657 --> 01:21:05,331
<i>Here is a silver stripe
which fell into our garden in Munich</i>

1046
01:21:05,427 --> 01:21:08,169
<i>during the last air strike.</i>

1047
01:21:09,998 --> 01:21:13,411
<i>Everyone is getting medals and decorations,
except for Daddy.</i>

1048
01:21:13,501 --> 01:21:16,573
<i>He should be the first to get one.</i>

1049
01:21:16,671 --> 01:21:20,448
<i>If not for him,
so much would be different.</i>

1050
01:21:26,047 --> 01:21:28,027
<i>Dear Mommy,</i>

1051
01:21:28,116 --> 01:21:30,596
<i>I always feel sorry
when I sleep well</i>

1052
01:21:30,685 --> 01:21:33,131
<i>and hear in the morning
that there were air strikes.</i>

1053
01:21:33,221 --> 01:21:37,567
<i>The food coupons are included.
Be assured, all will be fine.</i>

1054
01:21:37,659 --> 01:21:39,263
<i>I'm working more than ever.</i>

1055
01:21:39,361 --> 01:21:42,274
<i>Try to recuperate,
you and our dear daughter.</i>

1056
01:21:42,364 --> 01:21:45,470
<i>Lots of love and kisses.
Yours, Daddy.</i>

1057
01:21:56,845 --> 01:22:01,726
But everyone believes
firmly in victory (Daddy).

1058
01:22:21,002 --> 01:22:22,879
<i>June 1944.</i>

1059
01:22:23,538 --> 01:22:27,042
<i>The invasion started
on the night of the 5th</i>

1060
01:22:27,142 --> 01:22:28,917
<i>in Normandy, by the Channel.</i>

1061
01:22:29,010 --> 01:22:31,115
<i>We have already given up Cherbourg.</i>

1062
01:22:31,212 --> 01:22:33,351
<i>The Russians
want to take over the Baltic Sea.</i>

1063
01:22:33,448 --> 01:22:36,258
<i>The way they treat people is unspeakable.</i>

1064
01:22:37,085 --> 01:22:39,463
<i>Dear party member Gieseler,</i>

1065
01:22:40,155 --> 01:22:43,432
<i>I am definitely not the anxious type.</i>

1066
01:22:43,525 --> 01:22:47,803
<i>Still, I decided
to build the bunker in Gmund.</i>

1067
01:22:48,229 --> 01:22:53,269
<i>I believe it may be that the enemy,
who knows the location of our houses,</i>

1068
01:22:53,368 --> 01:22:55,746
<i>will launch an air strike</i>

1069
01:22:55,837 --> 01:23:00,980
<i>in order to destroy the house
with its residents,</i>

1070
01:23:01,076 --> 01:23:03,113
<i>including me.</i>

1071
01:23:03,545 --> 01:23:08,619
<i>I highly appreciate the fact
that you abandoned all formalities to help me.</i>

1072
01:23:08,717 --> 01:23:10,993
<i>I express my deepest gratitude.</i>

1073
01:23:11,086 --> 01:23:13,794
<i>With regards and Heil Hitler.</i>

1074
01:23:13,888 --> 01:23:16,300
<i>Yours, H. Himmler.</i>

1075
01:23:18,393 --> 01:23:19,872
FOR FREEDOM AND LIFE

1076
01:23:20,662 --> 01:23:22,198
PEOPLE'S ARMY

1077
01:23:31,740 --> 01:23:35,779
<i>A telegram came yesterday.
A place was found for Gerhard.</i>

1078
01:23:36,478 --> 01:23:40,984
<i>Whether he can come by
before he is sent to the front is questionable.</i>

1079
01:23:41,082 --> 01:23:44,154
<i>He is very brave
and likes it' in the SS in Brunn.</i>

1080
01:23:44,652 --> 01:23:47,064
<i>I think he has become nicer.</i>

1081
01:23:48,590 --> 01:23:50,228
<i>The fuhrer cannot believe</i>

1082
01:23:50,325 --> 01:23:52,566
<i>that the German soldier
doesn't want to flight anymore.</i>

1083
01:23:55,296 --> 01:23:57,207
<i>Daddy believes firmly in our victory.</i>

1084
01:23:57,298 --> 01:24:00,939
<i>It is impossible to imagine
that we could lose the war.</i>

1085
01:24:02,504 --> 01:24:05,542
<i>Whenever the situation gets serious,
he needs to help.</i>

1086
01:24:06,207 --> 01:24:08,244
<i>All of Germany is looking up to him.</i>

1087
01:24:09,277 --> 01:24:12,747
<i>Yet he is happy and in good spirits
when he calls.</i>

1088
01:24:14,983 --> 01:24:18,192
<i>My dear, good Mommy.
My dearest Puppi.</i>

1089
01:24:18,286 --> 01:24:21,358
<i>Despite the overwhelming
and severe situation,</i>

1090
01:24:21,456 --> 01:24:24,699
<i>I am convinced we will win.</i>

1091
01:24:25,960 --> 01:24:30,204
<i>I am attaching a beautiful poem
called Redemption.</i>

1092
01:24:30,298 --> 01:24:32,574
<i>Puppi should read it too.</i>

1093
01:24:36,805 --> 01:24:38,443
Redemption.

1094
01:24:39,074 --> 01:24:43,682
<i>From the Metz Cathedral,
it echoed four times from the clock tower.</i>

1095
01:24:43,778 --> 01:24:45,280
<i>Redemption.</i>

1096
01:24:46,381 --> 01:24:50,693
<i>Redeemed is the ancient,
the old mighty imperial sword.</i>

1097
01:24:50,785 --> 01:24:52,992
<i>Germany again holds sway,</i>

1098
01:24:53,688 --> 01:24:57,830
<i>the respect you once held.</i>

1099
01:24:58,893 --> 01:25:05,071
<i>Redemption,
and the German resumes his old post.</i>

1100
01:25:05,800 --> 01:25:13,412
<i>The evening mist still glimmers in the west.
On the Moselle, day breaks in the east.</i>

1101
01:25:14,375 --> 01:25:19,723
<i>And the future, German people, is yours.</i>

1102
01:25:19,814 --> 01:25:22,158
SURRENDER?
NO

1103
01:25:23,585 --> 01:25:28,056
<i>Baumert wanted to persuade Mom
to go to Valepp under a false name.</i>

1104
01:25:28,723 --> 01:25:31,670
<i>Wherever we go
must be kept completely secret.</i>

1105
01:25:33,962 --> 01:25:36,499
<i>I'm still here because Heini wants it.</i>

1106
01:25:36,931 --> 01:25:40,276
<i>I worry about my work and my reputation.</i>

1107
01:25:40,969 --> 01:25:43,245
<i>If you don't perform your duty
in the face of danger,</i>

1108
01:25:43,338 --> 01:25:46,376
<i>people despise you, and they're right.</i>

1109
01:25:47,976 --> 01:25:50,354
<i>Today I stayed in bed until noon.</i>

1110
01:25:50,445 --> 01:25:55,190
<i>Mommy doesn't like it when I lie down,
but I still do it anyway.</i>

1111
01:25:55,283 --> 01:25:58,730
<i>There is a lot going on in the world,
and especially at home.</i>

1112
01:25:58,820 --> 01:26:02,996
<i>In brief,
on the 24th in the evening.</i>

1113
01:26:06,060 --> 01:26:08,700
<i>April 17, 1945.</i>

1114
01:26:09,931 --> 01:26:13,743
<i>My love, dear Mommy.
My love, dear Daughter.</i>

1115
01:26:14,769 --> 01:26:18,273
<i>Mr. Baumert is driving down
so I have the chance to send you this letter.</i>

1116
01:26:19,407 --> 01:26:22,047
<i>He will tell Mommy a lot in person.</i>

1117
01:26:22,744 --> 01:26:27,215
<i>Still, he should bring a note
with this little package.</i>

1118
01:26:27,782 --> 01:26:31,059
<i>Times are tremendously hard
for all of us and yet,</i>

1119
01:26:31,352 --> 01:26:35,357
<i>it will, I firmly believe,
still turn out right.</i>

1120
01:26:36,891 --> 01:26:39,030
<i>But it is hard.</i>

1121
01:26:39,694 --> 01:26:42,038
<i>You, my loved ones, stay healthy.</i>

1122
01:26:42,797 --> 01:26:46,973
<i>The Ancient One will protect us,
especially the good German nation.</i>

1123
01:26:47,068 --> 01:26:49,241
<i>He will not lea' us fall.</i>

1124
01:26:50,205 --> 01:26:53,846
<i>I am sending you, my beloved Mommy,
and you, Puppi, my dear,</i>

1125
01:26:53,942 --> 01:26:57,981
<i>much love, kisses and greetings.</i>

1126
01:26:58,079 --> 01:26:59,558
<i>Heil Hitler.</i>

1127
01:26:59,647 --> 01:27:03,060
<i>With love. Yours, Daddy.</i>

1128
01:27:23,705 --> 01:27:26,686
<i>I think, gentlemen,
that you know me long enough</i>

1129
01:27:26,774 --> 01:27:29,380
<i>to know that I am not a bloodthirsty man</i>

1130
01:27:29,477 --> 01:27:36,258
<i>and not someone who
takes pleasure in difficult duties.</i>

1131
01:27:36,351 --> 01:27:39,730
<i>But on the other hand,
I have such strong nerves</i>

1132
01:27:39,821 --> 01:27:42,859
<i>and such a great sense of duty,</i>

1133
01:27:42,957 --> 01:27:45,301
<i>I might say,</i>

1134
01:27:46,327 --> 01:27:50,707
<i>that when I recognize something
as being essential,</i>

1135
01:27:50,798 --> 01:27:53,074
<i>I execute it without compromise.</i>

1136
01:27:56,638 --> 01:27:58,743
<i>Most of you will know</i>

1137
01:27:58,840 --> 01:28:01,252
<i>What it means
when a hundred corpses lie side by side,</i>

1138
01:28:01,342 --> 01:28:04,050
<i>whether there are 500 or 1,000.</i>

1139
01:28:05,680 --> 01:28:07,057
<i>And...</i>

1140
01:28:08,082 --> 01:28:11,620
<i>to endure that</i>

1141
01:28:13,221 --> 01:28:18,796
<i>and, apart from a few exceptions,</i>

1142
01:28:18,893 --> 01:28:21,499
<i>to remain decent,</i>

1143
01:28:22,664 --> 01:28:28,740
<i>has made us tough,
but it is never mentioned,</i>

1144
01:28:28,836 --> 01:28:31,976
<i>and will never appear
in the glorious annals of history.</i>

1145
01:28:32,674 --> 01:28:37,714
<i>We can have but one desire
as to what is said about us.</i>

1146
01:28:37,812 --> 01:28:41,123
<i>These German officers,
these German soldiers,</i>

1147
01:28:41,215 --> 01:28:43,217
<i>these German generals,</i>

1148
01:28:43,318 --> 01:28:45,764
<i>they were decent.</i>

1149
01:29:12,080 --> 01:29:15,118
<i>I think that for the camps,
it was my husband.</i>

1150
01:29:20,588 --> 01:29:23,034
<i>Sure. We talked about the war.</i>

1151
01:29:27,695 --> 01:29:29,231
<i>No, never.</i>

1152
01:29:34,969 --> 01:29:37,347
<i>No. We never talked about that.</i>

1153
01:29:40,775 --> 01:29:42,812
<i>Well, I knew nothing about it.</i>

1154
01:29:47,448 --> 01:29:49,758
<i>I don 't know.</i>

00:00:32,825 --> 00:00:39,074
<i> I'LL TAKE HER LIKE A FATHER </i>

2
00:01:54,851 --> 00:01:57,936
- A bunch of idiots, that's what you are! 
- What?

3
00:01:57,960 --> 00:02:00,802
You're a bunch of idiots,
blind and deaf!

4
00:02:00,826 --> 00:02:04,020
You're right! 
Counselor, I said you're right! I know!

5
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:07,803
This is like South African gold,
Rhur coal, Texas oil.

6
00:02:07,862 --> 00:02:11,401
- You should thank me.
- And we do, Counselor.

7
00:02:11,425 --> 00:02:13,560
- Thank you!
- You're welcome.

8
00:02:13,584 --> 00:02:16,498
Let the north bust
its balls with factories,

9
00:02:16,522 --> 00:02:19,027
strikes, oil that doesn't exist.

10
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:23,496
All of Europe must come here
to get drunk on real sun,

11
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:27,929
genuine wine, clean sea.
Take Mazzacolli's word for it!

12
00:02:28,131 --> 00:02:32,296
150 singles, 100 doubles,
50 apartments, a dock, a marina.

13
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:35,407
- Sailing, hiking, water skiing…
- A magnificent, grand project.

14
00:02:35,432 --> 00:02:38,635
Pools, tennis and sports courts,
saunas, mini zoos, mini safaris.

15
00:02:38,819 --> 00:02:40,759
Where do I find
the space for all that?

16
00:02:40,924 --> 00:02:43,235
Either make let me maximize this
or we'll take that.

17
00:02:43,259 --> 00:02:45,504
But Counselor Mazzacolli,
how can we?

18
00:02:45,528 --> 00:02:49,336
My lord, this is an agricultural area
and I'm not God Almighty!

19
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:52,441
This belongs to the Spina-Tommaselli
and who can touch it?

20
00:02:52,465 --> 00:02:55,035
Dear Di Corato, I'll touch it.
I'll pay in cash.

21
00:02:55,059 --> 00:02:56,825
And I will also buy them!

22
00:02:56,849 --> 00:03:01,216
Yes, the Spina-Tommaselli are like
a bone that sticks in your throat!

23
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:04,655
Spina! Spina! It's like all
the province belongs to them.

24
00:03:04,722 --> 00:03:07,696
- Not all but half of it.
- Can I drive, Counselor?

25
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:09,520
- Alright.
- Thank you.

26
00:03:12,684 --> 00:03:14,034
Be careful, eh?

27
00:03:18,450 --> 00:03:20,683
RIVA TOPAZIA S.p.A
DIRECTOR GENERAL

28
00:03:28,098 --> 00:03:30,542
You'll never touch
this steering wheel again.

29
00:03:30,566 --> 00:03:33,502
- It's not a bumper car.
- Here, Counselor!

30
00:03:33,793 --> 00:03:35,356
This way, Sir.

31
00:03:38,241 --> 00:03:41,536
I get it: You're quick, hold your own,
ambitious and rotten to the core.

32
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:43,704
If you listen and study,
I'll make something of you.

33
00:03:43,728 --> 00:03:46,200
- In 10 years, you'll be rich.
- 10 years?

34
00:03:46,224 --> 00:03:48,936
See that? You're in too
much of a rush, Surveyor.

35
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:50,602
You want it all right now. Study!

36
00:03:50,626 --> 00:03:52,897
- Hi, Concetta!
- Counselor!

37
00:03:52,961 --> 00:03:55,856
They wanted you from Rome.
From the Bregonzo Office.

38
00:03:55,880 --> 00:03:58,776
They said it's very urgent
and you must call back soon.

39
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:01,841
- Don Amilcare wanted you too.
- Well done, Concettina.

40
00:04:01,865 --> 00:04:03,561
He said it's urgent too.

41
00:04:04,582 --> 00:04:07,163
And if you don't mind,
this is urgent too.

42
00:04:07,187 --> 00:04:08,924
What's got into your head?

43
00:04:08,997 --> 00:04:10,997
Dear Guercioli, how are you?

44
00:04:11,464 --> 00:04:13,958
I'd like Bregonzo. He's not in?

45
00:04:14,273 --> 00:04:16,388
Then the list of the new ministry?

46
00:04:16,460 --> 00:04:18,923
Still not final? Christ!

47
00:04:19,009 --> 00:04:21,424
Tell me… Go on and tell me!

48
00:04:24,412 --> 00:04:26,636
Damn, I don't give
a shit about Healthcare!

49
00:04:26,660 --> 00:04:29,314
What can I do with Bregonzo
at the Ministry of Health?

50
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:32,960
No, Guerc… Guercioli, please,
call back in an hour, eh?

51
00:04:33,767 --> 00:04:35,089
Yeah, Healthcare…

52
00:04:35,113 --> 00:04:37,904
The Ministry of Health is
poorer than Fund for the South.

53
00:04:38,066 --> 00:04:42,136
Even if diseases are a good game.
I could turn it into a hospital complex:

54
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:45,301
Luxury clinics, check-ups,
total transplants, hormones,

55
00:04:45,518 --> 00:04:49,581
spas, rejuvenation, in short,
a brothel for old billionaires.

56
00:04:49,605 --> 00:04:51,543
- It's an idea.
- No, it's a fraud.

57
00:04:51,567 --> 00:04:52,909
Shut up and study!

58
00:04:56,640 --> 00:05:02,095
Blessed art thou among women and
blessed is the fruit of thy womb, Jesus.

59
00:05:02,119 --> 00:05:04,067
Holy Mary, mother of God,

60
00:05:04,091 --> 00:05:08,176
pray for us sinners, now
and at the hour of our death.

61
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:09,456
Amen.

62
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:14,576
Hail Mary, full of grace,
the Lord is with thee.

63
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:18,140
Blessed art thou among women and
blessed is the fruit of thy womb, Jesus.

64
00:05:18,164 --> 00:05:19,610
Holy Mary, mother of God,

65
00:05:19,634 --> 00:05:23,450
pray for us sinners, now
and at the hour of our death.

66
00:05:34,532 --> 00:05:36,104
Heal us, Lord.

67
00:05:36,128 --> 00:05:39,456
Let all the saints heal us:
Orontius, Justus, Fortunatus…

68
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:44,518
- Grace! Grace, Jesus!
- Lorè, what manners! Manners.

69
00:05:44,542 --> 00:05:46,965
With the heart, Lorè!
Pray with your heart!

70
00:05:46,989 --> 00:05:48,583
Yes, yes…

71
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:50,170
Useless fool!

72
00:05:51,594 --> 00:05:54,576
- The novena all together.
- Holy Mother of God.

73
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:56,162
Pray for us!

74
00:05:56,186 --> 00:05:59,509
- St Orontius, the Martyr.
- Pray for us.

75
00:06:02,637 --> 00:06:05,764
And so your wait is over,
dear Saverio.

76
00:06:05,818 --> 00:06:08,656
Soon you'll meet
Donna Raimonda Spina.

77
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:11,567
But if you want my advice,
just get to know her.

78
00:06:11,591 --> 00:06:15,737
Don't talk about business, please,
unless she starts the conversation.

79
00:06:15,899 --> 00:06:18,408
You need tact, Saverio. Tact!

80
00:06:19,298 --> 00:06:22,594
- And if she doesn't talk about it?
- Don't make any false moves.

81
00:06:22,618 --> 00:06:25,468
Once I've introduced you,
everything will be easier.

82
00:06:25,492 --> 00:06:28,153
Concetta, when you've done having
your ass fondled by the counselor,

83
00:06:28,177 --> 00:06:29,971
I'd like some more fish.

84
00:06:35,211 --> 00:06:37,565
And from Rome?
What news do we have?

85
00:06:37,589 --> 00:06:38,855
It's hard.

86
00:06:38,879 --> 00:06:41,650
They've made and unmade
the government list a dozen times,

87
00:06:41,674 --> 00:06:44,176
as if they were turning
their balls upside down…

88
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:46,476
- Ah, well…
- Sorry, Concetti'.

89
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:48,315
- The product's changed.
- It has.

90
00:06:48,339 --> 00:06:51,530
What do you do if Bregonzo
isn't confirmed in the South?

91
00:06:51,618 --> 00:06:53,945
- I'll cut off ""my ministers"".
- And spite me?

92
00:06:53,969 --> 00:06:56,096
Who has, respectfully speaking,
married you:

93
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:58,148
You and Emerald Shores.

94
00:06:58,172 --> 00:07:00,259
It was a love marriage,
Don Amilcare,

95
00:07:00,283 --> 00:07:03,816
because respectfully speaking,
what did you get me? Debts, mortgages…

96
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:06,167
And the Loyola name, dear Saverio.

97
00:07:06,191 --> 00:07:08,178
That's not yet mortgaged.

98
00:07:26,147 --> 00:07:29,970
Come, Clo, come on.
We must get dressed.

99
00:07:44,491 --> 00:07:47,444
Flower, my flower,
beautiful flower!

100
00:07:47,468 --> 00:07:48,768
Anna!

101
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:52,942
Haven't you got her ready yet?
Hurry, Anna, people are arriving.

102
00:07:52,967 --> 00:07:54,915
Yes, right away.

103
00:07:55,212 --> 00:07:56,478
Come here.

104
00:07:56,502 --> 00:07:58,374
Come, get up.

105
00:07:58,850 --> 00:08:00,516
Come now. Come.

106
00:08:00,540 --> 00:08:01,970
Just like that.

107
00:08:35,035 --> 00:08:38,386
That's Don Liguori, the canon
and that's the family doctor.

108
00:08:38,410 --> 00:08:40,862
- Countess Spina's notary.
- Does he have a price?

109
00:08:40,886 --> 00:08:42,790
The prefect with the mayor.

110
00:08:42,814 --> 00:08:46,008
The one who so gallantly
sees to the lady's necklace

111
00:08:46,032 --> 00:08:48,393
is the director of
the Salentine Credit,

112
00:08:48,417 --> 00:08:51,155
the president of which,
as you know, is Donna Raimonda.

113
00:08:51,179 --> 00:08:53,193
Of course, the bank is hers.

114
00:08:53,217 --> 00:08:55,830
- You already know the assessor
Di Corato. - He's mine.

115
00:08:55,854 --> 00:08:57,896
- Senator Palmieri.
- He will be.

116
00:08:57,920 --> 00:09:00,475
The one in the wheelchair is
Anastasia, a Russian princess,

117
00:09:00,499 --> 00:09:02,416
mother of the late
Count Emilio Spina,

118
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:05,056
that blonde gentleman
you see portrayed there.

119
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:08,090
They used to cross the street
in order to pay me homage

120
00:09:08,114 --> 00:09:09,776
but that's now ancient history.

121
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:13,734
Leave it to me, Don Amilcare and
they'll change palaces once again.

122
00:09:15,985 --> 00:09:18,879
- She's coming. - Don't move,
she'll come over to greet me.

123
00:09:18,903 --> 00:09:20,736
That is still owed to me at least.

124
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:22,962
- Don Amilcare!
- Dearest Raimonda!

125
00:09:22,986 --> 00:09:25,184
It took our patron saint
to perform this miracle.

126
00:09:25,208 --> 00:09:28,412
- If I may, Counselor Mazzacolli.
- <i>Enchanté</i>.

127
00:09:30,219 --> 00:09:34,136
Yes, Mazzacolli. Emerald Shores,
that's what it's called, right?

128
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:36,616
I've only heard talk
of your project.

129
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:39,800
If the countess would like the honor,
I'd be delighted to explain it.

130
00:09:39,824 --> 00:09:43,297
- It's a futuristic conception…
- With the greatest pleasure.

131
00:09:44,281 --> 00:09:47,777
<i>Comment vas-tu</i>, you old whore?

132
00:09:47,801 --> 00:09:49,650
I'm back in business!

133
00:09:50,695 --> 00:09:54,785
- <i>Maman</i>, may I introduce you
to the Counselor Mazzacolli? - <i>Oui</i>.

134
00:09:54,989 --> 00:09:57,131
<i>- Enchanté</i>.
- Come, Don Amilcare,

135
00:09:57,155 --> 00:10:00,799
Elisa and Lorè will be glad to see you.
They're in the living room.

136
00:10:00,924 --> 00:10:02,524
This way, Counselor.

137
00:10:04,464 --> 00:10:08,164
- Who is that man?
- Counselor Mazzacolli.

138
00:10:08,188 --> 00:10:09,585
Hmm. A man!

139
00:10:11,826 --> 00:10:13,806
Oh, dear Amilcare!

140
00:10:13,830 --> 00:10:18,936
Last night you made Emiliuccio
stay up late with those darn cards!

141
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:22,371
What are you saying, Lorè?
Emilio has been dead for 10 years!

142
00:10:23,275 --> 00:10:24,575
Dead?

143
00:10:25,144 --> 00:10:26,644
How did it happen?

144
00:10:27,132 --> 00:10:30,714
Jesus, they never tell me anything!

145
00:10:30,738 --> 00:10:33,393
What are you saying, Lorè?
How embarrassing!

146
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:36,651
And this is my daughter Clotilde.

147
00:10:36,675 --> 00:10:38,865
It's been a while
since you've seen her.

148
00:10:38,889 --> 00:10:41,910
How she has grown!
She has become a young lady.

149
00:10:41,934 --> 00:10:43,575
16 years old in May.

150
00:10:43,599 --> 00:10:46,136
Tonight she makes
her official debut into society.

151
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:48,607
- Right, Clo? Greet the duke.
- Raimonda!

152
00:10:50,484 --> 00:10:53,454
What a splendid daughter
you have, Donna Raimonda.

153
00:10:54,556 --> 00:10:57,855
Do you study, Little Countess?
What grade are you in?

154
00:10:58,520 --> 00:11:00,772
These things happen often.

155
00:11:00,796 --> 00:11:03,345
- Countess, about that request…
- Not now.

156
00:11:03,691 --> 00:11:06,164
I wanted to give an answer,
I see him tomorrow.

157
00:11:06,188 --> 00:11:09,282
Yes, but we've
already talked about it.

158
00:11:09,306 --> 00:11:11,350
But I'm not
convinced by that clause.

159
00:11:11,374 --> 00:11:13,759
Alright,
we'll talk about it tomorrow.

160
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:18,380
Anna!

161
00:11:18,859 --> 00:11:22,753
Come, Clo, don't do that.
Come with your nanny, come.

162
00:11:22,818 --> 00:11:25,664
You know, she's still a child.

163
00:11:25,729 --> 00:11:28,348
What a pleasure it was
to meet you, Counselor.

164
00:11:28,460 --> 00:11:32,312
Why don't you come with me tomorrow?
I'll give you a tour of my properties.

165
00:11:32,336 --> 00:11:33,636
Excuse me.

166
00:11:34,725 --> 00:11:38,681
We can calmly talk about your project.
I'd really like to know more.

167
00:11:38,748 --> 00:11:41,056
Yes, sure. Why not?
Tomorrow morning.

168
00:11:41,394 --> 00:11:42,694
Certainly.

169
00:11:43,959 --> 00:11:46,230
Yes, it smells like spring.

170
00:11:46,310 --> 00:11:49,244
Yes, forward. That's it.

171
00:11:49,269 --> 00:11:51,048
Jesus! Jesus! Jesus!

172
00:11:51,297 --> 00:11:54,297
Who would've thought
that poor Clotilde

173
00:11:54,321 --> 00:11:56,315
was making her debut in society?

174
00:11:56,339 --> 00:11:59,871
And the aunts? The grandmother?
Are they for real?

175
00:12:00,010 --> 00:12:03,925
It's obvious Donna Raimonda
is thinking of marrying her.

176
00:12:03,949 --> 00:12:05,790
A fool? Who would take her?

177
00:12:05,814 --> 00:12:09,331
Ah, dear Saverio, husbands are
bought like any other goods!

178
00:12:09,355 --> 00:12:13,256
- It's a matter of price.
- Yes, but a sick, demented girl…

179
00:12:13,280 --> 00:12:15,298
But upon that poor
demented little head

180
00:12:15,322 --> 00:12:17,768
there are houses, land, titles…

181
00:12:18,997 --> 00:12:21,709
and 20 kilometers of coastline.

182
00:12:22,032 --> 00:12:23,655
- 20?
- 20.

183
00:12:23,679 --> 00:12:26,896
15 minutes by car
from stake to stake.

184
00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:30,663
I know it well: it was all mine
before that cursed evening!

185
00:12:31,152 --> 00:12:35,406
Two pairs of aces and kings
which was, believe me, a jewel.

186
00:12:35,474 --> 00:12:40,286
And didn't that evil Count Spina have
a miserable trio of sevens in his hand?

187
00:12:40,311 --> 00:12:42,241
- Did he have it?
- He certainly did!

188
00:12:42,265 --> 00:12:44,896
May the devil take him to hell!

189
00:12:44,920 --> 00:12:48,536
He was a born bluffer but shit,
that night he had the points!

190
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:51,703
And he screwed me from a property
that's worth billions today.

191
00:12:52,197 --> 00:12:55,497
You play away billions
like that over a pair of aces?

192
00:12:56,055 --> 00:12:59,005
- Excuse me, couldn't you back out?
- Counselor,

193
00:13:00,063 --> 00:13:01,775
do you see that tree?

194
00:13:01,799 --> 00:13:04,347
There is more than
6 centuries of history there.

195
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:07,176
The Loyolas ruled at
the time of Ferrante of Aragon,

196
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:10,376
better than the Spinas,
lesser nobles of the Bourbon restoration.

197
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:14,027
I am the last without heirs.
The one on the top right.

198
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:18,062
- But a Loyola's word is as good as…
- As good as a king's.

199
00:13:21,165 --> 00:13:22,814
Why don't you adopt me?

200
00:13:22,902 --> 00:13:26,336
I gain a title and you a lineage.
I mean it. Why not think about it?

201
00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:27,836
Dear Mazzacolli,

202
00:13:27,860 --> 00:13:30,557
my name will serve
you better if I wear it myself.

203
00:13:30,876 --> 00:13:32,431
I don't know.

204
00:13:32,828 --> 00:13:35,300
Do me the favor
and not to say ""enchanté""

205
00:13:35,324 --> 00:13:37,656
- when I introduce you to a lady.
- Isn't that done?

206
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:41,432
If the lady is French or you are.
Are you French?

207
00:13:42,066 --> 00:13:45,771
I am from the European
Economic Community.

208
00:13:46,103 --> 00:13:47,403
<i>Bonne nuit.</i>

209
00:13:48,262 --> 00:13:50,089
Behave!

210
00:13:54,069 --> 00:13:57,016
- Well done, Peppe!
- Remember we're not on your side.

211
00:13:57,076 --> 00:14:00,668
Greeks, Arabs, Spaniards have been
spilling our blood for centuries.

212
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:02,535
- You have the plan?
- Yes, Sir.

213
00:14:02,559 --> 00:14:06,736
When we say ""yes or no"", it might
mean yes or no but not necessarily.

214
00:14:06,760 --> 00:14:08,976
- The heliport project?
- All there, Sir. - Good.

215
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:12,744
But when we're silent, you must start
shitting yourself because it's a bad sign.

216
00:14:12,768 --> 00:14:14,528
- Understand?
- Sure!

217
00:14:14,552 --> 00:14:17,815
Business doesn't require calculation
but intuition, imagination, poetry!

218
00:14:17,839 --> 00:14:20,517
Poetry?
Meanwhile, you stink like a whore!

219
00:14:20,541 --> 00:14:22,511
- Monsieur de Givenchy.
- Penhaligon.

220
00:14:22,535 --> 00:14:25,536
There's only one cologne: Penhaligon.
Few know about it even in London.

221
00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:27,139
Here, a present for you.

222
00:14:27,336 --> 00:14:29,628
Can this cologne be ordered?

223
00:14:29,652 --> 00:14:31,536
Never mind that,
think of the countess.

224
00:14:31,560 --> 00:14:33,617
She's a son of a bitch.
Don't underestimate her.

225
00:14:33,641 --> 00:14:35,541
I'll take that. I need it.

226
00:14:36,232 --> 00:14:39,716
And this son of a bitch, who does…
sorry, Concetti, who does she screw?

227
00:14:39,740 --> 00:14:43,412
As the criminal records
would say: ""No charges"".

228
00:14:43,436 --> 00:14:47,351
Some trips now and then:
Paris, New York, Barletta.

229
00:14:47,375 --> 00:14:50,743
Shit! Nail yourself to the table
and wait for Guercioli's call.

230
00:14:50,767 --> 00:14:53,619
I'll call as soon as
I hear any news.

231
00:14:54,676 --> 00:14:56,426
I'm off to fix the South.

232
00:15:00,167 --> 00:15:04,425
I forgot to warn you it's going to
be quite a country day, Counselor.

233
00:15:04,449 --> 00:15:05,834
Oh, please!

234
00:15:05,858 --> 00:15:08,358
Sorry, rather,
if I kept you waiting.

235
00:15:08,568 --> 00:15:10,868
A long-distance…
an international call…

236
00:15:10,892 --> 00:15:12,342
I just came down.

237
00:15:25,326 --> 00:15:27,432
More than 80,000
attendees a year,

238
00:15:27,456 --> 00:15:29,746
for starters.
A business of several billions.

239
00:15:29,770 --> 00:15:32,856
Don't overlook the possibility of
an outlet for your production, Countess.

240
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:35,780
- I won't overlook it.
- Here: wine, cigarettes…

241
00:15:36,004 --> 00:15:39,256
In other words, the common market.
Oil! You also produce oil, right?

242
00:15:39,280 --> 00:15:41,180
A little: 10,000 quintals.

243
00:15:41,262 --> 00:15:43,571
Lovely plants. Ancestral.

244
00:15:45,617 --> 00:15:49,296
The entire cost of the project
doesn't exceed 30 billion.

245
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:53,009
This includes buying the needed land,
for which I have the contracts.

246
00:15:53,033 --> 00:15:55,298
- A transfer of ownership?
- No.

247
00:15:55,322 --> 00:15:58,422
- You see, as an option. It's as if…
- Ah, ""as if"".

248
00:15:59,880 --> 00:16:02,638
This vineyard is splendid!
Is all this yours?

249
00:16:03,288 --> 00:16:04,601
And how much…?

250
00:16:04,625 --> 00:16:07,182
260 hectares, 600,000 bottles.

251
00:16:07,960 --> 00:16:11,536
<i>Here's to the frothing wine,
sparkling in the glass,</i>

252
00:16:11,560 --> 00:16:14,284
<i>like the lover's smile…</i>

253
00:16:14,308 --> 00:16:19,352
<i>that makes every
thought a happy one!</i>

254
00:16:19,413 --> 00:16:24,191
<i>Here's to the wine that's sincere,</i>

255
00:16:24,280 --> 00:16:29,199
<i>that makes every
thought a happy one!</i>

256
00:16:38,877 --> 00:16:40,144
It's nice.

257
00:16:40,168 --> 00:16:42,216
It's my refuge in the hot hours.

258
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:44,490
Make yourself at home, Counselor.

259
00:16:45,008 --> 00:16:48,067
I always come here after I've made
my rounds. I grab a bite to eat

260
00:16:48,091 --> 00:16:50,632
and when I feel like it,
take a catnap.

261
00:16:50,656 --> 00:16:52,395
At home, I have no peace.

262
00:16:52,419 --> 00:16:55,216
Excuse me, I'll take
a shower and be right back.

263
00:16:55,240 --> 00:16:58,976
By all means. Countess,
while you shower, may I use the phone?

264
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,300
My house is your house, Counselor.

265
00:17:03,754 --> 00:17:05,054
Peppe, it's me.

266
00:17:05,835 --> 00:17:07,235
So, did he call?

267
00:17:08,671 --> 00:17:09,971
And?

268
00:17:17,005 --> 00:17:18,451
Holy fuck…

269
00:17:20,600 --> 00:17:21,900
Fuck…

270
00:17:25,152 --> 00:17:26,452
Counselor?

271
00:17:26,669 --> 00:17:28,019
Were you bored?

272
00:17:28,312 --> 00:17:30,000
I was thinking about you.

273
00:17:30,119 --> 00:17:31,869
- Want some help?
- Yes.

274
00:17:41,936 --> 00:17:43,586
You are so beautiful.

275
00:17:45,464 --> 00:17:47,496
How nice you smell.

276
00:17:47,784 --> 00:17:50,334
You smell of soap,
lily of the valley.

277
00:17:50,513 --> 00:17:52,075
Flowers.

278
00:17:52,199 --> 00:17:55,530
Why don't you tell me
you want to fuck me?

279
00:18:11,076 --> 00:18:12,626
You liked that, eh?

280
00:18:16,620 --> 00:18:19,776
We shall do great things together.
Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes!

281
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:22,480
Adding your forces to mine,
Emerald Shores is a done deal.

282
00:18:22,504 --> 00:18:25,848
But that's just for starters:
We'll parcel out the Amazon!

283
00:18:27,389 --> 00:18:28,820
Counselor!

284
00:18:30,717 --> 00:18:32,117
Why ""counselor""?

285
00:18:34,243 --> 00:18:36,043
Did you say ""counselor""?

286
00:18:37,472 --> 00:18:38,772
Come here.

287
00:18:43,881 --> 00:18:46,359
I don't want any misunderstandings.

288
00:18:47,720 --> 00:18:50,128
It was very pleasant but…

289
00:18:50,576 --> 00:18:52,852
- But?
- Just a small interlude.

290
00:18:52,876 --> 00:18:55,693
We'll end it just as we began it.

291
00:18:56,744 --> 00:18:59,540
And we'll forget
about it soon, OK?

292
00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:05,659
You're a fine slut, eh?

293
00:19:05,683 --> 00:19:09,136
I am a fine slut
but don't forget my title.

294
00:19:09,160 --> 00:19:11,236
You, Countess, are a fine slut.

295
00:19:11,260 --> 00:19:13,765
See? Much better. Thank you.

296
00:19:17,946 --> 00:19:20,252
I'm so hungry now!

297
00:19:20,342 --> 00:19:23,856
We can talk business while having
a bite to eat. Right, Counselor?

298
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:26,762
Very true. I'm very hungry now too.

299
00:19:27,165 --> 00:19:28,665
May I get dressed?

300
00:19:29,262 --> 00:19:30,562
Alright.

301
00:19:32,117 --> 00:19:34,310
You're too hungry, Counselor.

302
00:19:34,561 --> 00:19:36,081
You want my money.

303
00:19:36,158 --> 00:19:39,413
- I don't. I'm giving you a chance
to give it to me. - The same thing.

304
00:19:39,651 --> 00:19:41,201
No, it's different.

305
00:19:41,406 --> 00:19:43,306
Oops! Sorry, ladies first.

306
00:19:44,976 --> 00:19:46,233
Fine.

307
00:19:46,257 --> 00:19:50,936
You offer me the chance to give
you my money in exchange for 30%.

308
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:54,314
- Exactly. - And I offer
you the chance to take it

309
00:19:54,338 --> 00:19:57,136
and keep the 30% for yourself.

310
00:19:57,328 --> 00:19:59,205
You don't want the percentage?

311
00:19:59,229 --> 00:20:00,891
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

312
00:20:01,196 --> 00:20:02,646
I want the other.

313
00:20:03,848 --> 00:20:06,707
- I want 70%.
- Hey, Countess, no.

314
00:20:06,731 --> 00:20:10,139
Sorry. We're still friends
but see ya. I'll go it alone.

315
00:20:10,163 --> 00:20:13,298
- Counselor, you will not
go it alone. - Ah, no?

316
00:20:13,322 --> 00:20:16,072
I know your situation
as well as yourself.

317
00:20:16,671 --> 00:20:20,120
You're in the hole for 423 million.

318
00:20:20,144 --> 00:20:22,216
If you want,
I can tell you the change.

319
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:23,940
Isn't this cheese good?

320
00:20:25,104 --> 00:20:27,054
You even know the change?

321
00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:29,070
You are as dry…

322
00:20:29,917 --> 00:20:31,617
as a bunch of raisins!

323
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:36,685
And if you don't find half a billion
within about two or three weeks,

324
00:20:36,760 --> 00:20:39,068
you lose everything
and go back home.

325
00:20:40,465 --> 00:20:43,937
- The Fund for the South (Midday)…
- For you, Counselor, it's midnight.

326
00:20:43,992 --> 00:20:47,696
You were informed just now
that your friend, Mr Berg…

327
00:20:47,720 --> 00:20:49,254
- Bregonzo.
- Bregonzo.

328
00:20:49,317 --> 00:20:52,155
""He hasn't found a seat
in the government ship"".

329
00:20:52,290 --> 00:20:53,846
Excuse me, how…?

330
00:20:53,870 --> 00:20:56,050
There's a line in the bedroom.

331
00:20:57,157 --> 00:21:01,004
Well done! How sumptuous,
how splendid, how sublime,

332
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:04,918
how celestial, how beatific
a son of a bitch you are!

333
00:21:05,040 --> 00:21:07,496
A son of a bitch and a bitch!
Whore! Slut!

334
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:09,620
A hooker is what you are!

335
00:21:09,644 --> 00:21:11,847
I did warn you.

336
00:21:14,715 --> 00:21:16,815
Hello? This is Emerald Shores!

337
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,442
Yes, one moment.
Counselor, the Senator!

338
00:21:22,072 --> 00:21:24,222
I've been saying this
to you since 3rd grade:

339
00:21:24,246 --> 00:21:26,177
""Bregonzo, you're an asshole""!

340
00:21:26,312 --> 00:21:27,790
It almost rhymes.

341
00:21:31,920 --> 00:21:33,844
Weak blood.

342
00:21:33,868 --> 00:21:36,736
And then the children pay for it.

343
00:21:38,372 --> 00:21:39,672
It's a shame.

344
00:21:39,820 --> 00:21:41,375
It's really a shame.

345
00:21:41,480 --> 00:21:42,780
Yes…

346
00:21:43,080 --> 00:21:44,532
Because…

347
00:21:44,556 --> 00:21:46,416
she would have everything.

348
00:21:46,930 --> 00:21:49,280
Just something missing in the head.

349
00:21:50,591 --> 00:21:53,891
- Here's the coffee, Excellency.
- Well done, Concetta!

350
00:21:54,658 --> 00:21:57,011
- Is she taking a bath?
- Shut up.

351
00:21:57,082 --> 00:21:59,186
- Mind your fucking business.
- Sorry, Concetta.

352
00:21:59,210 --> 00:22:01,710
- Thank you, Duke.
- Go to your kennel!

353
00:22:04,105 --> 00:22:05,824
<i>Punctum dolens.</i>

354
00:22:05,943 --> 00:22:07,163
The weak point.

355
00:22:07,187 --> 00:22:10,531
Everyone has one:
you, me, Donna Raimonda…

356
00:22:10,555 --> 00:22:13,256
But that's normal, Christ!
This Raimonda can't have it all!

357
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:16,788
The bank, olive trees, oil,
wine, tobacco! What the fuck?

358
00:22:16,920 --> 00:22:18,220
Clotilde.

359
00:22:19,553 --> 00:22:20,853
Clotilde?

360
00:22:38,160 --> 00:22:40,854
Why, Clotilde? Lie down.

361
00:22:42,272 --> 00:22:43,572
Like that.

362
00:22:48,040 --> 00:22:50,724
Sleep. Sleep, honey.

363
00:22:56,024 --> 00:22:59,214
Be good, good, my baby.

364
00:22:59,655 --> 00:23:01,205
Why are you crying?

365
00:23:02,840 --> 00:23:08,376
<i>Beautiful flower,
go to sleep in the castle.</i>

366
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:14,896
<i>In the castle there's a gentleman
who wants to eat the flower.</i>

367
00:23:14,920 --> 00:23:17,936
<i>Go beddy-bye in the castle.</i>

368
00:23:17,960 --> 00:23:25,171
<i>In the castle there's a gentleman
who wants to eat the flower.</i>

369
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:44,058
News has arrived from Palazzo Chigi
that the ministry assignments

370
00:23:44,082 --> 00:23:46,537
could be determined by tomorrow.

371
00:23:47,080 --> 00:23:48,730
The Finance Minister…

372
00:23:53,960 --> 00:23:55,706
- Hello?
- Counselor Mazzacolli?

373
00:23:55,730 --> 00:23:57,682
- In person. Who is it?
- Here's Dr Guercioli.

374
00:23:57,706 --> 00:24:00,845
- Dear counselor, unfortunately,
I must inform you… - One moment.

375
00:24:00,948 --> 00:24:02,585
- Stop.
- What? Are you busy?

376
00:24:02,609 --> 00:24:04,942
- No, go on! Heel.
- What did you say?

377
00:24:04,966 --> 00:24:06,938
Ah, you're talking to your dog.

378
00:24:07,208 --> 00:24:09,786
- Who? No, go on.
- I'm still inside arguing.

379
00:24:09,810 --> 00:24:13,498
According to the latest rumors
gathered by those in the know,

380
00:24:13,522 --> 00:24:16,340
Bregonzo goes to Transportation.
At least, it seems so.

381
00:24:16,556 --> 00:24:18,850
A funeral! Stay here.

382
00:24:18,956 --> 00:24:21,208
Well, first of all
it's not a sure thing

383
00:24:21,232 --> 00:24:23,539
and then it's not a ministry
to be sneezed at.

384
00:24:23,563 --> 00:24:27,096
Give me the other one, it's firm.
A hard boiled egg.

385
00:24:27,320 --> 00:24:30,202
- Hard? What do you mean?
- No, I mean the hard facts!

386
00:24:30,226 --> 00:24:32,248
Nothing else can be done.
Cheer up, eh?

387
00:24:32,272 --> 00:24:33,949
Yes, on a dick!
Where are you going?

388
00:24:33,973 --> 00:24:37,218
- To sleep!
- No, wait, come here. Sit down.

389
00:24:37,242 --> 00:24:40,980
You are a smart girl.
You must study, got it?

390
00:24:41,468 --> 00:24:45,242
Study languages: English, French,
Arabic. They are useful today.

391
00:24:45,266 --> 00:24:47,976
Study! You can do public
relations for Emerald Shores.

392
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:51,256
Study! Study and
you won't regret it! Study.

393
00:24:52,280 --> 00:24:53,940
Transportation…

394
00:24:54,448 --> 00:24:55,748
Healthcare…

395
00:24:56,813 --> 00:24:58,113
The Countess.

396
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,579
The Countess…

397
00:25:05,179 --> 00:25:07,830
Go to the post office and send
everything by express mail.

398
00:25:07,854 --> 00:25:09,704
Then come and pick me up.

399
00:25:18,533 --> 00:25:21,691
I'll accept, I'll sign
but I'd like to talk for a moment…

400
00:25:21,748 --> 00:25:23,748
It's something particular
but the notary…

401
00:25:23,772 --> 00:25:26,096
Notary, would you please
leave us for a moment?

402
00:25:26,120 --> 00:25:28,075
Of course, Countess.

403
00:25:31,575 --> 00:25:32,875
Go on.

404
00:25:36,026 --> 00:25:38,576
I want to marry
your daughter Clotilde.

405
00:25:39,709 --> 00:25:41,461
You want to marry Clotilde?

406
00:25:41,485 --> 00:25:44,038
I want to marry Clo.
I realize that it's…

407
00:25:44,062 --> 00:25:47,431
Counselor, I'm not disposed
to joke about that subject.

408
00:25:47,571 --> 00:25:50,987
I'm not joking at all, Countess.
I want to marry your daughter.

409
00:25:51,137 --> 00:25:55,313
Because it can be a guarantee
that's still missing from our pact.

410
00:25:57,258 --> 00:26:02,017
This way, I won't just be a partner
but join the Spina Family, become…

411
00:26:02,041 --> 00:26:05,291
But for that you don't need
to marry Clo, Counselor.

412
00:26:07,787 --> 00:26:09,733
Then why not you?

413
00:26:10,680 --> 00:26:13,902
There's already some sympathy
between us. You're a Spina…

414
00:26:14,658 --> 00:26:19,311
I am a Spina as long as
I remain Count Spina's widow.

415
00:26:19,427 --> 00:26:22,133
If I remarry, Counselor,
I am nothing.

416
00:26:22,157 --> 00:26:23,735
Nothing at all.

417
00:26:25,265 --> 00:26:26,565
Is the offer…

418
00:26:27,119 --> 00:26:28,502
still valid?

419
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:32,041
No… Never mind, Countess.
Never mind!

420
00:26:33,496 --> 00:26:36,206
Then I'll call
the notary so we can sign?

421
00:26:36,230 --> 00:26:40,023
No, Countess, I won't sign until
you sign the marriage contract.

422
00:26:40,047 --> 00:26:43,440
That is what's called
a fiduciary relationship!

423
00:26:44,355 --> 00:26:46,220
Of course! It's the minimum.

424
00:27:01,190 --> 00:27:03,136
Yes, the little snail. Yes.

425
00:27:03,160 --> 00:27:05,896
If you knew, dear Raimonda,
what joy this gives me.

426
00:27:05,920 --> 00:27:09,216
It's as if I were becoming
your relative too.

427
00:27:09,240 --> 00:27:12,528
As if something of myself
was entering this union.

428
00:27:12,811 --> 00:27:14,961
He's alluding to his mortgages!

429
00:27:16,594 --> 00:27:17,856
Oh, well…

430
00:27:17,880 --> 00:27:21,976
You'll do me the honor, dear Saverio.
Saturday my farmers are having a party.

431
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:25,256
- A yearly ancient festival.
- Sure, why not? Sure.

432
00:27:25,280 --> 00:27:27,567
- You too, I hope.
- Thank you, my friend,

433
00:27:27,591 --> 00:27:29,576
but you know I'd never go to it.

434
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:32,896
They burn the devil! But I bet
the lawyer doesn't believe in that.

435
00:27:32,920 --> 00:27:36,496
Why not? Even the Pope has recently
relaunched it, in grand style.

436
00:27:36,520 --> 00:27:40,489
In France, they say, ""One candle
to God and two to the devil.""

437
00:27:40,928 --> 00:27:44,970
The French are great diplomats.
You never know!

438
00:27:45,614 --> 00:27:49,399
What a beautiful bride you have,
Amilcare and at your age…

439
00:27:49,423 --> 00:27:51,307
What, Lorè? He's not the groom!

440
00:27:51,331 --> 00:27:53,231
It's Counselor Mazzacolli!

441
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:55,360
- Which one?
- Shh! Shut up!

442
00:27:55,880 --> 00:27:58,252
Madame Countess, I am ready.

443
00:27:59,006 --> 00:28:01,001
- Anna?
- Yes, immediately.

444
00:28:01,025 --> 00:28:02,772
Come, Clotilde.

445
00:28:04,312 --> 00:28:07,533
Come with me. Easy… easy…

446
00:28:08,080 --> 00:28:09,380
Easy…

447
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:13,161
Step down… Very good, like that.

448
00:28:13,272 --> 00:28:17,256
The San Gaudio estate,
96 hectares, as written in the registry,

449
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:21,456
the Suprammonte olive grove property,
36 hectares, as written in the registry,

450
00:28:21,480 --> 00:28:25,738
the 25% share of
the Apulian wine cellars property,

451
00:28:25,762 --> 00:28:29,896
the property of the plot of land
used for grazing and husbandry

452
00:28:29,920 --> 00:28:32,281
for a total area of

453
00:28:32,305 --> 00:28:37,148
1664 hectares denominated
the Duke's Springs.

454
00:28:39,001 --> 00:28:41,484
- Counselor Mazzacolli?
- Yes?

455
00:28:41,508 --> 00:28:43,300
- The size of this park…
- Yes?

456
00:28:43,324 --> 00:28:45,816
- It's around 10,000 heads.
- Yes.

457
00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:48,286
If you like,
I'll read you the details.

458
00:28:48,310 --> 00:28:51,343
For heaven's sake,
we have all the time in the world.

459
00:28:51,751 --> 00:28:54,896
Let's read the binding clause then.

460
00:28:54,920 --> 00:28:56,446
The what, notary?

461
00:28:57,040 --> 00:29:00,776
Countess Clotilde's
entire estate rests on,

462
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:04,416
by the express testamentary will
of the late Count Emilio…

463
00:29:04,440 --> 00:29:07,184
- Rests on what?
- The restriction of usufruct

464
00:29:07,208 --> 00:29:10,974
for Countess Raimonda
Spina-Tommaselli,

465
00:29:10,998 --> 00:29:15,265
appointed as trustee and
sole administrator of the assets.

466
00:29:15,289 --> 00:29:16,589
Rests on her?

467
00:29:16,877 --> 00:29:19,754
This is true even if
Clotilde gets married?

468
00:29:20,028 --> 00:29:23,969
That possibility, in truth, wasn't
foreseen by the late count.

469
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:27,336
The matter is in the hands
of Donna Raimonda.

470
00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:30,719
You won't care about
such a detail, dear Saverio.

471
00:29:30,777 --> 00:29:34,426
If I understood correctly, what matters
to you is joining the family, right?

472
00:29:34,450 --> 00:29:37,750
And a dowry is not needed.
Just Clotilde.

473
00:29:37,774 --> 00:29:41,154
A dowry? The thought never
passed my mind, dear Raimonda.

474
00:29:41,280 --> 00:29:42,680
Where do I sign?

475
00:29:43,689 --> 00:29:45,289
Next to the crosses.

476
00:29:46,069 --> 00:29:49,216
56 signatures, Counselor.

477
00:29:49,240 --> 00:29:51,639
Knowing that, I brought my stamp.

478
00:30:00,699 --> 00:30:02,128
I have to pay!

479
00:30:02,186 --> 00:30:03,750
It's the second time!

480
00:30:03,774 --> 00:30:06,808
It's the second time she fucked me!

481
00:30:07,036 --> 00:30:08,982
I have to pay! For everything!

482
00:30:09,058 --> 00:30:11,779
- The countess…
- Save'!

483
00:30:12,040 --> 00:30:14,877
What countess?
I told you, she was born badly.

484
00:30:14,901 --> 00:30:18,374
She doesn't have any true nobility!
She has no elegance.

485
00:30:18,398 --> 00:30:21,393
She doesn't give a fuck
about the noble and the elegant!

486
00:30:21,417 --> 00:30:22,664
And she's right!

487
00:30:22,688 --> 00:30:25,358
If the first Loyola had paid
attention to elegance and nobility,

488
00:30:25,382 --> 00:30:28,456
instead of killing and robbing,
you would not be a duke!

489
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:31,587
- Saverio, don't break my family tree.
- Yes, dream of your tree!

490
00:30:31,611 --> 00:30:34,543
Instead, by God,
I want to plant my tree here!

491
00:30:34,567 --> 00:30:37,696
I don't know what tree you refer to,
but if it's what I think it is,

492
00:30:37,720 --> 00:30:41,893
you've already planted it
but without any substantial results.

493
00:30:42,615 --> 00:30:43,915
I admit that.

494
00:30:44,289 --> 00:30:45,932
For the moment.

495
00:30:46,887 --> 00:30:50,317
And after all,
you're marrying a beautiful girl!

496
00:30:50,341 --> 00:30:53,550
Maybe she has no mind
but did you see those thighs?

497
00:30:53,574 --> 00:30:55,388
What do you mean?
Did you see her?

498
00:30:55,412 --> 00:30:57,319
She's lifeless. A thing.

499
00:30:57,440 --> 00:30:59,490
Can one make love to a thing?

500
00:31:00,098 --> 00:31:03,216
I do this crap because I must save
an exceptional venture, a great idea.

501
00:31:03,240 --> 00:31:05,684
But I won't touch
that girl even with a finger!

502
00:31:05,708 --> 00:31:07,799
I'll be a father to her.

503
00:31:07,920 --> 00:31:10,257
That's right.
I'll be just like a dad.

504
00:31:10,474 --> 00:31:14,934
A dad? In the sense that you'd
like to be the mother's husband.

505
00:31:14,959 --> 00:31:16,259
Stop!

506
00:31:19,776 --> 00:31:21,526
Here, a little present.

507
00:31:22,967 --> 00:31:24,467
What's the matter?

508
00:31:24,696 --> 00:31:28,143
- There, it's no longer a little gift!
- Yes, Sir.

509
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:31,153
- But when I'm done, not a word, eh?
- Yes, Sir.

510
00:31:31,177 --> 00:31:33,877
- I don't even want to hear you.
- You won't.

511
00:31:34,744 --> 00:31:37,750
""Yes, Sir. No, Sir…"" Turn around.

512
00:31:40,118 --> 00:31:41,620
What are you doing?

513
00:31:41,644 --> 00:31:44,737
Excuse me, Concettina,
but that's my fucking business.

514
00:31:44,761 --> 00:31:48,213
And mine too, if you don't mind.
Counselor, please…

515
00:31:48,323 --> 00:31:50,273
Don't think about anything.

516
00:31:56,368 --> 00:31:57,835
I'll show you!

517
00:31:58,034 --> 00:32:00,559
You don't know me.
You'll know who I am!

518
00:32:00,631 --> 00:32:03,883
No! No! I know! I know! Oh, Jesus!

519
00:32:03,907 --> 00:32:06,872
- You're Counselor Mazzacolli!
- You shut up!

520
00:32:08,185 --> 00:32:10,428
Damn slut that you are!

521
00:32:10,641 --> 00:32:12,939
Why say those nasty things to me?

522
00:32:13,128 --> 00:32:15,764
- What did I do to you?
- I don't mean you.

523
00:32:15,788 --> 00:32:18,415
I'm talking about another,
that titled whore.

524
00:32:19,122 --> 00:32:20,888
Wait, wait…

525
00:32:21,226 --> 00:32:23,376
You'll see if I don't bend you!

526
00:32:24,231 --> 00:32:27,191
I'll break you! I'll smash you!

527
00:32:27,215 --> 00:32:28,815
I'll smash you! I'll…

528
00:32:32,379 --> 00:32:33,679
I got it!

529
00:32:34,538 --> 00:32:37,709
- I've done it!
- You're wrong, Counselor, not yet!

530
00:32:37,733 --> 00:32:41,014
You shut up! I got it!
I got it, Duke!

531
00:32:41,079 --> 00:32:42,641
Duke, an idea!

532
00:32:42,970 --> 00:32:45,143
But… Counselor?

533
00:32:45,234 --> 00:32:47,125
Duke! Duke!

534
00:32:47,659 --> 00:32:48,959
Duke!

535
00:32:49,028 --> 00:32:50,752
Duke, I got it because…

536
00:32:50,776 --> 00:32:52,076
Duke!

537
00:32:52,833 --> 00:32:54,133
Duke!

538
00:32:55,586 --> 00:32:56,886
Duke!

539
00:32:57,003 --> 00:32:58,955
Duke! Duke, I got it!

540
00:32:58,979 --> 00:33:00,479
What's the matter?

541
00:33:01,181 --> 00:33:03,686
Counselor, you almost
gave me a heart attack.

542
00:33:03,710 --> 00:33:05,831
- I've screwed the countess.
- Again?

543
00:33:05,855 --> 00:33:08,733
No, I'll take everything:
the dowry and the daughter.

544
00:33:08,757 --> 00:33:12,133
Don Amilcare, I'll take it all!
All! All! All! I'll take it all!

545
00:33:12,157 --> 00:33:14,029
- How?
- How?

546
00:33:15,376 --> 00:33:16,676
First…

547
00:33:18,886 --> 00:33:20,206
Hey!

548
00:33:20,709 --> 00:33:22,109
Can you hear me?

549
00:33:22,970 --> 00:33:24,270
First:

550
00:33:25,743 --> 00:33:27,438
I'll kidnap the girl.

551
00:33:27,531 --> 00:33:28,831
Kidnap her?

552
00:33:29,800 --> 00:33:31,500
You'll compromise her!

553
00:33:31,740 --> 00:33:35,119
Sure, so I'll go to jail, I'll have to
marry her and it begins again:

554
00:33:35,143 --> 00:33:38,673
courts, fees and all that bullshit!
Don Amilcare, someone, unknown,

555
00:33:38,697 --> 00:33:41,138
- someone who must remain unknown…
- Not me!

556
00:33:41,162 --> 00:33:43,810
Of course. An unknown
must kidnap, as you've said,

557
00:33:43,834 --> 00:33:45,878
Clotilde Spina. Period.

558
00:33:48,185 --> 00:33:49,958
Second:

559
00:33:50,545 --> 00:33:53,569
The girl is found:
prayers, tears, candles

560
00:33:53,593 --> 00:33:56,944
and the bad ordeal has left her,
how shall we say, stained…

561
00:33:57,223 --> 00:33:59,188
- Compromised.
- Compromised!

562
00:33:59,284 --> 00:34:01,332
Understand? Compromised.

563
00:34:01,526 --> 00:34:05,133
Third: as the betrothed,
I am offended in my dignity,

564
00:34:05,158 --> 00:34:07,300
- in my honor.
- Right!

565
00:34:07,325 --> 00:34:10,458
At that point, I might back off,
""I don't buy second-hand stuff!""

566
00:34:10,483 --> 00:34:12,891
But instead… Fourth:

567
00:34:14,396 --> 00:34:15,693
I am generous.

568
00:34:17,053 --> 00:34:19,265
I'll marry the girl anyway.

569
00:34:20,182 --> 00:34:21,482
But…

570
00:34:24,106 --> 00:34:27,675
You're fantastic!
What a brain you have!

571
00:34:27,828 --> 00:34:29,727
You reason like us!

572
00:34:29,944 --> 00:34:31,244
Drink.

573
00:34:31,385 --> 00:34:36,121
And you have the subtlety to take
her all the same, even damaged!

574
00:34:36,145 --> 00:34:39,826
And they can't deny you
either the girl or the dowry.

575
00:34:39,850 --> 00:34:42,481
Well, ""damaged"", so to speak.
It doesn't need to go that far.

576
00:34:42,505 --> 00:34:45,955
No, it's necessary, it is.
And the medical examination?

577
00:34:48,425 --> 00:34:51,519
- What medical examination?
- We always do a medical exam.

578
00:34:51,543 --> 00:34:53,143
We're no fools here!

579
00:34:54,843 --> 00:34:57,415
She must be damaged goods.

580
00:34:57,638 --> 00:35:00,665
If not, it won't work.
Have someone do it.

581
00:35:00,689 --> 00:35:02,321
Christ, not a cuckold!

582
00:35:02,345 --> 00:35:04,801
Save', it's either
cuckold or nothing!

583
00:35:04,825 --> 00:35:07,144
After all, what is a horn?

584
00:35:07,168 --> 00:35:10,289
A horn jewel,
payable to the bearer!

585
00:35:10,313 --> 00:35:12,829
A fine pile of billions!

586
00:35:13,185 --> 00:35:15,908
Or do the service yourself.

587
00:35:16,058 --> 00:35:17,582
Out of the question.

588
00:35:18,105 --> 00:35:19,555
I am a gentleman.

589
00:35:26,465 --> 00:35:27,765
Damaged!

590
00:35:30,456 --> 00:35:33,025
This is the Duke of Loyola's property,
the perfect place.

591
00:35:33,049 --> 00:35:34,793
A place above all suspicion.

592
00:35:34,817 --> 00:35:38,213
Hidden by the trees, out of the way…
Then look inside. Come!

593
00:35:40,474 --> 00:35:42,995
Seems the Loyola family's
misfortunes began here.

594
00:35:43,019 --> 00:35:45,137
- It was a famous fire.
- Bravo.

595
00:35:45,366 --> 00:35:47,367
A beautiful ceiling, classic.

596
00:35:47,783 --> 00:35:49,644
And if this works out…

597
00:35:50,139 --> 00:35:52,488
I'll let you restore it all. Come.

598
00:35:53,837 --> 00:35:55,487
The bedroom survived.

599
00:35:57,948 --> 00:36:01,270
- Ah, a wedding favor!
- A bed for three, eh?

600
00:36:02,315 --> 00:36:03,960
Hey! The van?

601
00:36:04,755 --> 00:36:06,125
Bravo.

602
00:36:06,299 --> 00:36:09,128
- And what's in there?
- The toilet. Go on.

603
00:36:13,377 --> 00:36:18,226
Who knows how many beautiful
aristocratic asses have washed in here!

604
00:36:25,635 --> 00:36:26,935
Mazzacolli,

605
00:36:30,835 --> 00:36:32,785
I want my share right away.

606
00:36:33,443 --> 00:36:35,008
I'm risking a lot.

607
00:36:38,710 --> 00:36:40,010
Millions.

608
00:36:41,675 --> 00:36:44,130
On the very evening
you bring her here.

609
00:36:44,504 --> 00:36:47,436
But let's not screw up, Peppe.

610
00:36:48,995 --> 00:36:50,395
The Spina House.

611
00:36:50,927 --> 00:36:52,277
The side door.

612
00:36:54,395 --> 00:36:55,695
The stairs.

613
00:37:10,795 --> 00:37:12,480
So we agree, dear Don Liguori?

614
00:37:12,504 --> 00:37:15,051
A private ceremony.
Maybe late afternoon.

615
00:37:15,075 --> 00:37:17,105
Even late at night, dear Saverio.

616
00:37:17,129 --> 00:37:19,451
Discretion is the golden rule
of Holy Mother Church.

617
00:37:19,475 --> 00:37:20,775
Excellent.

618
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:28,526
Our notary has quite the appetite?

619
00:37:28,550 --> 00:37:32,447
Yes but only at the table,
dear Saverio. Only at the table!

620
00:38:12,755 --> 00:38:15,345
He's coming! He's coming!

621
00:38:20,555 --> 00:38:23,749
Blessed Archangel Michael,
come and do justice!

622
00:38:23,773 --> 00:38:28,091
Blind him! Blind the devil!
The ugly beast!

623
00:38:28,115 --> 00:38:29,415
My flower…

624
00:38:30,600 --> 00:38:33,196
What is it? You can't sleep?

625
00:38:33,675 --> 00:38:36,525
You understand that
no one's there, right?

626
00:38:36,549 --> 00:38:41,022
But don't be afraid.
Your nanny's here who loves you.

627
00:38:53,755 --> 00:38:57,637
You want a drink?
Then you'll make a lake in your bed!

628
00:39:03,173 --> 00:39:04,877
Alright then.

629
00:39:07,075 --> 00:39:09,924
It doesn't matter.
It doesn't. It doesn't.

630
00:39:10,195 --> 00:39:12,485
Go pee pee, dear. Pee pee!

631
00:39:12,958 --> 00:39:14,408
Beautiful flower.

632
00:39:14,577 --> 00:39:16,008
Good!

633
00:39:21,143 --> 00:39:22,753
How beautiful!

634
00:39:37,357 --> 00:39:38,827
They're burning him!

635
00:39:38,851 --> 00:39:41,509
But the devil doesn't give a shit.

636
00:39:45,572 --> 00:39:46,872
Go to sleep.

637
00:40:08,188 --> 00:40:12,419
""The gentleman wants
to eat the flower"".

638
00:40:13,486 --> 00:40:14,971
Come, go to sleep…

639
00:40:23,235 --> 00:40:26,293
Sleep, beautiful flower, come now.

640
00:40:46,875 --> 00:40:49,611
- Look! Look at that!
- Wonderful!

641
00:40:49,635 --> 00:40:53,005
It's over the top but satisfying.

642
00:40:54,043 --> 00:40:55,769
Extraordinary!

643
00:40:58,275 --> 00:41:01,891
- Is there anything wrong?
- A call from home.

644
00:41:17,435 --> 00:41:18,761
Barbarians!

645
00:41:18,785 --> 00:41:21,694
Barbarians! Uncivilized!
Cowards! Scoundrels!

646
00:41:21,795 --> 00:41:23,865
They would stop at nothing!

647
00:41:23,889 --> 00:41:26,211
And what the heck,
she's a poor sick baby!

648
00:41:26,235 --> 00:41:27,717
What does she have?

649
00:41:27,741 --> 00:41:30,010
- Shut up!
- And nobody heard a thing?

650
00:41:31,521 --> 00:41:33,609
- Go on, speak!
- I…

651
00:41:37,075 --> 00:41:41,411
At 9:00 Gaetano locked the door,
then came back to watch TV.

652
00:41:41,435 --> 00:41:44,763
We didn't hear anything.
The others didn't either,

653
00:41:44,787 --> 00:41:46,743
until Anna called me.

654
00:41:46,884 --> 00:41:49,851
- Was any door forced open?
- No, Ma'am.

655
00:41:49,875 --> 00:41:52,706
- Stop crying, you old crone!
- Yes…

656
00:41:52,875 --> 00:41:56,286
But if this monster, this assassin,
falls into my hands, I will…

657
00:41:56,310 --> 00:41:59,634
I'll break him! I'll break him in two!
I'll strangle, destroy him!

658
00:41:59,658 --> 00:42:02,159
Come, Lorè, come. Let's pray.

659
00:42:02,235 --> 00:42:04,260
- Come.
- Poor Clo…

660
00:42:04,284 --> 00:42:07,764
- Please, be calm, I beg you.
- Calm?

661
00:42:08,595 --> 00:42:11,451
Calm? But how can you be calm?

662
00:42:11,475 --> 00:42:15,071
- I marvel, you're the mother!
- That's right, I am! Got it?

663
00:42:15,197 --> 00:42:17,883
But don't you realize
they kidnapped her? Kidnapped!

664
00:42:17,907 --> 00:42:21,097
- She's in danger… - And why do
you think they kidnapped her?

665
00:42:21,217 --> 00:42:25,275
Because she's worth money.
And what's worth money is valuable.

666
00:42:25,640 --> 00:42:27,240
That's why I'm calm.

667
00:42:27,541 --> 00:42:28,891
I'm scared but…

668
00:42:30,460 --> 00:42:31,760
I'm calm.

669
00:42:31,892 --> 00:42:35,348
You have no choice but to pay.

670
00:42:35,875 --> 00:42:41,448
In this shitty region,
kidnapping has become big business!

671
00:42:42,355 --> 00:42:44,298
I can't take it anymore.

672
00:42:46,223 --> 00:42:48,172
- What are you doing?
- Calling the police.

673
00:42:48,196 --> 00:42:50,089
You're not calling anybody!

674
00:42:50,113 --> 00:42:52,788
- I don't agree.
- You still haven't got it, Saverio.

675
00:42:52,812 --> 00:42:55,611
Nothing has happened here. Got it?

676
00:42:55,635 --> 00:42:58,860
Clotilde's in there, in her room!
Everybody got that?

677
00:42:58,915 --> 00:43:02,038
- She's just sick with measles.
You got that, Anna? - Yes.

678
00:43:02,062 --> 00:43:03,930
And she must remain isolated!

679
00:43:03,954 --> 00:43:07,481
- Everybody got that? Do you two?
- Yes, yes!

680
00:43:07,595 --> 00:43:08,968
You too, Saverio.

681
00:43:08,992 --> 00:43:11,931
Remember that you're about to marry.
You're a happy man.

682
00:43:11,955 --> 00:43:14,497
So then smile. Smile!

683
00:43:14,915 --> 00:43:17,734
Everybody smile! Smile!

684
00:43:17,758 --> 00:43:20,669
Hurray! Long live the newlyweds!

685
00:43:27,515 --> 00:43:30,084
What are you doing here?
Did Peppe phone?

686
00:43:30,897 --> 00:43:32,597
- She's here.
- Peppe?

687
00:43:33,275 --> 00:43:36,111
- She. She's in the cellar.
- Clotilde!

688
00:43:42,319 --> 00:43:45,005
- Why didn't you take her to the cottage?
- It was impossible.

689
00:43:45,029 --> 00:43:46,863
You crazy?
We'll all get in trouble!

690
00:43:46,887 --> 00:43:49,771
I'm not crazy! I was about
to be taken by the carabinieri.

691
00:43:49,795 --> 00:43:52,390
So I came back and
chose to go somewhere safer.

692
00:43:52,414 --> 00:43:54,879
And I'm the only one taking risks!

693
00:43:55,435 --> 00:43:56,943
And now you…

694
00:43:57,226 --> 00:43:59,376
do your job and let me do mine.

695
00:44:00,115 --> 00:44:03,955
Now, if you take Concetta with you,
I'll do it and finish my part.

696
00:44:03,979 --> 00:44:07,211
- Get your hands off, Mazzacolli!
- Listen well, Surveyor!

697
00:44:07,235 --> 00:44:11,036
You take it down a notch and
get the fuck out of here! Got it?

698
00:44:11,195 --> 00:44:13,245
You'll do ""it"" when I say so.

699
00:44:16,275 --> 00:44:17,575
Alright.

700
00:44:18,355 --> 00:44:21,634
- If you want, tomorrow
I'll bring her to the cottage. - OK.

701
00:44:22,595 --> 00:44:26,825
But keep calling me ""Sir"",
because I can hear you better that way.

702
00:44:36,675 --> 00:44:39,291
What are you doing?
Have we all gone nuts?

703
00:44:39,315 --> 00:44:42,651
- I'm putting her to sleep.
- Is this a sleeping pill?

704
00:44:42,675 --> 00:44:45,336
Anna does this every night
to get her to sleep.

705
00:44:45,360 --> 00:44:47,571
- I saw her do it, I swear!
- Really?

706
00:44:47,595 --> 00:44:49,655
It's called fingering.

707
00:44:49,826 --> 00:44:52,978
Get out and make me a chamomile,
else my head will explode.

708
00:44:53,002 --> 00:44:55,252
- Get out!
- Yes, Sir, right away.

709
00:45:02,075 --> 00:45:03,798
Clotilde…

710
00:45:05,056 --> 00:45:06,356
Yes?

711
00:45:06,675 --> 00:45:08,255
Clotildina…

712
00:45:08,893 --> 00:45:10,283
Clotildina!

713
00:45:11,075 --> 00:45:13,194
Now, Clotildina,

714
00:45:13,218 --> 00:45:16,932
like a good little girl
goes beddy-bye.

715
00:45:23,515 --> 00:45:25,165
Hey, little countess.

716
00:45:27,515 --> 00:45:30,175
No, for heaven's sake!
Here, suck. Good.

717
00:45:30,875 --> 00:45:32,810
Just look what I…

718
00:45:32,834 --> 00:45:38,132
But tomorrow, Daddy will buy you
a nice bottle and you can suck that.

719
00:45:53,875 --> 00:45:56,012
No. No, stop, please.

720
00:45:56,036 --> 00:45:59,109
Clotilde, please stop. Oh, my god.

721
00:46:02,515 --> 00:46:04,237
Are you an idiot?

722
00:46:04,635 --> 00:46:05,935
I mean, sorry…

723
00:46:08,639 --> 00:46:11,417
Shut up! You'll wake up
the whole neighborhood!

724
00:46:11,474 --> 00:46:13,722
What are you doing? No! No!

725
00:46:13,746 --> 00:46:16,777
Pl… please!
Clo, what are you doing?

726
00:46:17,595 --> 00:46:19,164
Clo! No!

727
00:46:20,435 --> 00:46:22,659
Let go of me! What are you…?

728
00:46:22,715 --> 00:46:24,015
Please!

729
00:46:24,635 --> 00:46:27,711
No, Clo… Clo, please!

730
00:46:27,915 --> 00:46:29,817
Just stop it!

731
00:46:35,355 --> 00:46:36,655
Clotilde…

732
00:46:37,995 --> 00:46:40,671
Clo… No, Clotilde…

733
00:46:41,115 --> 00:46:42,415
Listen…

734
00:46:44,472 --> 00:46:47,388
Please, I beg you, Clo… Clotilde…

735
00:46:48,224 --> 00:46:50,263
No… my… no…

736
00:46:55,597 --> 00:46:57,845
I am flesh too.

737
00:47:06,955 --> 00:47:08,375
Clo…

738
00:47:09,955 --> 00:47:11,932
No… I…

739
00:47:14,035 --> 00:47:15,455
You…

740
00:47:16,115 --> 00:47:17,615
you are raping me!

741
00:48:10,115 --> 00:48:12,707
Counselor, damn it, it's cold.

742
00:48:12,782 --> 00:48:14,482
Want me to heat it up?

743
00:48:14,706 --> 00:48:16,156
What do you mean?

744
00:48:16,287 --> 00:48:17,587
The chamomile.

745
00:48:18,237 --> 00:48:20,565
Yes, I need more than chamomile.

746
00:48:27,795 --> 00:48:31,197
You stay down here tonight.
Watch her. Stay with her. Got it?

747
00:48:40,640 --> 00:48:41,940
There.

748
00:48:42,462 --> 00:48:43,864
That's enough.

749
00:48:56,494 --> 00:48:59,434
Just like she was inside it.
Got it?

750
00:48:59,458 --> 00:49:01,800
What do I do now?

751
00:49:01,824 --> 00:49:04,762
- What do I do now?
- Jesus, give me patience!

752
00:49:04,890 --> 00:49:09,011
What do you do every morning?
Open the blinds, idiot! Move it!

753
00:49:11,195 --> 00:49:14,077
Everything must look
normal from the outside.

754
00:49:16,614 --> 00:49:19,202
- And now?
- Sit down, stupid!

755
00:49:19,226 --> 00:49:22,197
Tell her fairy tales.
Do what you've always done!

756
00:49:22,882 --> 00:49:25,974
- Don't make me curse.
- Then the little girl

757
00:49:26,058 --> 00:49:28,302
looked out the window.

758
00:49:29,905 --> 00:49:32,758
- Hey, you must be up to this, got it?
- I can't…

759
00:49:33,026 --> 00:49:34,252
Come on.

760
00:49:34,276 --> 00:49:37,948
How come nobody woke me up?
Oh, Jesus, how I slept.

761
00:49:38,275 --> 00:49:41,190
Lisetta, did you like
the theater last night?

762
00:49:41,214 --> 00:49:44,576
- All that confusion!
- Yes.

763
00:49:44,640 --> 00:49:48,797
And she screamed
at her sister below,

764
00:49:48,821 --> 00:49:51,896
""Little sister! Little sister!

765
00:49:51,920 --> 00:49:54,296
If she doesn't come back
I'll go crazy!

766
00:49:55,395 --> 00:49:57,473
Shut up! Are you all crazy?

767
00:49:57,837 --> 00:50:00,429
I told you to shut up!
They can hear in the street!

768
00:50:00,453 --> 00:50:03,539
Enough! Calm down!
Go to Alfonsa!

769
00:50:03,933 --> 00:50:06,891
You want everyone to hear you?
Get out of there!

770
00:50:06,915 --> 00:50:08,920
No! Do what I tell you!

771
00:50:09,272 --> 00:50:11,916
We've supplies for at least a week.
Then we'll see.

772
00:50:11,940 --> 00:50:15,826
There's a stove over there.
Bring some underwear, shirts…

773
00:50:20,901 --> 00:50:22,201
Well?

774
00:50:23,437 --> 00:50:26,525
What? She's listening to music.
You don't move from here.

775
00:50:26,549 --> 00:50:29,716
When I'm not here, don't leave
her alone for even a second, OK?

776
00:50:29,800 --> 00:50:31,100
Yes, Sir.

777
00:51:06,090 --> 00:51:09,476
And don't spend it right away.
That's how fools get caught.

778
00:51:10,068 --> 00:51:11,368
By whom?

779
00:51:11,695 --> 00:51:13,845
No one's looking for me, right?

780
00:51:14,097 --> 00:51:15,397
For now.

781
00:51:19,944 --> 00:51:21,210
Well?

782
00:51:21,234 --> 00:51:22,934
What more do you want?

783
00:51:23,954 --> 00:51:25,254
To do that…

784
00:51:25,724 --> 00:51:27,124
which I must do.

785
00:51:28,781 --> 00:51:30,481
It's no longer needed.

786
00:51:30,557 --> 00:51:32,128
Are you disappointed?

787
00:51:32,231 --> 00:51:35,405
A bit. It was the only
appetizing side of this.

788
00:51:35,570 --> 00:51:38,307
- Why? Money doesn't amuse you?
- Yes.

789
00:51:40,738 --> 00:51:42,038
Hey…

790
00:51:42,255 --> 00:51:43,857
How was the girl?

791
00:51:44,425 --> 00:51:45,825
Was it worth it?

792
00:51:45,931 --> 00:51:49,220
Remember what you've left to do
and try not to do anything stupid.

793
00:51:49,244 --> 00:51:50,928
At 6:00 sharp!

794
00:51:52,225 --> 00:51:53,525
Alright?

795
00:51:54,587 --> 00:51:56,293
At 6:00 sharp!

796
00:51:56,317 --> 00:51:58,901
Always at Sir Counselor's orders!

797
00:51:59,039 --> 00:52:01,040
Hail, Queen, mother of mercy…

798
00:52:03,897 --> 00:52:06,782
We resort to you,
the exiled children of Eve.

799
00:52:08,882 --> 00:52:12,541
Moaning and weeping
in this vale of tears.

800
00:52:14,905 --> 00:52:17,203
Don't worry, dear Raimonda.

801
00:52:17,258 --> 00:52:21,230
I also sent Concettina to her village.
I gave her a holiday. You never know.

802
00:52:21,390 --> 00:52:22,845
The girl is quick.

803
00:52:22,869 --> 00:52:25,488
She would've ended up
sniffing out something.

804
00:52:36,082 --> 00:52:39,487
Donna Raimonda,
the clock is correct, right?

805
00:52:40,724 --> 00:52:44,114
Don Amilcare, why should you care
if the clock is fast or slow?

806
00:52:44,138 --> 00:52:45,964
Nothing. I was just asking.

807
00:52:46,130 --> 00:52:47,932
Saverio, please.

808
00:52:48,340 --> 00:52:49,719
I understand that…

809
00:52:49,743 --> 00:52:53,324
I can't take it anymore either.
My nerves are shot.

810
00:53:00,063 --> 00:53:03,637
- Hello?
- <i>Silence. Only I will speak</i>

811
00:53:03,661 --> 00:53:06,452
<i>and just once.</i>

812
00:53:06,507 --> 00:53:10,899
<i>Clotilde is fine.
You'll have her back soon.</i>

813
00:53:10,923 --> 00:53:15,474
<i>We will send the instructions
to Counselor Mazzacolli.</i>

814
00:53:15,498 --> 00:53:18,229
<i>We will deal only with him.</i>

815
00:53:19,863 --> 00:53:21,966
Hello? One moment! Hello?

816
00:53:28,631 --> 00:53:30,991
No, no, Raimonda. I can't!

817
00:53:31,092 --> 00:53:34,735
- It's a responsibility that I don't…
- Saverio, you heard him, right?

818
00:53:34,839 --> 00:53:37,939
- He only wants to deal with you.
- No, please. No!

819
00:53:38,663 --> 00:53:40,374
I'm afraid of messing up…

820
00:53:40,398 --> 00:53:44,025
I know myself. I'd have no control.
With animals like that I'd kill!

821
00:53:45,951 --> 00:53:47,171
Saverio…

822
00:53:47,195 --> 00:53:50,103
You've heard it all, right?
What should we do?

823
00:53:50,905 --> 00:53:54,713
Saverio, they spoke clearly.
They'll only show up for you.

824
00:53:54,825 --> 00:53:58,182
When they show up, I'll tell them
I don't want to be involved.

825
00:53:58,865 --> 00:54:01,945
And that they should go
directly to you, Donna Raimonda.

826
00:54:03,905 --> 00:54:05,555
Try to understand me…

827
00:54:05,789 --> 00:54:07,389
it's for Clo's sake.

828
00:54:28,945 --> 00:54:30,245
Saverio!

829
00:54:32,185 --> 00:54:33,485
Saverio…

830
00:54:36,905 --> 00:54:38,783
Thanks to the Madonna!

831
00:54:40,036 --> 00:54:42,757
Here, eat, my beauty! Eat.

832
00:54:43,985 --> 00:54:46,475
If you don't eat,
you'll starve, you know?

833
00:54:47,002 --> 00:54:49,668
- Eat, stupid!
- What's the matter?

834
00:54:49,896 --> 00:54:51,649
- Is that how you do it?
- She won't eat.

835
00:54:51,673 --> 00:54:53,924
She hasn't touched
anything all day.

836
00:54:54,065 --> 00:54:57,635
- Here, beauty. Eat, it's good!
- Go away.

837
00:54:58,105 --> 00:55:01,960
- Check that the shades are closed.
- I've closed them.

838
00:55:02,973 --> 00:55:04,569
And now…

839
00:55:05,069 --> 00:55:07,562
Papa will give you the good pap.

840
00:55:09,865 --> 00:55:11,615
Open your mouth, go on.

841
00:55:12,385 --> 00:55:13,685
Open…

842
00:55:18,465 --> 00:55:19,974
Very good.

843
00:55:21,825 --> 00:55:23,125
See?

844
00:55:27,865 --> 00:55:29,665
What? Don't you like it?

845
00:55:37,594 --> 00:55:38,894
Let me try it.

846
00:55:40,730 --> 00:55:43,561
She's right!
It's crap! It tastes like nothing!

847
00:55:43,585 --> 00:55:46,797
You forgot to bring salt, Counselor!
Is that my fault?

848
00:55:47,905 --> 00:55:50,839
I'll bring it tomorrow.
Give her something else to eat.

849
00:55:50,863 --> 00:55:52,841
- Is everything else fine?
- Yes.

850
00:55:52,865 --> 00:55:55,525
- Oh, sorry, Counselor.
- Stay still.

851
00:55:55,855 --> 00:55:58,106
I've already changed her
3 times since morning.

852
00:55:58,130 --> 00:56:00,156
She pees more than
a platoon of soldiers.

853
00:56:00,180 --> 00:56:01,480
Shut up.

854
00:56:06,630 --> 00:56:09,116
Eat, you asshole!

855
00:56:13,786 --> 00:56:17,787
The same voice. He said to look in
the trunk of the car and hung up.

856
00:56:17,811 --> 00:56:20,198
The lock was forced
and this was inside.

857
00:56:20,372 --> 00:56:23,263
""Prepare a billion
in small bills now.""

858
00:56:28,585 --> 00:56:30,483
They won't go easy on us, eh?

859
00:56:33,652 --> 00:56:37,089
Are you really sure you don't want
to put this in the police's hands?

860
00:56:37,113 --> 00:56:39,378
No! Don't insist, please.

861
00:56:42,665 --> 00:56:44,153
It's not little.

862
00:56:44,177 --> 00:56:47,469
Not even for the Spina
but we'll cough up the billion

863
00:56:47,785 --> 00:56:49,985
Anything to save Clo.

864
00:56:50,705 --> 00:56:52,005
Anything.

865
00:57:09,545 --> 00:57:11,921
She gets messy so quickly.

866
00:57:13,225 --> 00:57:14,525
There we go.

867
00:57:37,225 --> 00:57:40,946
Now we'll put on a clean shirt,
all clean.

868
00:57:43,665 --> 00:57:45,639
Give me a clean shirt.

869
00:57:46,145 --> 00:57:48,166
Any will do. That one.

870
00:57:51,883 --> 00:57:53,407
The underwear?

871
00:57:53,431 --> 00:57:55,556
They're all hanging out to dry.

872
00:58:00,865 --> 00:58:03,354
Concettina, you do it.
I don't have time.

873
00:58:04,065 --> 00:58:05,565
And brush her hair!

874
00:58:17,865 --> 00:58:20,466
Hello, Emerald Springs.
Who's speaking?

875
00:58:20,490 --> 00:58:23,269
- This is Countess Spina.
- Is that you, Countess?

876
00:58:23,357 --> 00:58:26,594
Excuse me. I…
Yes, I'm Surveyor Colizzi.

877
00:58:26,945 --> 00:58:30,328
- You want Mazzacolli?
- Yes, Counselor Mazzacolli, please.

878
00:58:30,352 --> 00:58:33,238
He hasn't returned yet.
One moment!

879
00:58:34,545 --> 00:58:37,496
Sorry, I thought that was him
but I was wrong.

880
00:58:38,029 --> 00:58:41,533
Don't worry.
I'll report that you called.

881
00:58:41,557 --> 00:58:42,857
Three times!

882
00:58:44,811 --> 00:58:49,174
And Bregonzo called from Rome,
Di Corato and the assessor of Bari!

883
00:58:49,425 --> 00:58:50,725
Counselor!

884
00:59:09,401 --> 00:59:12,200
The widdle bath is bye-byes.
Bye-byes!

885
00:59:18,585 --> 00:59:22,155
All nice and clean! Perfumed!

886
00:59:24,105 --> 00:59:25,846
Splash!

887
00:59:26,745 --> 00:59:28,421
Let's dry off!

888
00:59:28,564 --> 00:59:29,914
The shoulders,

889
00:59:30,496 --> 00:59:32,641
the widdle titties,

890
00:59:34,812 --> 00:59:36,304
the tummy,

891
00:59:37,145 --> 00:59:39,634
and the lovely widdle pussy!

892
00:59:46,105 --> 00:59:47,405
Up!

893
00:59:50,265 --> 00:59:51,715
The widdle heiny…

894
01:00:06,545 --> 01:00:09,695
- Please give the suitcase
to the gentleman. - Here.

895
01:00:12,265 --> 01:00:14,276
Countess, if I may.

896
01:00:15,305 --> 01:00:17,786
Thank you, Countess. My respects.

897
01:00:41,745 --> 01:00:43,095
Do you have it?

898
01:00:48,065 --> 01:00:49,815
- If you want.
- Yes.

899
01:00:52,053 --> 01:00:53,353
Daddy!

900
01:00:53,705 --> 01:00:55,005
Daddy!

901
01:00:55,385 --> 01:00:58,037
You repeat it too: pa-pa.

902
01:00:58,649 --> 01:00:59,949
Pa-pa.

903
01:01:05,266 --> 01:01:07,330
Good. And now…

904
01:01:07,823 --> 01:01:10,121
Listen up, eh? Pay attention.

905
01:01:10,745 --> 01:01:12,045
Say…

906
01:01:12,687 --> 01:01:15,353
screw me.

907
01:01:15,745 --> 01:01:17,295
Did you understand?

908
01:01:17,350 --> 01:01:19,770
No, don't get distracted. Say it.

909
01:01:20,661 --> 01:01:23,210
Screw me.

910
01:01:28,945 --> 01:01:30,595
Well done! Well done!

911
01:01:44,717 --> 01:01:46,117
What's going on here?

912
01:01:46,141 --> 01:01:48,841
Am I teaching you
or are you teaching me?

913
01:01:55,849 --> 01:01:57,149
Hey!

914
01:01:58,625 --> 01:02:00,769
That's a slutty look, eh?

915
01:02:03,825 --> 01:02:07,494
Yes, there's nothing else to do.
My love…

916
01:02:07,945 --> 01:02:09,245
My love…

917
01:02:09,945 --> 01:02:11,245
Darling…

918
01:02:12,998 --> 01:02:14,960
Daddy's widdle slut.

919
01:02:16,705 --> 01:02:18,836
But I do want to, you know?

920
01:02:20,927 --> 01:02:22,589
I want it too.

921
01:02:22,613 --> 01:02:25,603
Yes, we've already done it,
haven't we?

922
01:02:30,545 --> 01:02:32,921
God, how beautiful you are.

923
01:02:34,265 --> 01:02:36,321
You are so beautiful.

924
01:02:57,575 --> 01:02:59,470
And I envy you, I swear!

925
01:02:59,581 --> 01:03:01,985
You have discovered
the feminine ideal.

926
01:03:02,009 --> 01:03:04,320
A pure object, dear Saverio.

927
01:03:04,381 --> 01:03:06,156
Pepper, please.

928
01:03:06,400 --> 01:03:08,668
All the benefits and no hassles.

929
01:03:08,692 --> 01:03:12,489
She screws and doesn't talk.
She doesn't think and doesn't bitch.

930
01:03:12,607 --> 01:03:14,740
The perfect sex slave!

931
01:03:15,825 --> 01:03:17,125
Oh, no.

932
01:03:17,406 --> 01:03:19,455
It's not like that, Don Amilcare.

933
01:03:19,824 --> 01:03:21,724
It's like I've discovered…

934
01:03:22,745 --> 01:03:26,361
It's as if Clotilde had taught me
a new way of making love.

935
01:03:26,385 --> 01:03:28,413
Without guilt, without sin…

936
01:03:28,437 --> 01:03:30,445
Now we're philosophizing.

937
01:03:30,469 --> 01:03:33,278
No, it's not philosophy, it's life!

938
01:03:36,705 --> 01:03:39,325
I'm in paradise with Clo.

939
01:03:39,665 --> 01:03:41,198
That paradise lost…

940
01:03:41,222 --> 01:03:43,395
- In monthly installments.
- I like it.

941
01:03:44,025 --> 01:03:47,391
I am happy.
Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes!

942
01:03:47,415 --> 01:03:49,816
Yes! Yes! Yes! I'm happy!

943
01:03:50,745 --> 01:03:52,045
Happy…

944
01:03:54,375 --> 01:03:55,675
Save'!

945
01:03:55,727 --> 01:03:57,475
You frighten me.

946
01:05:13,105 --> 01:05:14,405
Hi.

947
01:05:16,505 --> 01:05:18,105
Daddy's leaving now.

948
01:05:19,105 --> 01:05:20,405
Bye.

949
01:05:21,025 --> 01:05:22,325
Bye bye.

950
01:05:32,385 --> 01:05:34,931
No, hush. Be good, eh? Bye.

951
01:05:35,039 --> 01:05:36,339
Bye.

952
01:07:05,126 --> 01:07:06,576
Either I'm crazy…

953
01:07:07,339 --> 01:07:09,044
or everybody else is.

954
01:07:10,145 --> 01:07:12,761
Here's what you need for tomorrow.

955
01:07:12,785 --> 01:07:14,827
If the county calls again,
what do I say?

956
01:07:14,851 --> 01:07:17,475
To stop bitching.
And if they create difficulties,

957
01:07:17,499 --> 01:07:19,585
authorize Di Corato
to name Countess Spina.

958
01:07:19,609 --> 01:07:23,081
When they know she's in the deal,
they'll shit themselves.

959
01:07:23,105 --> 01:07:26,562
By the way, if Donna Raimonda calls,
tell her that…

960
01:07:26,907 --> 01:07:28,876
that I'm not back yet. Alright?

961
01:07:28,945 --> 01:07:31,027
- Counselor!
- What is it?

962
01:07:32,625 --> 01:07:35,976
Counselor, that billion,
seeing that it's there,

963
01:07:36,104 --> 01:07:39,659
why don't we settle for that
and go and enjoy it in peace?

964
01:07:39,683 --> 01:07:41,361
In peace? And after?

965
01:07:41,847 --> 01:07:45,797
I don't steal, Surveyor Colizzi!
I'm not a chicken thief like you.

966
01:07:45,821 --> 01:07:50,367
I'm a businessman and that's worth
way more than your measly billion.

967
01:07:50,391 --> 01:07:51,891
Do you understand?

968
01:07:52,102 --> 01:07:53,402
Very well.

969
01:07:53,829 --> 01:07:55,588
So what are we waiting for?

970
01:07:55,612 --> 01:07:58,124
Let's give her daughter back
and close this deal.

971
01:07:58,148 --> 01:08:01,322
What are we waiting for,
Counselor Mazzacolli?

972
01:08:02,438 --> 01:08:05,921
We're waiting for me to decide. OK?

973
01:08:06,748 --> 01:08:09,644
And turn that bullshit off,
because I pay the bills!

974
01:08:09,668 --> 01:08:10,968
I pay!

975
01:08:23,065 --> 01:08:24,365
Amen.

976
01:08:27,985 --> 01:08:30,942
And above all,
don't break my balls!

977
01:08:31,015 --> 01:08:32,315
There.

978
01:08:39,692 --> 01:08:41,192
Spanish style, eh?

979
01:08:46,985 --> 01:08:50,169
Fee, fi, fo, fum!
I smell the blood of an Englishman!

980
01:08:50,193 --> 01:08:54,115
There is or there has been,
I can smell it on their skin.

981
01:08:59,003 --> 01:09:00,863
Jump, little horse!

982
01:09:18,964 --> 01:09:22,013
Hey! Hey!

983
01:09:22,465 --> 01:09:24,203
Hey, but…

984
01:09:26,884 --> 01:09:29,122
But are you crazy?

985
01:09:31,025 --> 01:09:33,957
And yes you are crazy.
Look at this stuff.

986
01:09:33,981 --> 01:09:35,616
I'll let it dry.

987
01:09:42,265 --> 01:09:44,732
Well?
You not going to poo, are you?

988
01:09:44,865 --> 01:09:47,987
On the pillows… No, wait!
Concetta, the chamber pot!

989
01:09:48,105 --> 01:09:50,321
Wait. No, no, wait!

990
01:09:52,785 --> 01:09:55,086
Well, in for a penny,
in for a pound.

991
01:09:55,905 --> 01:09:59,444
Clo, now I like everything
about you. Everything!

992
01:10:01,345 --> 01:10:04,081
Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes!

993
01:10:04,105 --> 01:10:07,334
It is a good thing! Human!

994
01:10:07,865 --> 01:10:10,775
Right! Yes, gentle people, alright?

995
01:10:11,220 --> 01:10:13,776
And please, don't break my balls!

996
01:10:36,284 --> 01:10:37,584
Saverio!

997
01:10:37,867 --> 01:10:39,817
Where have you been hiding?

998
01:10:40,014 --> 01:10:42,807
You haven't been in touch
for 2 days or given any news!

999
01:10:42,831 --> 01:10:45,438
- Why?
- Where did you just come from?

1000
01:10:47,026 --> 01:10:49,125
- I don't have a shirt on.
- I see.

1001
01:10:52,745 --> 01:10:54,045
Saverio,

1002
01:10:54,453 --> 01:10:56,053
what does this mean?

1003
01:10:56,119 --> 01:10:57,419
What happened?

1004
01:10:57,665 --> 01:10:59,035
Nothing.

1005
01:10:59,109 --> 01:11:02,494
- Nothing happened.
- No, you must explain.

1006
01:11:02,575 --> 01:11:04,870
- Do you trust me or not?
- I don't know.

1007
01:11:04,894 --> 01:11:07,322
- Great! Have we come to this?
- We have!

1008
01:11:07,346 --> 01:11:09,435
- Then you want to know?
- I do.

1009
01:11:09,516 --> 01:11:12,046
You want to know the truth?
Want me to tell you all?

1010
01:11:12,070 --> 01:11:13,370
Yes.

1011
01:11:14,145 --> 01:11:15,595
I won't tell you.

1012
01:11:16,188 --> 01:11:17,638
I won't tell you!

1013
01:11:19,705 --> 01:11:21,005
Alright?

1014
01:11:43,905 --> 01:11:46,105
Promise me you'll never grow up.

1015
01:11:46,785 --> 01:11:48,485
My little, little one.

1016
01:11:50,385 --> 01:11:52,229
Don't come to this world.

1017
01:11:52,253 --> 01:11:53,953
They don't understand.

1018
01:11:56,980 --> 01:11:59,106
I want to come where you are.

1019
01:12:00,985 --> 01:12:02,685
I want to be with you.

1020
01:12:03,665 --> 01:12:05,682
You and me alone.

1021
01:12:08,465 --> 01:12:10,786
They will sign, Counselor,

1022
01:12:10,980 --> 01:12:14,461
but they want 20 to
25 million right away!

1023
01:12:14,485 --> 01:12:16,755
To plug up the most urgent holes!

1024
01:12:18,152 --> 01:12:19,441
Insist.

1025
01:12:19,465 --> 01:12:23,201
Counselor, you must give me
at least 10 million now

1026
01:12:23,225 --> 01:12:25,516
or I can't keep them at bay!

1027
01:12:27,930 --> 01:12:30,815
- Counselor!
- Bye-byes!

1028
01:12:33,825 --> 01:12:35,289
Bye-byes!

1029
01:12:38,345 --> 01:12:40,345
- Where are you going?
- Hey!

1030
01:12:41,705 --> 01:12:43,505
What are you doing here?

1031
01:12:46,545 --> 01:12:49,281
- Are you keeping watch?
- You can't enter.

1032
01:12:49,305 --> 01:12:51,612
The counselor doesn't
want to be disturbed.

1033
01:12:51,636 --> 01:12:54,394
- Who wants to enter?
- Leave me alone!

1034
01:12:55,389 --> 01:12:56,689
Look here…

1035
01:13:00,385 --> 01:13:03,116
- What do you want?
- To talk with you.

1036
01:13:03,896 --> 01:13:06,001
- Don't you believe me?
- No.

1037
01:13:06,968 --> 01:13:08,418
I really mean it.

1038
01:13:19,945 --> 01:13:22,908
The lawyer's having fun in there…

1039
01:13:23,599 --> 01:13:26,644
and you keep watch outside
like a dog.

1040
01:13:27,304 --> 01:13:29,201
- My fucking business.
- Not at all.

1041
01:13:29,225 --> 01:13:30,825
If you listen to me,

1042
01:13:31,567 --> 01:13:32,967
you'd be a lady.

1043
01:13:34,248 --> 01:13:35,598
Furs.

1044
01:13:37,696 --> 01:13:41,650
- Apartments, cars!
- Yeah, with a beggar like you.

1045
01:13:41,674 --> 01:13:43,124
What do you think?

1046
01:13:43,497 --> 01:13:46,025
I know tons of people with money.

1047
01:13:46,264 --> 01:13:47,564
And vices!

1048
01:13:54,105 --> 01:13:56,103
If you were better dressed,

1049
01:13:56,230 --> 01:13:59,215
- you'd be a fine…
- Asshole! You think I'd be a whore?

1050
01:13:59,606 --> 01:14:03,713
- What's that with the lawyer then?
- I love the counselor.

1051
01:14:03,737 --> 01:14:04,975
Love?

1052
01:14:04,999 --> 01:14:06,279
For how much?

1053
01:14:06,460 --> 01:14:07,760
For 20?

1054
01:14:08,175 --> 01:14:09,881
For 30,000 lire?

1055
01:14:11,465 --> 01:14:14,019
With all these lovely
things that you have,

1056
01:14:14,145 --> 01:14:15,897
you could get 100,

1057
01:14:15,921 --> 01:14:18,041
even 150,000 lire a hit.

1058
01:14:18,065 --> 01:14:20,312
Leave me.
What do you want to do?

1059
01:14:20,422 --> 01:14:23,151
If I have to sell the goods,

1060
01:14:23,981 --> 01:14:26,647
I must try it first, right?

1061
01:14:29,825 --> 01:14:31,325
A little more red.

1062
01:14:32,505 --> 01:14:33,805
There.

1063
01:14:36,145 --> 01:14:37,495
Just like that.

1064
01:15:25,392 --> 01:15:26,837
Hey!

1065
01:15:26,955 --> 01:15:30,251
No! No! No! No!
Clotilde, please. I beg you.

1066
01:15:30,275 --> 01:15:32,381
OK! OK! OK!

1067
01:15:32,475 --> 01:15:33,775
Easy…

1068
01:15:40,470 --> 01:15:41,770
Concetta!

1069
01:15:50,943 --> 01:15:53,057
Sir, what happened?
Did you cut yourself?

1070
01:15:53,081 --> 01:15:55,317
- What are you doing here?
- The duke sent me.

1071
01:15:55,341 --> 01:15:57,316
He says Donna Raimonda
is beside herself.

1072
01:15:57,340 --> 01:16:00,773
She says if she doesn't hear anything
by tomorrow, she's going to the police.

1073
01:16:00,797 --> 01:16:03,933
- The duke says…
- He says! She says! You wait.

1074
01:16:03,957 --> 01:16:05,338
- You whore.
- See?

1075
01:16:05,362 --> 01:16:07,876
- Even the lawyer say so.
- Shut up!

1076
01:16:17,155 --> 01:16:19,840
- Alright. Concetta…
- He's nervous.

1077
01:16:19,925 --> 01:16:21,392
When I'm gone,

1078
01:16:22,259 --> 01:16:24,074
clean up a bit, tidy up…

1079
01:16:24,321 --> 01:16:26,213
and throw it all in the woods.

1080
01:16:26,237 --> 01:16:28,097
- It's your fault.
- Got it?

1081
01:16:29,235 --> 01:16:31,927
Tomorrow morning,
Peppe comes here at 8 sharp.

1082
01:16:31,951 --> 01:16:33,324
You go to the town

1083
01:16:33,348 --> 01:16:36,492
and only come back when your
holidays are over, not a day before.

1084
01:16:36,516 --> 01:16:38,562
- OK?
- Yes, Sir. - Come on!

1085
01:16:41,864 --> 01:16:43,314
Tomorrow morning,

1086
01:16:44,092 --> 01:16:46,693
you stay here with
Clotilde and wait for me.

1087
01:16:46,915 --> 01:16:49,354
I'll come later and
we'll take her home.

1088
01:16:49,441 --> 01:16:52,509
Counselor, why do I need to come?

1089
01:16:53,091 --> 01:16:55,483
Can't you bring her
back by yourself?

1090
01:16:56,843 --> 01:16:58,210
Just look…

1091
01:16:58,310 --> 01:16:59,869
Look at this imbecile.

1092
01:16:59,893 --> 01:17:02,343
I want to make you
look like a hero.

1093
01:17:03,801 --> 01:17:08,047
When we bring the daughter back
to Donna Raimonda with the billion,

1094
01:17:08,253 --> 01:17:11,866
I'll say you helped me
in finding out where she was.

1095
01:17:12,292 --> 01:17:14,474
I'm not from here
and you're a local.

1096
01:17:14,498 --> 01:17:18,128
Donna Raimonda will be grateful.
You'll get double the prize money.

1097
01:17:18,152 --> 01:17:21,103
Legal money, which you can
use in the light of day.

1098
01:17:21,127 --> 01:17:23,952
Tomorrow is your day,
Surveyor Colizzi.

1099
01:17:29,225 --> 01:17:32,072
Alright. I'll be here
tomorrow morning at 8.

1100
01:17:32,191 --> 01:17:33,558
Good.

1101
01:17:34,545 --> 01:17:36,945
- See you tomorrow, Counselor.
- Bye.

1102
01:19:15,745 --> 01:19:18,280
All night there, like a fool.

1103
01:19:20,097 --> 01:19:21,847
Well, I'm leaving then.

1104
01:19:27,870 --> 01:19:29,270
Little countess…

1105
01:20:13,866 --> 01:20:17,244
An ingenious scoundrel.
Who would ever think of the cottage?

1106
01:20:18,032 --> 01:20:19,692
Did I make you suffer?

1107
01:20:20,011 --> 01:20:23,271
But I wanted to be careful.
To catch him in the act.

1108
01:20:23,805 --> 01:20:26,729
I also wanted to be sure
he acted on his own.

1109
01:20:27,102 --> 01:20:29,236
- And then…
- And then?

1110
01:20:30,189 --> 01:20:33,489
And then I made sure
you'd see it with your own eyes.

1111
01:20:34,136 --> 01:20:36,386
So there would be no more doubts.

1112
01:20:36,567 --> 01:20:38,801
Saverio, forgive me
for the other night but…

1113
01:20:38,825 --> 01:20:40,258
No, please.

1114
01:20:40,555 --> 01:20:42,598
Won't he be rash if he's trapped?

1115
01:20:42,622 --> 01:20:45,083
He'll run away.
He's very intelligent.

1116
01:20:46,151 --> 01:20:49,561
And then fleeing and keeping quiet
will suit him as well as us.

1117
01:20:49,585 --> 01:20:52,135
What matters is
that Clotilde is safe.

1118
01:20:52,700 --> 01:20:56,200
By the way, I've already put
your money back in the bank.

1119
01:21:26,665 --> 01:21:28,441
You're an idiot…

1120
01:21:28,704 --> 01:21:30,235
but not bad at all.

1121
01:21:31,758 --> 01:21:33,058
Not bad…

1122
01:21:34,343 --> 01:21:36,613
I can almost sign off on that too.

1123
01:21:37,706 --> 01:21:39,006
Besides…

1124
01:21:40,373 --> 01:21:42,642
Mazzacolli and I are partners.

1125
01:21:45,890 --> 01:21:48,594
Stay where you are! Don't move!

1126
01:21:58,745 --> 01:22:00,677
Shut up! Shut up!

1127
01:22:24,630 --> 01:22:26,702
That son of a bitch!

1128
01:22:41,565 --> 01:22:42,865
Raimonda!

1129
01:22:44,141 --> 01:22:47,089
Help, Countess! Help!

1130
01:22:49,082 --> 01:22:51,112
Clo! Clotilde!

1131
01:22:51,136 --> 01:22:53,122
- Get up.
- Clo!

1132
01:22:53,146 --> 01:22:56,161
My flower! Beautiful flower!

1133
01:22:56,986 --> 01:22:59,152
What did that bastard do?

1134
01:23:02,985 --> 01:23:04,285
Love!

1135
01:23:08,098 --> 01:23:10,652
- Get the blanket, Anna!
- Yes.

1136
01:23:10,676 --> 01:23:13,019
- She passed out.
- Clotilde!

1137
01:23:13,199 --> 01:23:15,795
Clo… Clo… My daughter…

1138
01:23:16,368 --> 01:23:17,668
Clo…

1139
01:23:17,864 --> 01:23:19,403
Bastard!

1140
01:23:24,502 --> 01:23:26,628
- Well, Doctor?
- Later.

1141
01:23:37,299 --> 01:23:39,509
Unfortunately, it was done.

1142
01:23:39,534 --> 01:23:41,941
Dirty coward, son of a bitch.

1143
01:23:42,828 --> 01:23:46,267
- But this is not the end. I'll…
- You must be strong, Counselor.

1144
01:23:46,689 --> 01:23:50,201
The good luck is that
the countess, in this misfortune,

1145
01:23:50,241 --> 01:23:52,521
in the mental condition
in which she is,

1146
01:23:52,545 --> 01:23:54,714
must not have even realized it.

1147
01:23:54,825 --> 01:23:57,428
All is saved except for honor.

1148
01:23:57,453 --> 01:24:00,253
- You take me to her!
- Right away, Princess.

1149
01:24:02,729 --> 01:24:04,029
Excuse me.

1150
01:24:07,402 --> 01:24:09,959
I realize that
the situation has changed.

1151
01:24:10,065 --> 01:24:12,595
Saverio, if you want to back out,
you may.

1152
01:24:12,619 --> 01:24:15,373
No, what does this matter?
Who cares about that?

1153
01:24:17,152 --> 01:24:18,808
Sure, this has made me…

1154
01:24:19,945 --> 01:24:21,441
It's understandable…

1155
01:24:21,465 --> 01:24:25,173
Saverio is upset.
These things, you know…

1156
01:24:25,425 --> 01:24:27,441
Maybe it's best that I speak.

1157
01:24:27,465 --> 01:24:30,190
Maybe this isn't the best time but…

1158
01:24:30,214 --> 01:24:33,134
since you brought it up,
I might as well.

1159
01:24:33,613 --> 01:24:38,257
Indeed, as you well said,
the situation has changed.

1160
01:24:38,545 --> 01:24:40,495
But Saverio is a gentleman.

1161
01:24:40,841 --> 01:24:44,360
Let's give him time to recover,
to digest the blow…

1162
01:24:44,510 --> 01:24:48,108
He'll marry Clotilde.
He'll marry her even…

1163
01:24:48,351 --> 01:24:49,641
as she is.

1164
01:24:49,665 --> 01:24:52,166
- Though at this juncture…
- This juncture?

1165
01:24:52,190 --> 01:24:55,550
Well, you're an intelligent woman,
Raimonda dear…

1166
01:24:55,625 --> 01:25:00,326
a small tweak to the nuptial
contract would seem right to me.

1167
01:25:01,586 --> 01:25:04,406
See, I knew it: You're reasonable.

1168
01:25:04,430 --> 01:25:06,407
And it's just a small thing:

1169
01:25:06,545 --> 01:25:10,353
You renounce some of the usufruct,
let him manage the properties…

1170
01:25:10,377 --> 01:25:13,035
Let's say instead
that I will back out.

1171
01:25:13,345 --> 01:25:14,645
Excuse me?

1172
01:25:18,437 --> 01:25:21,472
Let's give Saverio time
to digest the blow.

1173
01:25:21,496 --> 01:25:23,196
All the time he needs.

1174
01:25:23,425 --> 01:25:25,402
My daughter will not marry.

1175
01:25:26,105 --> 01:25:28,162
I'll keep her with me as she is.

1176
01:25:29,145 --> 01:25:31,345
She's fine to me the way she is.

1177
01:25:33,905 --> 01:25:35,405
Donna Raimonda, I…

1178
01:25:36,150 --> 01:25:39,281
- I don't understand.
- I understand, Don Amilcare.

1179
01:25:39,306 --> 01:25:41,737
Fine, if you understand…

1180
01:25:49,385 --> 01:25:50,685
Saverio!

1181
01:25:51,527 --> 01:25:53,685
We'll rip up the marriage contract,

1182
01:25:53,709 --> 01:25:56,500
but business is business,
Counselor Mazzacolli.

1183
01:25:56,585 --> 01:25:59,681
Not as a son-in-law,
but as a partner you may suit me.

1184
01:25:59,705 --> 01:26:01,592
- But I wanted…
- Saverio,

1185
01:26:01,616 --> 01:26:03,666
let's talk about it tomorrow.

1186
01:27:14,425 --> 01:27:17,986
Clo! Drink, Clo.
Come now, be good.

1187
01:27:19,145 --> 01:27:20,497
My goodness!

1188
01:27:27,254 --> 01:27:28,554
Clo!

1189
01:27:28,687 --> 01:27:29,987
Clotilde!

1190
01:27:35,140 --> 01:27:37,792
What are you doing there?
Get the doctor! Hurry!

1191
01:27:37,816 --> 01:27:39,320
I'm going!

1192
01:27:40,355 --> 01:27:42,474
Clo! Clo!

1193
01:27:53,300 --> 01:27:54,600
Saverio!

1194
01:28:01,206 --> 01:28:03,206
But why don't you go to bed?

1195
01:28:04,535 --> 01:28:06,400
It's one o'clock, Save'.

1196
01:28:06,424 --> 01:28:08,833
Tomorrow. Take it easy.

1197
01:28:37,973 --> 01:28:40,711
I can't keep doping
her with sedatives.

1198
01:28:40,735 --> 01:28:44,066
I'm worried about her mental state.
I would call a specialist.

1199
01:28:44,090 --> 01:28:47,023
- The tarantula stung her!
They bewitched her! - Hush.

1200
01:28:47,047 --> 01:28:51,191
If she doesn't eat for a week,
we can't continue with the drip.

1201
01:28:51,215 --> 01:28:53,265
I'm sorry, Countess. Goodbye.

1202
01:28:54,284 --> 01:28:56,513
My respects, Princess.

1203
01:29:03,895 --> 01:29:05,195
Clo?

1204
01:29:05,695 --> 01:29:06,995
Clotilde?

1205
01:29:12,255 --> 01:29:13,604
Clo?

1206
01:29:14,331 --> 01:29:15,631
Little one…

1207
01:29:20,095 --> 01:29:21,395
Little one…

1208
01:29:24,015 --> 01:29:25,315
Raimonda!

1209
01:29:30,295 --> 01:29:32,575
She needs a man, understand?

1210
01:29:32,811 --> 01:29:35,329
We must marry her
immediately to that guy.

1211
01:29:35,353 --> 01:29:37,442
That will be the real cure.

1212
01:29:37,770 --> 01:29:39,740
You are all blind!

1213
01:30:51,655 --> 01:30:54,368
Save', here's the coffee
It's ten o'clock.

1214
01:30:54,453 --> 01:30:55,822
- At night?
- No, day.

1215
01:30:55,846 --> 01:30:58,146
At least come down
for a bite to eat.

1216
01:31:00,749 --> 01:31:03,931
- No pap.
- Huh? What did you say?

1217
01:31:04,055 --> 01:31:06,419
- No pap!
- Oh, no!

1218
01:31:06,858 --> 01:31:09,031
That won't do! No!

1219
01:31:10,415 --> 01:31:13,180
Bregonzo phoned. I spoke to him.

1220
01:31:13,307 --> 01:31:14,986
Everything can be saved.

1221
01:31:15,655 --> 01:31:16,955
Really?

1222
01:31:17,976 --> 01:31:20,274
- Tomorrow.
- What tomorrow?

1223
01:31:20,357 --> 01:31:23,672
He says the new minister is
ready to take an interest.

1224
01:31:23,815 --> 01:31:27,071
Indeed, to give a joint interest.
He expects a call.

1225
01:31:27,095 --> 01:31:28,878
What shall I do? Call him?

1226
01:31:28,902 --> 01:31:32,591
- Bregonzo can go fuck himself.
- Go fuck himself?

1227
01:31:32,615 --> 01:31:36,551
Have you forgotten that a half
billion of options are at stake?

1228
01:31:36,575 --> 01:31:40,384
Your money and not just yours!
Think a little about yours truly!

1229
01:31:40,408 --> 01:31:43,627
- Emerald Shores!
- Fuck Emerald Shores.

1230
01:31:46,382 --> 01:31:49,787
And above all,
don't break my balls!

1231
01:31:51,735 --> 01:31:53,235
He needs a doctor.

1232
01:31:59,175 --> 01:32:00,525
Leave me alone.

1233
01:32:01,060 --> 01:32:03,030
Otherwise, I'll…

1234
01:32:30,625 --> 01:32:33,625
I've been spying on you
for a few days, Mazzacolli.

1235
01:32:34,185 --> 01:32:37,069
If you think this is over,
you're wrong.

1236
01:32:38,823 --> 01:32:40,402
You'll pay for it.

1237
01:32:51,679 --> 01:32:53,421
You son of a bitch!

1238
01:32:53,589 --> 01:32:55,684
Disgusting worm!

1239
01:32:58,268 --> 01:32:59,568
Worm!

1240
01:33:04,046 --> 01:33:05,446
Disgusting worm!

1241
01:33:07,151 --> 01:33:09,207
What did you do to Clotilde?

1242
01:33:11,815 --> 01:33:14,527
Nothing… Nothing, I swear.

1243
01:33:15,008 --> 01:33:16,308
On my life…

1244
01:33:16,856 --> 01:33:18,669
On my mother's memory.

1245
01:33:18,815 --> 01:33:20,297
Yes, I tried…

1246
01:33:20,321 --> 01:33:22,981
but I didn't do anything to her.
I swear!

1247
01:33:23,095 --> 01:33:24,595
What do you swear?

1248
01:33:25,295 --> 01:33:28,204
On my mother's life.
I didn't do anything to her.

1249
01:33:28,295 --> 01:33:29,595
Nothing.

1250
01:33:31,569 --> 01:33:35,377
I won't kill you because I pity you.
I pity you all. You make me sick!

1251
01:33:35,474 --> 01:33:37,274
What do you want? Money?

1252
01:33:55,295 --> 01:33:58,527
Don't worry, I won't stop it
in the bank. You can cash it.

1253
01:34:00,056 --> 01:34:01,556
It's even covered.

1254
01:34:11,903 --> 01:34:13,203
Counselor!

1255
01:34:18,815 --> 01:34:20,565
- Thank you.
- For what?

1256
01:34:22,072 --> 01:34:24,933
Servants are paid
when they serve well.

1257
01:34:25,481 --> 01:34:27,481
And you have served me well.

1258
01:34:33,787 --> 01:34:35,405
Actually… Take it!

1259
01:34:36,869 --> 01:34:38,169
A gift.

1260
01:34:39,411 --> 01:34:42,128
You've been drooling
over it since you saw it.

1261
01:34:42,607 --> 01:34:43,957
My gift to you.

1262
01:34:59,362 --> 01:35:02,513
You take care of the transfer
of ownership. Understand?

1263
01:35:06,815 --> 01:35:10,114
If you don't admit her immediately,
I decline all responsibility.

1264
01:35:10,138 --> 01:35:12,138
Electroshock and right away!

1265
01:35:12,254 --> 01:35:14,725
We will then have a consultation.

1266
01:35:14,799 --> 01:35:17,412
- So, do we agree, Donna Raimonda?
- No.

1267
01:35:17,436 --> 01:35:19,382
- What?
- I said no.

1268
01:35:19,438 --> 01:35:21,712
Well then, good day.

1269
01:35:21,953 --> 01:35:23,579
Good day, Doctor.

1270
01:35:25,265 --> 01:35:26,961
I'll give him everything:

1271
01:35:26,985 --> 01:35:29,455
palaces, lands, factories…

1272
01:35:29,594 --> 01:35:31,775
Everything. But he must marry her.

1273
01:35:32,415 --> 01:35:33,915
He must marry her.

1274
01:35:35,455 --> 01:35:36,755
Bravo!

1275
01:35:37,332 --> 01:35:39,138
Hurry up, for heaven's sake!

1276
01:35:39,162 --> 01:35:43,559
Bregonzo's plane with the minister
arrives in an hour and a half!

1277
01:35:43,655 --> 01:35:46,071
You made me sick all night.

1278
01:35:47,086 --> 01:35:50,041
But where the hell were you?

1279
01:35:50,271 --> 01:35:53,532
- You have become a wild cat.
- A cat is beautiful.

1280
01:35:53,735 --> 01:35:55,736
Watch out for those two, eh?

1281
01:35:56,010 --> 01:35:57,810
Are you listening to me?

1282
01:35:58,968 --> 01:36:00,268
Yes!

1283
01:36:01,260 --> 01:36:03,231
The minister is coming to look.

1284
01:36:03,255 --> 01:36:06,794
To talk to you and
have the project explained.

1285
01:36:08,022 --> 01:36:10,390
- The recovery of the South…
- The project, sure.

1286
01:36:10,414 --> 01:36:12,044
- The economic roll-out.
- Yes.

1287
01:36:12,068 --> 01:36:15,380
And all that bullshit. You don't
need me to tell you what to say, eh?

1288
01:36:15,404 --> 01:36:16,670
No.

1289
01:36:16,694 --> 01:36:19,264
- Concetta!
- Here, Peppe!

1290
01:36:29,695 --> 01:36:32,711
Tonight we sleep in Bari
and then… in Milan!

1291
01:36:32,735 --> 01:36:36,685
I've a friend who emigrated last year
and he's in the big leagues!

1292
01:36:37,435 --> 01:36:39,698
Is it really true?
He gave it to you?

1293
01:36:41,068 --> 01:36:42,468
He's a fine man.

1294
01:36:42,775 --> 01:36:44,075
Poor guy.

1295
01:36:44,505 --> 01:36:47,389
In Milan, there's
the Duomo with 100 spires!

1296
01:36:53,780 --> 01:36:55,409
I put it all in the bag:

1297
01:36:55,433 --> 01:36:58,111
drawings, financial plans,
a copy of the application,

1298
01:36:58,135 --> 01:37:00,635
copy of option contracts,
everything!

1299
01:37:01,015 --> 01:37:02,315
Certainly.

1300
01:37:03,416 --> 01:37:04,716
And the bag?

1301
01:37:08,655 --> 01:37:10,605
The bag can go fuck itself.

1302
01:37:13,160 --> 01:37:14,460
Bye.

1303
01:37:21,098 --> 01:37:24,578
Counselor Saverio Mazzacolli…

1304
01:37:25,335 --> 01:37:27,058
Mazza-shitty!

1305
01:37:31,465 --> 01:37:35,191
Go now to the Loyola Palace.
Deliver it to Counselor Mazzacolli.

1306
01:37:35,215 --> 01:37:37,765
Be careful:
give it to him personally.

1307
01:37:37,975 --> 01:37:39,275
Yes, Ma'am.

1308
01:38:01,095 --> 01:38:03,791
Ma'am, Counselor Mazzacolli's here.

1309
01:38:03,815 --> 01:38:06,065
- He's here?
- Shall I let him in?

1310
01:38:27,295 --> 01:38:28,595
Listen…

1311
01:38:30,578 --> 01:38:31,978
I want Clotilde.

1312
01:38:32,706 --> 01:38:35,656
No, I don't want anything else.
Just Clotilde.

1313
01:38:35,855 --> 01:38:38,027
You take everything, Emerald Shores…

1314
01:38:38,051 --> 01:38:39,922
Take anything you want.

1315
01:38:42,295 --> 01:38:44,095
Just let me be near her.

1316
01:38:47,518 --> 01:38:48,818
I love her.

1317
01:38:51,186 --> 01:38:52,486
I love her.

1318
01:38:54,335 --> 01:38:55,885
Did you come here.…

1319
01:38:56,476 --> 01:38:58,571
- to tell me this?
- Yes.

1320
01:38:59,775 --> 01:39:01,863
- Have you read…?
- What?

1321
01:39:02,735 --> 01:39:05,618
- The letter?
- No, what does it say? - Nothing.

1322
01:39:06,132 --> 01:39:08,282
Nothing. It's not important.

1323
01:39:11,044 --> 01:39:12,583
Come. Come!

1324
01:39:53,455 --> 01:39:54,755
Clo.

1325
01:39:56,615 --> 01:39:57,915
My love?

1326
01:40:15,455 --> 01:40:16,755
Clo!

1327
01:40:28,561 --> 01:40:29,861
Clo…

1328
01:40:35,015 --> 01:40:36,315
Clo!

1329
01:40:53,139 --> 01:40:54,439
Well?

1330
01:41:08,073 --> 01:41:09,373
Clo!

1331
01:41:23,729 --> 01:41:27,748
Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes!
Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes!

1332
01:41:30,939 --> 01:41:32,689
Let's leave them alone.

1333
01:41:47,811 --> 01:41:49,804
It is the will of the Lord!

1334
01:41:54,288 --> 01:41:58,025
The letter?
Has he already read it?

1335
01:41:58,815 --> 01:42:00,874
Whatever! Well then...

1336
01:42:01,291 --> 01:42:04,012
everything is all sorted out!

1337
01:42:26,633 --> 01:42:28,087
Yes, go on. I love…

1338
01:42:28,111 --> 01:42:29,611
I love you.

1339
01:42:30,000 --> 01:42:31,774
I love…

1340
01:42:32,089 --> 01:42:33,907
I love…

1341
01:42:35,343 --> 01:42:38,354
Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes!
I understand! I do!

00:00:13,013 --> 00:00:14,753
Jackpot. Bust it up, dog.

2
00:00:14,797 --> 00:00:16,712
No, no, no. Not right now, yo.

3
00:00:17,191 --> 00:00:18,757
I think it's the cops.

4
00:00:18,801 --> 00:00:20,387
Come on, stop being scared
and bust the window out, man.

5
00:00:20,411 --> 00:00:21,282
I'm not being scared, man.

6
00:00:21,325 --> 00:00:22,761
This is what we came here for!

7
00:00:22,805 --> 00:00:23,675
Bust them out!
- I'm just saying it's going be to...

8
00:00:23,719 --> 00:00:24,676
Shh. Somebody's coming.

9
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:26,417
We'll handle this later.

10
00:00:31,031 --> 00:00:33,424
Hey, Elizabeth, it's me.

11
00:00:34,338 --> 00:00:35,557
Ahh!

12
00:00:36,601 --> 00:00:39,213
That's going to leave
a mark in the morning.

13
00:00:44,740 --> 00:00:47,003
You go, check his
wallet, check his wallet.

14
00:00:47,351 --> 00:00:48,546
Where's the money at, big boy?

15
00:00:48,570 --> 00:00:50,746
Here we go. Here we go.

16
00:00:51,181 --> 00:00:53,401
Yo, yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah.

17
00:00:53,444 --> 00:00:55,011
What else you got for me?

18
00:00:55,055 --> 00:00:55,968
What else you got for, huh?
There's a couple hundred, boy.

19
00:00:56,012 --> 00:00:56,578
Oh yeah.

20
00:00:56,621 --> 00:00:57,274
Yeah.

21
00:00:57,318 --> 00:00:58,449
I'm seeing flash.

22
00:00:58,493 --> 00:01:00,451
I'm seeing some flash.

23
00:01:00,495 --> 00:01:02,375
Shit!
- You know what I can get for this, huh?

24
00:01:02,410 --> 00:01:03,498
Thanks, big dog.

25
00:01:10,461 --> 00:01:12,507
Do you know what happened?

26
00:01:12,550 --> 00:01:14,552
I'm not sure.

27
00:01:14,813 --> 00:01:16,554
Oh, my head.

28
00:01:16,598 --> 00:01:19,079
Can't imagine
that feels too good.

29
00:01:19,644 --> 00:01:21,298
Mister...

30
00:01:22,343 --> 00:01:25,433
- White.
- Jackson White.

31
00:01:28,088 --> 00:01:31,091
Mister White,
you seem like a decent guy.

32
00:01:31,352 --> 00:01:34,833
Can you tell me why you're
face down in an alley?

33
00:01:38,533 --> 00:01:39,795
Just...

34
00:01:39,838 --> 00:01:43,190
This isn't how I thought
my life would turn out.

35
00:01:44,582 --> 00:01:47,585
But do you ever feel like you're
not the man you want to be?

36
00:01:47,629 --> 00:01:50,588
You know, I wanted to do
something that mattered.

37
00:01:50,632 --> 00:01:51,763
I want more.

38
00:01:51,807 --> 00:01:53,635
Can we focus on tonight?

39
00:01:53,678 --> 00:01:55,593
October 27th.

40
00:01:55,637 --> 00:01:57,117
It's my birthday.

41
00:01:57,682 --> 00:01:59,858
My 30th birthday.

42
00:01:59,902 --> 00:02:01,469
You were drinking?

43
00:02:01,773 --> 00:02:03,819
Yeah, there was a party.

44
00:02:09,390 --> 00:02:10,434
My client...

45
00:02:10,478 --> 00:02:11,653
What, what do you do?

46
00:02:11,696 --> 00:02:13,263
I'm a music manager.

47
00:02:13,307 --> 00:02:14,699
Hmm.

48
00:02:26,146 --> 00:02:30,106
He sang a song about my fiance.

49
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:32,195
How can we contact her?

50
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:34,371
Why do you keep doing this?

51
00:02:34,415 --> 00:02:35,720
What do you mean?

52
00:02:36,634 --> 00:02:40,986
My ex fiance.

53
00:02:41,422 --> 00:02:42,292
Liz!

54
00:02:42,336 --> 00:02:44,555
I screwed it up.

55
00:02:56,524 --> 00:02:57,612
Did you have any arguments?

56
00:02:57,655 --> 00:03:00,484
Anything out of the
ordinary happen?

57
00:03:01,181 --> 00:03:02,878
Not really.

58
00:03:03,531 --> 00:03:06,098
Why did you sit
down with Gammons?

59
00:03:07,056 --> 00:03:08,405
L.A.'s a small town, James.

60
00:03:08,449 --> 00:03:11,060
Dude, I don't want to
talk about this tonight.

61
00:03:18,894 --> 00:03:21,026
I left early.

62
00:03:21,418 --> 00:03:23,246
What happened at the party?

63
00:03:23,290 --> 00:03:25,205
Is there something
you're not telling me?

64
00:03:25,248 --> 00:03:26,597
Just talk to me about it.

65
00:03:26,641 --> 00:03:28,314
I feel like he's got
a lot of big clients.

66
00:03:28,338 --> 00:03:29,513
He can do something.

67
00:03:29,557 --> 00:03:31,167
His company has a
lot of big clients.

68
00:03:31,211 --> 00:03:33,300
He's a promotion away
from answering phones

69
00:03:33,343 --> 00:03:35,693
and making fucking coffee.

70
00:03:35,737 --> 00:03:39,175
My biggest client James,

71
00:03:39,654 --> 00:03:41,743
I think he's going to
sign with another manager.

72
00:03:44,180 --> 00:03:44,963
Just remember I was your client

73
00:03:45,007 --> 00:03:46,574
before I was your friend.

74
00:03:47,314 --> 00:03:50,621
Jackie boy,
it's your gray haired daddy.

75
00:03:50,665 --> 00:03:55,147
I wanted to call you earlier
but, well, happy birthday.

76
00:03:55,191 --> 00:03:56,627
I miss you, buddy.

77
00:03:56,671 --> 00:03:58,281
It's
Elizabeth. Leave a message.

78
00:03:58,325 --> 00:04:01,545
Hey, Elizabeth.
It's me, Jackson.

79
00:04:03,330 --> 00:04:05,288
I haven't spoken
to you in a while.

80
00:04:05,332 --> 00:04:10,337
Um, call me if, if you a, if...

81
00:04:24,829 --> 00:04:26,440
That's the
last thing I remember.

82
00:04:26,483 --> 00:04:29,007
- Go home.
- We'll be in touch.

83
00:05:04,739 --> 00:05:06,001
Jackson White's office.

84
00:05:06,044 --> 00:05:07,394
It's me.

85
00:05:07,437 --> 00:05:08,588
Dennis wants
to see you first thing.

86
00:05:08,612 --> 00:05:09,831
Where are you?

87
00:05:09,874 --> 00:05:11,461
I'm going to work
out of the house today.

88
00:05:11,485 --> 00:05:13,487
Jesus. You've
got three meetings and a lunch.

89
00:05:13,530 --> 00:05:14,749
Reschedule them.

90
00:05:14,792 --> 00:05:15,793
What do I tell Dennis?

91
00:05:15,837 --> 00:05:17,229
Uh, car trouble.

92
00:05:17,273 --> 00:05:18,685
Look, we need to find something
for James immediately.

93
00:05:18,709 --> 00:05:19,797
I mean, right now.

94
00:05:19,841 --> 00:05:20,798
Find out who's looking
for opening acts

95
00:05:20,842 --> 00:05:22,583
and put it in an email asap.

96
00:05:22,626 --> 00:05:24,062
People we know or everybody.

97
00:05:24,106 --> 00:05:25,890
Everybody,
Stefanie. Everybody.

98
00:05:25,934 --> 00:05:28,066
He's moving more units
in the Pacific Northwest.

99
00:05:28,110 --> 00:05:29,285
He's getting more airplay.

100
00:05:29,329 --> 00:05:31,548
I mean, this guy is
the next John Mayer.

101
00:05:31,592 --> 00:05:33,376
It's the same act.

102
00:05:33,420 --> 00:05:34,725
Another girl with a guitar!

103
00:05:34,769 --> 00:05:36,248
Crisis control.
It's what I do, man.

104
00:05:36,292 --> 00:05:37,511
It's what I do.

105
00:05:37,554 --> 00:05:38,792
It's what separates
the men from the boys.

106
00:05:38,816 --> 00:05:39,837
I pushed them into Thursday.

107
00:05:39,861 --> 00:05:41,471
Friday you have a
9:30 staff meeting.

108
00:05:41,515 --> 00:05:42,907
Lunch with the
head of the T Recs,

109
00:05:42,951 --> 00:05:44,624
you need to stop by the War
Presidents' video shoot.

110
00:05:44,648 --> 00:05:46,128
When do I sleep?

111
00:05:48,652 --> 00:05:50,437
Oh shit, I'd got to get this.

112
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:51,525
It's a Carolina number.

113
00:05:51,568 --> 00:05:53,135
Uh, I'll talk to you tomorrow.

114
00:05:53,178 --> 00:05:54,354
Good work today.

115
00:05:54,397 --> 00:05:55,790
Say hi to your dad for me.

116
00:05:55,833 --> 00:05:56,833
Yeah, will do.

117
00:05:58,358 --> 00:05:59,924
What do you want?

118
00:06:00,664 --> 00:06:01,622
Who?

119
00:06:01,665 --> 00:06:03,145
Oh, Foster!

120
00:06:03,450 --> 00:06:06,278
Hey, man, I haven't
spoken to you in a while.

121
00:06:09,325 --> 00:06:11,109
Wait. Wait. Wait.

122
00:06:16,332 --> 00:06:17,899
Cancer.

123
00:07:02,422 --> 00:07:03,423
Sir?

124
00:07:03,466 --> 00:07:04,902
Sir, excuse me.

125
00:07:04,946 --> 00:07:07,688
I don't want to wake
you up, but we're here.

126
00:07:27,316 --> 00:07:29,187
Oh, come on.

127
00:07:31,625 --> 00:07:33,148
This is great.

128
00:07:39,633 --> 00:07:40,808
Hello?

129
00:07:41,678 --> 00:07:43,724
You forgot a bag.

130
00:07:44,551 --> 00:07:46,291
Anyone back there?

131
00:07:49,991 --> 00:07:51,340
Sir, I'm sorry.

132
00:07:51,383 --> 00:07:53,013
We don't have you listed
in our passenger manifest

133
00:07:53,037 --> 00:07:54,996
for Flight 319.

134
00:07:55,039 --> 00:07:56,432
One second.

135
00:07:56,867 --> 00:07:57,694
How is that possible?

136
00:07:57,738 --> 00:07:58,434
How do you think I got here?

137
00:07:58,478 --> 00:07:59,479
Do you think I walked?

138
00:07:59,522 --> 00:08:00,305
No.

139
00:08:00,349 --> 00:08:02,307
Astral projection maybe?

140
00:08:02,743 --> 00:08:03,831
Your name is White.

141
00:08:03,874 --> 00:08:05,615
Yes. Jackson White.

142
00:08:05,659 --> 00:08:07,922
My assistant made the
reservation last evening.

143
00:08:07,965 --> 00:08:11,012
And it's W-H-I-T?

144
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:14,102
I'll call you back.

145
00:08:17,845 --> 00:08:20,978
My ticket. My driver's license.

146
00:08:21,370 --> 00:08:23,415
My baggage ticket.

147
00:08:23,459 --> 00:08:24,852
Okay.

148
00:08:30,205 --> 00:08:31,380
That's odd, sir.

149
00:08:31,423 --> 00:08:33,687
We, we just don't have
you in our system.

150
00:08:36,907 --> 00:08:37,908
You know what?

151
00:08:37,952 --> 00:08:40,302
I don't like how
you guys operate.

152
00:08:41,564 --> 00:08:43,740
Have a good day, sir.

153
00:08:44,785 --> 00:08:46,134
They've lost my luggage.

154
00:08:46,177 --> 00:08:48,615
They've got Barney Fife
behind the desk. Find it.

155
00:08:48,658 --> 00:08:50,506
You wouldn't believe the
rental car they gave me.

156
00:08:50,530 --> 00:08:51,855
Yeah, I'll
call the airline first thing

157
00:08:51,879 --> 00:08:52,967
and I'll get back to you.

158
00:08:53,010 --> 00:08:54,534
First thing? Call them now.

159
00:08:54,577 --> 00:08:56,710
Okay. I'll call
them right now. I'm sorry.

160
00:09:13,553 --> 00:09:14,704
Listen, listen, you don't
need to tell me we're behind.

161
00:09:14,728 --> 00:09:16,077
I know.

162
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:17,968
Yeah, well I need copies
of concert gate receipts,

163
00:09:17,992 --> 00:09:19,776
their published songs
and other paperwork

164
00:09:19,820 --> 00:09:21,386
pertinent to the group's income.

165
00:09:21,430 --> 00:09:24,172
I also need you to find out
who produced their merchandise

166
00:09:24,215 --> 00:09:25,782
and if the cost for...

167
00:09:26,348 --> 00:09:27,871
No, no, who produced
their merchandise.

168
00:09:27,915 --> 00:09:29,457
And if the cost of
production was subtracted

169
00:09:29,481 --> 00:09:30,918
before profits were divvied up.

170
00:09:30,961 --> 00:09:33,224
Yeah, get back to me asap.

171
00:09:33,834 --> 00:09:36,053
Yeah, no, no cell
phones. I got it. I know.

172
00:09:36,097 --> 00:09:37,272
Uh, it's Chris White's room.

173
00:09:37,315 --> 00:09:39,187
You know where that is?

174
00:09:40,667 --> 00:09:42,190
319.

175
00:09:44,801 --> 00:09:46,150
Thanks.

176
00:10:17,747 --> 00:10:19,836
Hi.

177
00:10:21,621 --> 00:10:23,623
Welcome home.

178
00:10:43,947 --> 00:10:45,708
I'm not sure you're
supposed to be doing this.

179
00:10:45,732 --> 00:10:48,648
Well, I'm not supposed
to do a lot of things.

180
00:11:11,758 --> 00:11:13,542
I missed you, buddy.

181
00:11:14,325 --> 00:11:16,023
Missed you too.

182
00:11:16,371 --> 00:11:18,939
You didn't have to come.

183
00:11:20,767 --> 00:11:22,353
How long are they
going to keep you here?

184
00:11:22,377 --> 00:11:24,031
I go home tomorrow.

185
00:11:24,509 --> 00:11:25,423
Sure about that?

186
00:11:25,467 --> 00:11:26,773
Mm.

187
00:11:27,599 --> 00:11:28,992
What do you want?

188
00:11:29,340 --> 00:11:30,994
I was going to
crack the window.

189
00:11:31,038 --> 00:11:32,692
I got it.

190
00:11:46,227 --> 00:11:47,750
Oh, that's right,
you don't smoke.

191
00:11:47,794 --> 00:11:49,578
You shouldn't either.

192
00:11:49,883 --> 00:11:52,276
One thing has nothing
to do with the other.

193
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:54,931
Dad, come on.
We're in a hospital.

194
00:11:55,671 --> 00:11:57,020
Everyone else give me shit.

195
00:11:57,064 --> 00:11:58,805
I don't need it
from my kid, too.

196
00:11:58,848 --> 00:12:00,197
Apparently you do.

197
00:12:00,241 --> 00:12:02,852
Everybody else doesn't
want you to die.

198
00:12:02,896 --> 00:12:05,028
They say you've stopped eating.

199
00:12:05,376 --> 00:12:06,682
I'm not hungry, kiddo.

200
00:12:06,726 --> 00:12:09,119
And you're just gonna
light up whenever you...

201
00:12:26,876 --> 00:12:29,270
You hear about Dunbar?

202
00:12:33,187 --> 00:12:34,275
Tony Dunbar?

203
00:12:34,318 --> 00:12:36,930
Mm-hmm. Miami moved
up to draft him.

204
00:12:37,582 --> 00:12:41,238
Riley thinks he's the hardest
worker he's ever seen.

205
00:12:41,282 --> 00:12:41,891
Really.

206
00:12:41,935 --> 00:12:42,762
Mm-hmm.

207
00:12:42,805 --> 00:12:45,982
He got 32 in San Diego game.

208
00:12:46,374 --> 00:12:48,680
Baron Davis guarding him.

209
00:12:50,987 --> 00:12:52,206
What does he know?

210
00:12:52,249 --> 00:12:54,251
What? He's a good coach.

211
00:12:54,295 --> 00:12:55,992
He needs a haircut.

212
00:12:56,993 --> 00:12:58,255
He doesn't have any more hair

213
00:12:59,082 --> 00:13:00,301
to get cut.

214
00:13:10,137 --> 00:13:12,269
Jackson White.

215
00:13:19,581 --> 00:13:20,930
Hey.

216
00:13:21,670 --> 00:13:23,759
I'm really glad you called.

217
00:13:23,803 --> 00:13:24,978
Of course.

218
00:13:25,021 --> 00:13:27,197
It's no problem.

219
00:13:27,241 --> 00:13:28,982
This is real.

220
00:13:39,688 --> 00:13:41,864
Sorry, it's just
that I haven't spoken

221
00:13:41,908 --> 00:13:43,823
to anybody since I got here.

222
00:13:44,084 --> 00:13:46,564
It's okay. I'm glad you came.

223
00:13:46,608 --> 00:13:47,652
Yeah.

224
00:13:47,957 --> 00:13:49,611
So, you're his doctor?

225
00:13:49,916 --> 00:13:50,873
One of them.

226
00:13:50,917 --> 00:13:52,832
Surgical resident.

227
00:13:54,659 --> 00:13:56,574
How bad is it?

228
00:15:36,500 --> 00:15:39,112
You should be careful up there.

229
00:15:42,767 --> 00:15:45,248
I thought you
weren't going to come.

230
00:15:45,466 --> 00:15:47,337
Who are you?

231
00:16:09,969 --> 00:16:10,665
Let me give you a hand.

232
00:16:10,708 --> 00:16:12,972
Nah, it's all right.

233
00:16:18,673 --> 00:16:20,327
Bit of a mess.

234
00:16:20,631 --> 00:16:22,416
I haven't had people
over for a while.

235
00:16:22,459 --> 00:16:24,287
Don't be ridiculous.

236
00:16:55,318 --> 00:16:57,016
Have a snack.

237
00:16:57,059 --> 00:17:00,497
Someday soon this
will all be yours.

238
00:17:14,642 --> 00:17:17,166
Is the picture
always like that?

239
00:17:17,906 --> 00:17:19,647
What do you mean?

240
00:17:20,213 --> 00:17:22,041
Are you running the
cables through RCA's

241
00:17:22,084 --> 00:17:24,086
or an S Video cord?

242
00:17:24,434 --> 00:17:25,957
Huh?

243
00:17:27,263 --> 00:17:30,049
How old is this TV?

244
00:17:33,139 --> 00:17:34,227
Oh, Dad.

245
00:17:34,270 --> 00:17:35,595
No wonder it looks
like a snowstorm.

246
00:17:35,619 --> 00:17:37,665
You're using a coaxial cable.

247
00:17:38,100 --> 00:17:39,362
Looks fine to me.

248
00:17:39,406 --> 00:17:40,600
That's ¢cause you
don't know any better.

249
00:17:40,624 --> 00:17:42,365
You know what you need?

250
00:17:43,366 --> 00:17:44,237
What's that?

251
00:17:44,280 --> 00:17:45,803
High def.

252
00:17:47,109 --> 00:17:48,197
Yeah, baby.

253
00:17:48,241 --> 00:17:49,894
This remote is for
the television.

254
00:17:49,938 --> 00:17:52,549
You only need to turn the
power on, then forget it.

255
00:17:52,593 --> 00:17:54,247
This one is for the cable.

256
00:17:54,290 --> 00:17:56,597
It controls the DVD
and surround sound.

257
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:59,948
This is the main remote
you'll have to know.

258
00:18:00,644 --> 00:18:02,211
Okay.

259
00:18:02,255 --> 00:18:03,865
Okay.

260
00:18:05,214 --> 00:18:05,780
What are you...

261
00:18:05,823 --> 00:18:07,912
Dad, Dad, no.

262
00:18:09,218 --> 00:18:11,307
You didn't have to
do this, you know.

263
00:18:11,351 --> 00:18:14,005
It's the absolute
least I could do.

264
00:18:14,049 --> 00:18:16,051
All right, what
does this one do?

265
00:18:17,226 --> 00:18:18,445
You know, back in my day,

266
00:18:18,488 --> 00:18:19,509
you just hit a button...
You have no idea.

267
00:18:19,533 --> 00:18:21,535
You hit a button
and it comes on.

268
00:18:21,578 --> 00:18:23,102
Now why is this not working?

269
00:18:23,145 --> 00:18:24,929
It's not working.

270
00:18:27,062 --> 00:18:27,671
Batteries.

271
00:18:27,715 --> 00:18:28,237
That was your job.

272
00:18:28,281 --> 00:18:29,064
No...

273
00:18:29,108 --> 00:18:30,413
I told you, aisle four.

274
00:18:30,718 --> 00:18:31,912
It was the only
thing you had to do.

275
00:18:31,936 --> 00:18:33,349
Just walk up to the
set, hit a button.

276
00:18:33,373 --> 00:18:34,591
That's it.

277
00:18:40,728 --> 00:18:43,470
Isn't it time for my medication?

278
00:18:44,035 --> 00:18:46,429
You going to ask
every fifteen minutes?

279
00:18:47,213 --> 00:18:49,171
Only during the commercials.

280
00:18:49,215 --> 00:18:49,867
Nice.

281
00:18:49,911 --> 00:18:53,480
This guy.

282
00:19:06,362 --> 00:19:08,712
This wasn't the first time.

283
00:19:09,235 --> 00:19:11,193
The hospital, I mean.

284
00:19:12,368 --> 00:19:14,544
Foster told me.

285
00:19:16,285 --> 00:19:18,157
Why didn't you say anything?

286
00:19:18,722 --> 00:19:19,917
It would have sounded serious.

287
00:19:19,941 --> 00:19:22,073
I didn't want you to worry.

288
00:19:22,552 --> 00:19:25,164
You didn't want me to worry.

289
00:19:26,817 --> 00:19:29,211
Cancer is kind of a big deal.

290
00:19:29,559 --> 00:19:31,126
I'm fine.

291
00:19:31,344 --> 00:19:33,259
I just uh...

292
00:19:33,868 --> 00:19:35,217
You what?

293
00:19:35,609 --> 00:19:37,306
I don't want to fight.

294
00:19:37,350 --> 00:19:38,089
Fuck you!

295
00:19:38,133 --> 00:19:39,265
I want to fight.

296
00:19:39,308 --> 00:19:39,830
Jackson!

297
00:19:39,874 --> 00:19:41,267
No, no, no.

298
00:19:41,310 --> 00:19:43,747
Last night we're in the
hospital and I let it slide.

299
00:19:43,791 --> 00:19:45,227
But you lied to me.

300
00:19:45,271 --> 00:19:46,489
I could never lie to you.

301
00:19:46,533 --> 00:19:49,231
Every time we
talked it was a lie!

302
00:19:49,536 --> 00:19:52,147
Every time you didn't tell me!

303
00:19:56,195 --> 00:19:58,632
I thought we were
closer than this.

304
00:20:00,677 --> 00:20:02,157
We are!

305
00:20:09,817 --> 00:20:11,514
Ashville Democrat.

306
00:20:11,558 --> 00:20:13,603
Are you looking for
marketing opportunities?

307
00:20:13,647 --> 00:20:14,909
What are you doing?

308
00:20:14,952 --> 00:20:16,345
Homework.

309
00:20:17,868 --> 00:20:19,870
Can you do it
somewhere else please?

310
00:20:19,914 --> 00:20:21,132
Why?

311
00:20:21,394 --> 00:20:23,134
Because this is
my dad's office.

312
00:20:23,178 --> 00:20:25,049
This is his desk.
That's his chair.

313
00:20:25,093 --> 00:20:28,357
And that's his pencil
you're chewing on.

314
00:20:29,228 --> 00:20:30,751
The office is empty.

315
00:20:30,794 --> 00:20:34,189
Besides, the guy who
used to work here got...

316
00:20:36,844 --> 00:20:38,237
I'm sorry.

317
00:20:44,199 --> 00:20:46,636
You're turning my dad's
office into a study hall?

318
00:20:46,680 --> 00:20:48,986
Sorry, that's my son.

319
00:20:49,335 --> 00:20:53,077
We're all just so broken
up about your dad.

320
00:20:53,339 --> 00:20:56,211
Maybe he'd come for
a visit sometime.

321
00:20:57,256 --> 00:20:58,605
Maybe. I'll ask him.

322
00:20:58,648 --> 00:21:00,694
Well, I've got the Cobra
and life insurance forms

323
00:21:00,737 --> 00:21:03,131
if you'd like to look them over.

324
00:21:04,350 --> 00:21:05,481
Okay.

325
00:21:27,460 --> 00:21:29,331
Mister Sheldrake...

326
00:21:30,245 --> 00:21:33,292
Yeah, I know sir. I haven't
had a chance to get to him.

327
00:21:33,901 --> 00:21:36,947
Uh, no, no, I had
to reschedule that.

328
00:21:40,603 --> 00:21:43,302
Sir, I'm doing the best I can.

329
00:21:46,261 --> 00:21:49,177
Well, I hope I have a
job to come back to.

330
00:21:51,092 --> 00:21:52,243
Are you really
going to threaten me

331
00:21:52,267 --> 00:21:54,965
while I'm packing
up my dad's office?

332
00:21:59,666 --> 00:22:00,841
Fuck!

333
00:22:03,583 --> 00:22:06,281
Clearly this
isn't a good time.

334
00:22:07,413 --> 00:22:08,936
Sorry.

335
00:22:09,937 --> 00:22:11,504
Don't be sorry.

336
00:22:11,547 --> 00:22:13,201
I'm Kat.

337
00:22:14,637 --> 00:22:16,204
Jackson.

338
00:22:16,509 --> 00:22:17,597
From New York?

339
00:22:17,640 --> 00:22:19,686
L.A. but close enough.

340
00:22:21,818 --> 00:22:24,212
Is there something
I can help you with?

341
00:22:25,213 --> 00:22:26,475
Oh, I...

342
00:22:28,956 --> 00:22:32,481
I interned here this spring
and I heard about your...

343
00:22:33,264 --> 00:22:35,354
I heard and,

344
00:22:36,137 --> 00:22:38,357
I want you to give this to him.

345
00:22:41,751 --> 00:22:43,187
Thanks.

346
00:22:43,231 --> 00:22:45,364
I'll make sure he gets it.

347
00:22:50,586 --> 00:22:52,022
You want to get lunch?

348
00:22:52,066 --> 00:22:53,328
Uh, no. Thank you.

349
00:22:53,372 --> 00:22:54,764
You already eat?

350
00:22:54,808 --> 00:22:55,808
No.

351
00:22:56,070 --> 00:22:57,288
Well, you got to eat.

352
00:22:57,332 --> 00:22:58,507
That's true.

353
00:22:58,551 --> 00:22:59,552
But not with me?

354
00:22:59,595 --> 00:23:01,162
No, not with a
complete stranger.

355
00:23:01,205 --> 00:23:04,121
And not when my world
is falling apart.

356
00:23:04,383 --> 00:23:06,341
Your dad said you were a snob.

357
00:23:06,385 --> 00:23:08,038
Excuse me?

358
00:23:08,343 --> 00:23:09,910
Not in a bad way.

359
00:23:09,953 --> 00:23:12,347
Just the prodigal son
who leaves his hometown

360
00:23:12,391 --> 00:23:14,175
and doesn't look back.

361
00:23:22,313 --> 00:23:25,404
Hey! Need a hand with that?

362
00:23:25,665 --> 00:23:28,276
Familiar with
the term stalker?

363
00:23:28,798 --> 00:23:32,193
Yeah, men tend to
get attached to me.

364
00:23:32,498 --> 00:23:35,326
Well, why aren't you
bothering one of them?

365
00:23:36,458 --> 00:23:38,417
He talks about you.

366
00:23:39,156 --> 00:23:40,419
A lot.

367
00:23:43,596 --> 00:23:45,424
We'll be quick.

368
00:23:47,164 --> 00:23:48,905
I think I put that...

369
00:23:49,602 --> 00:23:50,603
Okay.

370
00:23:50,646 --> 00:23:52,343
It's amazing.
I like your song.

371
00:23:52,387 --> 00:23:55,216
You look and I, and
maybe I'll, I'll steer.

372
00:23:55,259 --> 00:23:56,739
- Very funny.
- Please.

373
00:23:56,783 --> 00:23:57,479
You got it?

374
00:23:57,523 --> 00:23:58,349
Yeah? Yeah?

375
00:23:58,393 --> 00:24:00,439
I got it. Thanks.

376
00:24:09,099 --> 00:24:09,926
Whoa!

377
00:24:09,970 --> 00:24:11,711
Enough with the emailing.

378
00:24:12,494 --> 00:24:13,887
I'm just gonna...

379
00:24:14,191 --> 00:24:15,758
It's Thursday.

380
00:24:15,802 --> 00:24:18,457
The music industry doesn't shut
down because you want sushi.

381
00:24:18,892 --> 00:24:19,893
Well, that's a crime.

382
00:24:19,936 --> 00:24:21,416
Now put it away.

383
00:24:21,460 --> 00:24:24,506
Just one more and I'll put
the Blackberry away. Okay?

384
00:24:24,550 --> 00:24:26,377
What? What are you doing?

385
00:24:26,421 --> 00:24:28,292
What? Wait!

386
00:24:29,468 --> 00:24:31,861
Kat! This is a street!

387
00:24:32,514 --> 00:24:33,689
I'm, I'm sorry.

388
00:24:33,733 --> 00:24:35,474
What are you doing?

389
00:24:38,433 --> 00:24:40,261
Where's the owner?

390
00:24:40,522 --> 00:24:41,305
I don't know.

391
00:24:41,349 --> 00:24:43,177
There's no tags.

392
00:24:45,048 --> 00:24:47,050
Then who do we call?

393
00:24:47,355 --> 00:24:49,139
He hurt his paw.

394
00:24:49,183 --> 00:24:51,272
We're taking him to the vet.

395
00:24:56,451 --> 00:24:57,451
All right.

396
00:25:04,241 --> 00:25:05,504
Asheville.

397
00:25:05,547 --> 00:25:07,331
Where good taste goes to die.

398
00:25:07,375 --> 00:25:08,289
I do not think that would fly

399
00:25:08,332 --> 00:25:10,204
with the Chamber of Commerce.

400
00:25:10,247 --> 00:25:12,356
You've always thought you
were better than anyone else.

401
00:25:12,380 --> 00:25:14,600
I don't think I'm
better than anybody.

402
00:25:15,035 --> 00:25:16,906
Well, maybe just a
little bit better.

403
00:25:18,038 --> 00:25:20,823
I can't believe they
can just lose a bag.

404
00:25:21,128 --> 00:25:24,435
What if I had something
irreplaceable in there?

405
00:25:25,393 --> 00:25:27,743
What would be irreplaceable?

406
00:25:29,005 --> 00:25:29,658
I don't know.

407
00:25:29,702 --> 00:25:30,877
Uh...

408
00:25:31,921 --> 00:25:33,793
I'm sorry. I
don't have a 32-33.

409
00:25:33,836 --> 00:25:34,944
I didn't even ask for black.

410
00:25:34,968 --> 00:25:36,317
What about the French cuffs?

411
00:25:36,360 --> 00:25:38,101
Let me check in the back.

412
00:25:38,145 --> 00:25:40,408
Should have gotten them
the first time.

413
00:25:40,930 --> 00:25:44,673
Did the airline lose your
manners with the luggage?

414
00:25:45,195 --> 00:25:46,893
I'm almost done.

415
00:25:46,936 --> 00:25:48,131
I can't believe that
nobody in this town

416
00:25:48,155 --> 00:25:50,070
sells True Religion.

417
00:25:50,592 --> 00:25:52,551
You sure I can't
get you anything?

418
00:25:52,594 --> 00:25:54,857
A new watch? A
haircut? Anything?

419
00:25:54,901 --> 00:25:56,511
Consider it an early
Christmas gift.

420
00:25:56,555 --> 00:25:58,731
Or a late one from last
year for that matter.

421
00:25:58,774 --> 00:25:59,862
Well, I'm Jewish, Dad.

422
00:25:59,906 --> 00:26:01,951
I can't keep up with the dates.

423
00:26:01,995 --> 00:26:04,127
It's December
25th. Every year.

424
00:26:04,171 --> 00:26:05,738
Isn't that confusing?

425
00:26:05,781 --> 00:26:09,132
With Yom Kippur and Passover
jumping all over the calendar?

426
00:26:09,916 --> 00:26:11,700
Does this look all
right from the back?

427
00:26:11,744 --> 00:26:13,397
You look a little
fat, but yeah.

428
00:26:13,441 --> 00:26:15,182
I don't really wear suits.

429
00:26:15,225 --> 00:26:16,226
Well, you should.

430
00:26:16,270 --> 00:26:17,619
You look good.

431
00:26:17,663 --> 00:26:18,968
Huh?

432
00:26:20,753 --> 00:26:21,449
So what do you think?

433
00:26:21,492 --> 00:26:23,277
The navy or the gray?

434
00:26:23,538 --> 00:26:25,671
Yeah. I like this one.

435
00:26:28,238 --> 00:26:30,318
Shouldn't we get something
a little more practical?

436
00:26:30,458 --> 00:26:33,809
We both know I'm only
going to wear this suit once.

437
00:26:36,899 --> 00:26:38,422
Yeah.

438
00:26:40,424 --> 00:26:42,296
It's going to
be the white suit.

439
00:26:47,388 --> 00:26:50,434
You said I could get
anything if I agreed to this.

440
00:26:50,478 --> 00:26:51,697
Anything at all.

441
00:26:51,740 --> 00:26:54,047
Then I want this
shirt as well.

442
00:26:54,395 --> 00:26:57,006
Oh, Dad, that's revolting.

443
00:27:02,098 --> 00:27:05,058
Does he got any
idea on this contract?

444
00:27:07,843 --> 00:27:09,932
This cracks me up.

445
00:27:12,326 --> 00:27:16,547
My snotnose little kid
is buying me a suit.

446
00:27:22,641 --> 00:27:23,990
What's that?

447
00:27:33,608 --> 00:27:34,914
What?

448
00:27:35,436 --> 00:27:36,611
What?

449
00:27:36,655 --> 00:27:37,481
You upset?

450
00:27:37,525 --> 00:27:39,483
No, no.

451
00:27:46,577 --> 00:27:48,405
It's okay, it's okay.

452
00:27:51,974 --> 00:27:53,454
Dad, I love you.

453
00:27:53,497 --> 00:27:54,934
Yeah.

454
00:27:56,152 --> 00:27:58,241
I love you so much.

455
00:27:59,721 --> 00:28:01,723
I promise, I swear to you
it's going to be okay.

456
00:28:01,767 --> 00:28:04,334
No. There's
nothing they can do.

457
00:28:06,685 --> 00:28:08,338
I'm dying.

458
00:28:08,687 --> 00:28:11,341
There's nothing they
can do about it.

459
00:28:16,564 --> 00:28:17,521
I'm so scared.

460
00:28:17,565 --> 00:28:19,219
Come here. Come here.

461
00:28:27,967 --> 00:28:29,316
So let me get this right.

462
00:28:29,359 --> 00:28:32,058
Your life's ambition is to
not become your parents?

463
00:28:32,101 --> 00:28:33,537
Totally.

464
00:28:33,842 --> 00:28:34,974
They think that human life

465
00:28:35,017 --> 00:28:37,890
is defined by its
consumer potential.

466
00:28:38,499 --> 00:28:40,631
Right. And what do you think?

467
00:28:43,156 --> 00:28:44,461
I don't know.

468
00:28:44,505 --> 00:28:47,464
But I want what I do
to mean something.

469
00:28:47,508 --> 00:28:49,945
I'm not sure that one
life can mean anything.

470
00:28:49,989 --> 00:28:52,556
One life can change the world.

471
00:28:53,732 --> 00:28:55,187
Wait until you're
in the real world.

472
00:28:55,211 --> 00:28:56,604
You'll see.

473
00:28:56,647 --> 00:28:58,388
What does that even mean?

474
00:28:58,432 --> 00:29:00,390
This isn't real?

475
00:29:01,261 --> 00:29:03,021
The real world is where
you're no longer driving

476
00:29:03,045 --> 00:29:06,440
Daddy's BMW and you have
ramen six days in a row

477
00:29:06,483 --> 00:29:09,443
because entry level job
roughly translates to

478
00:29:09,486 --> 00:29:11,445
""We can pay you as
little as we like.""

479
00:29:11,488 --> 00:29:12,663
Your priorities shift.

480
00:29:12,707 --> 00:29:14,317
Not mine.

481
00:29:15,536 --> 00:29:17,712
Don't patronize me.

482
00:29:21,803 --> 00:29:23,457
I got this friend, right?

483
00:29:23,500 --> 00:29:26,373
He thinks his novel is
going to change the world.

484
00:29:26,808 --> 00:29:28,505
He's now 28 years old

485
00:29:28,549 --> 00:29:30,725
and he still works at
our childhood camp.

486
00:29:30,769 --> 00:29:32,422
What's your point?

487
00:29:32,683 --> 00:29:35,425
My point is, he spends
so much time dreaming

488
00:29:35,469 --> 00:29:37,776
that he's pissed his life away.

489
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:39,299
And we used to be so close.

490
00:29:39,342 --> 00:29:41,649
Now I don't even know
what to say to him.

491
00:29:41,692 --> 00:29:43,520
To a guy who still
lives for a fantasy

492
00:29:43,564 --> 00:29:45,871
that's never going to happen.

493
00:30:16,510 --> 00:30:17,816
Dad?

494
00:30:22,298 --> 00:30:23,734
Dad?

495
00:30:28,914 --> 00:30:31,046
Is it seven already?

496
00:30:31,742 --> 00:30:32,221
Yeah.

497
00:30:32,265 --> 00:30:33,657
Oh.

498
00:30:34,528 --> 00:30:35,311
Here, dad.

499
00:30:35,355 --> 00:30:36,878
Thanks, darling.

500
00:30:38,401 --> 00:30:40,012
Give me five minutes.

501
00:30:51,632 --> 00:30:53,242
Wow!

502
00:30:53,808 --> 00:30:57,638
This is just amazing.

503
00:30:59,509 --> 00:31:01,076
It's amazing.

504
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:03,339
You still like it
medium rare, right?

505
00:31:04,906 --> 00:31:07,430
I don't know what to say.

506
00:31:08,823 --> 00:31:11,260
I really appreciate this.

507
00:31:12,566 --> 00:31:13,741
But?

508
00:31:16,004 --> 00:31:18,441
I don't have an appetite.

509
00:31:19,703 --> 00:31:20,966
I'm sorry, Jack,

510
00:31:21,009 --> 00:31:22,682
if I'd known you'd gone
to all this trouble...

511
00:31:22,706 --> 00:31:23,533
It's okay.

512
00:31:23,577 --> 00:31:25,579
No, I mean it.

513
00:31:26,014 --> 00:31:27,668
This is great.

514
00:31:28,799 --> 00:31:31,628
They said they would like
to see you at the office.

515
00:31:33,543 --> 00:31:35,763
I don't want them
to see me like this.

516
00:31:36,677 --> 00:31:37,547
Dad, you're sick.

517
00:31:37,591 --> 00:31:39,332
It's nothing to be ashamed of.

518
00:31:39,680 --> 00:31:40,681
Mm.

519
00:31:42,901 --> 00:31:45,599
And one of the interns
wrote you a letter.

520
00:31:45,642 --> 00:31:46,730
Who?

521
00:31:47,209 --> 00:31:48,950
Her name is Kat.

522
00:31:49,298 --> 00:31:51,692
Katherine Morrison.

523
00:31:51,997 --> 00:31:53,781
I like her.

524
00:31:57,785 --> 00:31:58,699
Enjoy being home?

525
00:31:58,742 --> 00:32:00,135
Sure. You want another one?

526
00:32:00,179 --> 00:32:00,701
Yeah.

527
00:32:00,744 --> 00:32:02,311
I got it.

528
00:32:09,231 --> 00:32:11,930
What's on schedule
for tomorrow?

529
00:32:12,408 --> 00:32:14,628
I was going to
run by the camp.

530
00:32:14,671 --> 00:32:17,370
Ben's working there
full time now.

531
00:32:21,765 --> 00:32:23,419
That's about it.

532
00:32:32,515 --> 00:32:34,300
He wrote a book.

533
00:32:34,604 --> 00:32:35,736
Ben?

534
00:32:35,779 --> 00:32:37,390
Yeah.

535
00:32:39,827 --> 00:32:41,568
Is it any good?

536
00:32:42,047 --> 00:32:43,787
It's very good.

537
00:32:43,831 --> 00:32:45,441
It's very good.

538
00:32:47,052 --> 00:32:48,879
It's about me.

539
00:32:49,750 --> 00:32:51,621
How much of it?

540
00:32:53,623 --> 00:32:55,408
All of it.

541
00:32:58,237 --> 00:33:02,719
I didn't even realize until
about a hundred pages into it.

542
00:33:03,111 --> 00:33:06,854
It's about a politician
who loses his soul.

543
00:33:06,897 --> 00:33:07,986
He sells out his friends,

544
00:33:08,029 --> 00:33:10,989
constituency and
religion for power.

545
00:33:13,687 --> 00:33:15,906
Haven't spoken to him since?

546
00:33:17,212 --> 00:33:18,126
I was supposed to head down

547
00:33:18,170 --> 00:33:19,867
to the music festival in August.

548
00:33:19,910 --> 00:33:22,043
But that didn't happen.

549
00:33:22,826 --> 00:33:25,133
It's good you're
seeing him again.

550
00:33:29,355 --> 00:33:31,792
You can't leave things unsaid.

551
00:33:34,142 --> 00:33:36,014
What do I say?

552
00:34:21,581 --> 00:34:23,322
As a rule,

553
00:34:24,497 --> 00:34:29,502
the Jewish faith does not
address the afterlife.

554
00:34:30,024 --> 00:34:33,810
We are asked to
focus on the present.

555
00:34:33,854 --> 00:34:35,943
There's a reason the
Mourner's Kaddish

556
00:34:35,986 --> 00:34:37,379
doesn't mention death.

557
00:34:37,423 --> 00:34:40,730
It's a celebration of
the time we spent...

558
00:34:40,774 --> 00:34:41,775
Is she sleeping?

559
00:34:41,818 --> 00:34:43,124
Is she sleeping
or is she just...

560
00:34:43,168 --> 00:34:44,299
Is she thinking?

561
00:34:44,343 --> 00:34:46,519
She's very pensive.
Or is that sleep?

562
00:34:46,562 --> 00:34:47,520
Sleeping Beauty!

563
00:34:47,563 --> 00:34:49,783
Jordan! Wake up. Thank you.

564
00:34:49,826 --> 00:34:53,047
How could you, how could
you sleep through this?

565
00:34:53,091 --> 00:34:55,223
Okay, forget it.

566
00:34:55,267 --> 00:34:57,138
Girls, can we see
your art projects?

567
00:34:57,182 --> 00:34:58,574
I uh...

568
00:34:58,835 --> 00:35:01,838
I am a loser. Thank
you. Well done.

569
00:35:02,187 --> 00:35:03,188
Let's see...

570
00:35:03,231 --> 00:35:05,103
He must be stoned.

571
00:35:06,104 --> 00:35:07,627
Rachel?

572
00:35:08,410 --> 00:35:09,672
Earth to Rachel?

573
00:35:09,716 --> 00:35:10,673
Are you?

574
00:35:10,717 --> 00:35:13,111
Who's the guy in the back?

575
00:35:18,246 --> 00:35:20,988
Jackson White everybody.

576
00:35:21,031 --> 00:35:22,772
Yeah, uh...

577
00:35:23,208 --> 00:35:24,992
I'll come find you.

578
00:35:42,749 --> 00:35:45,621
You're, you're Ben's friend.

579
00:35:46,187 --> 00:35:47,536
Yeah.

580
00:35:49,495 --> 00:35:51,366
Are you going to bust us?

581
00:35:51,714 --> 00:35:53,499
I don't work here.

582
00:35:55,283 --> 00:35:57,633
No, I'm not going to bust you.

583
00:35:57,938 --> 00:35:59,983
You guys want to shoot a round?

584
00:36:00,680 --> 00:36:01,550
You want some of that?

585
00:36:01,594 --> 00:36:03,161
Oh!

586
00:36:03,552 --> 00:36:05,032
How do you know Ben?

587
00:36:05,075 --> 00:36:07,121
We went to camp together.

588
00:36:07,556 --> 00:36:08,731
What's your name?

589
00:36:08,775 --> 00:36:10,472
I'm Jackson White.

590
00:36:10,516 --> 00:36:11,343
Wait.

591
00:36:11,386 --> 00:36:13,693
Holy shit. You're a legend.

592
00:36:13,736 --> 00:36:14,911
No way.

593
00:36:14,955 --> 00:36:16,652
You're the Rocket?

594
00:36:16,696 --> 00:36:18,132
Well I suppose I was.

595
00:36:18,176 --> 00:36:19,568
I'm him.

596
00:36:20,090 --> 00:36:22,658
Dude, I heard
you dropped 40 points

597
00:36:22,702 --> 00:36:24,617
on Camp Barney one year.

598
00:36:24,660 --> 00:36:25,922
43.

599
00:36:27,402 --> 00:36:28,708
Hello. He's open.

600
00:36:28,751 --> 00:36:29,926
Uh-oh.

601
00:36:31,754 --> 00:36:34,192
He's open. He's open.

602
00:36:40,023 --> 00:36:41,199
You still got it.

603
00:36:41,242 --> 00:36:42,374
Still got it.

604
00:36:44,245 --> 00:36:46,813
So what brings you
to Hendersonville?

605
00:36:47,509 --> 00:36:49,119
Just visiting my dad.

606
00:36:49,163 --> 00:36:50,773
Everything all right?

607
00:36:51,470 --> 00:36:52,949
Yeah.

608
00:36:56,997 --> 00:36:58,912
How's Elizabeth?

609
00:36:59,391 --> 00:37:02,785
Or as we say behind her
back, the Japinator?

610
00:37:03,308 --> 00:37:06,659
Uh, you know, she's
as difficult as ever.

611
00:37:12,317 --> 00:37:13,927
Are you all right?

612
00:37:14,884 --> 00:37:18,845
Yeah. Yeah, I'm great.

613
00:37:22,588 --> 00:37:24,198
It's good to hear.

614
00:37:26,679 --> 00:37:28,681
Because you look like shit.

615
00:37:42,434 --> 00:37:43,609
Nine months out of the year

616
00:37:43,652 --> 00:37:46,307
I got this whole
place to myself.

617
00:37:47,439 --> 00:37:48,962
It's great.

618
00:37:49,005 --> 00:37:50,920
I read. I write.

619
00:37:51,399 --> 00:37:53,096
Sleep till noon.

620
00:37:55,142 --> 00:37:56,752
I'm up at six.

621
00:37:56,796 --> 00:37:57,449
On a good day.

622
00:37:57,492 --> 00:38:00,190
Ouch. Sorry.

623
00:38:00,539 --> 00:38:05,544
I'm hooking up with girls,
I'm way too old for.

624
00:38:06,022 --> 00:38:07,894
Does it ever get old?

625
00:38:07,937 --> 00:38:09,287
Not yet.

626
00:38:12,246 --> 00:38:15,771
Uh, no. I, I...

627
00:38:21,473 --> 00:38:24,780
Adulthood you know,
it's it's overrated.

628
00:38:25,085 --> 00:38:30,090
It's all uh, tuition and
erectile dysfunction.

629
00:38:39,055 --> 00:38:40,883
Adulthood's uh...

630
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:44,191
It's working out
for you, though?

631
00:38:44,496 --> 00:38:45,734
Well, you know I was thinking

632
00:38:45,758 --> 00:38:47,455
of becoming a camp counselor.

633
00:38:52,068 --> 00:38:54,636
You still thinking
about grad school?

634
00:38:56,246 --> 00:38:58,118
I'm thinking about it.

635
00:38:58,988 --> 00:39:01,208
Doing anything about it?

636
00:39:02,818 --> 00:39:04,864
I'm thinking about it.

637
00:39:13,873 --> 00:39:14,917
It's great.

638
00:39:14,961 --> 00:39:16,745
All right?

639
00:39:18,617 --> 00:39:21,184
I read your book and
I think it's great.

640
00:39:21,707 --> 00:39:23,926
I don't know how I
became Sammy Glick.

641
00:39:23,970 --> 00:39:26,320
Look, Jackson, man.

642
00:39:27,016 --> 00:39:29,105
I never meant to hurt you.

643
00:39:30,455 --> 00:39:33,066
Sometimes the
truth just hurts.

644
00:39:44,077 --> 00:39:46,035
Hey,
Ben, we need you at services.

645
00:39:46,079 --> 00:39:47,123
Shit.

646
00:39:49,865 --> 00:39:54,043
Uh, hey, sorry, I got to...

647
00:39:56,568 --> 00:39:57,786
Yes. Yes, yes.

648
00:39:57,830 --> 00:40:01,007
On my way, over and out. Yes.

649
00:40:03,009 --> 00:40:06,012
Well, I, I should
hit the road too.

650
00:40:06,447 --> 00:40:08,580
Yeah. I...

651
00:40:12,061 --> 00:40:14,542
The real world beckons.

652
00:40:18,677 --> 00:40:22,071
So, uh, we still friends?

653
00:40:24,422 --> 00:40:26,032
Always, brother.

654
00:40:26,075 --> 00:40:27,773
Always.

655
00:40:28,991 --> 00:40:30,210
Good.

656
00:40:43,223 --> 00:40:45,007
Be well.

657
00:40:47,967 --> 00:40:49,534
You too.

658
00:41:11,512 --> 00:41:15,342
315, 317, 323.

659
00:41:15,385 --> 00:41:17,518
Where the hell 319?

660
00:41:38,583 --> 00:41:40,193
Can I help you?

661
00:41:40,541 --> 00:41:41,542
I don't know.

662
00:41:41,934 --> 00:41:43,936
Is this 319 Cypress?

663
00:41:43,979 --> 00:41:45,372
Yeah.

664
00:41:46,765 --> 00:41:48,070
Is that you, Jackson?

665
00:41:48,114 --> 00:41:49,376
Uh...

666
00:41:49,419 --> 00:41:50,614
Sorry I didn't tell
you about my roommate.

667
00:41:50,638 --> 00:41:53,162
I just thought it
sounded so collegiate.

668
00:41:53,206 --> 00:41:55,121
Well, you're in college.

669
00:41:55,861 --> 00:41:59,168
Hey, oh, look at
your little paw.

670
00:41:59,995 --> 00:42:01,257
What's your name?

671
00:42:01,301 --> 00:42:02,084
Ophelia.

672
00:42:02,128 --> 00:42:03,825
Ophelia?

673
00:42:03,869 --> 00:42:05,871
Ophelia.

674
00:42:08,961 --> 00:42:11,050
I'm telling you, I have band.

675
00:42:11,093 --> 00:42:12,617
Do not leave my sight.

676
00:42:30,504 --> 00:42:31,331
Jackson.

677
00:42:31,374 --> 00:42:32,680
Alright.

678
00:42:33,028 --> 00:42:34,377
That's inside.

679
00:42:34,421 --> 00:42:34,987
Oh.

680
00:42:35,030 --> 00:42:36,162
Oh.

681
00:42:45,432 --> 00:42:47,086
Dance with me.

682
00:43:10,065 --> 00:43:11,850
Sorry about your mom.

683
00:43:14,635 --> 00:43:16,985
Dude, what the fuck?

684
00:43:17,290 --> 00:43:19,422
Come on, Jackson, Matt.

685
00:43:19,858 --> 00:43:21,599
Matty P.

686
00:43:21,947 --> 00:43:25,428
Six. I was the sixth
man for Reynolds in '95.

687
00:43:25,472 --> 00:43:27,909
Matthew Price. Holy shit.

688
00:43:27,953 --> 00:43:30,651
What, what, what's going on?

689
00:43:30,695 --> 00:43:32,740
Living out by the
Biltmore, I'm selling ins...

690
00:43:32,784 --> 00:43:34,655
What about you, man?

691
00:43:35,177 --> 00:43:37,615
I'm a manager for musicians.

692
00:43:38,398 --> 00:43:40,182
Fuck, dude.

693
00:43:40,226 --> 00:43:42,097
It's so fucking good to see you.

694
00:43:42,141 --> 00:43:42,837
Yeah.

695
00:43:42,881 --> 00:43:44,056
Yo, Trent! We got...

696
00:43:44,099 --> 00:43:47,146
We got the fuckin'
Rocket over here, dude!

697
00:43:47,189 --> 00:43:49,757
Give him a fuckin'
beer! Let's do it!

698
00:43:51,977 --> 00:43:53,108
You know what?

699
00:43:53,152 --> 00:43:54,719
This is great. My
friend's in a band.

700
00:43:54,762 --> 00:43:56,068
Wow, you're married?

701
00:43:56,111 --> 00:43:58,113
Separated actually.

702
00:43:58,157 --> 00:43:59,157
Um...

703
00:43:59,767 --> 00:44:01,595
Separated really.

704
00:44:02,030 --> 00:44:03,292
You're not married.

705
00:44:03,336 --> 00:44:05,294
Not with who you're
with tonight.

706
00:44:05,338 --> 00:44:07,645
Walking in here with Kat.

707
00:44:09,168 --> 00:44:11,083
You were always a pimp.

708
00:44:12,432 --> 00:44:13,694
She's legendary.

709
00:44:13,738 --> 00:44:15,000
She really goes down.

710
00:44:15,043 --> 00:44:17,480
And you're going to
have a good night.

711
00:44:18,568 --> 00:44:19,569
What did you say?

712
00:44:19,613 --> 00:44:21,180
Okay, you know what?

713
00:44:21,223 --> 00:44:24,618
I see where this is going and
I'm about six inches taller,

714
00:44:24,662 --> 00:44:26,117
so you're gonna want
to take it outside

715
00:44:26,141 --> 00:44:28,100
or I'm going to do something.

716
00:44:31,886 --> 00:44:33,279
Do it.

717
00:44:34,236 --> 00:44:35,411
Do it.

718
00:44:38,763 --> 00:44:40,373
Good choice.

719
00:44:40,416 --> 00:44:41,591
Good choice.

720
00:44:41,635 --> 00:44:43,245
Take it outside.

721
00:44:43,289 --> 00:44:45,030
Go outside, go outside.

722
00:44:47,380 --> 00:44:50,035
Hey uh, we, we should go.

723
00:44:52,254 --> 00:44:53,449
Okay. Is everything all right?

724
00:44:53,473 --> 00:44:55,910
Yeah. Um...

725
00:44:57,085 --> 00:44:59,522
Let's just, I want to
show you something.

726
00:45:01,873 --> 00:45:03,918
Who wants a fucking beer?

727
00:45:04,484 --> 00:45:07,139
Who wants a fucking beer!

728
00:45:08,662 --> 00:45:10,098
All right.

729
00:45:10,142 --> 00:45:11,752
I almost feel like you should,

730
00:45:11,796 --> 00:45:14,146
you should close your
eyes as we're walking up.

731
00:45:14,189 --> 00:45:16,452
Yeah, ¢cause this
looks really exciting.

732
00:45:16,496 --> 00:45:17,889
It's a pretty
scary part of town.

733
00:45:17,932 --> 00:45:19,281
Are we close yet?

734
00:45:19,325 --> 00:45:21,719
At least there's
no lines. This here.

735
00:45:22,415 --> 00:45:24,243
Oh, shit!
This is the place?

736
00:45:25,244 --> 00:45:26,114
No way.

737
00:45:26,158 --> 00:45:28,421
You've got to be kidding me.

738
00:45:34,079 --> 00:45:35,558
What are you?

739
00:45:37,343 --> 00:45:38,561
Kat.

740
00:45:40,563 --> 00:45:43,305
Good evening Asheville!

741
00:45:47,135 --> 00:45:49,529
So why did you leave school?

742
00:45:49,921 --> 00:45:51,966
I flunked out.

743
00:45:52,532 --> 00:45:54,839
You know, by the time I
realized how poorly I was doing,

744
00:45:54,882 --> 00:45:56,101
it was too late.

745
00:45:56,666 --> 00:45:58,190
I went from walking on to the

746
00:45:58,233 --> 00:45:59,844
best basketball team in America,

747
00:45:59,887 --> 00:46:03,021
to living at home
in sixteen months.

748
00:46:03,848 --> 00:46:05,763
And the first few
weeks weren't so bad.

749
00:46:05,806 --> 00:46:08,200
You know I got a lot of
calls, a lot of emails,

750
00:46:08,243 --> 00:46:11,203
but people moved on.

751
00:46:11,594 --> 00:46:13,596
Everyone but me.

752
00:46:14,336 --> 00:46:17,165
I sat in my room
for weeks on end.

753
00:46:17,209 --> 00:46:19,254
I didn't know how to
get out of that house.

754
00:46:19,298 --> 00:46:22,170
And this town was
my personal prison.

755
00:46:22,214 --> 00:46:25,173
Hey, everyone's home
town feels that way.

756
00:46:27,219 --> 00:46:29,961
And we came here
for my 21st birthday.

757
00:46:30,004 --> 00:46:32,441
Ben, Foster, everyone.

758
00:46:33,225 --> 00:46:35,183
Nobody knew I was
going to kill myself.

759
00:46:35,227 --> 00:46:36,576
But at that point,

760
00:46:36,619 --> 00:46:39,318
I don't think anybody
would have been surprised.

761
00:46:41,886 --> 00:46:46,891
It's funny how
therapeutic suicide can be

762
00:46:47,587 --> 00:46:50,982
when you decide to end it.

763
00:46:51,025 --> 00:46:54,681
Every worry, every
responsibility just fades away.

764
00:46:57,727 --> 00:46:59,642
So we started
drinking at dinner.

765
00:46:59,686 --> 00:47:01,949
And when we got here we were,

766
00:47:02,210 --> 00:47:04,473
you know, we were hammered.

767
00:47:06,084 --> 00:47:07,484
And by the time
Whiskeytown came on,

768
00:47:07,520 --> 00:47:10,218
I was counting my final hours.

769
00:47:13,178 --> 00:47:15,920
And the most amazing
thing happened.

770
00:47:16,224 --> 00:47:17,747
Ryan Adams.

771
00:47:17,791 --> 00:47:22,796
He climbed on to the stage
like a drunken troubadour.

772
00:47:23,928 --> 00:47:26,626
He was young, sad and fucked up.

773
00:47:26,669 --> 00:47:28,236
Just like me.

774
00:47:29,411 --> 00:47:31,849
His songs were brutally
honest confessions

775
00:47:31,892 --> 00:47:34,895
of his failure and pain.

776
00:47:35,896 --> 00:47:40,814
And he sang about all the things
I thought I wanted to kill.

777
00:47:41,336 --> 00:47:43,077
It was the first time
in my life I thought

778
00:47:43,121 --> 00:47:45,384
that everything might be okay.

779
00:47:47,342 --> 00:47:50,563
And I wanted to be part
of the art form that

780
00:47:51,216 --> 00:47:53,696
celebrated imperfection.

781
00:47:54,697 --> 00:47:58,353
I recognized that it was
our most human quality.

782
00:48:10,452 --> 00:48:12,411
I left him here.

783
00:48:13,716 --> 00:48:15,022
All alone.

784
00:48:16,850 --> 00:48:19,374
I was all he had and I just

785
00:48:20,680 --> 00:48:22,247
left him here to die.

786
00:48:22,290 --> 00:48:25,206
You know what?
You lived your life.

787
00:48:25,250 --> 00:48:26,077
No.

788
00:48:26,120 --> 00:48:28,122
That's what you had to do.

789
00:48:28,688 --> 00:48:30,908
Your dad knows that.

790
00:48:49,317 --> 00:48:51,363
You have to decide
on radiation soon.

791
00:48:51,406 --> 00:48:54,192
It'll be unpleasant but you
got to fight this thing.

792
00:48:54,235 --> 00:48:56,237
That it, Doc?

793
00:48:56,672 --> 00:48:57,891
That's it.

794
00:48:57,935 --> 00:48:59,086
All I know is
we're coming here

795
00:48:59,110 --> 00:49:00,391
for all your
doctor's appointment.

796
00:49:00,415 --> 00:49:02,200
Shut up and drink your beer.

797
00:49:02,243 --> 00:49:04,463
Remember, it's
basketball season.

798
00:49:04,506 --> 00:49:06,900
Let's talk about
something important.

799
00:49:07,379 --> 00:49:09,250
Who do you guys
like this season?

800
00:49:09,294 --> 00:49:10,512
I like the Bobcats.

801
00:49:10,556 --> 00:49:12,775
I think they're going
to surprise them.

802
00:49:12,819 --> 00:49:15,256
Adam Morrison may need a
haircut but the guy can play.

803
00:49:15,300 --> 00:49:17,998
It says here the Knicks
might resign Allan Houston.

804
00:49:18,042 --> 00:49:19,304
You kidding me?

805
00:49:19,347 --> 00:49:20,846
The guy's legs haven't
been right for years.

806
00:49:20,870 --> 00:49:22,176
I'm just reading the article.

807
00:49:22,220 --> 00:49:24,439
I mean look,
the guy can shoot.

808
00:49:24,918 --> 00:49:26,311
He's no Adam Morrison though.

809
00:49:26,354 --> 00:49:27,225
Sure he can shoot.

810
00:49:27,268 --> 00:49:29,705
He set the SEC scoring record.

811
00:49:29,749 --> 00:49:32,186
Come on, he's human though.

812
00:49:32,230 --> 00:49:34,580
I mean, the body falls
apart after a while.

813
00:49:34,623 --> 00:49:36,495
You told me that.

814
00:49:36,538 --> 00:49:38,976
At least he knew
when to walk away.

815
00:49:39,019 --> 00:49:39,889
I'll be back in a minute.

816
00:49:39,933 --> 00:49:40,760
Hey, do you need any help?

817
00:49:40,803 --> 00:49:41,326
No.

818
00:49:41,369 --> 00:49:42,022
Are you sure?

819
00:49:42,066 --> 00:49:43,415
No.

820
00:49:43,458 --> 00:49:44,914
I can still wipe my own
ass, thank you very much.

821
00:49:44,938 --> 00:49:48,550
And I don't intend on
sticking around till I can't.

822
00:49:49,247 --> 00:49:51,292
I'm cancerman.

823
00:49:54,165 --> 00:49:56,080
He's not a superman.

824
00:49:56,123 --> 00:49:57,951
He's doing well.

825
00:49:58,865 --> 00:50:00,475
Yeah, he is.

826
00:50:00,519 --> 00:50:02,347
He's not eating well.

827
00:50:03,087 --> 00:50:05,002
Well, oxycodone,

828
00:50:05,785 --> 00:50:08,092
it's not really good
for the appetite.

829
00:50:08,135 --> 00:50:11,791
Look, I can't prescribe it,
but marijuana does help.

830
00:50:13,401 --> 00:50:15,012
How are you?

831
00:50:15,838 --> 00:50:17,231
I'm alright.

832
00:50:18,450 --> 00:50:21,453
It's unhealthy to
keep it all bottled in.

833
00:50:22,410 --> 00:50:23,810
You know if I didn't
have Allison...

834
00:50:23,846 --> 00:50:25,892
You know what I love about
our friendship, Foster?

835
00:50:25,935 --> 00:50:26,632
What's that?

836
00:50:26,675 --> 00:50:28,199
We don't need to talk.

837
00:50:28,242 --> 00:50:29,504
Some people want to analyze

838
00:50:29,548 --> 00:50:32,377
and nitpick life down
to nothing, but not you.

839
00:50:32,420 --> 00:50:35,423
You've always understood
my not wanting to talk.

840
00:50:36,424 --> 00:50:38,818
You let everything be okay.

841
00:50:41,342 --> 00:50:43,779
Are you sure you don't
want any more, Jackson?

842
00:50:43,823 --> 00:50:45,390
Oh, no, I'm fine.

843
00:50:45,433 --> 00:50:47,348
Four servings is
really sufficient.

844
00:50:48,436 --> 00:50:49,587
Mind if I turn
on the television?

845
00:50:49,611 --> 00:50:50,917
Oh, no. Go right ahead.

846
00:50:50,960 --> 00:50:52,397
This reminds me,

847
00:50:52,440 --> 00:50:54,418
ESPN Classic's playing the
Georgetown game from '82.

848
00:50:54,442 --> 00:50:55,269
The championship?

849
00:50:55,313 --> 00:50:56,749
Yep.

850
00:50:56,792 --> 00:50:58,031
You can watch
anything you like, Mr. White.

851
00:50:58,055 --> 00:50:59,099
Ah.

852
00:50:59,143 --> 00:50:59,969
Some people might
think it's crazy

853
00:51:00,013 --> 00:51:02,102
to watch a 25 year old game.

854
00:51:02,494 --> 00:51:05,105
No one's ever accused
me of being normal.

855
00:51:05,149 --> 00:51:06,759
Ain't that the truth.

856
00:51:09,283 --> 00:51:12,939
Yeah, we split Mom's
painting room into offices.

857
00:51:12,982 --> 00:51:14,636
Just finished in March.

858
00:51:15,028 --> 00:51:16,203
It looks good.

859
00:51:16,247 --> 00:51:18,423
I never would have
recognized the place.

860
00:51:18,771 --> 00:51:20,120
Thanks.

861
00:51:20,512 --> 00:51:22,340
Your dad loved this ball.

862
00:51:23,645 --> 00:51:25,362
I swear he must have
told us about Hank Aaron

863
00:51:25,386 --> 00:51:26,431
every time I came here.

864
00:51:26,474 --> 00:51:28,346
Look, Jackson.

865
00:51:28,389 --> 00:51:30,174
You got to deal with this.

866
00:51:31,523 --> 00:51:33,046
I told you I'm fine.

867
00:51:33,090 --> 00:51:35,092
No, you're not fine.

868
00:51:37,050 --> 00:51:38,486
How would you know, Foster?

869
00:51:38,530 --> 00:51:39,574
Because it torn me apart

870
00:51:39,618 --> 00:51:41,098
when my parents
were in that crash!

871
00:51:41,141 --> 00:51:43,448
You selfish son of a bitch.

872
00:51:45,885 --> 00:51:47,278
I'm sorry.

873
00:51:47,321 --> 00:51:48,757
I didn't want to bring that up.

874
00:51:48,801 --> 00:51:49,932
No, go ahead.

875
00:51:49,976 --> 00:51:51,543
You're the one
that wants to talk.

876
00:51:51,586 --> 00:51:54,502
Tell me what an asshole I am
for not coming to the funeral.

877
00:51:56,635 --> 00:51:57,505
What?

878
00:51:57,549 --> 00:51:58,787
That's not what you want to say?

879
00:51:58,811 --> 00:51:59,507
No, it isn't.

880
00:51:59,551 --> 00:52:01,335
Yes, it is. Say it.

881
00:52:01,379 --> 00:52:04,425
Tell me how much I suck at life.

882
00:52:05,034 --> 00:52:06,601
I couldn't leave my job, Foster.

883
00:52:06,645 --> 00:52:08,255
I'm sorry I couldn't
finish school.

884
00:52:08,299 --> 00:52:10,170
I'm sorry I didn't
become a damned doctor.

885
00:52:10,214 --> 00:52:11,476
Fuck you!

886
00:52:11,519 --> 00:52:13,193
What? You don't think
I see it in your eyes?

887
00:52:13,217 --> 00:52:15,393
You're judging me.
You always have.

888
00:52:15,436 --> 00:52:16,481
Hey.

889
00:52:17,743 --> 00:52:19,658
You have no idea how
much I care about you.

890
00:52:19,701 --> 00:52:21,050
How much I value our friendship!

891
00:52:21,094 --> 00:52:23,401
Hey, we haven't been
close since college.

892
00:52:23,444 --> 00:52:25,707
You think that's
my fault, Jackson?

893
00:52:33,802 --> 00:52:35,717
Look, Jackson, I've tried.

894
00:52:36,153 --> 00:52:38,198
I've tried for seven
years to be your friend.

895
00:52:38,242 --> 00:52:40,244
And I'll try for the next seven.

896
00:52:40,287 --> 00:52:43,116
But now that means
getting in your face.

897
00:52:43,986 --> 00:52:46,815
Because you can't push
this off any longer.

898
00:52:47,816 --> 00:52:49,011
You can't keep running
from everything

899
00:52:49,035 --> 00:52:51,516
that makes you feel pain.

900
00:52:54,475 --> 00:52:57,478
You might find out
the pain isn't so bad.

901
00:53:01,526 --> 00:53:04,529
It means that something
matters, Jackson.

902
00:53:11,666 --> 00:53:13,799
Elizabeth left me.

903
00:53:15,540 --> 00:53:17,150
I figured.

904
00:53:20,371 --> 00:53:22,155
It's just that

905
00:53:25,332 --> 00:53:29,989
I'm falling behind at
work and my dad's dying.

906
00:53:30,511 --> 00:53:34,559
And I'm going to be
all alone in the world.

907
00:53:39,216 --> 00:53:41,087
What about Kat?

908
00:53:43,524 --> 00:53:44,699
She's nice.

909
00:53:46,353 --> 00:53:48,486
I'm not used to that.

910
00:53:50,488 --> 00:53:53,404
And she lives in
Asheville and I don't.

911
00:53:53,969 --> 00:53:56,668
I think she's good
for you in any regard.

912
00:53:57,756 --> 00:54:02,064
I think it's worth
making an exception for.

913
00:54:02,108 --> 00:54:02,978
What is?

914
00:54:03,022 --> 00:54:04,022
Love.

915
00:54:17,689 --> 00:54:20,431
Have you ever been in love?

916
00:54:21,475 --> 00:54:22,998
I love my dad.

917
00:54:23,042 --> 00:54:23,912
I know you love your dad.

918
00:54:23,956 --> 00:54:25,653
That's not the question.

919
00:54:26,001 --> 00:54:27,568
I don't know, I
mean I've told girls

920
00:54:27,612 --> 00:54:30,179
that I loved them before,
but it's never been...

921
00:54:31,485 --> 00:54:34,314
Well, it's always
been safe and easy.

922
00:54:34,358 --> 00:54:37,404
Just regular sex with
someone I care about.

923
00:54:37,448 --> 00:54:42,061
Everything but that feeling.

924
00:54:42,801 --> 00:54:44,542
What are you laughing at?

925
00:54:44,585 --> 00:54:46,413
No. Nothing. It's just...

926
00:54:46,457 --> 00:54:47,999
If we hadn't spent
the last hour fucking,

927
00:54:48,023 --> 00:54:50,069
I'd swear you weren't a man.

928
00:54:50,504 --> 00:54:51,897
I'm not a man?

929
00:54:51,940 --> 00:54:53,638
No, not so much.

930
00:54:53,681 --> 00:54:55,379
Men just want sex.

931
00:54:55,422 --> 00:54:56,728
Wow.

932
00:54:58,120 --> 00:54:59,426
That's all I want.

933
00:54:59,470 --> 00:55:01,428
Yeah, I know.

934
00:55:03,778 --> 00:55:05,302
You're...

935
00:55:05,345 --> 00:55:07,086
I'm what?

936
00:55:08,435 --> 00:55:10,045
I don't know.

937
00:55:10,872 --> 00:55:12,570
I don't know.

938
00:55:12,613 --> 00:55:14,267
Guys my age they
just close their eyes

939
00:55:14,311 --> 00:55:17,226
and go straight ahead
like I'm not even there.

940
00:55:17,270 --> 00:55:20,621
Well that sounds
incredibly romantic.

941
00:55:23,668 --> 00:55:25,713
But your eyes are open.

942
00:55:26,584 --> 00:55:29,151
I can't take my eyes off you.

943
00:55:30,805 --> 00:55:32,459
I like that.

944
00:55:33,068 --> 00:55:34,896
Yeah, me too.

945
00:55:47,344 --> 00:55:48,475
What is it?

946
00:55:50,869 --> 00:55:52,261
What?

947
00:55:52,305 --> 00:55:54,568
It's the, I'm sorry, it's
the music. I kind of...

948
00:55:54,612 --> 00:55:55,961
You don't like James Cooper?

949
00:55:56,004 --> 00:55:57,876
It spoiled the moment.
No, I hate this song.

950
00:55:57,919 --> 00:56:00,487
It's amazing. I listen to
it every night before bed.

951
00:56:02,141 --> 00:56:04,535
Do you know what it's about?

952
00:56:05,362 --> 00:56:06,642
Okay, well, I know
it sounds sad,

953
00:56:06,667 --> 00:56:09,540
but it's about this guy

954
00:56:09,583 --> 00:56:11,063
who's in a relationship
with this girl

955
00:56:11,106 --> 00:56:13,239
who keeps on hurting him.

956
00:56:13,674 --> 00:56:14,825
And then by the end of the song,

957
00:56:14,849 --> 00:56:16,895
he lets you know that

958
00:56:17,461 --> 00:56:20,159
he's going to find someone
who deserves his love.

959
00:56:20,986 --> 00:56:22,770
And he says,

960
00:56:23,684 --> 00:56:26,208
close your eyes, come to me,

961
00:56:26,252 --> 00:56:28,820
tomorrow's where
you're meant to be.

962
00:56:29,516 --> 00:56:32,867
Her tears are wet,
complexion streaked

963
00:56:32,911 --> 00:56:35,740
the love that you
have yet to meet.

964
00:56:38,656 --> 00:56:40,266
You okay?

965
00:56:41,180 --> 00:56:42,616
Yeah.

966
00:56:57,849 --> 00:57:00,634
I feel like I'm
behind enemy lines.

967
00:57:02,070 --> 00:57:04,812
Your mom was
uncomfortable here too.

968
00:57:05,204 --> 00:57:07,249
Is that why you broke up?

969
00:57:07,293 --> 00:57:09,730
It's never one thing.

970
00:57:10,339 --> 00:57:12,603
We were meant for
certain people.

971
00:57:13,168 --> 00:57:15,649
She wasn't my soul mate.

972
00:57:16,650 --> 00:57:18,826
But she gave me you.

973
00:57:28,532 --> 00:57:29,837
I feel like he's
looking at me.

974
00:57:29,881 --> 00:57:31,709
Like he knows I'm Jewish.

975
00:57:31,752 --> 00:57:33,058
God doesn't have an ego.

976
00:57:33,101 --> 00:57:35,582
He doesn't care what
religion you are.

977
00:57:35,626 --> 00:57:37,932
Tell that to the
Christian right.

978
00:57:37,976 --> 00:57:39,606
Why do you have to
judge an entire faith

979
00:57:39,630 --> 00:57:43,198
on its most irrational faction?

980
00:57:58,866 --> 00:58:00,520
Let's go, okay?

981
00:58:00,564 --> 00:58:02,522
I'm fine, okay. Let's
just get out of here.

982
00:58:02,566 --> 00:58:03,586
Whoa, whoa, what happened?

983
00:58:03,610 --> 00:58:05,656
Nothing. Okay? Just...

984
00:58:05,699 --> 00:58:08,049
Did he do something to you?

985
00:58:08,441 --> 00:58:10,617
No. It was my fault, okay.

986
00:58:10,661 --> 00:58:12,421
There is nothing you could
have done that could...

987
00:58:12,445 --> 00:58:13,620
Hey!

988
00:58:14,403 --> 00:58:18,016
I hit him, okay?
With a golf club.

989
00:58:18,059 --> 00:58:21,759
Many, many times.

990
00:58:21,802 --> 00:58:24,239
So let's just get out of here.

991
00:58:26,328 --> 00:58:28,809
Sorry about the room.

992
00:58:28,853 --> 00:58:31,290
Taking you back
to my dying father

993
00:58:31,333 --> 00:58:34,641
seemed even less you know...

994
00:58:35,294 --> 00:58:36,774
Cheers.

995
00:58:42,997 --> 00:58:44,782
You okay?

996
00:58:45,347 --> 00:58:46,740
Yeah.

997
00:58:47,524 --> 00:58:50,657
Yeah, you know, I have
to tell you something.

998
00:58:53,921 --> 00:58:57,446
And I'm not sure how
you're going to take it.

999
00:58:57,490 --> 00:59:00,319
I'm really worried that
you're going to hate me.

1000
00:59:01,189 --> 00:59:02,060
No matter what it is...

1001
00:59:02,103 --> 00:59:05,585
Just don't speak for a minute.

1002
00:59:09,371 --> 00:59:13,375
When you showed up, my life
was really complicated.

1003
00:59:15,726 --> 00:59:19,033
Kevin has been my fuck
buddy for some time now.

1004
00:59:21,079 --> 00:59:25,126
Even when I've had
other boyfriends, I

1005
00:59:29,870 --> 00:59:33,047
I don't know, with you,
I just don't want to.

1006
00:59:34,266 --> 00:59:36,050
And he doesn't understand?

1007
00:59:36,573 --> 00:59:37,661
No.

1008
00:59:38,226 --> 00:59:40,664
He understands, I just...

1009
00:59:41,665 --> 00:59:43,580
I freaked out.

1010
00:59:45,669 --> 00:59:47,714
God, you're going to hate me.

1011
00:59:47,758 --> 00:59:49,194
I'm not going to hate you.

1012
00:59:49,237 --> 00:59:50,238
Not yet.

1013
00:59:50,282 --> 00:59:52,893
Wait until you see
who I really am.

1014
00:59:57,289 --> 00:59:58,856
I'm a whore.

1015
00:59:59,117 --> 01:00:00,858
You're not a whore.

1016
01:00:00,901 --> 01:00:02,903
This is what I'm
trying to tell you.

1017
01:00:02,947 --> 01:00:04,905
Men use me for sex all the time,

1018
01:00:04,949 --> 01:00:08,256
and I let them use me.
You are not a whore.

1019
01:00:08,648 --> 01:00:11,608
Every time I say
""Never again"" and...

1020
01:00:13,784 --> 01:00:15,046
It doesn't matter.

1021
01:00:15,089 --> 01:00:16,090
But it does matter.

1022
01:00:16,134 --> 01:00:16,743
Not to me.

1023
01:00:16,787 --> 01:00:19,616
It does matter!

1024
01:00:21,705 --> 01:00:25,622
What good is my love if I've
given it to so many men?

1025
01:00:27,754 --> 01:00:30,148
Oh, this is a bad idea.

1026
01:00:30,191 --> 01:00:32,803
I shouldn't have
told you, I just...

1027
01:00:32,846 --> 01:00:35,588
I don't know. I thought if
I got it out of me that...

1028
01:00:35,632 --> 01:00:37,982
I don't, I don't
know what I thought.

1029
01:00:39,723 --> 01:00:41,507
We should go.

1030
01:00:42,769 --> 01:00:44,553
We should go.

1031
01:00:44,597 --> 01:00:47,905
We need to go, okay! Come on.

1032
01:00:48,688 --> 01:00:51,169
Please, I just want to go.

1033
01:00:53,475 --> 01:00:54,738
Come here.

1034
01:00:59,743 --> 01:01:02,397
I know you've been hurt.

1035
01:01:03,268 --> 01:01:06,663
Over and over and over again.

1036
01:01:07,315 --> 01:01:11,058
And you still managed to
see the best in people.

1037
01:01:11,885 --> 01:01:15,062
Have you got any idea
how amazing that is?

1038
01:01:16,455 --> 01:01:19,023
You made me find something.

1039
01:01:19,327 --> 01:01:21,286
Let's go get it.

1040
01:02:12,729 --> 01:02:14,818
They'll look for
a nurse this week.

1041
01:02:14,861 --> 01:02:16,863
You're sure you have to leave?

1042
01:02:16,907 --> 01:02:19,910
I got to find a new job
before I lose all my clients.

1043
01:02:19,953 --> 01:02:21,259
That bad.

1044
01:02:22,651 --> 01:02:23,803
I was holding it
together with Scotch tape

1045
01:02:23,827 --> 01:02:26,264
and baling wire before this.

1046
01:02:27,831 --> 01:02:30,355
I'm so proud of you.

1047
01:02:31,008 --> 01:02:34,141
I was terrified when you
got back from Durham.

1048
01:02:34,185 --> 01:02:36,491
I didn't sleep for months.

1049
01:02:36,840 --> 01:02:38,537
You never said a word.

1050
01:02:38,580 --> 01:02:40,974
You don't tell those
things to your kid.

1051
01:02:42,193 --> 01:02:46,284
You pulled yourself back up
and carved yourself a life.

1052
01:02:49,678 --> 01:02:51,811
I wish I understood you.

1053
01:02:51,855 --> 01:02:53,770
Don't waste time trying.

1054
01:02:54,335 --> 01:02:58,426
You're going to wake up
one morning and be me.

1055
01:02:59,776 --> 01:03:02,822
Life happens. No matter what.

1056
01:03:04,389 --> 01:03:05,912
You uh...

1057
01:03:06,913 --> 01:03:10,787
You'll get credit for
what you don't deserve,

1058
01:03:10,830 --> 01:03:14,181
blame for things that
weren't your fault.

1059
01:03:14,878 --> 01:03:19,317
You just have to stick
around for the rest.

1060
01:03:22,929 --> 01:03:24,061
Eh...

1061
01:03:25,845 --> 01:03:26,933
Eh.

1062
01:03:27,281 --> 01:03:28,935
Let's shoot some pool.

1063
01:03:32,983 --> 01:03:34,854
How'd it go with Ben?

1064
01:03:37,552 --> 01:03:39,554
Okay, I guess.

1065
01:03:40,425 --> 01:03:42,296
Tell him you love him?

1066
01:03:43,123 --> 01:03:45,082
It didn't come up.

1067
01:03:47,388 --> 01:03:49,869
He probably knows, but
you'll regret it anyway.

1068
01:03:49,913 --> 01:03:51,218
You should say it.

1069
01:03:51,479 --> 01:03:53,220
You certainly say it a lot.

1070
01:03:53,264 --> 01:03:55,222
I love you a lot.

1071
01:03:57,181 --> 01:03:58,138
I know.

1072
01:03:58,182 --> 01:03:59,836
You do?

1073
01:04:01,272 --> 01:04:04,144
It's the only thing
I've ever been sure of.

1074
01:04:09,933 --> 01:04:11,412
Nice.

1075
01:04:12,370 --> 01:04:13,980
One more game?

1076
01:04:14,024 --> 01:04:16,504
What can I say? The
man likes to lose.

1077
01:04:16,548 --> 01:04:17,897
Rack ¢em up!

1078
01:04:28,342 --> 01:04:31,868
Oh, I can't get
comfortable anymore.

1079
01:04:32,694 --> 01:04:35,001
Open the glove compartment.

1080
01:04:40,659 --> 01:04:41,921
This?

1081
01:04:42,400 --> 01:04:44,793
Medical marijuana.

1082
01:04:58,242 --> 01:05:00,548
What's your disease?

1083
01:05:02,115 --> 01:05:04,901
What kind of father
do you think I am?

1084
01:05:11,951 --> 01:05:14,214
I like this song.

1085
01:05:24,572 --> 01:05:26,531
That's enough.

1086
01:05:41,763 --> 01:05:43,156
Leaving for the night?

1087
01:05:43,200 --> 01:05:44,027
Yeah.

1088
01:05:44,070 --> 01:05:45,637
I told Kat I would stop by.

1089
01:05:45,680 --> 01:05:47,508
You're seeing a lot of her.

1090
01:05:47,552 --> 01:05:48,901
Yeah.

1091
01:05:48,945 --> 01:05:50,903
Okay.

1092
01:05:53,079 --> 01:05:54,602
Jack.

1093
01:05:54,646 --> 01:05:55,864
Yeah?

1094
01:05:56,256 --> 01:05:58,650
Thanks for coming down here.

1095
01:05:59,694 --> 01:06:01,914
It means a lot to me.

1096
01:06:03,742 --> 01:06:04,917
I love you.

1097
01:06:04,961 --> 01:06:07,311
I love you too, Dad.

1098
01:06:08,790 --> 01:06:09,878
You know, I was thinking

1099
01:06:09,922 --> 01:06:11,576
we could turn this
couch into a bed.

1100
01:06:11,619 --> 01:06:13,665
Sheets, blankets,
the whole nine yards.

1101
01:06:13,708 --> 01:06:15,014
That won't be necessary.

1102
01:06:15,058 --> 01:06:17,147
I could bring
your bed down here.

1103
01:06:18,713 --> 01:06:20,411
It was just a thought.

1104
01:06:54,010 --> 01:06:56,055
The professor is
completely biased

1105
01:06:56,099 --> 01:06:58,405
against anything
made in this country.

1106
01:06:58,449 --> 01:07:01,887
And I'm like, ""Come on,
you teach American film.""

1107
01:07:01,930 --> 01:07:04,150
It's so frustrating.

1108
01:07:04,585 --> 01:07:05,649
You know, why does
something has to be

1109
01:07:05,673 --> 01:07:07,327
in another language or just

1110
01:07:07,371 --> 01:07:10,765
incredibly obscure
to be artistic?

1111
01:07:13,116 --> 01:07:14,247
Are you listening?

1112
01:07:14,291 --> 01:07:15,944
You know, sometimes
the most simple,

1113
01:07:15,988 --> 01:07:17,729
direct things are
the most beautiful.

1114
01:07:17,772 --> 01:07:18,382
Kat...

1115
01:07:18,425 --> 01:07:20,079
I love you.

1116
01:07:20,123 --> 01:07:21,602
What?

1117
01:07:23,126 --> 01:07:24,518
I'm sorry.

1118
01:07:24,562 --> 01:07:26,999
I had to get that out there
or I was going to burst.

1119
01:07:27,608 --> 01:07:30,002
You don't have to say anything.

1120
01:07:34,615 --> 01:07:36,443
Okay, say something.

1121
01:07:40,230 --> 01:07:43,015
You're the most amazing girl.

1122
01:07:43,059 --> 01:07:45,061
But?

1123
01:07:50,414 --> 01:07:53,156
I've got to go back to L.A.

1124
01:07:53,895 --> 01:07:57,203
And this isn't right for me.

1125
01:07:59,292 --> 01:08:01,207
I wish I had met
you five years ago.

1126
01:08:01,251 --> 01:08:04,080
I wish I could be that guy.

1127
01:08:04,471 --> 01:08:07,909
I can't. Too much has happened.

1128
01:08:08,214 --> 01:08:09,781
You understand?

1129
01:08:09,824 --> 01:08:11,478
Too much has...

1130
01:08:15,221 --> 01:08:17,005
I know this is a bad time but

1131
01:08:17,049 --> 01:08:19,530
it's really essential that
you call me for Peter back.

1132
01:08:19,573 --> 01:08:23,011
They're not going to cover our
September or August expenses.

1133
01:08:23,055 --> 01:08:24,143
You need to call me back.

1134
01:08:24,187 --> 01:08:26,450
We're talking business affairs.

1135
01:08:38,592 --> 01:08:40,072
It's signed.

1136
01:08:40,681 --> 01:08:43,119
Have a drink. Celebrate.

1137
01:08:43,902 --> 01:08:45,556
Not tonight.

1138
01:08:50,256 --> 01:08:52,171
Is everything all right, Jeff?

1139
01:08:52,215 --> 01:08:53,129
It'll be fine.

1140
01:08:53,172 --> 01:08:55,174
He and Jackson were close.

1141
01:08:58,177 --> 01:08:59,874
Did you regret it?

1142
01:09:00,266 --> 01:09:02,616
I don't believe in regret.

1143
01:09:03,400 --> 01:09:05,445
I believe in mistakes.

1144
01:09:06,142 --> 01:09:07,317
Regret makes it sound like

1145
01:09:07,360 --> 01:09:09,493
you can actually do
something about it.

1146
01:09:09,536 --> 01:09:11,190
This isn't even my robe.

1147
01:09:12,191 --> 01:09:13,105
Come on, Kat!

1148
01:09:13,149 --> 01:09:15,063
Open up, Kat!

1149
01:09:21,896 --> 01:09:23,071
For better or for worse,

1150
01:09:23,115 --> 01:09:26,074
my actions have
made me who I am.

1151
01:09:27,075 --> 01:09:29,165
Writing that book

1152
01:09:29,991 --> 01:09:32,298
was a terrible idea.

1153
01:09:33,821 --> 01:09:35,234
But if I hadn't done it,
I'd be a different person

1154
01:09:35,258 --> 01:09:37,042
and I'd be in a different place.

1155
01:09:37,085 --> 01:09:41,046
I'd be with a different girl.

1156
01:09:42,569 --> 01:09:44,441
I'd be with no girl.

1157
01:10:06,419 --> 01:10:07,768
Dad!

1158
01:11:51,176 --> 01:11:54,179
Yes. I'd like to report a...

1159
01:11:57,356 --> 01:11:59,532
My dad is dead.

1160
01:13:06,207 --> 01:13:07,774
Why don't you watch
where you're going?

1161
01:13:07,818 --> 01:13:10,342
You got something to say, boy?

1162
01:13:12,300 --> 01:13:14,215
What'd you say?

1163
01:14:37,255 --> 01:14:38,255
Ugh!

1164
01:15:24,737 --> 01:15:26,304
I wasn't ready.

1165
01:15:30,090 --> 01:15:32,919
I wasn't ready to see you back.

1166
01:15:37,141 --> 01:15:38,795
Stay.

1167
01:15:39,665 --> 01:15:40,927
Stay in Asheville.

1168
01:15:40,971 --> 01:15:41,972
I can't.

1169
01:15:42,015 --> 01:15:43,582
I love you.

1170
01:15:43,626 --> 01:15:45,453
And you love me.

1171
01:15:45,497 --> 01:15:47,499
You can't say it
and that's okay.

1172
01:15:47,543 --> 01:15:49,545
But I know you do.

1173
01:15:49,980 --> 01:15:51,851
My life is here.

1174
01:15:52,722 --> 01:15:53,984
This is your life.

1175
01:15:54,027 --> 01:15:55,159
No.

1176
01:15:55,202 --> 01:15:59,685
Me. Ben. Foster.
Alison. We love you.

1177
01:16:02,558 --> 01:16:04,429
You're so fixated on this idea

1178
01:16:04,472 --> 01:16:06,344
of what you think your
life should look like

1179
01:16:06,387 --> 01:16:09,956
that you can't even see
what's really going on.

1180
01:16:10,391 --> 01:16:12,655
Right now! Here!

1181
01:16:13,177 --> 01:16:15,353
This is your life.

1182
01:16:17,094 --> 01:16:19,923
And it¢s going to hurt
for a little while.

1183
01:16:21,359 --> 01:16:24,362
But you just have
to do it anyway.

1184
01:16:28,322 --> 01:16:30,455
I'm not going to leave you.

1185
01:16:41,988 --> 01:16:43,468
Jackson.

1186
01:16:45,949 --> 01:16:47,733
What is this?

1187
01:16:50,475 --> 01:16:51,737
Tragic news from Los Angeles.

1188
01:16:51,781 --> 01:16:52,564
Asheville
native, Jackson murdered

1189
01:16:52,608 --> 01:16:54,305
in late Saturday evening.

1190
01:16:54,348 --> 01:16:55,915
Son of longtime
Democrat columnist...

1191
01:16:55,959 --> 01:16:56,742
Huh?

1192
01:16:56,786 --> 01:16:58,222
Thanks, big dog.

1193
01:16:58,265 --> 01:16:59,527
Hey!

1194
01:17:00,180 --> 01:17:00,877
Give me...

1195
01:17:00,920 --> 01:17:02,530
Get down! Get back down!

1196
01:17:02,574 --> 01:17:04,228
You want to play
somebody with a gun?

1197
01:17:04,271 --> 01:17:05,969
What's his name, man?

1198
01:17:06,404 --> 01:17:08,711
Dude, dude, dude, dude.

1199
01:17:08,754 --> 01:17:09,842
What's his name, man?

1200
01:17:09,886 --> 01:17:11,365
Jackson White,
man. Jackson White.

1201
01:17:11,409 --> 01:17:12,845
Let's go man. Let's go, D.

1202
01:17:12,889 --> 01:17:14,368
Jackson.

1203
01:17:14,412 --> 01:17:16,370
Look at me!

1204
01:17:17,241 --> 01:17:18,546
Yo, come on, D.

1205
01:17:20,679 --> 01:17:21,462
30 years...

1206
01:17:21,506 --> 01:17:23,377
Suspect is still at large.

1207
01:17:35,781 --> 01:17:37,609
It's okay.

1208
01:17:38,218 --> 01:17:39,002
Go.

1209
01:17:39,045 --> 01:17:40,917
I love you too.

1210
01:17:42,832 --> 01:17:44,311
I know.

1211
01:17:50,491 --> 01:17:52,102
Jesus.

1212
01:17:54,539 --> 01:17:55,671
Looks like a...

1213
01:17:55,714 --> 01:17:57,629
How many days?

1214
01:17:58,456 --> 01:18:00,501
Keep him behind the yellow line.

1215
01:18:02,590 --> 01:18:04,331
What's the
official time of death?

1216
01:18:04,375 --> 01:18:05,375
3:19am.

1217
01:18:07,726 --> 01:18:09,423
No!

1218
01:18:21,566 --> 01:18:24,047
Now do you know what happened?

1219
01:18:24,395 --> 01:18:25,918
I'm dead.

1220
01:18:26,266 --> 01:18:28,355
For a few weeks now.

1221
01:18:28,399 --> 01:18:30,531
We should go.

1222
01:18:34,231 --> 01:18:36,015
Are you God?

1223
01:18:36,537 --> 01:18:38,452
I'm afraid not.

1224
01:18:38,975 --> 01:18:40,454
An angel.

1225
01:18:40,498 --> 01:18:42,935
Just think of me as a friend.

1226
01:18:43,283 --> 01:18:46,069
I've always been
looking out for you.

1227
01:18:47,548 --> 01:18:49,550
I'm not the only one.

1228
01:18:50,116 --> 01:18:53,685
Just listen to the
people who surrounds you.

1229
01:18:55,252 --> 01:18:57,384
I'm not sure that one
life can mean anything.

1230
01:18:57,428 --> 01:18:59,430
One life can change the world.

1231
01:18:59,473 --> 01:19:01,519
You might find out
that pain isn't so bad.

1232
01:19:01,562 --> 01:19:04,348
That means that something
matters, Jackson.

1233
01:19:04,391 --> 01:19:05,828
Can't leave things unsaid.

1234
01:19:05,871 --> 01:19:06,785
Are we still friends?

1235
01:19:06,829 --> 01:19:08,526
Always brother.

1236
01:19:08,569 --> 01:19:10,223
Always.

1237
01:19:10,615 --> 01:19:12,535
You might be meeting
someone who lets you know.

1238
01:19:12,573 --> 01:19:17,013
But he's going to find
someone who deserves his love.

1239
01:19:18,318 --> 01:19:21,147
I'll never get to say good-bye.

1240
01:19:21,582 --> 01:19:23,541
You already have.

1241
01:19:23,584 --> 01:19:24,672
Did you ever lose someone

1242
01:19:24,716 --> 01:19:27,327
whose absence shook
your very core?

1243
01:19:27,371 --> 01:19:28,981
Then one day you felt
a flood of warmth

1244
01:19:29,025 --> 01:19:32,855
and the pain was gone, leaving
only those memories of love.

1245
01:19:32,898 --> 01:19:34,204
Everyone makes this journey

1246
01:19:34,247 --> 01:19:37,642
and your love never
leaves this earth.

1247
01:19:37,685 --> 01:19:39,905
Foster and Alison will help.

1248
01:19:39,949 --> 01:19:43,691
They become a family, united
by their love for you.

1249
01:19:45,128 --> 01:19:46,390
And Kat?

1250
01:19:46,433 --> 01:19:48,435
It's harder for her.

1251
01:19:48,479 --> 01:19:50,960
She'll never meet her soul mate.

1252
01:19:51,351 --> 01:19:54,441
Most people can deal with
a lesser lot in life.

1253
01:19:54,485 --> 01:19:56,748
You see them everywhere.

1254
01:19:56,792 --> 01:19:58,837
Living life out of habit.

1255
01:19:59,577 --> 01:20:01,492
She's not that resilient.

1256
01:20:02,623 --> 01:20:04,016
She'll wake up one morning

1257
01:20:04,060 --> 01:20:08,368
with an inexplicable sadness
she can no longer carry.

1258
01:20:13,504 --> 01:20:15,419
Kat! No!

1259
01:20:21,164 --> 01:20:23,427
Don't worry.
She will find you.

1260
01:20:23,470 --> 01:20:25,168
Same way you found her.

1261
01:20:25,211 --> 01:20:27,170
In this world or the next.

1262
01:20:27,213 --> 01:20:28,693
It doesn't matter.

1263
01:20:28,954 --> 01:20:31,522
We all find our love.

1264
01:21:14,565 --> 01:21:15,783
Jackson.

1265
01:21:15,827 --> 01:21:18,525
You have to finish this
journey on your own.

1266
01:21:18,786 --> 01:21:21,050
But you're going to be okay.

1267
01:21:21,398 --> 01:21:24,183
It was such a
pleasure to know you.

1268
01:21:24,880 --> 01:21:27,665
This is where we say good-bye.

1269
01:21:33,236 --> 01:21:34,628
Wait!

1270
01:21:36,979 --> 01:21:38,763
What happens now?

1271
01:21:40,243 --> 01:21:41,679
You live.

1272
01:21:45,161 --> 01:21:46,684
Live.

1273
01:22:29,379 --> 01:22:30,989
Welcome home.

"
Camille,https://yts-subs.com/movie-imdb/tt0028683,https://yts-subs.com/subtitles/camille-1936-english-yify-489895,"1
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:16,800
For the lady of the camellias.

2
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:22,560
And they're almost twice as large
as usual.

3
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:25,600
I shall have twice as many
as usual tomorrow.

4
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:29,920
Twice as man...? Oh, don't listen to her,
Barjon. I know what those things cost.

5
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:33,560
Aren't you willing to listen to her when
she orders hats and dresses from you?

6
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:35,160
They're an investment.

7
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:38,520
Of course, I order too many flowers,
hats and too many everything.

8
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:39,960
But I want them.

9
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:41,680
To the theater.

10
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:48,800
And there's no limit to your extravagance.
Now, you won't be young forever.

11
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:51,800
It's high time you settle something
about your future.

12
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:54,960
And I know the very man for you.

13
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:57,720
- Really?
- Yes, really.

14
00:02:58,880 --> 00:03:00,920
Aren't you interested
to know who it is?

15
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:02,400
Oh, yes, who is it?

16
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:08,240
The Baron de Varville, one of the richest
and most elegant gentlemen in Paris.

17
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:10,520
One foot in the grave
and a wig on his head.

18
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:14,400
Not at all. Not at all. Quite the contrary.
He's young and handsome.

19
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:17,640
I heard from one of the girls in my shop
who heard from his valet...

20
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:22,080
...he's gonna be at the theater tonight.
That's why I wanted you to look your best.

21
00:03:56,440 --> 00:03:57,880
Come here.

22
00:03:58,040 --> 00:03:59,200
I want to send a note.

23
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:02,960
And I'll give you a handsome tip
if you get it to the right person.

24
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:04,840
Do you know the Baron de Varville?

25
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,840
- Yes, Madame.
- Good.

26
00:04:18,960 --> 00:04:20,920
Well, that's done.

27
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:23,080
We go this way.

28
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:32,040
My dear, you're as good
as a baroness already.

29
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:34,160
Don't forget. I arranged it all.

30
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:37,680
- Where are we sitting?
- Box A, of course. I always ask for Box A.

31
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:40,920
The baron can't miss it.
Come, come, old dear, open Box A.

32
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:42,680
- Someone else is in there.
- What?

33
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:46,040
- Good evening. Let me see your ticket.
- Here.

34
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:49,160
- Why, this says Box B.
- I asked for Box A.

35
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:51,680
If you'd wear your spectacles,
you'd see what you get.

36
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:53,600
- None of your lip.
- Not so much fuss.

37
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:56,800
- Wait, who's in there?
- A friend of yours.

38
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:00,240
- Olympe.
- Olympe.

39
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:01,840
Right.

40
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,120
Well, what's so funny about it,
I'd like to know.

41
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:06,680
How you arranged everything for Olympe.

42
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:09,840
That cat. If you think I'm going to let...

43
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,080
...a cheating, lying wretch like that
upset my plans, you're wrong.

44
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:17,800
- She's got to change places with us.
- Well, fight it out, ladies.

45
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:24,040
- My angel.
- Marguerite, darling.

46
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:28,200
Oh, how are you, my dear?
How beautiful we look this evening.

47
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:30,520
- Nice perfume. What is it?
- That's my secret.

48
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:36,000
- And how are you, you old robber?
- You're great for teasing, aren't you?

49
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:40,000
Is there any point in our staying out here
in this draft?

50
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:43,640
Oh, look here, Olympe, there's been
a little mistake about our tickets...

51
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:46,800
...and we want you
to change boxes with us.

52
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:48,440
Why?

53
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:51,920
I can't understand why you must sit
in this box when yours is just as good.

54
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:54,640
Well, you know Prudence.
She's a woman full of secrets.

55
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:56,840
Even changing her corset
is a great mystery.

56
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,200
Some things have to be a mystery.

57
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:03,240
But if you'll do what I ask you to do,
I'll send you that fur toque for a present.

58
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:05,640
It's a bargain.
During the intermission, I'll move.

59
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:06,800
Come here, Marguerite.

60
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:21,320
A note for Monsieur le Baron.

61
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:36,760
- Which is Box A?
- There, Monsieur le Baron. At the left.

62
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:38,800
Show me to my seat.

63
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:41,080
Doesn't Monsieur le Baron
wish to send an answer?

64
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:44,440
I'll wait and decide that later.

65
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:21,800
My dear, do you see that gentleman
standing up?

66
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:24,560
- Which one?
- In the second row on the aisle.

67
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,080
- Yes. Do you know him?
- I know who he is.

68
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:36,400
He's the fabulously rich de Varville,
Baron de Varville.

69
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:43,200
I didn't know that rich men
ever looked like that.

70
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:45,760
This one does. He's looking at us.

71
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:47,160
He's seen us looking at him.

72
00:07:56,520 --> 00:07:59,280
I've changed my mind, Prudence.
You can keep your fur toque.

73
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:03,160
The Baron de Varville is on his way to this
box, and I'm going to stay and meet him.

74
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:05,240
But he's coming here to meet me.

75
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:08,960
- So that's what you had up your sleeve.
- I invited him to join us here myself.

76
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:12,600
Nothing could be better. Thank you,
my dear Prudence, for arranging it.

77
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:16,160
But having done so much,
you really must let me receive him alone.

78
00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:19,960
- Unfortunately, I like him too.
- Why unfortunately?

79
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:22,640
Because his eyes have made love to me
all evening.

80
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:27,520
That's a lie. He barely glanced at you.
I never took my glasses from his face...

81
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:30,080
...except for an instant
to let him see mine.

82
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:32,760
Perhaps that was the instant
he smiled at me.

83
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:35,600
He did not smile at you,
and he won't meet you here.

84
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:38,600
- Then he must look for me somewhere else.
- Sit down, Marguerite.

85
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:43,040
Listen, Olympe, I appeal to your sense
of honor, if you have such a thing.

86
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:46,120
Oh, shut up, you old woman.
Get out before I have you dragged out.

87
00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:49,000
Come, come, Prudence.
You really are a fool, Olympe.

88
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:50,880
You're the fool.

89
00:08:52,280 --> 00:08:54,720
You know that Prudence
is nothing but an old vulture.

90
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:58,280
Vulture! She called me a vulture.

91
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:01,400
That one who'd pick
a dead man's pocket.

92
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:06,640
I'll tell you something else. If you don't
stop being so easygoing with money...

93
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:09,040
...you'll land in the gutter before
you're through.

94
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:11,080
Or back on that farm
where you came from...

95
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:13,760
...milking cows
and cleaning out henhouses.

96
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:18,000
Cows and chickens make better friends
than I've ever met in Paris.

97
00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:24,280
Come here. Stop the baron going to Box A.
Tell him to join us in Box B. Hurry. Hurry!

98
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:30,040
Monsieur le Baron. There has been
a mistake, Monsieur le Baron.

99
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:33,160
The lady who sent you the note
does not wish you to go to Box A...

100
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:36,160
...but to join her and her friend in Box B.

101
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:39,360
So it is you. Do come in, monsieur.

102
00:09:39,520 --> 00:09:41,080
But your answer, Monsieur le Baron.

103
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:44,120
You may say that for the moment
I am engaged.

104
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:05,880
- Are you following me?
- Yes.

105
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:08,640
You... Well, you did smile at me
a moment ago, didn't you?

106
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:11,680
Well, you tell me first whether
you smiled at me or at my friend.

107
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:14,200
- What friend?
- You didn't even see her?

108
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:17,160
- No.
- That's very nice.

109
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:21,000
I was wondering if you'd ask me to sit
down if I knocked at the door of the box.

110
00:10:21,160 --> 00:10:22,360
Why not?

111
00:10:22,520 --> 00:10:25,320
We really seemed fated to meet
this evening, didn't we?

112
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:50,120
Fate must've had something to do
with this evening.

113
00:10:50,280 --> 00:10:52,600
I've hoped for it so long.

114
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:54,640
- You don't believe me?
- No.

115
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:57,040
The first time I saw you
was a year and a half ago.

116
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:59,520
You were in an open carriage
and dressed in white.

117
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:01,880
I saw you go into a shop
in the Place de la Bourse.

118
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:05,320
Yes, that might've happened. I went
to a dressmaker in Place de la Bourse.

119
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:08,920
You were wearing a thin dress
with miles of ruffles...

120
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:13,560
...a large straw hat, an embroidered shawl,
a single bracelet and heavy, gold chain...

121
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:15,800
...and, of course,
the camellias at your waist.

122
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:17,840
You have a marvelous memory,
haven't you?

123
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:20,400
The next time was at the Op�ra Comique.

124
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:22,600
You were sitting in a box
with a fur coat on...

125
00:11:22,760 --> 00:11:25,480
...and Gaston, a chap whom I know
who knows you...

126
00:11:25,640 --> 00:11:28,080
...said, ""Marguerite's been ill. ""

127
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:30,920
And that hurt me.

128
00:11:31,520 --> 00:11:34,200
- The next time...
- Tell me, if all you say is true...

129
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:36,600
...why have you never
spoken to me before?

130
00:11:36,760 --> 00:11:39,760
- In the first place, I didn't know you.
- You didn't know me tonight.

131
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:44,320
No, but after you smiled at me,
I knew you wouldn't mind.

132
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:46,560
And now, since you've met me?

133
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:48,760
Now I know that I love you...

134
00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:51,520
...and have loved you
since that first day.

135
00:11:54,640 --> 00:11:56,600
Marguerite, my dear.

136
00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:01,560
After what happened,
I had to have a brandy.

137
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:05,120
- And after that, two brandies.
- Yes, and then he made me have another.

138
00:12:05,280 --> 00:12:07,800
Well, that's only four.

139
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:10,360
Suppose you go and have another,
Prudence, and then...

140
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:12,000
Well, then another.

141
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:15,480
- You don't want to get me drunk, do you?
- She wants to get rid of us.

142
00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:17,520
She wants to be alone with my friend.

143
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:20,480
For once in your life
you're quite right, Gaston.

144
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:21,840
Who is your friend anyway?

145
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:25,280
Baron de Varville, this is my neighbor,
Madame Duvernoy.

146
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:27,680
- Baron de Varville?
- He, the Baron de Varville?

147
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:30,080
No wonder she wanted to get rid of us.

148
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:33,400
Well, I... I never said
I was the ""Baron"" anybody.

149
00:12:33,560 --> 00:12:34,960
There's the Baron de Varville...

150
00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:37,880
...sitting over there, big as life,
with that wretch, Olympe.

151
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:41,400
- Really?
- Certainly.

152
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:45,240
Well, this is rather funny.

153
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:49,280
- Funny?
- Yes, I quite agree with you. It is funny.

154
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:52,080
Oh, even if you're not Baron de Varville,
sit down.

155
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:55,440
I can't believe I'm wanted now that
my unimportance has been discovered.

156
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:57,720
Don't be silly. Who are you anyhow?

157
00:12:57,880 --> 00:12:59,200
My name is Armand Duval.

158
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:01,400
I've never had any reason
to be ashamed of it.

159
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:03,320
- Armand Duval.
- Yes.

160
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:08,840
I'm not always sincere.
One can't be in this world, you know.

161
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:13,000
- But I am not sorry the mistake happened.
- Nor am I.

162
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:17,880
The baron keeps looking over here.
That must worry Olympe.

163
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:23,920
Well, as long as you don't wish to sit down,
would you go and buy me some sweets?

164
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:26,280
You can afford a pound
of marrons glac�s...

165
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:28,880
...even if you're not the rich baron,
can't you?

166
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:32,200
I'll not come back with your sweets
too soon.

167
00:13:45,160 --> 00:13:48,520
- What is your friend's name?
- I'm not sure which friend you mean.

168
00:13:48,680 --> 00:13:51,480
The girl in the opposite box
whom you just spoke to.

169
00:13:51,640 --> 00:13:55,400
Oh, her. Well, she's hardly a friend.

170
00:13:55,560 --> 00:13:57,240
I know her, of course.

171
00:13:57,440 --> 00:13:59,800
But she's not easy to get along with.
Ask anybody.

172
00:13:59,960 --> 00:14:01,240
What did you say her name was?

173
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:04,960
And she has a reputation of being one
of the most extravagant girls in Paris...

174
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:07,680
...as well as one of the most insincere.

175
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:11,160
- I like sincerity, don't you?
- It's an admirable quality.

176
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:13,480
Well, I insist on it.

177
00:14:13,640 --> 00:14:15,960
She's the kind who says one thing
and thinks another.

178
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:19,080
- Who?
- Marguerite, the girl we were talking about.

179
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:21,040
Marguerite.

180
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:25,480
- What is her other name?
- Gautier. Not that it's her real name.

181
00:14:25,640 --> 00:14:29,000
She had some sort of very common name,
I hear, when she came to Paris.

182
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:31,880
There's no use boring you about her.

183
00:14:32,040 --> 00:14:35,320
A friend of mine is giving a small party
tonight, if you'd care to come.

184
00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:39,400
I detest parties. Thank you
for a very charming entr'acte, my dear.

185
00:14:40,640 --> 00:14:41,880
Will I see you again?

186
00:14:42,040 --> 00:14:45,080
I should think it's very likely, sometime.
Good evening.

187
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:59,160
- Good evening.
- Good evening.

188
00:14:59,520 --> 00:15:02,080
- I hope I don't intrude.
- No.

189
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:04,480
You're very welcome, baron.

190
00:15:04,640 --> 00:15:07,720
I was delighted when I saw
that you were alone.

191
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:16,600
Oh, monsieur, I'm so sorry
I kept you waiting.

192
00:15:16,760 --> 00:15:19,400
I had to go to two shops
before I found your marrons glac�s.

193
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:21,280
It doesn't matter. I'm in no hurry.

194
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:24,440
But since nothing but marrons glac�s
would do, these are very fresh.

195
00:15:24,640 --> 00:15:26,960
- Will monsieur try one?
- Thank you.

196
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:34,160
Thank you, monsieur.

197
00:16:03,280 --> 00:16:05,600
The coachman wishes me
to remind Monsieur le Baron...

198
00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:08,280
...there are four horses to manage,
and they're restless.

199
00:16:08,440 --> 00:16:09,760
Very well.

200
00:16:11,160 --> 00:16:13,360
I must go.

201
00:16:13,520 --> 00:16:15,640
I think I'll change my mind
and take you with me.

202
00:16:15,840 --> 00:16:19,160
- The doctors warned me against Russia.
- But Russia isn't cold in summer.

203
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:21,840
Even so, the trip would be
too much for me.

204
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:27,200
I shall get tired. I shall get ill again.
And you'll be bored.

205
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:29,520
Now, what shall I give you
to remember me by?

206
00:16:29,960 --> 00:16:32,000
- You can't give the only thing I'd like.
- What?

207
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:33,680
A tear.

208
00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:37,920
- You're not sorry enough I'm going.
- Oh, but I am sorry.

209
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:42,360
Is there anything I can do for you
before I go?

210
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:45,240
Yes. I'm going to an auction
this afternoon.

211
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:48,240
- I would like to buy a pair of horses.
- I just gave you a pair.

212
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:51,640
Yes, but these horses belonged
to my friend, Eugenie Clivet...

213
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:53,760
...who died a few weeks ago.

214
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:56,080
And I know she'd like me
to have her horses.

215
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:58,520
Well, what of it
if you don't need them?

216
00:16:58,680 --> 00:17:02,160
Olympe wants them.
She always wants everything I want...

217
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:04,000
...and I don't want her to have them.

218
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:07,560
Are you really as jealous of Olympe
as all that? I don't believe it.

219
00:17:08,440 --> 00:17:10,000
I'll be frank with you.

220
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:13,160
I want Clivet's horses
because I want the coachman.

221
00:17:13,320 --> 00:17:15,960
And he'd be miserable
without the horses.

222
00:17:16,120 --> 00:17:18,640
- He must be very young and handsome.
- Oh, no.

223
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:20,960
He's quite old. He's older than Nanine.

224
00:17:21,120 --> 00:17:26,320
But, well, he needs someone to take care
of him, and I know Olympe won't.

225
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:30,360
So much heart and so little sense.

226
00:17:30,760 --> 00:17:34,080
I shall take a good look
at your new coachman when I come back.

227
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:38,960
- Thank you.
- Now, goodbye.

228
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:40,560
Goodbye.

229
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:44,440
Goodbye.

230
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:51,000
Keep an eye on her, Nanine.

231
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:54,520
Two thousand two hundred and forty
for this magnificent pair of chestnuts.

232
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:56,760
They're the finest pair
in the whole of France.

233
00:17:56,920 --> 00:17:58,640
Why, they're worth 5000 at least.

234
00:17:58,800 --> 00:18:01,160
- Two thousand five hundred.
- Bid, Nanine, 3000.

235
00:18:01,320 --> 00:18:04,040
- Twenty-five hundred once.
- Three thousand.

236
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:06,560
So that's what you came for.
I might've known it.

237
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:08,920
Three thousand and one hundred francs.

238
00:18:09,080 --> 00:18:10,960
Three thousand seven hundred and fifty.

239
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:13,920
- Four thousand. Four!
- Four thousand.

240
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:17,880
Four thousand for this fine pair of chestnuts
which is easily worth 7.

241
00:18:18,040 --> 00:18:20,360
- Oh, that's too much.
- Of course. Don't bid anymore.

242
00:18:20,520 --> 00:18:21,640
- I won't.
- No.

243
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:23,440
Four thousand one hundred.

244
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:26,680
- Four thousand one hundred.
- Four thousand five hundred.

245
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:29,880
- Five thousand!
- Five thousand. Five thousand!

246
00:18:30,040 --> 00:18:34,160
Five thousand francs for this magnificent
pair of chestnuts, ladies and gentlemen.

247
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:36,000
They can be sold any day for 10.

248
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:39,400
- Five thousand one hundred.
- Six thousand.

249
00:18:39,560 --> 00:18:42,680
- Six thousand.
- Six thousand. Six thousand.

250
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:45,560
Six thousand francs.
Six thousand francs.

251
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:51,320
Ladies and gentlemen. Once, twice.
Ladies and gentlemen, sold at 6000 francs.

252
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:55,920
Well, I hope they don't run away
and kill you. I hear they're none too safe.

253
00:18:56,080 --> 00:18:57,760
Go settle with the auctioneer, Nanine.

254
00:18:57,920 --> 00:19:00,480
Tell the old coachman
we'll take him with the horses.

255
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:04,320
- You really have a heart, Marguerite.
- Yes. It's going to cost her a lot.

256
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:07,040
- I hope mine never gets that soft.
- Don't worry, it won't.

257
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:10,880
It's a great mistake for any woman
to have a heart bigger than her purse.

258
00:19:11,040 --> 00:19:13,320
Prudence, did you invite them
to my party tomorrow?

259
00:19:13,480 --> 00:19:15,160
I thought the baron disliked parties.

260
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:17,440
He won't be there.
He'd be bored with my friends.

261
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:20,880
- Have you quarreled?
- Not yet, but don't give up hope, Olympe.

262
00:19:24,440 --> 00:19:27,160
- Nichette.
- Marguerite.

263
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:29,800
How well you look. How happy.
It must be love.

264
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:32,120
- It is.
- Still the same young man?

265
00:19:32,280 --> 00:19:36,560
Of course. And just think, Marguerite.
He talks of our getting married.

266
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:39,640
Just as soon as he's passed
his examinations and is a real lawyer.

267
00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:42,920
- You seem to think that's very fine of him.
- But of course I do.

268
00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:45,800
After all, I have no dowry,
and he's a gentleman and educated.

269
00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:48,800
Even so, why should the mention
of marriage go to your head?

270
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:52,640
But, Marguerite, it's ideal to love,
and to marry the one you love.

271
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:56,000
I have no faith in ideals.
Amuse yourself if you wish.

272
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:58,960
But remember, you can always do better
than a penniless lawyer.

273
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:00,840
I never want to do better
than Gustave.

274
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:04,640
Well, well, time changes our minds,
as well as our hearts.

275
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:07,360
Perhaps you won't go on being
a little goose always.

276
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:09,960
Only, come and see me now and then.

277
00:20:10,120 --> 00:20:12,200
Remember, you're my oldest friend
in Paris.

278
00:20:12,360 --> 00:20:14,360
I will, Marguerite. Soon.

279
00:20:14,560 --> 00:20:17,120
I often think of those days we worked
in the linen shop.

280
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:19,960
I'm so glad to see you today
and that you're looking so well.

281
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:22,520
I always look well
when I'm near death.

282
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:40,000
Armand Duval.

283
00:20:41,160 --> 00:20:44,800
- Where are my marrons glac�s?
- I ate them, Madame, six months ago.

284
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:46,400
What a pity.

285
00:20:46,560 --> 00:20:50,760
However, I'm glad of this opportunity
of returning something belonging to you.

286
00:20:50,920 --> 00:20:53,880
- Yes?
- I found it on the floor when I came back.

287
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:56,360
- And you kept it with you all this time?
- Yes.

288
00:20:56,520 --> 00:20:59,960
- Always with you?
- Always with me, like an old friend...

289
00:21:00,160 --> 00:21:02,680
...to remind me that I'm not
the Baron de Varville.

290
00:21:04,160 --> 00:21:08,520
- That's not a very romantic reason.
- No, I kept it as a warning against romance.

291
00:21:08,680 --> 00:21:12,040
How sensible.
Has it made you very cynical?

292
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:15,880
- Yes, very.
- Is that why you've never called on me?

293
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:19,520
- Perhaps.
- I'm sorry. One needs friends.

294
00:21:19,680 --> 00:21:21,720
Well, I've been looking for you.

295
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:24,720
Monsieur, you can see for yourself,
she's quite well again.

296
00:21:24,920 --> 00:21:26,680
Oh, no, Nanine.

297
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:29,240
Well, or would be
if she took proper care of herself.

298
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:31,640
Why would my health interest
Monsieur Duval?

299
00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:33,800
Because he came every day
when you were ill...

300
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:36,080
...to ask how you were
and to leave flowers.

301
00:21:38,560 --> 00:21:39,760
He's the one?

302
00:21:39,920 --> 00:21:42,840
Tell her yourself.
He just said ""a friend,"" so I thought...

303
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:47,200
- All right, Nanine. Wait for me downstairs.
- Yes, Madame. Monsieur.

304
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:56,240
- You might have asked to have seen me.
- Well, I knew there were so many others.

305
00:21:56,480 --> 00:21:57,840
There were no others.

306
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:01,560
None during all those weeks
the doctors thought I might die.

307
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:03,320
Not even the Baron de Varville?

308
00:22:03,480 --> 00:22:06,400
Baron de Varville chose
to be in England at the time.

309
00:22:06,560 --> 00:22:10,520
No, you were the only one
that took the trouble to ring my bell.

310
00:22:10,680 --> 00:22:15,000
- But now...
- Now I'm well again, and all goes merrily.

311
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:19,160
Would you come to a party I'm giving
tomorrow night? It's my birthday.

312
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:21,440
Aren't you afraid
you're not strong enough yet?

313
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:24,280
Oh, I'm afraid of nothing
except being bored.

314
00:22:24,440 --> 00:22:27,480
- It's supper after the theater.
- Thank you, I'll come with pleasure.

315
00:22:27,640 --> 00:22:29,880
And bring this book as a present.
Have you read it?

316
00:22:30,040 --> 00:22:32,360
<i>- I never read anything. What is it?
- Manon Lescaut.</i>

317
00:22:32,520 --> 00:22:34,400
- Who was she?
- A beautiful girl...

318
00:22:34,560 --> 00:22:36,520
...who lived for love and pleasure.

319
00:22:36,680 --> 00:22:39,120
It's a beautiful color.
It should be a very good story.

320
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:42,400
Yes, it is, but it's rather sad.
She dies in the end.

321
00:22:42,560 --> 00:22:46,000
Well, then I'll keep it, but I won't read it.
I don't like sad thoughts.

322
00:22:46,160 --> 00:22:48,560
However, we all die.

323
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:52,960
So perhaps this will be sold again
someday at an auction after my death.

324
00:22:53,960 --> 00:22:57,880
- I thought you didn't like sad thoughts.
- I don't. But they come sometimes.

325
00:22:58,080 --> 00:23:00,120
<i>- Au revoir, Monsieur Duval.
- Goodbye.</i>

326
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:09,320
Marguerite, my child, are we waiting
for someone, my dear?

327
00:23:09,480 --> 00:23:11,920
- Or are we just waiting for supper?
- Both.

328
00:23:14,360 --> 00:23:16,840
I was so afraid you wouldn't come.

329
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:19,720
- Here's the book I brought you.
- Thank you.

330
00:23:19,880 --> 00:23:22,040
We were just about to sit down.

331
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:25,320
- Will you come?
- Oh, I remember you, young man.

332
00:23:25,480 --> 00:23:28,880
- You're the bogus baron.
- Tactful as always, Prudence.

333
00:23:29,040 --> 00:23:31,640
- You may all sit where you wish.
- Thank you so much.

334
00:23:31,800 --> 00:23:34,840
Now, I'm going to sit next to Gaston,
and you sit over here.

335
00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:36,280
Thank you.

336
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:40,560
Oh, Marguerite,
how charming this table looks.

337
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:47,560
- And how are you this evening, Madame?
- Very well, and how are you, monsieur?

338
00:23:47,720 --> 00:23:50,680
Good gracious, listen to them.
Why so formal?

339
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:52,760
Why not? This is a very elegant soiree.

340
00:23:52,920 --> 00:23:56,280
Well, elegant or not,
if I'm going to enjoy my supper...

341
00:23:56,480 --> 00:23:59,640
...I've got to take off these tight shoes.
Help me, Gaston.

342
00:23:59,800 --> 00:24:01,680
Can't you manage to hold it
a little higher?

343
00:24:01,880 --> 00:24:03,160
There.

344
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:09,920
- What are those little fellas on that dish?
- Partridges, Madame.

345
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:12,920
- Put some on my plate.
- Some? How many do you think you'll get?

346
00:24:13,080 --> 00:24:15,000
Partridges are not oysters, you know.

347
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:17,280
Well, they don't look
much bigger than oysters.

348
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:21,480
- What's the joke?
- The funniest story I've ever heard...

349
00:24:21,640 --> 00:24:24,240
...in my life. I shall die!

350
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:27,520
- Tell me, tell me.
- Get closer.

351
00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:35,800
- Tell me.
- Oh, no, tell me.

352
00:24:35,960 --> 00:24:37,600
Well, no fair. Tell us all.

353
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:47,320
Tell me the story, Gaston.

354
00:24:52,840 --> 00:24:56,240
I know what's coming, but you go on.

355
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:59,280
I want a laugh too. Tell me the story.

356
00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:03,480
I'll tell you. You've probably heard
it before. It's as old as Prudence.

357
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:07,280
- What's that about my being old?
- I said that the story was as old as you are.

358
00:25:07,720 --> 00:25:09,280
I'm 36.

359
00:25:12,160 --> 00:25:15,880
Drink your wine, Armand.
He's as sad as a drinking song.

360
00:25:16,040 --> 00:25:17,720
What's the matter? Are you shocked?

361
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:22,000
No, certainly not.
Only, I know all Gaston's jokes.

362
00:25:22,160 --> 00:25:24,080
In fact, I told him most of them.

363
00:25:25,160 --> 00:25:27,800
I'd sooner they weren't repeated
at your table.

364
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:30,280
Oh, come, come.

365
00:25:30,440 --> 00:25:34,720
You must remember, I'm not a colonel's
daughter just out of the convent.

366
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:41,320
Bravo! Bravo!

367
00:25:48,040 --> 00:25:52,520
I do this better than anybody.
Nobody can do it as well as I can.

368
00:25:52,680 --> 00:25:56,320
- Slower, Charles, you're going too fast.
- You're getting tired.

369
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:58,680
If you don't stop playing,
Olympe will drop dead.

370
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:02,040
She can't keep that up forever,
she's not so young.

371
00:26:02,360 --> 00:26:05,240
Faster, I'm just getting into the mood.

372
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:06,840
You'll drop, dear.

373
00:26:09,040 --> 00:26:10,960
Well, go ahead and drop. I don't care.

374
00:26:15,080 --> 00:26:19,240
- Sit beside me, dear.
- I'm not tired.

375
00:26:21,280 --> 00:26:23,800
I appreciate you. I love you.

376
00:26:23,960 --> 00:26:25,240
I love you.

377
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:29,080
Now, don't go away. I adore you.

378
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:33,880
- Play a waltz, Charles.
- I don't want to. I want to play a polka.

379
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:35,760
Very well, play a polka.

380
00:26:35,920 --> 00:26:38,800
Dance with me, Gaston.
Dance, everybody.

381
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:16,440
Oh, it's you.

382
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:20,520
What's happened? You look ill too.

383
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:22,320
No, it's...

384
00:28:23,040 --> 00:28:25,560
It's seeing you like this, suffering.

385
00:28:25,720 --> 00:28:26,880
It's nothing.

386
00:28:27,040 --> 00:28:29,240
- It lasts only a minute.
- You're killing yourself.

387
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:32,360
If I am, you are the only one
who objects.

388
00:28:32,920 --> 00:28:37,160
Now, Armand, why don't you go back
and dance with one of those pretty girls.

389
00:28:42,040 --> 00:28:44,600
Come. I'll go with you.

390
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:51,240
What a child you are.

391
00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:54,200
Your hand's so hot.

392
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:58,040
Is that why you put tears on it,
to cool it?

393
00:28:58,240 --> 00:29:00,760
I know I don't mean anything to you.
I don't count.

394
00:29:00,920 --> 00:29:03,160
But someone ought to look after you.

395
00:29:03,680 --> 00:29:05,720
And I could if you'd let me.

396
00:29:06,600 --> 00:29:09,920
Too much wine
has made you sentimental.

397
00:29:13,360 --> 00:29:17,600
It wasn't wine that made me come every
day for months to find out how you were.

398
00:29:18,440 --> 00:29:21,080
No, that couldn't have been wine.

399
00:29:21,960 --> 00:29:24,120
- So you'd really like to take care of me?
- Yes.

400
00:29:24,280 --> 00:29:27,960
- All day, every day?
- All day, every day. Why not?

401
00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:30,760
Why should you care
for a woman like me?

402
00:29:30,920 --> 00:29:34,600
I'm always nervous or sick
or sad or too gay.

403
00:29:35,720 --> 00:29:37,720
But I do care for you.

404
00:29:38,360 --> 00:29:41,440
You know what you should do?
You should get married.

405
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:46,520
Come, come.

406
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:47,960
You're young and sensitive.

407
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:50,840
The sort of company you're in tonight
doesn't suit you at all.

408
00:29:51,040 --> 00:29:52,640
- Nor you.
- Nonsense.

409
00:29:52,800 --> 00:29:55,960
These are the only friends I have,
and I'm no better than they are.

410
00:29:56,720 --> 00:30:00,880
However, I've given you
some very good advice.

411
00:30:01,040 --> 00:30:02,840
Now, let's go back.

412
00:30:11,480 --> 00:30:14,480
What on earth am I going
to do with you?

413
00:30:18,360 --> 00:30:20,560
No one has ever loved you
as I love you.

414
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:23,880
That may be true,
but what can I do about it?

415
00:30:24,840 --> 00:30:28,200
You should go away
and not see me anymore.

416
00:30:31,080 --> 00:30:33,280
But don't go in anger.

417
00:30:33,640 --> 00:30:36,440
Why don't you laugh at yourself a little
as I laugh at myself...

418
00:30:36,600 --> 00:30:41,120
...and come and talk to me
once in a while in a friendly way.

419
00:30:41,480 --> 00:30:44,440
That's too much. And not enough.

420
00:30:46,560 --> 00:30:49,400
Don't you believe in love, Marguerite?

421
00:30:51,720 --> 00:30:54,200
I don't think I know what it is.

422
00:30:54,360 --> 00:30:57,440
- Oh, thank you.
- For what?

423
00:30:57,600 --> 00:30:59,800
For never having been in love.

424
00:31:00,680 --> 00:31:02,480
How funny you are.

425
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:06,000
That's right, laugh at me.

426
00:31:06,160 --> 00:31:08,880
Perhaps your laughter will cure me.
Nothing else seems to.

427
00:31:09,040 --> 00:31:11,720
I believe you're sincere, at least.

428
00:31:13,560 --> 00:31:16,360
After all, when one may not have
long to live...

429
00:31:16,520 --> 00:31:18,600
...why shouldn't one have fancies?

430
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:24,720
You see, I'm not laughing anymore.

431
00:31:32,600 --> 00:31:34,840
Take this and come back to me
when it dies.

432
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:37,520
- How soon will that be?
- Tomorrow night.

433
00:31:37,680 --> 00:31:39,280
Look...

434
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:42,440
...it's dead already. Now.

435
00:31:42,600 --> 00:31:45,440
- That's impossible.
- It's not. Send those people away.

436
00:31:45,640 --> 00:31:47,560
- I can't.
- I will. I'll tell them you're ill.

437
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:50,440
It's true. You're too ill to talk
with anyone but me tonight.

438
00:31:50,600 --> 00:31:52,000
If they go, you must go too.

439
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:53,440
- What?
- Yes.

440
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:57,840
Come back later, alone, so we'll have
supper in here tonight.

441
00:31:59,080 --> 00:32:02,560
Go in the other room, and I'll have
Nanine get rid of you all.

442
00:32:06,320 --> 00:32:08,520
You're not sending me for
marrons glac�s, are you?

443
00:32:08,680 --> 00:32:11,160
How do I know you'll let me
in when I come back?

444
00:32:18,680 --> 00:32:22,320
There. You can let yourself in
when you come back.

445
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:24,520
You're an angel.

446
00:32:25,080 --> 00:32:27,240
I won't go, I can't.

447
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:38,240
Marguerite Gautier.

448
00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:53,760
Stretch your legs, ladies!
Remember, the hat's full of money...

449
00:32:53,920 --> 00:32:56,840
...and the one kicking it
out of my hand gets it all!

450
00:32:58,360 --> 00:33:01,000
Out of my way, everybody!

451
00:33:06,520 --> 00:33:12,360
Get back! I don't have to run a mile
to get my leg up.

452
00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:18,440
Let me try.

453
00:33:24,400 --> 00:33:25,960
Again.

454
00:33:26,520 --> 00:33:30,520
- Madame Prudence. Madame Prudence!
- Hello! Hello, Nanine.

455
00:33:30,680 --> 00:33:33,040
Madame is sorry,
but she must send everybody away.

456
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:36,560
Oh, what a pity. Just when we were having
such a good time too.

457
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:38,360
Bad news, everybody. Party's over.

458
00:33:38,520 --> 00:33:41,040
- What?
- Marguerite wants us to go home.

459
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:43,400
She started to cough while dancing.
She was ill.

460
00:33:43,560 --> 00:33:45,880
She's always ill
when anybody's having fun.

461
00:33:46,040 --> 00:33:48,040
What's the matter?
Did she drink too much?

462
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:49,360
Don't be a cat, Olympe.

463
00:33:49,520 --> 00:33:51,880
- Well, it's late anyhow.
- Let's go somewhere else.

464
00:33:52,080 --> 00:33:54,320
Let's go to my place!

465
00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:57,000
I wanna keep trying till I kick it.

466
00:33:57,160 --> 00:34:01,040
What about something to eat?
I'm just beginning to be hungry again.

467
00:34:02,520 --> 00:34:05,720
I think that I'll take some food.
Come get some, everybody!

468
00:34:05,880 --> 00:34:09,600
Don't forget the cheese!
Somebody bring the cheese.

469
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:12,000
Forward march!

470
00:34:20,280 --> 00:34:23,640
- But I thought you wanted your hair done.
- I do.

471
00:34:23,800 --> 00:34:26,920
- Have they been gone long?
- Just about half an hour.

472
00:34:27,080 --> 00:34:30,520
- Nanine, you told the servants to go to bed?
- They've gone.

473
00:34:30,680 --> 00:34:33,720
- But I fixed supper for the two of you.
- Oh, good, Nanine.

474
00:34:33,880 --> 00:34:38,040
Darling Nanine, perfect Nanine,
hurry up.

475
00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:04,080
- Good evening, my dear.
- Good evening.

476
00:35:05,800 --> 00:35:08,800
You've lost no time in celebrating
my departure, I see.

477
00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:11,280
So you didn't go to Russia after all.

478
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:14,320
- I had an idea you wouldn't.
- No.

479
00:35:15,400 --> 00:35:18,560
You may flatter yourself.
I can't do without you.

480
00:35:19,120 --> 00:35:23,240
After driving most of the day, I turned
round and drove most of the night back.

481
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:25,360
What's this? More supper.

482
00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:30,400
- For two. Whom were you expecting?
- You. Put it there, Nanine.

483
00:35:30,560 --> 00:35:34,240
I have learned never to believe a man
when he says he's leaving town.

484
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:37,280
- Won't you have something to eat?
- I'm not hungry.

485
00:35:37,480 --> 00:35:39,240
Then drink something.

486
00:35:39,400 --> 00:35:40,560
Come and drink with me.

487
00:35:40,720 --> 00:35:43,600
- I'm not thirsty.
- I am.

488
00:35:55,240 --> 00:35:58,520
- Many happy returns.
- Thank you.

489
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:12,400
This part is so difficult.

490
00:36:12,560 --> 00:36:16,280
- I hate all the sharps.
- I'm afraid your mind's not on it.

491
00:36:16,440 --> 00:36:19,400
Why, you know very well
I've never been able to play it.

492
00:36:20,520 --> 00:36:23,040
- But you play it beautifully.
- My one merit.

493
00:36:23,200 --> 00:36:27,000
- Won't you play it for me?
- Aren't you tired? It's very late.

494
00:36:27,160 --> 00:36:30,360
- Probably are wishing I'd go home.
- Please play.

495
00:36:41,360 --> 00:36:43,080
Oh, good, Nanine.

496
00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:45,960
Bolt the door. If the bell rings,
don't answer it.

497
00:36:46,160 --> 00:36:48,840
- No, I won't.
- Have you two finished whispering?

498
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:52,520
I'm sorry. I was just giving
Nanine some orders.

499
00:36:52,720 --> 00:36:54,840
I don't doubt it.

500
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:57,760
Now, play nicely.

501
00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:21,000
Someday I shall get temperamental and
object when doorbells ring when I play.

502
00:37:21,840 --> 00:37:23,760
Did the doorbell ring?

503
00:37:24,520 --> 00:37:27,280
Does my music shut out
the rest of the world for you?

504
00:37:27,440 --> 00:37:32,200
- Yes. You play beautifully.
- You lie beautifully.

505
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:35,720
Thank you. That's more than I deserve.

506
00:37:36,440 --> 00:37:39,400
It's not half as much
as you deserve, my dear.

507
00:37:43,080 --> 00:37:45,040
- I'll see who it is.
- No, I'll tell you.

508
00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:46,440
Yes?

509
00:37:46,640 --> 00:37:49,320
- But you won't believe me.
- No, I won't. Who is it?

510
00:37:49,520 --> 00:37:52,760
Well, I might say that there is someone
at the wrong door...

511
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:57,160
...or the great romance of my life.

512
00:37:57,360 --> 00:38:00,400
The great romance of your life?
Charming.

513
00:38:01,640 --> 00:38:03,600
Well, it might have been.

514
00:38:15,600 --> 00:38:17,800
Let your godmother take your veil.

515
00:38:17,960 --> 00:38:22,120
Oh, no, just a moment.
I want one more look at her.

516
00:38:22,280 --> 00:38:25,520
The way she looked when she
made her first communion.

517
00:38:25,680 --> 00:38:30,280
God keep you always so pure
and happy, my child.

518
00:38:31,400 --> 00:38:33,640
Come, come and sit down.

519
00:38:46,080 --> 00:38:49,200
And now, children,
on this happy occasion...

520
00:38:49,360 --> 00:38:53,640
...I ask you all to rise and drink a toast
to the happiness of this family.

521
00:38:53,800 --> 00:38:56,200
- We certainly will, sir.
- Oh, of course, a toast.

522
00:38:56,400 --> 00:38:58,520
- To health and happiness.
- Health and happiness.

523
00:38:59,400 --> 00:39:04,480
Now may I propose the happiness of my
sister and my friend, Louise and Valentine...

524
00:39:04,640 --> 00:39:07,880
...who've known each other from childhood
and are soon to be man and wife.

525
00:39:08,080 --> 00:39:11,720
- Louise and Valentine.
- Thank you, thank you.

526
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:16,040
Now, Ma, you must go in for your nap.

527
00:39:16,200 --> 00:39:20,360
- Take my arm, Mama.
- Such a happy day.

528
00:39:22,640 --> 00:39:24,880
Well, my boy, I'm glad you got down...

529
00:39:25,040 --> 00:39:27,840
...even though you weren't in time
to go with us to the church.

530
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:30,040
I came for a purely selfish reason, Father.

531
00:39:30,200 --> 00:39:32,200
- You in debt?
- No, no, it isn't that.

532
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:33,800
In love?

533
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:36,360
- Wrong again.
- Well, what then?

534
00:39:36,560 --> 00:39:38,240
- I want to travel.
- Where?

535
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:39,760
Anywhere. Everywhere.

536
00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:42,320
I'm tired of waiting for the office
to give me a post.

537
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:45,160
If I ever do get one, the more I know
the world, the better.

538
00:39:45,320 --> 00:39:47,840
Well, it mightn't be a bad idea.

539
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:51,040
Your income won't let you go very far
in any great style.

540
00:39:51,200 --> 00:39:54,280
- I could use some of the principal.
- You will do nothing of the sort.

541
00:39:54,440 --> 00:39:57,480
Your grandfather's legacy
mustn't be touched.

542
00:39:57,680 --> 00:40:00,600
However, I have a few thousand francs
I can spare.

543
00:40:00,760 --> 00:40:04,640
- You mean, you'll give me the money?
- I don't know where else you'd get it.

544
00:40:04,840 --> 00:40:07,960
You're not such a bad son.
When do you want to start?

545
00:40:08,120 --> 00:40:11,080
At once. If I get back to Paris
tomorrow, the next morning.

546
00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:12,440
Well...

547
00:40:12,600 --> 00:40:14,640
Ready, Marguerite?

548
00:40:15,720 --> 00:40:18,960
But we planned to go to the theater.
Why aren't you dressed?

549
00:40:19,120 --> 00:40:22,400
- I've changed my mind, Prudence.
- Oh, come now, get dressed. I'll wait.

550
00:40:22,560 --> 00:40:26,080
No, no, no.
Look, how do you spell ""apology""?

551
00:40:26,240 --> 00:40:29,400
Good gracious, how should I know?
I'm no scholar.

552
00:40:29,560 --> 00:40:31,640
Even so, you've been living in Paris.

553
00:40:31,800 --> 00:40:34,120
Six years ago, I couldn't even
write my own name.

554
00:40:34,280 --> 00:40:36,440
Here's a letter which just came.

555
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:40,320
Perhaps Nanine knows how
to spell ""apology. ""

556
00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:43,840
She asked me that once before today.
Is it the same apology?

557
00:40:48,720 --> 00:40:51,520
Oh, don't bother. It isn't necessary now.

558
00:40:51,680 --> 00:40:56,840
If that young man has made you unhappy,
he's the one who should spell ""apology. ""

559
00:41:03,360 --> 00:41:05,600
It's all my fault.

560
00:41:05,880 --> 00:41:08,200
He's going away, Prudence.

561
00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:11,680
Stop your nonsense. He won't go.
They never do.

562
00:41:11,840 --> 00:41:15,640
No, I think he means it.
And perhaps it's better.

563
00:41:16,520 --> 00:41:18,640
But he had no right to write
such things to me.

564
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:21,520
Of course he didn't. Now, come along.
Let's go to the theater.

565
00:41:21,680 --> 00:41:25,080
But first you'll stop at his place
and find out if he's really going away.

566
00:41:31,680 --> 00:41:34,320
Why on earth does anyone
live four flights up?

567
00:41:34,480 --> 00:41:37,120
- You've come with a message.
- Yes, I've got to sit down...

568
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:38,600
...before I can talk.

569
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:40,720
- From Mademoiselle Gautier?
- Yes.

570
00:41:40,880 --> 00:41:42,280
Girl's a fool.

571
00:41:42,480 --> 00:41:45,400
She wants to know if you're really
starting out to see the world...

572
00:41:45,560 --> 00:41:47,040
...as you wrote her yesterday.

573
00:41:47,240 --> 00:41:50,560
- Yes, it's true. I'm leaving in the morning.
- Good.

574
00:41:50,720 --> 00:41:53,360
You and Marguerite are safer apart.

575
00:41:58,120 --> 00:42:00,960
Didn't I tell you to wait in the carriage?

576
00:42:03,520 --> 00:42:05,880
Oh, so you really are going away,
Armand Duval?

577
00:42:06,040 --> 00:42:07,320
Yes.

578
00:42:09,080 --> 00:42:11,240
Wait down in the carriage
yourself, Prudence.

579
00:42:11,400 --> 00:42:14,440
Oh, very well,
since I'm not wanted here.

580
00:42:15,640 --> 00:42:18,560
No, I think I'd better stay.

581
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:21,080
I think you'd better not.

582
00:42:24,640 --> 00:42:27,360
- Oh, don't!
- Haven't got much time if you want it back.

583
00:42:27,520 --> 00:42:30,400
Oh, don't. Don't, Marguerite.

584
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:36,480
Oh, what a girl. What a tease!

585
00:42:44,480 --> 00:42:46,960
You wrote me an unkind letter.

586
00:42:48,600 --> 00:42:51,360
What did you expect?
I saw the baron's carriage.

587
00:42:51,520 --> 00:42:54,040
- You were jealous.
- Of course.

588
00:42:55,920 --> 00:42:58,200
Well, then you do right in going away.

589
00:42:58,840 --> 00:43:01,760
Well, what does it matter
whether I go or stay?

590
00:43:02,640 --> 00:43:06,000
I played the fool again, and you've
probably been laughing at me ever since.

591
00:43:06,160 --> 00:43:08,360
I didn't laugh at all.

592
00:43:08,520 --> 00:43:13,160
I was angry because you dared write
such things to me, but I didn't laugh.

593
00:43:15,600 --> 00:43:18,320
You should have known
it was because I loved you.

594
00:43:22,040 --> 00:43:27,400
You know, once I had a little dog,
and he always looked sad when I was sad...

595
00:43:27,600 --> 00:43:29,800
...and I loved him so.

596
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:34,880
And when your tears fell on my hand,
I loved you too all at once.

597
00:43:36,560 --> 00:43:39,960
There are things that you wouldn't
understand, so that's why...

598
00:43:41,080 --> 00:43:43,000
Who's that pretty girl?

599
00:43:44,480 --> 00:43:46,440
My sister Louise.

600
00:43:47,440 --> 00:43:50,080
- And the other one?
- Another sister.

601
00:43:50,680 --> 00:43:53,600
- And that's your mother, isn't it?
- Yes.

602
00:43:53,920 --> 00:43:55,160
How happy she looks.

603
00:43:55,320 --> 00:43:57,960
- Does your father love her very much?
- Of course.

604
00:43:58,160 --> 00:44:00,360
Why, they must've been married
a long time.

605
00:44:00,520 --> 00:44:02,280
Nearly 30 years.

606
00:44:02,480 --> 00:44:05,000
And they loved each other
all that time?

607
00:44:05,680 --> 00:44:09,320
Yes. You sound as though
you didn't believe it.

608
00:44:10,800 --> 00:44:14,600
It's hard to believe that there's
such happiness in this world.

609
00:44:16,760 --> 00:44:18,600
Marguerite...

610
00:44:18,760 --> 00:44:21,440
...now you've put tears on my hand.

611
00:44:22,320 --> 00:44:23,720
Why?

612
00:44:25,960 --> 00:44:30,440
You will never love me 30 years.
No one will.

613
00:44:30,720 --> 00:44:34,360
I'll love you all my life.
I know that now.

614
00:44:34,800 --> 00:44:36,640
All my life.

615
00:44:40,800 --> 00:44:43,360
Sleepy head.

616
00:44:44,160 --> 00:44:47,320
I wasn't asleep. I was dreaming.

617
00:44:47,480 --> 00:44:50,120
- Yes?
- Of you.

618
00:44:50,680 --> 00:44:55,320
- And?
- We were in the country, alone, far away.

619
00:44:55,600 --> 00:44:57,520
I wish we were.

620
00:44:57,680 --> 00:45:01,560
- Marguerite, let me take you to the country.
- Yes.

621
00:45:01,720 --> 00:45:05,000
- Any day you like.
- I mean, let me take you for a long time.

622
00:45:05,160 --> 00:45:06,840
Until you're well and strong again.

623
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:09,560
- Oh, what nonsense.
- Why is it nonsense?

624
00:45:09,720 --> 00:45:12,800
- It costs money to go to the country.
- I have money.

625
00:45:12,960 --> 00:45:15,560
Yes, how much?

626
00:45:15,760 --> 00:45:17,960
Seven thousand francs a year.

627
00:45:18,400 --> 00:45:20,000
I spend more than that in a month...

628
00:45:20,160 --> 00:45:23,880
...and I have never been too particular
where it came from, as you probably know.

629
00:45:24,080 --> 00:45:26,800
- Don't say such things.
- Well, it's true.

630
00:45:28,160 --> 00:45:29,800
Give up the baron.

631
00:45:33,680 --> 00:45:36,120
I must give you up.

632
00:45:36,760 --> 00:45:39,760
I've told you before
that you should forget me.

633
00:45:39,920 --> 00:45:44,560
So you go on your trip around the world
and put me out of your mind.

634
00:45:47,080 --> 00:45:49,280
I thought I meant something to you.

635
00:45:49,560 --> 00:45:52,920
You mean too much already.

636
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:56,960
But you're young,
and your life is before you.

637
00:45:57,120 --> 00:45:58,960
You know what mine
has been already.

638
00:45:59,120 --> 00:46:02,440
- It doesn't matter.
- Doesn't it?

639
00:46:03,040 --> 00:46:04,760
Marguerite...

640
00:46:04,920 --> 00:46:07,840
...you need love more than
you need money just now.

641
00:46:08,040 --> 00:46:10,200
You need care even more than love.

642
00:46:10,360 --> 00:46:14,120
I can take such good care of you,
if you'll let me.

643
00:46:17,040 --> 00:46:19,560
You wouldn't be happy with me.

644
00:46:20,160 --> 00:46:21,560
No, probably not.

645
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:23,720
Nor you with me.

646
00:46:23,920 --> 00:46:26,000
I'll leave Paris today.

647
00:46:27,400 --> 00:46:30,960
I was...
I was only thinking of you, my dear.

648
00:46:31,120 --> 00:46:34,480
I wasn't thinking of myself, really.

649
00:46:37,360 --> 00:46:39,440
Then come to the country with me.

650
00:46:39,600 --> 00:46:43,080
Well, if I should, for a little while...

651
00:46:43,240 --> 00:46:46,800
...promise not to be jealous and not to think
things that'll make you miserable.

652
00:46:46,960 --> 00:46:48,080
Yes, I promise.

653
00:46:48,240 --> 00:46:50,920
- Swear?
- I swear not to be jealous if you...

654
00:46:51,120 --> 00:46:52,560
If...?

655
00:46:52,720 --> 00:46:55,760
- If you swear not to see the baron again.
- No, you see?

656
00:46:55,920 --> 00:46:59,080
- You will only torture yourself.
- But if you swear.

657
00:46:59,280 --> 00:47:02,120
One hour from now, you will ask me
to swear about something else.

658
00:47:02,280 --> 00:47:05,160
- You can't be sensible, Armand.
- It's true, I can't.

659
00:47:05,360 --> 00:47:08,840
- I want too much.
- So do I.

660
00:47:09,040 --> 00:47:14,160
How can one change one's entire life and
build a new one on one moment of love?

661
00:47:14,320 --> 00:47:17,280
And yet that's what you make me
want to close my eyes and do.

662
00:47:17,440 --> 00:47:21,120
Then close your eyes and say yes.
I command it.

663
00:47:21,280 --> 00:47:24,320
Yes. Yes. Yes.

664
00:47:30,320 --> 00:47:34,120
I'm going to tell him
that I love somebody else.

665
00:47:34,720 --> 00:47:36,840
I'm going to the country for the summer...

666
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:40,600
...and I'm never going to see him again.
- Are you crazy?

667
00:47:41,480 --> 00:47:43,960
You may be a fool, but I thought
you were an honest girl.

668
00:47:44,120 --> 00:47:47,080
It's because she's honest
she's telling the baron they're through.

669
00:47:47,280 --> 00:47:50,760
What about the money she owes?
Who's gonna pay it?

670
00:47:50,920 --> 00:47:53,440
I knew you'd ruin yourself
and everybody who trusted you.

671
00:47:53,600 --> 00:47:56,360
- How dare you say such things about her?
- It's true.

672
00:47:56,520 --> 00:48:00,920
Doesn't she owe me, me personally,
more than 17,000 francs?

673
00:48:01,080 --> 00:48:05,600
Do you think I'd let her leave Paris without
having the law on her unless she pays?

674
00:48:05,760 --> 00:48:07,880
I'm going to the country just the same.

675
00:48:08,080 --> 00:48:12,000
And what do you think will happen when
the rest of your creditors hear about it...

676
00:48:12,160 --> 00:48:14,800
...and come down on Armand Duval
for your debts?

677
00:48:14,960 --> 00:48:17,120
- They couldn't do that.
- Wait and see.

678
00:48:17,280 --> 00:48:21,280
They'll be after you in a pack.
A pretty holiday you'll have.

679
00:48:22,800 --> 00:48:26,440
Why can't anything ever be perfect once?

680
00:48:27,120 --> 00:48:29,080
What shall I do, Prudence?

681
00:48:29,240 --> 00:48:31,880
You can ask the baron
for money for your debts.

682
00:48:32,080 --> 00:48:35,560
- Now that I'm going to leave him?
- You don't have to tell him everything.

683
00:48:35,760 --> 00:48:39,400
She's right, Madame. If you've really set
your heart on going to the country...

684
00:48:39,560 --> 00:48:42,040
...you've got to get some money
from someone, somehow.

685
00:48:42,200 --> 00:48:45,120
What is the matter with you
anyway, Marguerite?

686
00:48:45,280 --> 00:48:49,200
Have you suddenly become
a sentimental schoolgirl?

687
00:48:50,800 --> 00:48:55,080
There's the baron now. The sooner
this matter's settled, the better.

688
00:48:57,840 --> 00:49:02,160
Oh, my dear baron, hail and farewell.

689
00:49:04,840 --> 00:49:07,920
I do hope you will encourage
this new plan of Marguerite's.

690
00:49:08,080 --> 00:49:10,960
A few months in the country would do
her a world of good.

691
00:49:11,120 --> 00:49:13,000
I know the doctor insists on it.

692
00:49:13,160 --> 00:49:14,760
- Really?
- Yes.

693
00:49:14,960 --> 00:49:18,240
- She'll tell you about it herself.
- I don't doubt it.

694
00:49:23,440 --> 00:49:24,960
Busy?

695
00:49:25,160 --> 00:49:26,880
Hello.

696
00:49:27,280 --> 00:49:29,760
Don't you think these accounts
are in a beautiful order?

697
00:49:29,920 --> 00:49:31,200
Beautiful.

698
00:49:31,360 --> 00:49:34,000
- Do you think me very businesslike?
- Very.

699
00:49:34,440 --> 00:49:36,080
But why?

700
00:49:36,520 --> 00:49:40,480
I decided that these bills ought to be paid.
I owe 40,000 francs.

701
00:49:40,800 --> 00:49:42,880
Will you lend me the money?

702
00:49:44,240 --> 00:49:45,640
No.

703
00:49:46,880 --> 00:49:49,960
Oh, but what will I do?

704
00:49:50,280 --> 00:49:54,160
Come to Russia with me, and you can
have as much money as you want.

705
00:49:55,280 --> 00:49:59,280
If you are my friend, why won't
you lend me the money anyway?

706
00:49:59,560 --> 00:50:02,400
Because then you might have
no further use for me.

707
00:50:05,920 --> 00:50:09,120
Well, I don't think you're very generous.

708
00:50:09,920 --> 00:50:13,040
Prudence tells me you plan to go
to the country this summer.

709
00:50:13,240 --> 00:50:15,080
Prudence is a chatterbox.

710
00:50:15,800 --> 00:50:18,840
Living quietly two or three months
in the country, alone...

711
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:22,160
...obeying your doctor's orders,
sounds an admirable idea.

712
00:50:22,320 --> 00:50:24,320
But extremely unlike you.

713
00:50:24,520 --> 00:50:27,720
- What can you do about it?
- I can deliberately put you out of my mind.

714
00:50:27,880 --> 00:50:29,040
Why should you?

715
00:50:29,200 --> 00:50:31,400
It's become a question
of either avoiding you...

716
00:50:31,600 --> 00:50:33,760
...or taking you
out of this life altogether.

717
00:50:33,920 --> 00:50:37,480
What will you do with me? Lock me in that
gloomy chateau you've got somewhere?

718
00:50:37,640 --> 00:50:39,240
I might.

719
00:50:42,920 --> 00:50:44,360
No one has to tell me...

720
00:50:44,520 --> 00:50:48,360
...you've found a playmate for this
rustic holiday of yours, it's in your face.

721
00:50:48,520 --> 00:50:50,760
But my consolation is...

722
00:50:50,960 --> 00:50:53,440
...I am well rid of such a fool.

723
00:50:54,560 --> 00:50:57,960
Here's the 40,000 francs you need.
But this is my last act of consideration.

724
00:50:58,120 --> 00:51:00,560
If ever we meet again,
it will be on a different basis.

725
00:51:00,720 --> 00:51:03,400
I never make the same mistake twice.

726
00:51:06,600 --> 00:51:07,920
Thank you.

727
00:51:40,560 --> 00:51:41,560
Quiet! Quiet!

728
00:51:51,160 --> 00:51:52,880
Let her sleep.

729
00:51:56,800 --> 00:51:58,880
Oh, no.

730
00:51:59,040 --> 00:52:02,360
You look after the other luggage.
I'll take care of these jewels myself.

731
00:52:02,520 --> 00:52:04,680
- Yes, Madame.
- Thank you.

732
00:52:08,120 --> 00:52:09,680
Not very big.

733
00:52:28,040 --> 00:52:31,840
- It's not very grand.
- It's heaven.

734
00:52:41,960 --> 00:52:45,480
- Madame, are you ill?
- No, why should I be ill?

735
00:52:45,640 --> 00:52:48,200
Because you're awake at this early hour
in the morning.

736
00:52:48,400 --> 00:52:51,560
I'm not ill. I'm awake
and I want to get up, Nanine.

737
00:52:51,720 --> 00:52:54,800
Am I dreaming? Are we really here?

738
00:52:54,960 --> 00:52:57,160
We are indeed.

739
00:52:57,320 --> 00:53:01,920
If I'm not mistaken, you'll soon wish you
were in your comfortable house in Paris.

740
00:53:02,080 --> 00:53:05,560
Monsieur Duval alone will see to that.
This place is nothing but a hut.

741
00:53:05,720 --> 00:53:09,320
There are no gaslights, and you have
to fetch water from a reservoir...

742
00:53:09,520 --> 00:53:11,280
...and heat it on a stove.

743
00:53:11,440 --> 00:53:13,800
You can't sleep at night
on account of the birds...

744
00:53:13,960 --> 00:53:18,120
...and before sunup, there was a big noise
like more birds, only worse.

745
00:53:18,280 --> 00:53:20,040
Chickens, I suppose.

746
00:53:20,200 --> 00:53:25,440
And as for that linen on the beds,
it's so coarse, I scratched all night.

747
00:53:25,600 --> 00:53:28,880
And I never slept better
in my life, Nanine.

748
00:53:29,040 --> 00:53:31,640
How far is it to the inn
where Monsieur Duval is staying?

749
00:53:31,800 --> 00:53:33,960
How should I know, Madame?

750
00:53:34,160 --> 00:53:36,360
Now, come, Nanine.

751
00:53:37,760 --> 00:53:40,520
He said he'd be over early this morning.

752
00:53:41,080 --> 00:53:43,600
And I'm so hungry too.

753
00:53:47,080 --> 00:53:51,560
What delicious air.
What a heavenly room.

754
00:53:51,920 --> 00:53:54,600
Good heavens, you scared me!
Can't you knock properly?

755
00:53:54,760 --> 00:53:56,240
Not when I've got me hands full.

756
00:53:56,400 --> 00:53:58,760
A wooden shoe makes a better noise
than your knuckles.

757
00:53:58,920 --> 00:54:00,520
- Good morning, Madame.
- Good morning.

758
00:54:00,680 --> 00:54:03,400
The gentleman said you were
to have milk for your breakfast.

759
00:54:03,560 --> 00:54:05,520
Madame likes coffee for her breakfast.

760
00:54:05,680 --> 00:54:09,360
No, no, Nanine. Up in the country,
I like milk better.

761
00:54:09,760 --> 00:54:14,440
At 10:00, when it's time to have another
bite, I'll do you a couple of nice, fresh eggs.

762
00:54:14,640 --> 00:54:16,680
- What kind of cows do you keep?
- Jersey.

763
00:54:16,840 --> 00:54:20,000
I thought so, they give the best milk.
What do you feed them?

764
00:54:20,160 --> 00:54:22,760
Plenty of red clover, hay and bran mash.

765
00:54:22,920 --> 00:54:25,440
That's silly. The cows get
all the grass they need now.

766
00:54:25,600 --> 00:54:27,680
The thing is not to let them
run their feet off.

767
00:54:27,840 --> 00:54:30,720
- If they want to, you've got to let them run.
- Oh, no, you don't.

768
00:54:30,880 --> 00:54:34,960
I'll take them out walking myself someday,
and I'll show you how to manage them.

769
00:54:44,840 --> 00:54:48,600
- Tired?
- Only nicely tired.

770
00:54:49,200 --> 00:54:52,360
Let's go as far as the top of the hill
and see what's beyond.

771
00:54:52,520 --> 00:54:54,120
Yes.

772
00:54:57,640 --> 00:55:00,640
I don't care what's behind, do you?

773
00:55:00,840 --> 00:55:02,480
No.

774
00:55:07,440 --> 00:55:09,000
Look!

775
00:55:11,680 --> 00:55:14,160
Oh, what a fine sight in this light.

776
00:55:14,320 --> 00:55:17,160
- It looks like a castle of a king.
- Yes.

777
00:55:17,880 --> 00:55:20,120
When I was a little girl,
I always wanted to see...

778
00:55:20,280 --> 00:55:22,600
...what a great chateau
would look like inside.

779
00:55:24,080 --> 00:55:26,240
You are tired.

780
00:55:26,400 --> 00:55:29,760
I'm not used to long country walks yet.

781
00:55:31,240 --> 00:55:33,000
Hello!

782
00:55:36,680 --> 00:55:39,000
- Good evening.
- Good evening, monsieur.

783
00:55:39,160 --> 00:55:41,680
- Are you going any distance?
- As far as the village.

784
00:55:41,840 --> 00:55:45,520
- Good. Could you drive us part of the way?
- With pleasure, monsieur.

785
00:55:45,680 --> 00:55:47,720
- Madame.
- Thank you.

786
00:55:47,920 --> 00:55:50,960
We went much further than we realized.

787
00:55:58,120 --> 00:55:59,880
By the way, whose chateau is that?

788
00:56:00,040 --> 00:56:04,680
You must be strangers here, or you'd know
it belongs to my master, Baron de Varville.

789
00:56:25,680 --> 00:56:27,600
Nanine? Nanine.

790
00:56:27,760 --> 00:56:30,520
Put the pail down.
I'll carry it for you in a moment.

791
00:56:31,640 --> 00:56:34,160
- Hasn't any letter come for me yet?
- No, Madame.

792
00:56:34,320 --> 00:56:37,280
Take this book, and if it comes while
I am with Monsieur Armand...

793
00:56:37,440 --> 00:56:39,520
...put it in the leaves
and send the book by Jacques.

794
00:56:39,680 --> 00:56:42,640
- Very well.
- Armand must not know about this.

795
00:56:42,800 --> 00:56:44,240
Yes, Madame.

796
00:56:44,400 --> 00:56:47,160
Oh, give me the book.
I'll explain to Jacques myself.

797
00:56:49,920 --> 00:56:54,240
- She has some good reason, monsieur.
- Yes, I'm sure of that.

798
00:56:57,880 --> 00:56:59,800
Oh, there you are.

799
00:56:59,960 --> 00:57:02,560
Isn't it the most beautiful day?

800
00:57:03,400 --> 00:57:05,160
Is it so beautiful?

801
00:57:06,480 --> 00:57:09,200
Well, the birds have noticed it.

802
00:57:11,200 --> 00:57:14,440
- Why so silent?
- Why not?

803
00:57:15,320 --> 00:57:16,960
Let's sit down here.

804
00:57:22,600 --> 00:57:26,640
How good the earth smells.
Better than any perfume.

805
00:57:28,880 --> 00:57:32,640
Look, I found a four-leaf clover.
My first good luck.

806
00:57:32,800 --> 00:57:37,480
When I was little, I used to hunt for them,
thinking they would change everything.

807
00:57:38,440 --> 00:57:40,520
Why so gloomy?

808
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:43,080
If you'll smile, I'll give it to you.

809
00:57:43,240 --> 00:57:45,920
- No, you keep it, it's yours.
- Excuse me.

810
00:57:46,080 --> 00:57:50,120
- This is the book Madame was looking for...
- Oh, yes, thank you, Jacques.

811
00:57:51,200 --> 00:57:54,560
<i>- So you're reading Manon Lescaut after all.
- Yes.</i>

812
00:57:54,760 --> 00:57:57,240
- No, I won't let you.
- Why not?

813
00:57:57,400 --> 00:58:00,240
Because she was unscrupulous
and faithless, a liar and a cheat.

814
00:58:00,400 --> 00:58:02,960
Well, you used to like her.
She loved him just the same.

815
00:58:03,120 --> 00:58:05,600
He was no better than she
to share her love with others.

816
00:58:05,800 --> 00:58:08,520
- Beggars can't be choosers.
- She shouldn't love a poor man.

817
00:58:08,680 --> 00:58:10,520
You're hurting me.

818
00:58:10,760 --> 00:58:12,480
Give me that book.

819
00:58:15,560 --> 00:58:17,480
Here's the letter you were expecting.

820
00:58:17,680 --> 00:58:19,240
Read it.

821
00:58:29,640 --> 00:58:31,560
You've been selling your jewelry.

822
00:58:31,720 --> 00:58:36,560
Only a ring. So Nichette can have
a wedding dress and a small dowry.

823
00:58:37,200 --> 00:58:38,800
Forgive me.

824
00:58:40,480 --> 00:58:44,960
- Don't I always when you are jealous?
- You're an angel.

825
00:58:48,520 --> 00:58:50,600
Why don't we give Nichette
a real wedding here.

826
00:58:51,560 --> 00:58:53,000
- May I?
- Of course.

827
00:58:53,320 --> 00:58:56,440
Let's write Nichette this moment
and tell her we'll give her a wedding.

828
00:58:56,600 --> 00:58:59,040
- Will you come and spell the hard words?
- Yes.

829
00:59:30,640 --> 00:59:31,800
Amen.

830
00:59:31,960 --> 00:59:35,880
- ""With this ring, I thee wed. ""
- With this ring, I thee wed.

831
00:59:36,040 --> 00:59:40,000
- ""And I plight unto thee my troth. ""
- And I plight unto thee my troth.

832
00:59:42,720 --> 00:59:43,680
Amen.

833
00:59:43,880 --> 00:59:47,880
- ""With this ring, I thee wed. ""
- With this ring, I thee wed.

834
00:59:48,040 --> 00:59:52,040
- ""And I plight unto thee my troth. ""
- And I plight unto thee my troth.

835
00:59:54,760 --> 00:59:55,920
Amen.

836
01:00:06,280 --> 01:00:08,920
Congratulations, my boy!

837
01:00:09,080 --> 01:00:13,120
My dear! Oh, what a pity all Paris
can't see that dress.

838
01:00:13,280 --> 01:00:15,760
It's the prettiest one
we've ever turned out of the shop.

839
01:00:15,920 --> 01:00:18,040
- Oh, congratulations, my dear.
- Thank you.

840
01:00:18,200 --> 01:00:21,120
Why is everybody crying?

841
01:00:22,280 --> 01:00:27,480
Wasn't it beautiful?
Wasn't it all beautiful?

842
01:00:29,160 --> 01:00:32,520
- Who are you?
- I'm the butcher, Madame.

843
01:00:35,240 --> 01:00:37,400
Darling Marguerite.

844
01:00:38,120 --> 01:00:41,640
- Oh, thank you. Thank you so much.
- My little Nichette.

845
01:00:41,800 --> 01:00:45,160
You've made me feel like a princess
with a fine wedding gown...

846
01:00:45,320 --> 01:00:49,200
...and a dowry and such
a beautiful, beautiful wedding.

847
01:00:49,360 --> 01:00:53,320
- I must kiss the bride too.
- And I, the happy bridegroom.

848
01:01:09,400 --> 01:01:13,320
- Ready at last. Come along, come along.
- Don't hurry me.

849
01:01:16,520 --> 01:01:19,080
Wine used to go to my head
and make me gay...

850
01:01:19,240 --> 01:01:22,120
...and now it goes to my legs
and makes me old.

851
01:01:22,280 --> 01:01:23,840
- Get along, get along.
- Goodbye.

852
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:25,440
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

853
01:01:35,280 --> 01:01:38,440
What did you and Prudence have
your heads together about so long?

854
01:01:38,640 --> 01:01:40,400
I won't tell you yet.

855
01:01:40,560 --> 01:01:43,360
Of course, she thinks you're a fool
for wasting yourself on me.

856
01:01:43,520 --> 01:01:44,920
Perhaps you are.

857
01:01:45,080 --> 01:01:47,840
What did Gaston mean by
""an appointment you'd lost""?

858
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:50,640
Nothing. Some chap was given
a post by the foreign office...

859
01:01:50,800 --> 01:01:52,680
...that Gaston seemed to think I wanted.

860
01:01:52,840 --> 01:01:55,000
- Are you sure you didn't?
- Yes, quite sure.

861
01:01:55,160 --> 01:01:57,320
It meant my leaving France.

862
01:01:57,800 --> 01:02:00,680
Shall we...? Shall we go inside?

863
01:02:01,560 --> 01:02:03,880
We might go to the top of the hill.

864
01:02:04,040 --> 01:02:07,360
- Look at the baron's chateau?
- No.

865
01:02:07,520 --> 01:02:10,280
Are you going to spoil a day like this
by being jealous?

866
01:02:10,440 --> 01:02:13,000
No, of course not. Only...

867
01:02:13,160 --> 01:02:15,400
...I always know he's there.

868
01:02:15,560 --> 01:02:17,800
But I'm always here.

869
01:02:20,880 --> 01:02:23,240
Don't ever leave me.

870
01:02:25,160 --> 01:02:27,000
I never will.

871
01:02:27,600 --> 01:02:29,240
But you...

872
01:02:30,760 --> 01:02:33,920
- I can't bear our summer to end, Marguerite.
- Nor I.

873
01:02:34,080 --> 01:02:38,360
- Could you go on living like this?
- I couldn't live any other way now.

874
01:02:38,520 --> 01:02:42,400
Listen, I've written my father,
asking him to turn my money over to me.

875
01:02:42,560 --> 01:02:45,920
- Oh, why?
- So I can make plans for our future.

876
01:02:46,080 --> 01:02:49,720
And you won't have to live in two rooms
five flights up like Nichette either.

877
01:02:49,880 --> 01:02:52,800
You'll have a little house
in the garden, all your own.

878
01:02:52,960 --> 01:02:56,520
I'm leaving for Paris tomorrow to see
the lawyer who made my grandfather's will.

879
01:02:57,360 --> 01:03:00,360
- Do you know what I asked Prudence to do?
- No, what?

880
01:03:00,520 --> 01:03:02,440
Sell everything, pay everything.

881
01:03:02,600 --> 01:03:05,320
So I could take a flat like Nichette's
with what I have left.

882
01:03:05,480 --> 01:03:07,720
Really? You mean you'd give up
everything for me?

883
01:03:07,880 --> 01:03:10,880
Everything in the world. Everything.

884
01:03:14,800 --> 01:03:19,200
Never be jealous again. Never doubt
that I love you more than the world...

885
01:03:19,400 --> 01:03:21,760
...more than myself.

886
01:03:22,600 --> 01:03:24,280
Then...

887
01:03:25,200 --> 01:03:26,920
...marry me.

888
01:03:29,760 --> 01:03:32,480
- What?
- I married you today.

889
01:03:32,640 --> 01:03:35,240
Every word the priest said
was meant for us...

890
01:03:35,400 --> 01:03:38,200
...and in my heart,
I made all of the vows to you.

891
01:03:38,920 --> 01:03:41,760
- And I to you.
- Then...

892
01:03:41,920 --> 01:03:45,640
No, no. That isn't fitting.
Let me love you. Let me live for you.

893
01:03:45,800 --> 01:03:48,520
Don't let me ask any more
from heaven than that.

894
01:03:48,680 --> 01:03:51,200
God might get angry.

895
01:03:58,840 --> 01:04:02,640
Oh, why does anybody want
to keep bees, anyhow? They're so fickle.

896
01:04:02,800 --> 01:04:04,520
If they want to fly away, let them.

897
01:04:04,680 --> 01:04:06,960
They'll fly away when they
get the swarming fever...

898
01:04:07,120 --> 01:04:09,600
...unless we make so much noise
they settle down again.

899
01:04:09,760 --> 01:04:11,960
They're going to settle in that tree.
Look.

900
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:19,400
Every time I eat a mouthful of honey,
I'll think what loons we look doing this.

901
01:04:19,560 --> 01:04:21,640
Who knows the bee song?
All together now.

902
01:04:46,120 --> 01:04:50,120
Please don't think us mad, monsieur.
Did you want to see someone?

903
01:04:50,280 --> 01:04:52,480
- Mademoiselle Gautier?
- Yes.

904
01:04:52,640 --> 01:04:55,560
I was told at the inn
that I'd find my son here.

905
01:04:55,720 --> 01:04:58,320
- Your son?
- Armand Duval.

906
01:05:02,920 --> 01:05:07,800
Yes, Armand Duval is very often here,
but he's in Paris today.

907
01:05:08,960 --> 01:05:11,280
- Do you wish to come in?
- Thank you.

908
01:05:18,240 --> 01:05:20,800
I'm sorry your son isn't here, monsieur.

909
01:05:20,960 --> 01:05:22,600
Well, it's just as well.

910
01:05:22,760 --> 01:05:27,040
I didn't look forward to seeing him
with any pleasure, under the circumstances.

911
01:05:27,240 --> 01:05:31,760
As a matter of fact, I'm glad to be able
to talk to you directly and frankly.

912
01:05:31,920 --> 01:05:34,600
You see, I know
what's been going on here.

913
01:05:34,760 --> 01:05:37,720
You don't think me worthy of your son.
You're right, I'm not.

914
01:05:37,880 --> 01:05:40,800
No. No woman is worthy
of a man's love...

915
01:05:41,000 --> 01:05:45,520
...who's willing to let him ruin himself
for her, as you're doing.

916
01:05:45,680 --> 01:05:48,480
I don't know what you've heard,
but it isn't true.

917
01:05:48,640 --> 01:05:50,240
Armand has told me himself...

918
01:05:50,400 --> 01:05:54,560
...that he wants to take his modest fortune
out of my hands at once.

919
01:05:54,720 --> 01:05:56,960
The reason is obvious, isn't it?

920
01:05:57,120 --> 01:06:00,240
Can you deny he wants the money
for you?

921
01:06:01,360 --> 01:06:04,720
Whatever the reason, I hope
you won't let him have it, monsieur.

922
01:06:07,120 --> 01:06:09,320
I wish I could believe you were sincere.

923
01:06:10,440 --> 01:06:13,480
A few years ago,
I lived on bread and soup.

924
01:06:13,640 --> 01:06:16,240
I can manage very well without
taking anything from Armand.

925
01:06:16,400 --> 01:06:21,960
I still say what I came here to say.
This thing must end at once.

926
01:06:22,120 --> 01:06:24,840
You might as well
save your breath, monsieur.

927
01:06:27,320 --> 01:06:30,600
How long have you
known Armand, Madame?

928
01:06:30,760 --> 01:06:33,000
Three months and 12 days, monsieur.

929
01:06:33,160 --> 01:06:38,120
Three months and 12 days. And how long
do you expect this thing to last?

930
01:06:39,000 --> 01:06:40,960
You have never known love
to last, monsieur?

931
01:06:41,160 --> 01:06:44,000
Never, when it was
unsanctified by marriage...

932
01:06:44,160 --> 01:06:47,040
...unblessed by children or social ties.

933
01:06:47,240 --> 01:06:50,680
I shall love Armand always, and I
believe he shall love me always too.

934
01:06:50,840 --> 01:06:52,360
- Always, eh?
- Always.

935
01:06:52,520 --> 01:06:56,480
Hasn't your own experience taught you
the human heart can't be trusted?

936
01:06:56,640 --> 01:07:00,040
I think I know my own heart
better than you can, monsieur.

937
01:07:00,200 --> 01:07:02,200
And I can trust it not to change.

938
01:07:02,360 --> 01:07:07,040
No woman, unprotected as you are, can
afford to give the best years of her life...

939
01:07:07,200 --> 01:07:10,400
...to a man who, when he leaves her,
will leave her with nothing...

940
01:07:10,560 --> 01:07:13,800
...and who is certain to leave her
in the end.

941
01:07:14,440 --> 01:07:18,080
I don't suppose you can understand
how any woman...

942
01:07:18,240 --> 01:07:23,720
...unprotected, as you say I am,
can be lifted above self-interest...

943
01:07:23,880 --> 01:07:27,280
...by a sentiment so delicate and pure
that she feels only humiliation...

944
01:07:27,440 --> 01:07:28,920
...when you speak of such things.

945
01:07:30,280 --> 01:07:34,160
I realize now that you
do love him unselfishly.

946
01:07:34,320 --> 01:07:36,840
But even so, I say it can't go on.

947
01:07:37,000 --> 01:07:39,480
- But it will go on!
- Armand is a young man...

948
01:07:39,640 --> 01:07:42,360
...with his way to make,
with a career waiting for him.

949
01:07:42,520 --> 01:07:45,960
And in his case, he can't serve
his best interests by being tied...

950
01:07:46,120 --> 01:07:50,680
...to a woman he can't present
to his family or his friends.

951
01:07:51,240 --> 01:07:54,080
- Armand is no different than other men.
- Oh, come, Madame.

952
01:07:54,240 --> 01:07:56,960
Be honest.
Haven't you found him different?

953
01:07:57,120 --> 01:08:00,600
Haven't you found him
more sensitive, more loyal?

954
01:08:00,760 --> 01:08:04,120
Or am I prejudiced
because I'm his father?

955
01:08:04,520 --> 01:08:07,680
No. No, no. Armand is different.

956
01:08:07,840 --> 01:08:13,360
And so you see, as long as Armand loves
you, he'll not enter rooms that you can't.

957
01:08:13,520 --> 01:08:17,000
But a man can go back.
He can always go back.

958
01:08:17,880 --> 01:08:19,440
Monsieur...

959
01:08:19,600 --> 01:08:23,160
...suppose I told you I have a feeling
I shan't live very long?

960
01:08:23,320 --> 01:08:27,800
Well, then I'd scold you for being fanciful
and a little foolish.

961
01:08:28,120 --> 01:08:31,520
What you probably feel
is the melancholy of happiness...

962
01:08:31,680 --> 01:08:34,440
...that mood that comes over
all of us when we realize...

963
01:08:34,600 --> 01:08:38,560
...that even love can't remain
at flood tide forever.

964
01:08:38,760 --> 01:08:42,760
- Without Armand, I'm doomed.
- With him, you're both doomed.

965
01:08:42,920 --> 01:08:46,400
Without a profession of any sort,
what can he do?

966
01:08:46,560 --> 01:08:49,280
Unless he sinks so low
he's willing to let some other man...

967
01:08:49,440 --> 01:08:51,280
...foot the bills for his life with you.

968
01:08:51,440 --> 01:08:53,400
You don't know Armand.
You wouldn't say that.

969
01:08:53,560 --> 01:08:57,320
No one knows the man he might become
if he loses his self-respect.

970
01:08:57,480 --> 01:09:01,440
But I think that's too high
a price to pay, even for love.

971
01:09:01,600 --> 01:09:06,040
I want Armand to enjoy life,
not to be sacrificed to it.

972
01:09:06,200 --> 01:09:10,840
You see, my son is as dear to me
as he possibly can be to you.

973
01:09:11,360 --> 01:09:14,160
Yes, but you have others
who are dear to you.

974
01:09:14,320 --> 01:09:17,160
I have only Armand.

975
01:09:17,960 --> 01:09:20,400
You don't know how I've changed.

976
01:09:20,560 --> 01:09:25,360
And he taught me that love is not
always selfish, nor goodness dull...

977
01:09:25,520 --> 01:09:30,480
...nor men faithless. No, no. You can't
expect me to give up such love as his.

978
01:09:30,640 --> 01:09:32,280
Think what's best for him.

979
01:09:32,560 --> 01:09:35,880
Think what you'd want for him
if he were your own son.

980
01:09:36,440 --> 01:09:40,440
Then think how you're killing
his right to a normal life.

981
01:09:40,600 --> 01:09:44,960
Try to realize that everything
you're ashamed of in your own past...

982
01:09:45,120 --> 01:09:47,920
...would only taint his future.

983
01:09:48,080 --> 01:09:51,560
You tell me that you love him.
I believe you.

984
01:09:51,720 --> 01:09:56,000
That's why I'm able to stand here,
a man who's getting old...

985
01:09:56,200 --> 01:09:58,840
...and ask this great sacrifice of you...

986
01:09:59,000 --> 01:10:03,000
...as humbly as I'd ask
a great favor of a queen.

987
01:10:03,160 --> 01:10:08,840
I can give you nothing in return,
except my thanks and my respect.

988
01:10:09,000 --> 01:10:11,560
Please give him up.

989
01:10:14,120 --> 01:10:19,120
- What shall I do?
- Talk to him. Tell him he must leave you.

990
01:10:19,280 --> 01:10:22,480
- I have talked.
- Leave him.

991
01:10:22,760 --> 01:10:25,960
- He'd follow me.
- Tell him you don't love him.

992
01:10:26,120 --> 01:10:28,040
He wouldn't believe me.

993
01:10:33,000 --> 01:10:34,680
No.

994
01:10:34,840 --> 01:10:37,520
I know only one way.

995
01:10:38,160 --> 01:10:40,920
But I shan't tell you what it is.

996
01:10:42,520 --> 01:10:45,000
I knew I was too happy.

997
01:10:45,160 --> 01:10:47,240
What are you going to do?

998
01:10:48,400 --> 01:10:50,880
Don't let yourself think of it.

999
01:10:51,240 --> 01:10:53,480
I'll send him back to you tonight.

1000
01:10:53,640 --> 01:10:56,680
How can I ever repay you
for all you're doing for me?

1001
01:11:00,320 --> 01:11:02,720
Make no mistake, monsieur.

1002
01:11:02,920 --> 01:11:06,520
Whatever I do, it's nothing for you.

1003
01:11:06,680 --> 01:11:10,080
- It's all for Armand.
- I thank you just the same.

1004
01:11:10,280 --> 01:11:15,760
And I shall never forget
what I and my family owe you.

1005
01:11:29,760 --> 01:11:33,880
Goodbye, monsieur.
Don't reproach yourself.

1006
01:11:34,040 --> 01:11:37,320
You've done only what Armand's father
should have done.

1007
01:11:37,480 --> 01:11:40,840
Only, don't let him know it.
He might hate you.

1008
01:11:41,000 --> 01:11:43,200
And I don't want that to happen...

1009
01:11:43,360 --> 01:11:48,280
...because he shall need all the courage
and comfort you can give him...

1010
01:11:48,440 --> 01:11:51,440
...for a long time, I think.

1011
01:11:53,960 --> 01:11:57,400
God bless you, Marguerite Gautier.

1012
01:12:20,440 --> 01:12:22,400
Did the gentleman go?

1013
01:12:23,520 --> 01:12:25,720
But, Madame, what's the matter?

1014
01:12:28,080 --> 01:12:33,800
I want you to take this letter
and give it to Baron de Varville yourself.

1015
01:12:33,960 --> 01:12:37,880
But I thought you were so happy
at last with Monsieur Duval.

1016
01:12:38,040 --> 01:12:39,880
I was.

1017
01:12:40,040 --> 01:12:41,280
I don't know what's in it...

1018
01:12:41,440 --> 01:12:44,760
...but I know the very thought
of this one makes you shudder.

1019
01:12:44,920 --> 01:12:47,600
Are you sure you want me to take it?

1020
01:12:47,760 --> 01:12:52,680
Yes, yes. Go now, Nanine.
And pray for me.

1021
01:12:52,840 --> 01:12:56,640
Pray for me that I'll have the strength
to go through with what I have to do.

1022
01:12:56,800 --> 01:13:02,520
Oh, your hands are like ice, child.
Tell Nanine what you're going to do.

1023
01:13:03,640 --> 01:13:07,200
Make my love hate me.
Make him hate me.

1024
01:13:07,360 --> 01:13:09,680
Oh, God help me.

1025
01:13:33,320 --> 01:13:35,760
Hello. I'm back.

1026
01:13:36,360 --> 01:13:38,640
Oh, I didn't hear you drive up.

1027
01:13:53,320 --> 01:13:56,040
Why are you all dressed up?
Not going to a ball, are you?

1028
01:13:56,200 --> 01:14:00,720
No. I wish I were. You don't know
of any balls I might be asked to, do you?

1029
01:14:00,880 --> 01:14:04,040
- If you're serious, I brought an invitation.
- Really?

1030
01:14:04,200 --> 01:14:07,800
From Olympe. There's a new gambling club
opening. She suggests we go together.

1031
01:14:07,960 --> 01:14:09,160
Where did you see Olympe?

1032
01:14:09,320 --> 01:14:12,640
She dropped in the shop while I was
talking to Prudence about your affairs.

1033
01:14:12,840 --> 01:14:15,120
I didn't ask you to discuss my affairs
with Prudence.

1034
01:14:15,280 --> 01:14:17,680
And I did ask her not
to talk to you about them.

1035
01:14:17,840 --> 01:14:21,080
Marguerite, you're angry.

1036
01:14:21,600 --> 01:14:23,520
Do you realize that
we're almost quarreling?

1037
01:14:23,720 --> 01:14:27,840
Well, everybody quarrels.
It keeps people from getting bored.

1038
01:14:28,680 --> 01:14:30,720
Something happened today.

1039
01:14:31,720 --> 01:14:33,960
What was it? I want the truth.

1040
01:14:34,440 --> 01:14:37,920
Well, this morning,
the bees left the hive...

1041
01:14:38,120 --> 01:14:39,680
...and we had to bring them back.

1042
01:14:39,880 --> 01:14:42,160
This afternoon, I washed my hair.

1043
01:14:42,320 --> 01:14:45,160
Those are the two exciting events
of my day.

1044
01:14:45,440 --> 01:14:48,200
The first time I leave you,
you change completely.

1045
01:14:48,360 --> 01:14:50,280
I come back to you happy,
with good news.

1046
01:14:50,440 --> 01:14:53,800
What do you call good news?
Have you been left a large fortune?

1047
01:14:53,960 --> 01:14:56,480
No, but I find I can do
as I please with my small one.

1048
01:14:56,680 --> 01:14:58,840
Well, don't you touch it.

1049
01:14:59,160 --> 01:15:02,440
Why, you'll be rich one month
and then have nothing.

1050
01:15:04,720 --> 01:15:07,840
If that's what you're afraid of,
you needn't worry.

1051
01:15:08,840 --> 01:15:13,000
We have something better to do than play
at being rich, even for a month.

1052
01:15:13,160 --> 01:15:16,480
Nichette and Gustave are already
looking for a house for us.

1053
01:15:17,280 --> 01:15:19,920
They're the sort of people
that think two rooms wonderful...

1054
01:15:20,080 --> 01:15:24,280
...three rooms a mansion,
and more than four rooms wicked.

1055
01:15:26,480 --> 01:15:28,120
What's the matter?

1056
01:15:29,960 --> 01:15:31,920
That's what I'm wondering.

1057
01:15:36,600 --> 01:15:38,840
Oh, darling, darling.

1058
01:15:40,200 --> 01:15:42,720
I'd begun to think you didn't love me.

1059
01:15:45,800 --> 01:15:48,240
Perhaps I don't really.

1060
01:15:48,680 --> 01:15:53,240
Yet only last night you were ready
to give up everything for me.

1061
01:15:53,400 --> 01:15:55,280
Well, that was last night, you know.

1062
01:15:55,440 --> 01:15:58,200
People say things they don't mean
sometimes at night.

1063
01:15:59,600 --> 01:16:04,360
Well, life is something besides kisses
and promises in the moonlight.

1064
01:16:05,200 --> 01:16:06,800
Even you should know that.

1065
01:16:11,720 --> 01:16:13,200
Yes.

1066
01:16:14,920 --> 01:16:17,120
Wasn't one summer all you wanted?

1067
01:16:23,400 --> 01:16:25,560
So you're going to leave me.

1068
01:16:27,760 --> 01:16:29,160
Yes.

1069
01:16:37,200 --> 01:16:41,040
- I could kill you for this.
- I'm not worth killing, Armand.

1070
01:16:41,200 --> 01:16:44,200
I've loved you as much as I could love.

1071
01:16:44,600 --> 01:16:46,760
If that wasn't enough...

1072
01:16:47,880 --> 01:16:51,560
...I'm not to blame.
We don't make our own hearts.

1073
01:16:52,280 --> 01:16:53,760
I guess that's...

1074
01:16:54,280 --> 01:16:56,040
That's true.

1075
01:16:57,440 --> 01:17:02,320
You're no more to blame because yours
can be faithful only a few weeks...

1076
01:17:02,480 --> 01:17:06,600
...than I am because mine
will be faithful as long as I live.

1077
01:17:08,400 --> 01:17:11,120
Yes, that's how it is.

1078
01:17:13,400 --> 01:17:17,200
It's as if one of us had died,
Marguerite, suddenly or I dreamed it.

1079
01:17:19,200 --> 01:17:20,840
Where are you going?

1080
01:17:21,320 --> 01:17:24,400
Baron de Varville is expecting me.

1081
01:17:28,240 --> 01:17:31,680
At last I shall see what a great chateau
looks like inside.

1082
01:18:19,520 --> 01:18:21,480
Marguerite.

1083
01:18:52,360 --> 01:18:56,320
And this, Madame, is the newest and finest
of all the private gambling clubs in Paris.

1084
01:18:56,480 --> 01:18:57,760
I hope you're impressed.

1085
01:18:57,920 --> 01:19:01,400
Must be a pleasure to lose money in such
a charming place. I wonder who's here.

1086
01:19:01,560 --> 01:19:04,120
Everyone who's anything to lose,
or nothing.

1087
01:19:07,720 --> 01:19:11,120
Am I dreaming, or do I see
a flock of birds?

1088
01:19:12,000 --> 01:19:13,440
No, it's Olympe.

1089
01:19:16,160 --> 01:19:21,120
- Hello, darling. Good evening, general.
- Good evening, general.

1090
01:19:24,800 --> 01:19:26,320
Would anybody like an omelet?

1091
01:19:26,480 --> 01:19:29,760
Stop that, you nasty thing.
Pardon us. The general wants to play.

1092
01:19:29,920 --> 01:19:32,040
So nice to have seen you.

1093
01:19:32,680 --> 01:19:36,960
- Well, what I could say about that one.
- There's Armand Duval.

1094
01:19:37,480 --> 01:19:40,760
Armand, my boy.

1095
01:19:41,320 --> 01:19:42,720
Hello, Prudence.

1096
01:19:42,880 --> 01:19:46,680
- How well you're looking.
- I return the compliment.

1097
01:19:46,840 --> 01:19:50,320
I... I think I ought to warn you.

1098
01:19:50,520 --> 01:19:53,800
Marguerite is coming here tonight
with the baron.

1099
01:19:53,960 --> 01:19:55,360
Well...

1100
01:19:56,360 --> 01:19:58,200
These things can't last forever.

1101
01:19:58,360 --> 01:20:01,640
Your little adventure was costing
Marguerite more than she could afford.

1102
01:20:01,800 --> 01:20:04,920
- It cost her nothing.
- Oh, what a child you are.

1103
01:20:05,080 --> 01:20:08,840
Who do you think furnished the money
for Marguerite's debts before she left Paris?

1104
01:20:09,000 --> 01:20:11,720
What do you think would've happened if
she hadn't left you...

1105
01:20:11,880 --> 01:20:13,400
...when her money was gone?

1106
01:20:13,680 --> 01:20:15,200
And now?

1107
01:20:15,840 --> 01:20:18,880
The baron has promised
to put her affairs in perfect order.

1108
01:20:19,040 --> 01:20:20,520
Good.

1109
01:20:21,040 --> 01:20:23,560
Then you don't really hold it against her?

1110
01:20:23,720 --> 01:20:28,880
No, why should I? The past is dead.
Heaven rest its soul, if it had one.

1111
01:20:29,320 --> 01:20:32,440
You have more sense
than I gave you credit for.

1112
01:20:32,600 --> 01:20:34,200
Hello.

1113
01:20:34,880 --> 01:20:36,240
- Armand.
- Hello, Charles.

1114
01:20:36,400 --> 01:20:37,640
- Hello, Gaston.
- Hello.

1115
01:20:37,800 --> 01:20:40,120
Well, when did you get back to Pa...?

1116
01:20:41,000 --> 01:20:42,160
To Paris?

1117
01:21:05,480 --> 01:21:07,560
You've dropped your fan.

1118
01:21:10,360 --> 01:21:12,800
I said, you've dropped your fan.

1119
01:21:22,280 --> 01:21:26,760
- I don't feel well. I'd like to go home.
- I insist on your staying. Come.

1120
01:21:34,760 --> 01:21:37,800
I'm so glad you've come, dear.
Good evening, baron.

1121
01:21:37,960 --> 01:21:40,440
- Good evening.
- Of course, you know each other.

1122
01:21:40,600 --> 01:21:42,960
- Monsieur Duval?
- No.

1123
01:21:43,760 --> 01:21:45,160
You're late.

1124
01:21:45,320 --> 01:21:47,480
- We went to the theater.
- What was the play?

1125
01:21:47,640 --> 01:21:49,440
<i>- Manon Lescaut. 
- Oh, yes.</i>

1126
01:21:49,600 --> 01:21:52,360
The story of a man who loved a woman
more than his honor...

1127
01:21:52,520 --> 01:21:55,320
...and a woman who wanted luxury
more than his love.

1128
01:21:55,480 --> 01:21:58,080
You should have found that
very entertaining.

1129
01:21:58,280 --> 01:22:01,000
Isn't that your tune, Marguerite?

1130
01:22:01,480 --> 01:22:04,040
Madame, you've dropped your fan.

1131
01:22:05,640 --> 01:22:08,360
- Thank you.
- Any gentleman would've done the same.

1132
01:22:08,520 --> 01:22:11,040
Aren't you playing, baron?

1133
01:22:11,560 --> 01:22:14,000
- Where is the baccarat table?
- Yes, Gaston, where is it?

1134
01:22:14,160 --> 01:22:16,080
- Straight ahead.
- I play for high stakes.

1135
01:22:16,240 --> 01:22:19,200
Good. I should like to make
a fortune tonight.

1136
01:22:21,120 --> 01:22:24,840
- Come, Marguerite.
- I'd rather not play, if you don't mind.

1137
01:22:25,000 --> 01:22:26,960
You can watch.

1138
01:22:28,120 --> 01:22:31,880
I can't watch, Prudence. Armand may lose.
He may lose everything, and it's my fault.

1139
01:22:32,040 --> 01:22:34,840
You needn't worry, dear.
He doesn't blame you at all.

1140
01:22:35,000 --> 01:22:39,640
That isn't true. His voice is too cold
and his face is too pale.

1141
01:22:41,480 --> 01:22:44,600
Monsieur le Baron wins.

1142
01:23:03,120 --> 01:23:06,800
- Can I get Madame anything?
- No, thank you.

1143
01:23:10,360 --> 01:23:13,320
Yes. Will you take a message
to Monsieur Armand Duval?

1144
01:23:13,480 --> 01:23:15,240
Tell him I would like to speak to him.

1145
01:23:15,400 --> 01:23:19,480
- How will I know the gentleman?
- Well, he's playing at the first table...

1146
01:23:19,640 --> 01:23:24,360
...and he's the youngest
and handsomest man there.

1147
01:23:24,520 --> 01:23:26,320
I'll find him, Madame.

1148
01:23:26,480 --> 01:23:30,160
- Nine, the right side wins.
- Congratulations, monsieur.

1149
01:23:30,320 --> 01:23:32,160
Well done, Armand.
Twenty thousand francs.

1150
01:23:32,320 --> 01:23:35,320
- Twenty thousand?
- Place your bets, gentlemen.

1151
01:23:35,960 --> 01:23:38,960
Armand wins again.
He drew nine three times.

1152
01:23:40,320 --> 01:23:42,440
Well done, well done.

1153
01:23:43,760 --> 01:23:45,400
Let it stand.

1154
01:23:45,560 --> 01:23:47,280
- You'll lose it all.
- Let it stand.

1155
01:23:47,440 --> 01:23:50,040
- Good. You owe me revenge.
- Take it if you can.

1156
01:23:50,200 --> 01:23:52,960
Only, I warn you,
lucky in love, unlucky at cards.

1157
01:23:53,120 --> 01:23:55,200
That also means
lucky at cards, unlucky in love.

1158
01:23:55,400 --> 01:23:57,640
- We shall see.
- Make your bets, please, gentlemen.

1159
01:23:58,280 --> 01:23:59,600
Card.

1160
01:24:05,720 --> 01:24:07,360
No card.

1161
01:24:11,000 --> 01:24:13,080
- Eight.
- Seven.

1162
01:24:14,120 --> 01:24:15,760
Baccarat!

1163
01:24:19,320 --> 01:24:22,160
You've won a fortune, Armand.

1164
01:24:24,920 --> 01:24:26,760
Make your bets, gentlemen.
Make your bets.

1165
01:24:26,920 --> 01:24:27,880
Pardon me.

1166
01:24:38,440 --> 01:24:40,320
You sent for me, Madame?

1167
01:24:40,760 --> 01:24:43,760
Yes. I want to beg you,
leave this place at once.

1168
01:24:43,920 --> 01:24:46,760
- Why?
- Baron de Varville is not a patient man...

1169
01:24:46,920 --> 01:24:48,880
...and you're in the mood
to quarrel tonight.

1170
01:24:49,040 --> 01:24:51,680
You don't want to lose
your rich admirer. I understand.

1171
01:24:51,840 --> 01:24:53,760
Your own fortunes would fall with him.

1172
01:24:53,960 --> 01:24:57,160
Armand, he's not to blame
for what happened. That I swear.

1173
01:24:57,320 --> 01:24:59,360
Then how could you do what you did?

1174
01:25:00,120 --> 01:25:03,400
I'll tell you. Because your heart is a thing
that can be bought and sold.

1175
01:25:03,560 --> 01:25:05,520
I know, you gave it to me
for a whole summer.

1176
01:25:05,680 --> 01:25:08,840
When it came to a choice, the jewels
and carriages he could give you...

1177
01:25:09,000 --> 01:25:12,200
...were worth more than my love,
my devotion, my life.

1178
01:25:12,880 --> 01:25:14,440
Yes, that's true.

1179
01:25:14,600 --> 01:25:19,120
I'm a completely worthless woman,
and no man should risk his life for me.

1180
01:25:19,480 --> 01:25:22,760
For that reason alone, I beg you,
leave this place at once.

1181
01:25:22,920 --> 01:25:24,480
I will.

1182
01:25:24,760 --> 01:25:27,360
I will, on one condition.

1183
01:25:27,960 --> 01:25:29,800
That you'll go with me.

1184
01:25:30,280 --> 01:25:31,480
No.

1185
01:25:32,480 --> 01:25:35,880
I came back to Paris to tell you
that I despise you, and I do.

1186
01:25:36,280 --> 01:25:39,400
But I love you too. Say you'll go away
with me. We'll forget the past.

1187
01:25:39,560 --> 01:25:41,680
- We'll never turn back.
- No, no.

1188
01:25:41,840 --> 01:25:44,040
I doubled my fortune tonight
at his expense.

1189
01:25:44,200 --> 01:25:48,600
And when that's gone, I'll work,
I'll beg, I'll borrow, I'll steal.

1190
01:25:48,760 --> 01:25:51,680
But I must be with you always, always.

1191
01:25:52,200 --> 01:25:57,320
When I hear you talk of such a future,
I realize I'm right in doing what I did.

1192
01:25:58,560 --> 01:26:01,640
Look, do you suppose
we could ever be happy together...

1193
01:26:01,800 --> 01:26:04,480
...even if I were free to act as I choose?
- You are free.

1194
01:26:04,640 --> 01:26:06,880
I've given a solemn promise
never to return to you.

1195
01:26:07,080 --> 01:26:08,440
To whom?

1196
01:26:09,160 --> 01:26:12,960
- To someone who had the right to ask.
- To the Baron de Varville?

1197
01:26:14,240 --> 01:26:17,120
- Yes.
- So you do love him.

1198
01:26:20,200 --> 01:26:24,280
Dare to tell me that you love him,
you're free of me forever.

1199
01:26:26,120 --> 01:26:27,760
I love him.

1200
01:26:32,840 --> 01:26:35,360
Come in! Come in here, all of you!

1201
01:26:35,800 --> 01:26:39,600
You see this woman? You know her?
Then listen to what I'm going to say.

1202
01:26:39,760 --> 01:26:42,080
I accepted her favors
because I thought she loved me.

1203
01:26:42,240 --> 01:26:45,280
I let her make sacrifices when there
were others who had more to give.

1204
01:26:45,480 --> 01:26:48,160
But bear witness, I owe her nothing.

1205
01:26:48,520 --> 01:26:50,280
Take it. Go on, take it!

1206
01:26:50,440 --> 01:26:54,480
Buy camellias. Buy diamonds, horses
and carriages! Buy moonlight! Buy a grave!

1207
01:26:55,600 --> 01:26:59,160
I congratulate you, monsieur. You know
how to treat a woman as she deserves.

1208
01:26:59,320 --> 01:27:01,680
Like the cheat this one is.

1209
01:27:03,840 --> 01:27:06,120
You shall answer to me for this!

1210
01:27:07,880 --> 01:27:10,080
Send me word when and where.

1211
01:27:15,600 --> 01:27:19,120
- Come, gentlemen, let's continue our play.
- Come, come, the game is continuing.

1212
01:27:19,280 --> 01:27:22,560
Place your bets, gentlemen.
Please, please make your bets.

1213
01:27:49,000 --> 01:27:50,640
He's safe.

1214
01:27:50,800 --> 01:27:53,560
Thank God. Oh, thank God.

1215
01:27:53,720 --> 01:27:54,880
But the baron is wounded.

1216
01:27:55,080 --> 01:27:58,800
That means Armand must leave the country
to avoid arrest. He's already on his way.

1217
01:27:58,960 --> 01:28:03,080
- My letter?
- I'm sorry. He sent it back.

1218
01:28:03,240 --> 01:28:05,080
He wouldn't open it.

1219
01:28:33,480 --> 01:28:35,520
Who's here we know?

1220
01:28:38,720 --> 01:28:40,800
- Oh, there's someone now.
- Come in.

1221
01:28:41,360 --> 01:28:43,360
- Armand!
- Armand Duval!

1222
01:28:43,560 --> 01:28:45,160
- Well...
- Do sit down.

1223
01:28:45,320 --> 01:28:47,720
- When did you get back to Paris?
- About a week ago.

1224
01:28:47,880 --> 01:28:50,680
- Why hasn't anyone seen you?
- Where have you been, anyhow?

1225
01:28:50,840 --> 01:28:54,080
- All sorts of places.
- It's good you didn't kill the baron...

1226
01:28:54,240 --> 01:28:58,400
...and have to stay away for years instead
of months. Have you seen Marguerite?

1227
01:28:58,880 --> 01:29:02,400
- Oh, I'm sorry, I meant...
- Well.

1228
01:29:02,600 --> 01:29:04,880
How does Paris look to the traveler?

1229
01:29:05,640 --> 01:29:07,760
The same as it looked six months ago.

1230
01:29:07,920 --> 01:29:10,600
The same girls singing the same song
on the same stage.

1231
01:29:10,760 --> 01:29:13,360
And I'm still wearing
the same dress, alas.

1232
01:29:13,720 --> 01:29:16,360
Don't hint.
Nobody's going to buy you a new one.

1233
01:29:16,520 --> 01:29:18,880
Only, Marguerite isn't here.

1234
01:29:20,560 --> 01:29:22,760
However, I suppose
there are worse places.

1235
01:29:22,920 --> 01:29:25,680
- I said, Marguerite isn't here.
- Don't shout. We all heard you.

1236
01:29:26,040 --> 01:29:29,320
- Do you know she's been ill, Armand?
- Stop teasing Armand, Gaston.

1237
01:29:29,480 --> 01:29:31,680
Can't you see that he isn't interested?

1238
01:29:31,840 --> 01:29:34,120
- Aren't you?
- No, not particularly.

1239
01:29:34,280 --> 01:29:36,640
After all, why should he be?
It's nothing new.

1240
01:29:36,800 --> 01:29:40,000
Marguerite is always ill
or pretending to be.

1241
01:29:40,160 --> 01:29:42,080
You really have a nasty tongue,
haven't you?

1242
01:29:42,240 --> 01:29:45,240
Why, if you mean to insinuate
that I haven't been a good friend...

1243
01:29:45,400 --> 01:29:49,280
...to Marguerite Gautier, ask Prudence
what I've done for her. Just ask her.

1244
01:29:49,480 --> 01:29:55,080
It's true. That angel has been buying
Marguerite's things, all of her jewelry...

1245
01:29:55,240 --> 01:29:57,760
...one after another.
- Look.

1246
01:29:58,480 --> 01:30:00,440
- Why?
- So she could raise some money.

1247
01:30:00,600 --> 01:30:03,040
Since the duel with the baron,
he's refused to see her.

1248
01:30:03,200 --> 01:30:06,120
Shut up, Olympe. I know more
about that than you do.

1249
01:30:06,280 --> 01:30:10,560
Marguerite won't see the baron,
or any other man who might help her...

1250
01:30:10,760 --> 01:30:13,920
...in spite of all my motherly advice.
- Well, that's what you say.

1251
01:30:14,080 --> 01:30:17,880
Only, this... Last week, I bought this.
Look.

1252
01:30:18,040 --> 01:30:21,560
Oh, you couldn't get it for 5000
at the jewelers. How much?

1253
01:30:21,720 --> 01:30:25,120
Two hundred Louis. Am I smart.

1254
01:30:30,760 --> 01:30:33,080
Shall we go around afterwards
and ask how she is?

1255
01:30:33,240 --> 01:30:34,720
No.

1256
01:30:35,640 --> 01:30:37,120
I couldn't.

1257
01:30:44,520 --> 01:30:46,480
- Hello, Nanine.
- Monsieur.

1258
01:30:46,640 --> 01:30:49,360
- How is she tonight?
- Oh, I don't know, monsieur.

1259
01:30:49,520 --> 01:30:51,400
The doctor tells me nothing.

1260
01:30:51,560 --> 01:30:54,920
Oh, forgive me, monsieur,
but these are bad times.

1261
01:30:55,080 --> 01:30:58,400
- There must be something I can do.
- There's nothing anybody can do...

1262
01:30:58,560 --> 01:31:01,120
...but watch and wait.
- Well, I'll watch and wait...

1263
01:31:01,280 --> 01:31:04,040
...while you get some rest.
- Gave yourself all the good cards.

1264
01:31:05,880 --> 01:31:07,560
You'll have to get out of here,
my men.

1265
01:31:07,720 --> 01:31:10,400
We're here for the creditors,
by order of the court...

1266
01:31:10,560 --> 01:31:14,080
...to see that nothing's taken out of
the house, and here we're going to stay.

1267
01:31:14,240 --> 01:31:16,240
There's a passage outside.
Wait there instead.

1268
01:31:16,400 --> 01:31:18,480
This room still belongs
to Mademoiselle Gautier.

1269
01:31:18,640 --> 01:31:21,720
- Our orders are to see...
- You can see nobody goes out that door...

1270
01:31:21,880 --> 01:31:26,000
...with a piano in his pocket
as well there as here. Get out.

1271
01:31:26,560 --> 01:31:27,960
Get out.

1272
01:31:39,680 --> 01:31:41,200
Lie down.

1273
01:31:42,320 --> 01:31:44,840
I'll call you the minute she stirs.

1274
01:33:16,080 --> 01:33:19,880
- Is it morning?
- Yes, dear child.

1275
01:33:20,640 --> 01:33:24,920
- Any letters?
- No. It's too early for the postman.

1276
01:33:25,320 --> 01:33:28,640
Who are you?

1277
01:33:32,360 --> 01:33:33,720
Gaston.

1278
01:33:35,560 --> 01:33:40,200
Nanine's sleeping. I made her lie down
when I looked in after the theater.

1279
01:33:41,280 --> 01:33:43,280
Dear Gaston.

1280
01:33:43,800 --> 01:33:46,040
So you've been here all night?

1281
01:33:46,320 --> 01:33:50,320
Well, I was thinking of taking you
for a drive, or maybe for a bit of lunch.

1282
01:33:54,240 --> 01:33:56,560
You still make me laugh.

1283
01:33:58,000 --> 01:34:01,320
Not today. Some other time.

1284
01:34:01,480 --> 01:34:03,640
All right, another time.

1285
01:34:09,920 --> 01:34:12,320
How kind you are.

1286
01:34:13,760 --> 01:34:18,200
You know, I used to think
you were such a gay fellow...

1287
01:34:18,360 --> 01:34:21,280
...with no other thought but for pleasure.

1288
01:34:21,440 --> 01:34:23,320
Forgive me.

1289
01:34:24,000 --> 01:34:25,480
But you were right.

1290
01:34:25,640 --> 01:34:28,560
Here, drink this.

1291
01:34:31,520 --> 01:34:33,400
It'll do you good.

1292
01:34:34,360 --> 01:34:39,400
Nothing will do me good anymore,
Gaston, except Armand's return.

1293
01:34:39,560 --> 01:34:42,880
- Armand's return?
- Yes.

1294
01:34:43,440 --> 01:34:46,160
That's what I'm waiting for.

1295
01:34:46,520 --> 01:34:48,480
That's why I live.

1296
01:34:50,560 --> 01:34:54,720
- He will come back, won't he, Gaston?
- Of course he'll come back.

1297
01:34:54,880 --> 01:34:58,160
How could he come to Paris
without coming straight to you?

1298
01:34:58,760 --> 01:35:00,480
Here, drink this.

1299
01:35:07,040 --> 01:35:09,360
I feel better already.

1300
01:35:13,800 --> 01:35:16,280
It's all right, Nanine. She's awake.

1301
01:35:16,440 --> 01:35:21,160
- Poor Nanine. Were you tired last night?
- Oh, a little, Madame.

1302
01:35:21,320 --> 01:35:24,680
That Madame Prudence is here
on her way home from a party.

1303
01:35:24,840 --> 01:35:27,080
I'll get rid of her.

1304
01:35:30,160 --> 01:35:33,720
So that's why you ran away from us,
you naughty boy.

1305
01:35:35,280 --> 01:35:37,960
Hello, my child.

1306
01:35:38,120 --> 01:35:40,920
Why, I expected to find you dying,
and you look better...

1307
01:35:41,080 --> 01:35:43,520
...than I've seen you look for months.
How are you?

1308
01:35:43,720 --> 01:35:46,280
- Much better.
- You certainly look better than I feel.

1309
01:35:46,440 --> 01:35:49,760
Oh, heavens, what worries I've had
this past week.

1310
01:35:49,920 --> 01:35:53,760
I couldn't, by any chance,
borrow some money from you, could I?

1311
01:35:53,960 --> 01:35:57,000
If you don't know how little money
there is in this house, you should.

1312
01:35:57,160 --> 01:36:00,640
Well, I've simply got to get 200 francs
from somewhere.

1313
01:36:00,840 --> 01:36:05,640
I didn't intend to ask you for it. In fact,
I didn't intend popping in on you like this...

1314
01:36:05,800 --> 01:36:11,400
...but as I passed your door,
I just remembered you still owe me some.

1315
01:36:12,760 --> 01:36:16,280
- I didn't know, Prudence.
- I can show it to you on my ledger.

1316
01:36:16,440 --> 01:36:18,760
If you look around,
you'll find my purse somewhere.

1317
01:36:18,920 --> 01:36:21,880
You'll see I haven't
but a few francs in the world.

1318
01:36:27,960 --> 01:36:30,000
Why, it's full.

1319
01:36:31,440 --> 01:36:34,000
A thousand francs.

1320
01:36:34,160 --> 01:36:37,480
Well, I'll just help myself.

1321
01:36:37,640 --> 01:36:40,440
Did you know Armand Duval
was in Paris?

1322
01:36:41,920 --> 01:36:43,560
Armand?

1323
01:36:44,360 --> 01:36:47,760
- When did he get back?
- Why, almost a week, I gather.

1324
01:36:48,520 --> 01:36:53,560
Gaston told him you were ill,
but he didn't seem terribly interested.

1325
01:36:53,720 --> 01:36:57,640
Oh, men are funny. Goodbye, my dear.
Goodbye, Gaston. Goodbye.

1326
01:37:00,920 --> 01:37:03,840
- Gaston?
- Yes?

1327
01:37:04,240 --> 01:37:08,640
- Thank you for filling my purse.
- That was nothing.

1328
01:37:11,240 --> 01:37:15,400
- Will you do me one more favor, Gaston?
- Of course.

1329
01:37:16,680 --> 01:37:18,880
Send for the priest.

1330
01:37:41,480 --> 01:37:44,240
Where is she? Let me see her.
Make her see me.

1331
01:37:44,400 --> 01:37:49,880
Oh, my dear boy, if you only knew
how happy, how happy...

1332
01:38:09,000 --> 01:38:12,960
- Nanine? It's not too late?
- No, no, let us hope not.

1333
01:38:13,120 --> 01:38:16,120
Let us hope you'll make her well again.

1334
01:38:18,240 --> 01:38:22,280
No, no, no, wait.
Let me prepare her first.

1335
01:38:30,880 --> 01:38:32,640
Madame.

1336
01:38:33,880 --> 01:38:36,440
I've good news, Madame.

1337
01:38:39,120 --> 01:38:41,480
There can't be any good news now.

1338
01:38:41,640 --> 01:38:45,920
But there is. Only, you must be calm.
You mustn't get excited.

1339
01:38:46,120 --> 01:38:51,440
- He's here, Madame. He's come back.
- Yes...

1340
01:38:51,600 --> 01:38:53,240
...he's back.

1341
01:38:53,920 --> 01:38:58,440
- But he won't come to see me.
- But he has come. He's here.

1342
01:39:03,280 --> 01:39:05,720
He's here, Madame.

1343
01:39:09,160 --> 01:39:10,800
He's here?

1344
01:39:12,000 --> 01:39:14,880
- Are you telling me the truth?
- Yes, yes.

1345
01:39:15,040 --> 01:39:19,480
- Only, be calm, and I'll call him.
- No, no. Not yet.

1346
01:39:19,640 --> 01:39:22,040
He mustn't see me like this, Nanine.

1347
01:39:22,200 --> 01:39:25,960
- Help me to the mirror.
- You mustn't think of getting out of bed.

1348
01:39:26,120 --> 01:39:28,840
Brush my hair. Get me some rouge.
Help me, Nanine.

1349
01:39:29,000 --> 01:39:30,920
No, no. What will the doctor say?

1350
01:39:31,080 --> 01:39:34,760
Oh, what does it matter?
I must look my...

1351
01:39:36,520 --> 01:39:38,080
Nanine.

1352
01:39:38,480 --> 01:39:44,040
Nanine. I beg you, Nanine, I must...
You must help me, Nanine. Come on.

1353
01:39:44,200 --> 01:39:46,280
I beg you, Nanine. I beg...

1354
01:39:46,440 --> 01:39:48,280
Come, Nanine.

1355
01:39:48,440 --> 01:39:51,080
Oh, I shouldn't do this.

1356
01:39:51,760 --> 01:39:56,800
You don't think he cares how you look.
He knows you've been ill.

1357
01:40:05,040 --> 01:40:08,360
You always said, ""He'll come back,""
didn't you, Nanine?

1358
01:40:08,520 --> 01:40:10,040
Yes.

1359
01:40:10,440 --> 01:40:12,200
- Sit here.
- Yes.

1360
01:40:13,960 --> 01:40:15,520
Sit here.

1361
01:40:16,120 --> 01:40:18,960
- There. Here are all your things.
- My camellias.

1362
01:40:19,120 --> 01:40:22,360
Nanine, I'll even have camellias.

1363
01:40:29,160 --> 01:40:32,760
I'll be beautiful again
when I'll be well again, won't I, Nanine?

1364
01:40:32,920 --> 01:40:35,040
Of course.

1365
01:40:36,040 --> 01:40:38,400
I can't wait. Call him now, Nanine.
Call him now.

1366
01:40:38,600 --> 01:40:40,200
Yes.

1367
01:40:44,360 --> 01:40:45,920
Monsieur.

1368
01:40:52,680 --> 01:40:55,520
- Marguerite.
- Armand.

1369
01:40:55,680 --> 01:40:57,280
Marguerite!

1370
01:41:01,520 --> 01:41:06,240
- It's you. It's not a dream.
- No, no, it's not a dream.

1371
01:41:06,400 --> 01:41:10,400
- I'm here with you in my arms at last.
- At last.

1372
01:41:11,960 --> 01:41:16,320
- You're weak.
- No, no, I'm strong.

1373
01:41:18,160 --> 01:41:22,920
It's my heart. It's not used
to being happy.

1374
01:41:23,080 --> 01:41:25,320
Oh, how pretty you are.

1375
01:41:25,920 --> 01:41:28,920
I've been in the street half the night,
walking under your window...

1376
01:41:29,080 --> 01:41:32,840
...just as I did when I first knew you,
wanting to come up but not daring to.

1377
01:41:33,000 --> 01:41:36,760
I felt so guilty.
I didn't know how ill you were.

1378
01:41:37,160 --> 01:41:39,520
I've been everywhere trying
to forget I loved you.

1379
01:41:39,680 --> 01:41:43,000
And when I came back a week ago,
I was still determined to forget you.

1380
01:41:43,160 --> 01:41:46,920
Forget you, as if I could.

1381
01:41:48,640 --> 01:41:50,960
- Forgive me.
- Forgive you.

1382
01:41:51,120 --> 01:41:54,760
And to think I couldn't see
into this heart I knew so well...

1383
01:41:54,920 --> 01:41:57,920
...and see that it was
sacrificing itself for me.

1384
01:41:58,560 --> 01:42:02,760
No good can come to either of us
without the other. I know that now.

1385
01:42:03,200 --> 01:42:06,680
- I know that too.
- Nothing shall ever separate us again.

1386
01:42:06,840 --> 01:42:10,600
The future is ours.
My whole life belongs to you.

1387
01:42:10,760 --> 01:42:13,960
I'll take you far from Paris, where there
are no unhappy memories for us.

1388
01:42:14,120 --> 01:42:16,840
Where the sun will help me take care
of you and make you well.

1389
01:42:17,000 --> 01:42:20,200
We will go back to the country,
where we were happy all one summer.

1390
01:42:21,480 --> 01:42:23,960
Oh, if only we could. If only we could.

1391
01:42:24,120 --> 01:42:26,840
We can. We will,
as soon as you're well enough.

1392
01:42:27,000 --> 01:42:30,480
Well, I'm well now. Call Nanine.

1393
01:42:30,760 --> 01:42:33,080
- Nanine?
- Take me today.

1394
01:42:33,240 --> 01:42:37,720
Nanine? Nanine, help Madame to dress.
We're going to the country today.

1395
01:42:39,480 --> 01:42:43,240
Don't worry. I'll take good care of her.
You must come along too.

1396
01:42:44,040 --> 01:42:48,000
We're going to the country, Nanine.
Get my things out.

1397
01:42:49,080 --> 01:42:51,600
Don't stare at me, Nanine. Go.

1398
01:43:00,680 --> 01:43:02,400
I can't...

1399
01:43:06,840 --> 01:43:09,280
Nanine? Nanine.

1400
01:43:09,480 --> 01:43:11,440
Nanine, get the doctor, quickly!

1401
01:43:11,600 --> 01:43:13,480
The doctor?

1402
01:43:13,640 --> 01:43:16,640
If you can't make me live,
how can he?

1403
01:43:16,840 --> 01:43:21,760
No, no. Don't say such things, Marguerite.
You'll live. You must live.

1404
01:43:21,960 --> 01:43:28,160
Perhaps it's better if I live in your heart,
where the world can't see me.

1405
01:43:29,280 --> 01:43:34,360
If I'm dead, there'll be no stain
on our love.

1406
01:43:34,760 --> 01:43:36,960
Don't think such things, Marguerite.

1407
01:43:37,120 --> 01:43:39,520
Even if we can't go
to the country today...

1408
01:43:39,680 --> 01:43:44,040
...think of how happy we were once,
and how happy we shall be again.

1409
01:43:44,360 --> 01:43:48,360
Think of the day you found the clover,
and the good luck it's going to bring us.

1410
01:43:48,520 --> 01:43:51,200
Think of the vows we heard
Nichette and Gustave make...

1411
01:43:51,360 --> 01:43:54,120
...and that we're going to make
to each other.

1412
01:43:54,280 --> 01:43:56,600
This is for life, Marguerite...

1413
01:43:59,720 --> 01:44:01,240
Marguerite?

1414
01:44:06,200 --> 01:44:07,920
Marguerite?

1415
01:44:09,040 --> 01:44:12,360
No. No, don't leave me.

1416
01:44:12,520 --> 01:44:15,320
Marguerite, come back, come back.

01:04:17,559 --> 01:04:19,594
Just some idiot
playing his music too loud.

1097
01:04:20,427 --> 01:04:22,396
-They gone now.
-[Monty] Chill, bro.

1098
01:04:23,263 --> 01:04:24,298
[Noble]
What're you doin', man?

1099
01:04:25,299 --> 01:04:26,333
What're you talking about?

1100
01:04:27,167 --> 01:04:31,639
[Noble] The car, the paint,
the rims, the sounds?

1101
01:04:32,139 --> 01:04:34,007
-What's that?
-I bought me a car.

1102
01:04:34,942 --> 01:04:36,644
-What's your problem?
-Bro,

1103
01:04:36,678 --> 01:04:38,546
that's unnecessary attention.

1104
01:04:40,180 --> 01:04:41,248
[Monty]
It's just a car.

1105
01:04:41,716 --> 01:04:42,983
Nigga, you bought one.

1106
01:04:48,322 --> 01:04:50,023
[Keisha] What is that smell?

1107
01:04:51,726 --> 01:04:54,361
Girl, I was
dreaming about some fish

1108
01:04:54,995 --> 01:04:57,632
and woke up
craving salmon croquettes.

1109
01:04:57,665 --> 01:04:59,233
[Keisha]
Can I open the window?

1110
01:04:59,266 --> 01:05:00,668
That smell is
making me nauseous.

1111
01:05:03,270 --> 01:05:05,939
Sure, baby. I'm sorry.

1112
01:05:10,612 --> 01:05:13,347
How do you feel about Tasha?

1113
01:05:14,081 --> 01:05:15,149
[Keisha]
Who's Tasha?

1114
01:05:16,150 --> 01:05:18,018
It's not just a car, Monty.

1115
01:05:18,051 --> 01:05:19,253
That's a billboard.

1116
01:05:19,621 --> 01:05:20,688
Get rid of it.

1117
01:05:22,122 --> 01:05:23,591
Whatever, nigga,
you got me fucked up.

1118
01:05:25,492 --> 01:05:27,194
[Noble]
I'm not playing.

1119
01:05:27,227 --> 01:05:29,129
Get rid of that thing
and don't bring it back.

1120
01:05:29,396 --> 01:05:31,098
I'm serious.

1121
01:05:33,535 --> 01:05:36,604
That's just a name
that I always loved.

1122
01:05:36,638 --> 01:05:40,542
[engine revving]

1123
01:05:43,578 --> 01:05:48,248
If Noble had been a girl,
I would have named him Tasha.

1124
01:05:48,282 --> 01:05:50,652
-[chuckles]
-It's pretty.

1125
01:05:54,221 --> 01:05:55,456
[Suge]
This shit, man.

1126
01:05:58,392 --> 01:06:01,094
[engine revving]

1127
01:06:09,604 --> 01:06:11,739
This nigga Monty
getting paper now too?

1128
01:06:13,474 --> 01:06:15,242
Man.

1129
01:06:15,275 --> 01:06:17,612
How long is you gonna let
this little motherfucker

1130
01:06:17,645 --> 01:06:19,079
get away with this shit?

1131
01:06:21,181 --> 01:06:22,650
Should've never
put this nigga on!

1132
01:06:23,417 --> 01:06:25,052
With your dumbass!

1133
01:06:25,085 --> 01:06:27,087
Nigga, who the fuck
is you talking to?

1134
01:06:27,722 --> 01:06:30,725
I'm saying they eating
like a motherfucker.

1135
01:06:30,758 --> 01:06:33,026
Maybe I start rolling
with these niggas.

1136
01:06:33,060 --> 01:06:36,631
Then get the fuck on then,
you dick riding ass nigga.

1137
01:06:39,701 --> 01:06:41,669
I told you to give me a minute,

1138
01:06:42,336 --> 01:06:45,507
but if you can't wait,
then get the fuck on!

1139
01:06:48,342 --> 01:06:50,612
Look, D. It ain't like that.

1140
01:06:50,645 --> 01:06:52,312
But you know me, nigga.

1141
01:06:52,346 --> 01:06:54,516
I'm tired of waiting
and these motherfuckers

1142
01:06:54,549 --> 01:06:56,183
is making us look stupid.

1143
01:07:00,287 --> 01:07:01,388
You right.

1144
01:07:02,289 --> 01:07:03,658
Playtime is over with.

1145
01:07:03,691 --> 01:07:05,492
[Jay] If you ask a girl
what she doing?

1146
01:07:05,527 --> 01:07:09,429
And she say, ""I was thinking,""
uh, you gotta go.

1147
01:07:14,468 --> 01:07:16,203
You little bitch ass nigga.

1148
01:07:16,236 --> 01:07:17,672
-[punch lands]
-[thud]

1149
01:07:20,608 --> 01:07:23,043
You sell another crumb
around this motherfucker,

1150
01:07:23,343 --> 01:07:25,513
I'mma take you
for everything you got.

1151
01:07:26,446 --> 01:07:27,682
You hear me?

1152
01:07:28,816 --> 01:07:30,083
[Noble spits]

1153
01:07:32,185 --> 01:07:33,253
Look at me.

1154
01:07:35,255 --> 01:07:36,323
Yeah, I hear you.

1155
01:07:37,659 --> 01:07:39,661
Can't nobody save your ass.

1156
01:07:40,562 --> 01:07:42,797
Not one more
motherfucking crumb.

1157
01:07:49,169 --> 01:07:50,805
Now try me
if you think I'm playing.

1158
01:07:59,313 --> 01:08:01,415
-Y'all have a good day.
-[laughs]

1159
01:08:03,751 --> 01:08:05,285
Whoo.

1160
01:08:06,521 --> 01:08:07,655
[Jay]
Oh, my God.

1161
01:08:08,790 --> 01:08:11,425
I told you to fight that
nigga Shooter a long time ago.

1162
01:08:11,458 --> 01:08:12,860
Now you gotta kill him, bro.

1163
01:08:12,894 --> 01:08:14,161
This shit ain't gonna stop.

1164
01:08:15,362 --> 01:08:16,496
[Dabs]
What you do, No?

1165
01:08:19,667 --> 01:08:21,168
[Katherine]
I love children.

1166
01:08:22,402 --> 01:08:24,739
I wished I could have had ten.

1167
01:08:24,772 --> 01:08:26,440
[laughing]

1168
01:08:26,473 --> 01:08:27,675
I don't know about ten.

1169
01:08:45,258 --> 01:08:46,360
Ready to go?

1170
01:08:47,327 --> 01:08:48,428
Yeah.

1171
01:08:52,600 --> 01:08:55,335
[engine revving]

1172
01:09:02,844 --> 01:09:05,245
-Hi!
-[Keisha] Hi, how are you?

1173
01:09:05,278 --> 01:09:06,581
I am great.

1174
01:09:06,614 --> 01:09:08,583
-Keisha, right?
-[Keisha] Keisha.

1175
01:09:08,916 --> 01:09:10,450
[realtor]
Hi, and you are?

1176
01:09:10,484 --> 01:09:11,953
-Dabs.
-[Realtor] Dabs.

1177
01:09:11,986 --> 01:09:14,287
-And you must be Noble.
-Yeah.

1178
01:09:19,927 --> 01:09:24,164
All right. Now, as you can see,
all the floors are new.

1179
01:09:24,899 --> 01:09:27,300
You got great flow through here.

1180
01:09:27,635 --> 01:09:30,705
And the kitchen
is being completely remodeled,

1181
01:09:30,738 --> 01:09:34,374
but the real jewel
in this home is the basement.

1182
01:09:34,776 --> 01:09:35,843
Let's go take a look.

1183
01:09:38,245 --> 01:09:39,514
[Dabs]
Dada wants 2000.

1184
01:09:39,881 --> 01:09:40,948
What do I tell him?

1185
01:09:44,351 --> 01:09:46,587
Tell him to give you an hour
and I'll call him back.

1186
01:09:49,624 --> 01:09:51,826
Hey, man,
gimme an hour, man, all right?

1187
01:09:53,360 --> 01:09:55,797
[Suge] Dabs.

1188
01:09:59,466 --> 01:10:00,635
What's in the bag, buddy?

1189
01:10:01,301 --> 01:10:02,436
[Dabs]
Nothin'', nothin'.

1190
01:10:02,937 --> 01:10:04,639
Yeah, well, we gonna see.

1191
01:10:04,672 --> 01:10:05,807
Hey, come on!

1192
01:10:12,345 --> 01:10:13,648
Now why lie to me, Dabs?

1193
01:10:14,448 --> 01:10:16,416
After all I did for you?

1194
01:10:17,018 --> 01:10:18,553
Man, you breakin' my heart.

1195
01:10:20,521 --> 01:10:21,689
I think I'm ''bout to cry.

1196
01:10:22,724 --> 01:10:24,357
That''s not mine, man,
give it back.

1197
01:10:25,860 --> 01:10:27,461
[Suge]
Or what, ho ass nigga?

1198
01:10:30,363 --> 01:10:31,498
[Dada]
I know whose it is.

1199
01:10:33,034 --> 01:10:35,636
Tell that nigga I said
this is more than a crumb.

1200
01:10:50,918 --> 01:10:54,856
[Dabs] Man, Dada and Shooter
just took my bag.

1201
01:10:54,889 --> 01:10:56,824
-What happened?
-Man, they snatched it.

1202
01:10:57,625 --> 01:10:58,826
And wouldn't give it back.

1203
01:10:59,961 --> 01:11:02,964
Dada said to tell you
that's more than a crumb.

1204
01:11:03,998 --> 01:11:05,398
Where they at?

1205
01:11:05,767 --> 01:11:06,834
In front of his house.

1206
01:11:09,402 --> 01:11:10,470
[Noble]
Come on.

1207
01:11:11,906 --> 01:11:12,974
Fuck.

1208
01:11:14,842 --> 01:11:17,779
Look, Shoot.
It's the Powerpuff Girls.

1209
01:11:17,812 --> 01:11:21,516
[laughing]

1210
01:11:21,549 --> 01:11:22,683
This nigga dumb.

1211
01:11:23,785 --> 01:11:25,653
Where my money, Dada,
I'm not playin' with you!

1212
01:11:27,822 --> 01:11:29,356
[Dada]
Neither am I, motherfucker.

1213
01:11:29,924 --> 01:11:31,358
The money's mine.

1214
01:11:31,893 --> 01:11:34,662
Matter of fact,
everything you got is mine.

1215
01:11:35,630 --> 01:11:39,366
-Them shoes, this shirt.
-[Suge] Full of shit.

1216
01:11:39,399 --> 01:11:40,701
[Dada]
Even that car's mine.

1217
01:11:41,736 --> 01:11:42,837
And I want it all.

1218
01:11:44,071 --> 01:11:45,907
And if you ain't
gonna give it to me...

1219
01:11:47,842 --> 01:11:49,476
then I'm just
going to have to take it.

1220
01:11:50,845 --> 01:11:52,445
Now, see, the problem is...

1221
01:11:53,114 --> 01:11:54,749
once I start taking shit...

1222
01:11:56,584 --> 01:11:57,718
I don't know when to stop.

1223
01:11:59,153 --> 01:12:02,690
I might take your dog,
your bitch...

1224
01:12:03,758 --> 01:12:06,359
and the milk from
your mama left titty, nigga.

1225
01:12:07,628 --> 01:12:09,964
So don't come ''round
talking that tough shit

1226
01:12:10,698 --> 01:12:12,499
because the only reason
you alive...

1227
01:12:13,935 --> 01:12:15,837
is because I allow you to be.

1228
01:12:19,941 --> 01:12:22,342
[Suge]
Nigga. Straight up.

1229

Ass nigga. What's up?

1232
01:12:29,482 --> 01:12:30,952
Get your bitch-ass outta here.

1233
01:12:30,985 --> 01:12:32,119
[Dabs] Come on, Noble.
Wake up, man.

1234
01:12:32,987 --> 01:12:34,856
[Suge]
Damn, bitch ass nigga.

1235
01:12:34,889 --> 01:12:36,824
-[Dabs] Come on, wake up.
-[Dada] Let's go.

1236
01:12:36,858 --> 01:12:38,526
You're not waking up, man.
Come on, get up, man, get up.

1237
01:12:42,597 --> 01:12:43,664
[door shuts closed]

1238

[footsteps approaching]

1239
01:12:47,668 --> 01:12:49,503
You gonna have
to kill them niggas.

1240
01:12:49,537 --> 01:12:50,872
Both of 'em.

1241
01:12:50,905 --> 01:12:52,874
There ain't no way
around it now.

1242
01:12:54,175 --> 01:12:57,511
I know these niggas,
and they ain't gonna stop.

1243
01:13:01,048 --> 01:13:02,516
How many you say they took?

1244
01:13:03,117 --> 01:13:04,384
Eight.

1245
01:13:07,889 --> 01:13:10,390
8000 pills.

1246
01:13:11,559 --> 01:13:12,894
That's unforgivable.

1247
01:13:15,930 --> 01:13:17,665
If you gonna survive
in this game...

1248
01:13:18,566 --> 01:13:20,701
then you gonna have
to dead them niggas.

1249
01:13:21,869 --> 01:13:22,970
Both of them.

1252
01:13:37,885 --> 01:13:41,454
Noble, come go
to church with me today.

1253
01:13:42,089 --> 01:13:44,859
No, Ma, I don't think
that's a good idea.

1254
01:13:45,593 --> 01:13:48,029
Why not?
It's good for your soul.

1255
01:13:55,136 --> 01:13:56,837
Oh, my God.

1256
01:13:56,871 --> 01:13:58,639
What happened to your face?

1257
01:13:58,673 --> 01:14:00,841
[Noble] I-- I got
into a little scuffle.

1258
01:14:01,642 --> 01:14:03,511
[sighs] Oh, baby. Come here.

1259
01:14:03,945 --> 01:14:05,012
Come here.

You don't have to do this
for me, sweetheart.

1261
01:14:15,723 --> 01:14:17,191
Please let it go, baby,

1262
01:14:17,224 --> 01:14:19,860
I've lived
a long and happy life.

1263
01:14:20,728 --> 01:14:22,763
And it's time
for you to live yours.

1264

You don't have
to do this for me.

It's time for you
to let God take care of me.

1266
01:14:33,174 --> 01:14:37,511
Oh, Lord. Dear Heavenly Father,
please watch over my child.

1267
01:14:38,546 --> 01:14:40,181
Take away his fears.

1268
01:14:41,816 --> 01:14:43,818
Help him to have the strength

1269
01:14:43,851 --> 01:14:46,486
that he needs
to accept your will.

1270
01:14:47,955 --> 01:14:49,190
Amen.

01:15:01,035 --> 01:15:03,037
-[Keisha] Can you come here?
-Yeah, yeah. What's up?

1274
01:15:04,905 --> 01:15:06,974
We need some milk.
Can you go get me some?

1275
01:15:07,008 --> 01:15:09,710
-Milk. Yeah. Got it.
-I'll go get my purse.

1276

What up, doe?

1285
01:15:29,764 --> 01:15:33,667
Shooter. Dada. Damn. Again?

1286
01:15:35,636 --> 01:15:37,671
So, you a whole bitch
out here now, Dabs?

1287
01:15:37,705 --> 01:15:40,841
[Dabs] That was wrong, Dada.
Noble ain't do nothing to you.

1288
01:15:40,875 --> 01:15:42,176
Ain't do nothing to me?

1289
01:15:42,843 --> 01:15:44,979
Tell me what that
motherfucker did for me.

1290
01:15:45,012 --> 01:15:47,014
I helped him

1291
01:15:47,048 --> 01:15:48,916
just like I helped you and the
rest of these hoe-ass niggas.

1292
01:15:49,884 --> 01:15:51,752
Who was there
when your parents died, Dabs?

1293
01:15:52,153 --> 01:15:53,220
Me.

1294
01:15:54,255 --> 01:15:57,024
And ain't none of you niggas
did nada for Dada!

[Noble]
Not today.

1300
01:16:47,341 --> 01:16:48,375
I think I'm done.

1301
01:16:49,076 --> 01:16:50,211
[Keisha] Yeah.

1302
01:16:51,345 --> 01:16:53,180
I think this is God's way
of telling you it's time.

1303
01:16:54,081 --> 01:16:55,149
Me too.

1304
01:16:55,850 --> 01:16:57,218
I'm glad you said that, Noble,

1305
01:16:57,251 --> 01:16:58,686
'cause a lot of people
don't know

1306
01:16:58,719 --> 01:16:59,787
when to leave the streets alone.

1307
01:17:01,422 --> 01:17:04,391
They keep trying to make
a career out of selling drugs,

1308
01:17:04,425 --> 01:17:06,260
but it's more
of a temporary thing.

1309
01:17:06,760 --> 01:17:07,828
All right.

1310
01:17:08,863 --> 01:17:10,097
Good.

1311
01:17:11,232 --> 01:17:13,267

Okay. I'll be right there.

What's up, Dada?

1322

Thanks.

You got a nice chain.

-Yeah, this is real nice.
-[Dada] Mm-hmm.

-Right now.

It's at his girl's house.

to you, Monty.

[Green]
You positive?

1345
01:20:10,578 --> 01:20:11,879
[Noble] Yeah.

1346
01:20:12,313 --> 01:20:13,981
I'm not sure what he'll do next.

1347
01:20:14,649 --> 01:20:16,817
I think it's best
to just leave it alone.

1348
01:20:20,054 --> 01:20:22,289
[sighs] I'll let
the members know your decision.

1349

I really feel like
you jumping the gun.

1350
01:20:26,594 --> 01:20:28,228
I think you need
to give it more time.

1351
01:20:29,229 --> 01:20:30,931
Come on, man.
Your people need you.

1352
01:20:30,964 --> 01:20:32,032
Your mother needs you.

1353
01:20:33,067 --> 01:20:34,234

happen from time to time.

-What do you mean?
-[Green] Dada.

You know what the hell I mean.

Talk to him, see if we can get
your money back for you.

to be a part of this thing

in the future,
you are going to stay.

these things on your own.

-I can explain.
-Explain what?

1370
01:21:33,160 --> 01:21:37,398
Why would you stash drugs
at my house, Noble?

1371
01:21:37,599 --> 01:21:39,366
After all I've been through

1372
01:21:39,400 --> 01:21:42,035
and all you were talking
about quitting

1373
01:21:42,069 --> 01:21:44,572
and realizing when God is
trying to tell you something,

1374
01:21:44,606 --> 01:21:47,241
you go and put drugs
in my refrigerator?

1375
01:21:47,274 --> 01:21:48,475
Keisha, it ain't even like that,

1376
01:21:48,510 --> 01:21:50,277
I put that there
a long time ago.

[Keisha scoffs]

1378
01:21:54,148 --> 01:21:55,215
That's even worse.

1379
01:21:58,051 --> 01:21:59,420
Just get your stuff and leave.

1380
01:22:01,388 --> 01:22:02,489

Noble, what's wrong?

1386
01:23:02,382 --> 01:23:03,551
I don't know what to do, Ma.

1388
01:23:05,352 --> 01:23:08,055
It's like I want to stop,
but I can't stop.

1389
01:23:09,389 --> 01:23:10,625
Why not?

1390
01:23:11,124 --> 01:23:12,660
[Noble] I have so many
people depending on me.

1391
01:23:13,828 --> 01:23:16,063
Those people
don't need you, baby.

1392
01:23:17,364 --> 01:23:19,734
What are they going to do
if you die or go to prison?

1393
01:23:20,702 --> 01:23:22,670
They'll find
another way to survive,

1394
01:23:22,704 --> 01:23:25,105
-so don't believe that.
-You need me.

1395
01:23:28,075 --> 01:23:31,011
There's not enough money
in the world to save me, Noble.

1396
01:23:32,079 --> 01:23:35,015
You can't change God's plan.

1397
01:23:36,283 --> 01:23:38,285
What you need to do
is focus on Keisha.

1398
01:23:40,087 --> 01:23:42,624
I would, but that's over.

1399
01:23:43,791 --> 01:23:45,392
What do you mean that's over?

1400
01:23:45,793 --> 01:23:47,060
[Noble]
She left me.

1401
01:23:47,629 --> 01:23:48,696
[Katherine]
No, she didn't.

1402
01:23:49,664 --> 01:23:52,132
She might be
a little emotional right now,

1403
01:23:52,165 --> 01:23:54,401
but, um, she still loves you.

1404
01:23:56,804 --> 01:24:00,207
See, that's what you need
to be fighting for.

1405

-Keisha and your new family.
-[phone buzzing]

1406

[Noble] What family?
You only family I got.

1407
01:24:06,313 --> 01:24:08,482
Well, that's about to change.

1408
01:24:14,121 --> 01:24:16,390
-[Noble] What you mean?
-Keisha's pregnant.

-Why do you say that?

has left for dead.

00:01:32,527 --> 00:01:33,832
I know these are hard to see.

00:01:33,963 --> 00:01:37,967
- 20 years of marriage.

Everybody reacts
differently.

13
00:01:55,593 --> 00:01:57,551
The main thing right now,
Mrs. Cutler,

14
00:01:57,682 --> 00:01:59,119
is that you have
all the information,

15
00:01:59,249 --> 00:02:00,990
which means you have
all the power.

16
00:02:01,121 --> 00:02:05,255
- Power? Do I look like
I have power?

17
00:02:05,386 --> 00:02:08,127
- Just because you're hurt
doesn't mean you're powerless.

18
00:02:08,258 --> 00:02:10,434
You're armed with
everything you need

19
00:02:10,565 --> 00:02:12,001
to make an informed decision.

20
00:02:12,132 --> 00:02:13,655
So you hold all the cards.

21
00:02:16,701 --> 00:02:19,400
- I just knew that he was
messing around behind my back.

22
00:02:19,530 --> 00:02:22,446
I knew it. But now
that I know for sure...

23
00:02:25,406 --> 00:02:27,843
I just feel so worthless.

24
00:02:29,236 --> 00:02:31,412
- You are not worthless.

25
00:02:32,587 --> 00:02:35,938
Hey, you were smart enough
to come in here

26
00:02:36,067 --> 00:02:38,636
and ask a question you maybe
didn't want the answer to.

27
00:02:39,420 --> 00:02:41,161
But you did it.

28
00:02:41,291 --> 00:02:44,555
And that takes guts.
And strength.

29
00:02:44,686 --> 00:02:48,255
And yes, being betrayed
by somebody you love,

30
00:02:48,385 --> 00:02:52,084
somebody you thought you knew;
that hurts.

31
00:02:52,215 --> 00:02:54,174
But that is not on you.

32
00:02:54,304 --> 00:02:56,088
That is on him.

33
00:02:56,219 --> 00:02:58,047
It is always on them.

34
00:02:58,178 --> 00:03:00,963
Men cheat;

35
00:03:01,093 --> 00:03:03,966
they break promises,
but now, you get to decide,

36
00:03:04,096 --> 00:03:06,925
is this a man that you can learn
to trust again?

37
00:03:07,056 --> 00:03:10,842
Or do you move on,
knowing what you know now?

38
00:03:10,973 --> 00:03:13,105
You stand in that power

39
00:03:13,236 --> 00:03:15,804
and you make that decision
for yourself.

40
00:03:20,025 --> 00:03:21,984
- You're right.
I've done nothing wrong.

41
00:03:22,114 --> 00:03:24,116
- No, you didn't.

42
00:03:24,247 --> 00:03:26,075
Never take the fall for
someone else's wrongdoing.

43
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:29,383
- I have a lot to think about.

44
00:03:31,211 --> 00:03:32,690
- Thank you.

45
00:03:32,821 --> 00:03:35,215

- You're welcome.

46
00:03:35,954 --> 00:03:37,347
- You've been helpful.

47
00:03:45,399 --> 00:03:48,402
- 10 bucks says she stays.
- Nah.

48
00:03:48,531 --> 00:03:50,230
She's gonna bleed him dry.

49
00:03:52,667 --> 00:03:55,539
- Lucy Thompson?
- Who's asking?

50
00:03:55,670 --> 00:04:00,022
- My name is Clive Cassel.
You came highly recommended.

51
00:04:00,152 --> 00:04:01,676
- Yes, Mr. Cassel. I believe

52
00:04:01,806 --> 00:04:03,417
I spoke to your assistant.
- That's right.

53

- What can I do for you,
Mr. Cassel?

54
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:08,117
- Please, call me Clive.
- What can I do for you, Clive?

55
00:04:08,248 --> 00:04:10,424
- I think my wife
is having an affair

56
00:04:10,554 --> 00:04:12,774
and I would need
your help proving it.

57
00:04:12,904 --> 00:04:15,429
It's not always
the man who cheats...

58
00:04:16,298 --> 00:04:17,866
- Of course.

59
00:04:17,995 --> 00:04:20,129
Uh, please, have a seat.

60
00:04:21,696 --> 00:04:23,306
August, aren't you
going to join us?

61
00:04:23,437 --> 00:04:24,960
- No, I've got an interview
to get to.

62
00:04:25,090 --> 00:04:26,135
You can bring me up
to speed later.

63
00:04:26,266 --> 00:04:27,267
- Sure.

64
00:04:28,398 --> 00:04:30,139
Can I get you a coffee?

65
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:31,445
- Please.

66
00:04:34,274 --> 00:04:36,928
Adriana was
my interior designer.

67
00:04:38,278 --> 00:04:41,672
We met shortly after
I sold my first start-up.

68
00:04:41,803 --> 00:04:44,893
We've been together
just under eight years now.

69
00:04:45,023 --> 00:04:48,462
The first six, happy.
The rest...

70
00:04:50,246 --> 00:04:52,422
Well, I'm here, aren't I?

71
00:04:52,553 --> 00:04:56,426
It was the closest I'd ever come
to love at first sight.

72
00:04:57,427 --> 00:04:58,950
And now, she's got me wondering

73
00:04:59,081 --> 00:05:00,561
whether she ever
loved me at all.

74
00:05:01,388 --> 00:05:02,911
- A lot of people wonder that

75
00:05:03,041 --> 00:05:04,695
when they suspect
their spouse is cheating.

76
00:05:04,826 --> 00:05:05,957
- Right.

77
00:05:07,742 --> 00:05:10,962
- So, what initially made you
question her fidelity?

78
00:05:11,093 --> 00:05:13,704
- Oh, the usual stuff, I guess.

79
00:05:13,835 --> 00:05:15,793
Gradually, throughout
the years,

80
00:05:15,924 --> 00:05:17,404
I could sense her pulling away.

81
00:05:17,534 --> 00:05:19,406
I know I can take
some of the blame for that,

82
00:05:19,536 --> 00:05:22,713
I travel a lot for work
and she's always busy too.

83
00:05:22,844 --> 00:05:25,063
It's hard to find time
to be together.

84
00:05:25,194 --> 00:05:30,417
But when we do make
the time, it's... different.

85
00:05:30,547 --> 00:05:33,071
- Different how?

86
00:05:33,202 --> 00:05:34,943
- Well, for starters,
we stopped having sex.

87
00:05:36,074 --> 00:05:40,775
And she became difficult
to get a hold of,

88
00:05:40,905 --> 00:05:42,777
screening my calls,

89
00:05:42,907 --> 00:05:47,042
she started having
private conversations
behind closed doors.

90
00:05:47,172 --> 00:05:48,870
She never used to do that.

91
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,351
She's an interior designer.

92
00:05:51,481 --> 00:05:53,831
What could possibly be
so confidential?

93
00:05:54,876 --> 00:05:57,139
Do you need me to continue?

94
00:05:57,269 --> 00:06:00,708
- No. From the sounds of it,
you're completely justified

95
00:06:00,838 --> 00:06:03,232
in feeling the way you do.
- Oh, thanks.

96
00:06:03,363 --> 00:06:05,495
It's nice to know
I'm not losing my mind.

97
00:06:06,496 --> 00:06:08,411
- You're not. In my experience,

98
00:06:08,542 --> 00:06:10,848
it's always best
to trust your instincts.

99
00:06:12,633 --> 00:06:16,637
- Well, it'll be
a relief to finally get
to the bottom of this.

100
00:06:16,767 --> 00:06:18,856
Whatever the truth is.

101
00:06:18,987 --> 00:06:20,728
- I understand.

102
00:06:20,858 --> 00:06:24,906
- So, how does this work?
Do I have to sign something?

103
00:06:25,036 --> 00:06:27,778
- Uh, do you have
any questions for me?

104
00:06:27,909 --> 00:06:29,780
Am I the first investigator
you've met with?

105
00:06:29,911 --> 00:06:32,957
- No. I met with
Rudy Davis last week.

106
00:06:33,088 --> 00:06:36,657
- Oh, Rudy. How'd that go?
- He's a hack.

107
00:06:36,787 --> 00:06:39,094
- Wasn't gonna say.
- I've done my research.

108
00:06:39,224 --> 00:06:41,270
I've explored a few
other options and...

109
00:06:42,053 --> 00:06:43,403
I want you.

110
00:06:44,534 --> 00:06:46,014
- What makes you so sure?

111
00:06:47,755 --> 00:06:50,279
- Let's just say
I'm trusting my instincts.

112
00:06:52,107 --> 00:06:53,674
- I'll have August
send over a contract

113
00:06:53,804 --> 00:06:55,066
and we'll go from there.

114
00:06:55,197 --> 00:06:58,113
- Wonderful. Thank you.

115
00:07:36,586 --> 00:07:39,415
- Hey, Cami.
- Happy almost birthday.

116
00:07:39,546 --> 00:07:41,286
- Do you have to remind me?

117
00:07:41,417 --> 00:07:42,897
- What would you do without me?

118
00:07:43,027 --> 00:07:45,159
- Not have a birthday party,
for starters.

119
00:07:45,290 --> 00:07:47,641
- Oh, don't be such
a party pooper!

120
00:07:47,771 --> 00:07:50,382
This is your 35th! We have
to do something special.

121
00:07:50,513 --> 00:07:53,037
I've kind of invited someone
I want you to meet.

122
00:07:53,777 --> 00:07:55,866
- You know I don't do setups.

123
00:07:55,997 --> 00:07:59,870
- Look, sweetie, I know you
don't trust anyone.

124
00:08:00,001 --> 00:08:02,960
I get it. You're exposed
to a lot of bad guys

125
00:08:03,091 --> 00:08:04,788
doing what you do every day.

126
00:08:04,919 --> 00:08:07,704
But, not everybody cheats.

127
00:08:07,835 --> 00:08:09,837
I mean, just look
at Charles and I.

128
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:14,363
If you just let someone in,
just for once,

129
00:08:14,494 --> 00:08:16,147
maybe you can be
as happy as we are.

130
00:08:20,369 --> 00:08:21,936
How bad could it be?

131
00:08:22,066 --> 00:08:23,633
If I'm wrong,
I will leave you alone.

132
00:08:23,764 --> 00:08:25,461
No more setups.

133
00:08:28,725 --> 00:08:32,033
Hello? You there?

134
00:08:32,163 --> 00:08:34,209
- Alright, fine.
You can invite him.

135
00:08:34,338 --> 00:08:35,602
- Yes!

136
00:08:35,732 --> 00:08:37,038
- But if he turns out

137
00:08:37,168 --> 00:08:38,779
to be another dud,
you leave me alone?

138
00:08:38,909 --> 00:08:39,866
- Scout's honor.

139
00:08:41,172 --> 00:08:43,479
- I'll see you Friday.
- Love you!

140
00:08:43,610 --> 00:08:45,046
- Love you too.

141
00:11:48,446 --> 00:11:51,145
- Who you texting?
- Just Lucy.

142
00:11:51,275 --> 00:11:54,714
You ever meet Adriana or
Clive Cassel at the CATC ball?

143
00:11:54,844 --> 00:11:57,238
- Not that I know of, why?

144
00:11:57,368 --> 00:11:59,022
- Must be for a case
or something.

145
00:12:00,981 --> 00:12:02,678
- Uh, I got to get to work.

146
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:07,335
Hey.

147
00:12:08,075 --> 00:12:11,078
I love you.
- Love you, too.

148
00:12:24,874 --> 00:12:29,183
- Hey! Uh, just my usual.
And uh,

149
00:12:29,313 --> 00:12:30,706
a round for my friends.

150
00:12:32,229 --> 00:12:35,363
I can't believe it,
she's wearing a dress.

151
00:12:35,493 --> 00:12:39,715
- Nice. I should set you up
on blind dates more often.

152
00:12:39,846 --> 00:12:43,066
- No, you shouldn't.
This was so much work.

153
00:12:43,197 --> 00:12:44,851
- Can you grab...?
- Yeah.

154
00:12:48,115 --> 00:12:50,552
- Happy Birthday!
- Happy Birthday, Lucy.

155
00:12:52,380 --> 00:12:55,296
You guys!

156
00:12:56,906 --> 00:13:00,388
I love them!
These will come in handy!

157
00:13:00,518 --> 00:13:02,694
Thank you both so much.

158
00:13:02,825 --> 00:13:07,047
So, tell me about Mr. Wonderful.
- What? Remi?

159
00:13:07,177 --> 00:13:09,745
Well, he's... He's...

160
00:13:09,876 --> 00:13:11,094
He's wonderful.

161
00:13:13,488 --> 00:13:16,186
Unless you're already
spoken for, that is.

162
00:13:16,317 --> 00:13:18,319
I'm pretty sure he's kind of
the monogamous type.

163
00:13:18,449 --> 00:13:21,931
- Oh, that is August,
my new associate,

164
00:13:22,062 --> 00:13:23,541
wishing me a happy birthday.

165
00:13:23,672 --> 00:13:25,239
He has been a lifesaver,

166
00:13:25,369 --> 00:13:27,154
I honestly don't know how I did
anything without him.

167
00:13:30,810 --> 00:13:32,507
Thank you.

168
00:13:34,335 --> 00:13:36,032
Well, cheers.

169
00:13:36,163 --> 00:13:38,643
To best friends.
Thank you guys for doing this.

170
00:13:38,774 --> 00:13:40,863
- We love you, Lucy.
- Cheers.

171
00:13:40,994 --> 00:13:43,518
- So, seriously,
tell me about this guy.

172
00:13:43,648 --> 00:13:45,302
What's wrong with him?
Why is he single?

173
00:13:45,433 --> 00:13:47,870
- Well, I occasionally snore,

174
00:13:48,001 --> 00:13:51,091
casually drink and I may have
a slight shoe fetish.

175
00:13:51,221 --> 00:13:54,442
- Uh, well, those look like
regular old shoes to me.

176
00:13:56,052 --> 00:13:57,575
- I like her.

177
00:13:57,706 --> 00:13:59,360
Remi.

178
00:13:59,490 --> 00:14:01,797
- Lucy.
- Nice to meet you.

179
00:14:01,928 --> 00:14:03,581
- Well, there it is,
ladies and gentlemen.

180
00:14:03,712 --> 00:14:05,714
Love at first slight.

181
00:14:07,672 --> 00:14:12,025
Hey, I'm just really glad
the two of you got off
on the right foot!

182
00:14:12,155 --> 00:14:13,940
- Ugh!
- Wow.

183
00:14:14,070 --> 00:14:15,724
- Yeah.
- What?

184
00:14:16,681 --> 00:14:18,640
- Well, what do you think?

185
00:14:20,207 --> 00:14:23,863
He's nice, right? He likes you,
he asked me for your number.

186
00:14:23,993 --> 00:14:26,648
- I will admit,
I had a good time.

187
00:14:26,778 --> 00:14:28,650
- So, you gonna see him again?

188
00:14:29,390 --> 00:14:31,218
Charles can 100 % vouch for him.

189
00:14:31,348 --> 00:14:35,396
- Cami, I don't know.
- Take a chance!

190
00:14:35,526 --> 00:14:39,052
Life is full of unknowns,
but risks like this are
worth taking!

191
00:14:40,357 --> 00:14:42,794
Lucy, how many times
do I have to tell you

192
00:14:42,925 --> 00:14:46,015
they are not all bad guys?
- Okay! Fine!

193
00:14:46,146 --> 00:14:48,670
If you stop badgering me,
then I'll go out with him again.

194
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:50,324
- Now wasn't that easy?

195
00:14:51,455 --> 00:14:53,762
Your chariot awaits.

196
00:14:53,893 --> 00:14:54,850
- Ladies...

197
00:15:03,250 --> 00:15:04,555
- Thank you.

198
00:15:20,963 --> 00:15:22,617
- Sorry, boss.
Didn't mean to scare you.

199
00:15:24,271 --> 00:15:26,142
- That lunch?
- Yeah.

200
00:15:26,273 --> 00:15:28,492
- Then, I won't fire you.
- Thanks.

201
00:15:28,623 --> 00:15:30,625
If you need anything else,
I'll be at the office.

202
00:15:30,755 --> 00:15:31,931
- Thank you!

203
00:15:42,811 --> 00:15:44,639
Where are you going?

204
00:17:01,063 --> 00:17:02,673
And who might you be?

205
00:17:04,806 --> 00:17:06,199
Surprise!

206
00:17:23,128 --> 00:17:24,913
- Thank you for meeting me.

207
00:17:25,044 --> 00:17:26,654
- Of course.

208
00:17:26,784 --> 00:17:28,221
- What are you drinking?

209
00:17:29,091 --> 00:17:31,398
- Uh, I really shouldn't.

210
00:17:31,528 --> 00:17:33,530
I'm charging you
by the hour, remember?

211
00:17:34,270 --> 00:17:36,881
Uh... Manhattan.

212
00:17:38,579 --> 00:17:39,928
- On me.

213
00:17:40,059 --> 00:17:41,408
- Thanks.

214
00:17:41,538 --> 00:17:43,279
So, uh...

215
00:17:44,715 --> 00:17:47,414
Sorry to say I've been tailing
Adriana for a week

216
00:17:47,544 --> 00:17:49,285
and I have nothing
to show for it.

217
00:17:49,416 --> 00:17:50,982
- Oh?

218
00:17:51,113 --> 00:17:54,029
- There's no suspicious
activity.

219
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:55,596
Her phone log is clean,

220
00:17:55,726 --> 00:17:57,250
she goes to and from work
most days,

221
00:17:57,380 --> 00:18:00,514
consultations,
a homecoming party...

222
00:18:01,515 --> 00:18:02,820
I don't know what to tell you.

223
00:18:02,951 --> 00:18:04,692
I don't think
you need to keep me on.

224
00:18:05,649 --> 00:18:08,783
- Well, I appreciate
your honesty.

225
00:18:10,567 --> 00:18:11,786
- Thanks.

226
00:18:13,004 --> 00:18:15,181
- But, I want you to stay on.

227
00:18:16,443 --> 00:18:17,835
- You would?

228
00:18:17,966 --> 00:18:19,620
- She's up to something.

229
00:18:19,750 --> 00:18:22,057
You've only been
on the case for a week.

230
00:18:22,188 --> 00:18:24,190
I'm sure if you stay on longer,
something will come up.

231
00:18:24,842 --> 00:18:26,235
Call it intuition.

232
00:18:27,367 --> 00:18:29,412
- You really don't trust her.

233
00:18:29,543 --> 00:18:33,808
- Well, a wise woman once
told me to follow my instincts.

234
00:18:41,511 --> 00:18:42,556
Typical.

235
00:18:47,996 --> 00:18:49,084
- Someone you know?

236
00:18:49,215 --> 00:18:50,868
- No.

237
00:18:50,999 --> 00:18:52,783
Turns out,
I don't know him at all.

238
00:18:53,567 --> 00:18:55,917
- And what does that mean?

239
00:18:56,047 --> 00:18:57,353
- You don't want to know.

240
00:18:57,484 --> 00:18:58,789
- Try me.

241
00:19:00,791 --> 00:19:04,447
- Okay. Um...
We met last week.

242
00:19:04,578 --> 00:19:05,666
Thought he was interested.

243
00:19:08,451 --> 00:19:11,411
- Well, for what it's worth,
he's obviously an idiot.

244
00:19:13,152 --> 00:19:16,242
- Thank you.
But I'm the idiot.

245
00:19:16,372 --> 00:19:21,029
I let my friend convince me
to let my guard down

246
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:23,901
despite my better judgement,
I did.

247
00:19:24,032 --> 00:19:25,207
Serves me right.

248
00:19:25,338 --> 00:19:27,340
- No one deserves
to be deceived.

249
00:19:28,732 --> 00:19:30,517
- I know that better
than anyone.

250
00:19:30,647 --> 00:19:32,214
Look at what I do.

251
00:19:32,345 --> 00:19:33,998
- Right.

252
00:19:34,129 --> 00:19:38,655
So, what got you
into all of this?

253
00:19:38,786 --> 00:19:40,701
Private investigating?

254
00:19:43,660 --> 00:19:45,314
- Well...

255
00:19:45,445 --> 00:19:47,925
My dad left when I was little.

256
00:19:48,056 --> 00:19:51,494
Ran off with his secretary,
believe it or not.

257
00:19:52,626 --> 00:19:56,543
Blindsided my mom,
left her with nothing.

258
00:19:57,848 --> 00:19:59,850
Just seemed like the best way
to make sure

259
00:19:59,981 --> 00:20:01,200
it didn't happen
to someone else.

260
00:20:02,201 --> 00:20:04,464
- So, it's personal.
- Yeah.

261
00:20:05,856 --> 00:20:08,294
That and I always thought
I had killer instincts.

262
00:20:08,424 --> 00:20:09,991
Until now, that is.

263
00:20:10,121 --> 00:20:12,907
- Oh hey, don't let this guy
make you doubt yourself.

264
00:20:13,037 --> 00:20:15,649
We all misjudge people
once in a while.

265
00:20:17,128 --> 00:20:18,565
- I should have known better.

266
00:20:18,695 --> 00:20:20,393
This is why I don't date.

267
00:20:22,830 --> 00:20:24,092
- Ever?

268
00:20:24,223 --> 00:20:26,660
- I always saw trust
as a weakness.

269
00:20:29,097 --> 00:20:31,230
- That's a little harsh,
don't you think?

270
00:20:32,840 --> 00:20:34,885
- This coming from the guy
who asked me to follow his wife?

271
00:20:39,586 --> 00:20:41,109
I'm sorry.
That was uncalled for.

272
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:44,112
- No, don't apologize,
you're right.

273
00:20:45,679 --> 00:20:47,420
- Well, I should get going.
Thank you for the drink.

274
00:20:47,550 --> 00:20:49,900
- Stay.
- I really shouldn't.

275
00:20:50,031 --> 00:20:51,946
- Don't make me eat alone.

276
00:21:00,171 --> 00:21:03,740
- So, you don't eat alone.

277
00:21:03,871 --> 00:21:05,438
What's that about?

278
00:21:05,568 --> 00:21:07,178
- Oh I didn't say I don't.

279
00:21:07,309 --> 00:21:09,268
I just prefer not to.

280
00:21:12,096 --> 00:21:15,448
What? Is that so hard
to believe?

281
00:21:15,578 --> 00:21:17,319
- I don't know,
I just had you down

282
00:21:17,450 --> 00:21:18,668
as the independent type of guy.

283
00:21:18,799 --> 00:21:21,280
- Oh no, you've got me
all wrong.

284
00:21:21,410 --> 00:21:22,933
Total codependent.

285
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:26,110
- Really?
- I'm kidding.

286
00:21:27,808 --> 00:21:30,985
Though, I'm starting to think
no one is as independent as you.

287
00:21:31,899 --> 00:21:33,335
- How do you figure?

288
00:21:33,466 --> 00:21:35,598
- You live alone,
you don't date ever,

289
00:21:35,729 --> 00:21:37,383
you see trust as a weakness.

290
00:21:37,513 --> 00:21:39,950
- Okay. Point taken.

291
00:21:40,081 --> 00:21:43,171
- But come on, there must be
someone you can trust.

292
00:21:46,087 --> 00:21:47,567
- Cami.

293
00:21:47,697 --> 00:21:50,396
We've been best friends
since college.

294
00:21:50,526 --> 00:21:55,444
She's been by my side
despite my... intensity.

295
00:21:56,837 --> 00:21:59,100
Through thick and thin,
no matter what.

296
00:22:00,493 --> 00:22:02,843
For years it was me and Cami
against the world.

297
00:22:04,323 --> 00:22:05,498
- Was?

298
00:22:07,064 --> 00:22:09,371
- She married her husband
Charles a few years back.

299
00:22:09,502 --> 00:22:11,199
- Charles?

300
00:22:11,330 --> 00:22:14,333
And how do we feel
about Charles?

301
00:22:16,291 --> 00:22:19,816
- At first, I had my doubts,
as you can imagine.

302
00:22:21,209 --> 00:22:22,819
But he's actually become
a really good friend.

303
00:22:22,950 --> 00:22:25,082
And they're great together.

304
00:22:25,213 --> 00:22:27,171
They're like
the perfect couple.

305
00:22:27,302 --> 00:22:30,349
If there's anyone who could
convince me that...

306
00:22:32,568 --> 00:22:35,441
Never mind.
- What?

307
00:22:35,571 --> 00:22:37,530
- No, it's nothing.
It's stupid.

308
00:22:37,660 --> 00:22:40,315
- Come on, say it.
- No. Really.

309
00:22:40,446 --> 00:22:42,361
- You know I won't let up.

310
00:22:42,491 --> 00:22:43,840
- You are shockingly persistent.

311
00:22:45,929 --> 00:22:47,583
I was just gonna say,

312
00:22:47,714 --> 00:22:49,672
if there's anybody who could
make me believe in true love,

313
00:22:49,803 --> 00:22:51,239
it would be them.

314
00:22:52,893 --> 00:22:54,547
That was even sappier
out loud.

315
00:22:57,027 --> 00:22:58,725
- I think it's nice.

316
00:23:03,643 --> 00:23:08,082
I'm starting to think
you're more of a romantic
than you let on.

317
00:23:19,049 --> 00:23:20,399
You're sure it was him?

318
00:23:20,529 --> 00:23:23,663
- Positive.
- Damn, Luce. I'm sorry.

319
00:23:23,793 --> 00:23:27,710
I totally misjudged him.
- Yeah well, I did too.

320
00:23:27,841 --> 00:23:30,583
I'm just glad it ended before
it even started, you know?

321
00:23:30,713 --> 00:23:34,021
- What were you doing
at The Waverley, anyway?

322
00:23:34,151 --> 00:23:36,066
- I was meeting a client.

323
00:23:36,197 --> 00:23:38,852
- At The Waverley? Fancy.

324
00:23:38,982 --> 00:23:42,508
- Yeah, well, he insisted.
Actually, he um...

325
00:23:43,770 --> 00:23:45,946
He made me feel better
about the whole thing.

326
00:23:46,076 --> 00:23:48,470
We had dinner, talked.
It was nice.

327
00:23:48,601 --> 00:23:49,993
- Having dinner with a client?

328
00:23:50,124 --> 00:23:51,647
I never would've thought
I'd see the day.

329
00:23:51,778 --> 00:23:53,301
- Like I said, he insisted.

330
00:23:53,432 --> 00:23:54,998
- Hey, Luce.

331
00:23:55,129 --> 00:23:57,174
Cami mentioned a Cassel
the other day,

332
00:23:57,305 --> 00:23:58,785
is that the client?

333
00:23:59,699 --> 00:24:01,309
- His name is Clive.

334
00:24:03,006 --> 00:24:04,443
I don't know, there's like
something about him.

335
00:24:04,573 --> 00:24:06,532
I just feel like
I can talk to him.

336
00:24:06,662 --> 00:24:08,229
- Are you sure
this is a good idea, Lucy?

337
00:24:08,359 --> 00:24:09,796
Fraternizing with a client?

338
00:24:09,926 --> 00:24:11,580
He's obviously going
through a lot.

339
00:24:11,711 --> 00:24:14,583
Maybe you should just move
away from this one.

340
00:24:14,714 --> 00:24:16,846
- What are you talking about?
A job's a job!

341
00:24:16,977 --> 00:24:18,457
They just had dinner.
What's the big deal?

342
00:24:18,587 --> 00:24:20,850
- He's a married man, Cami.

343
00:24:20,981 --> 00:24:22,983
What do you even know
about this guy anyway?

344
00:24:23,113 --> 00:24:24,637
- She's a professional, babe.

345
00:24:24,767 --> 00:24:25,986
She's done her due diligence.

346
00:24:26,116 --> 00:24:27,378
Right, Luce?

347
00:24:27,509 --> 00:24:29,163
- Obviously.

348
00:24:29,293 --> 00:24:31,687
Look, I gotta get ready work.
I'll talk to you guys later.

349
00:24:31,818 --> 00:24:32,819
Bye.

350
00:24:41,697 --> 00:24:43,264
- What?

351
00:24:43,394 --> 00:24:44,874
- I really don't think
it's a good idea.

352
00:24:45,484 --> 00:24:46,615
- She knows what she's doing.

353
00:24:48,095 --> 00:24:49,183
- You're right.

354
00:24:50,140 --> 00:24:51,359
Okay.

355
00:24:53,317 --> 00:24:54,754
Love you.

356
00:24:54,884 --> 00:24:56,843
Oh, hey, I've got
that meeting tonight.

357
00:24:56,973 --> 00:24:58,497
So I'm gonna
be home late. Okay?

358
00:24:58,627 --> 00:25:00,847
- Yup. Love you too.
- Bye.

359
00:25:02,718 --> 00:25:04,198
- Have a good day!

360
00:25:49,678 --> 00:25:51,114
- Good work everyone.
Keep it up.

361
00:25:51,245 --> 00:25:53,508
Let's go! Let's go!
Train hard, let's go! Again!

362
00:25:53,639 --> 00:25:55,292
Alright, let's go, come on.

363
00:25:55,423 --> 00:25:57,077
Hard, let's go.
Come on, train hard.

364
00:25:57,207 --> 00:25:58,992
Cross, jab, cross, jab. Come on!

365
00:25:59,122 --> 00:26:00,515
Cross, jab, cross, jab.

366
00:26:00,646 --> 00:26:03,649
One, two, three, four!
Good, keep going.

367
00:26:03,779 --> 00:26:05,215
Come on, come on!

368
00:26:05,346 --> 00:26:07,261
Hey, Clive, you made it.
Come in.

369
00:26:08,567 --> 00:26:10,220
- Sorry I'm late.
- It's all good.

370
00:26:10,351 --> 00:26:12,092
Alright, let's go.

371
00:26:12,701 --> 00:26:14,660
Come on, guys, let's go!

372
00:26:14,790 --> 00:26:16,966
Come on, guys.
Let's keep training!

373
00:26:17,097 --> 00:26:18,402
Let's go, let's go, come on!

374
00:26:18,533 --> 00:26:20,143
Train hard, let's go,
come on!

375
00:26:20,274 --> 00:26:21,449
Ten more, come on!

376
00:26:25,279 --> 00:26:26,846
Next combination.

377
00:26:29,849 --> 00:26:32,373
Let's go, Lucy! Come on, hard!
Come on! Don't slack off.

378
00:26:32,503 --> 00:26:34,941
Come on! 10 more! 10 more!

379
00:26:35,071 --> 00:26:36,464
Let's go!

380
00:26:36,595 --> 00:26:39,598
Okay, listen up,
time to pair up.

381
00:26:39,728 --> 00:26:42,035
Try and team up with someone you
haven't worked with yet, okay?

382
00:26:42,165 --> 00:26:43,602
Let's go, find somebody.

383
00:26:43,732 --> 00:26:45,516
Let's go, come on,
don't waste time.

384
00:26:45,647 --> 00:26:46,822
- Hey!

385
00:26:48,215 --> 00:26:50,957
So what do you say?
Partners?

386
00:26:52,349 --> 00:26:53,742
- Sure.
- Alright.

387
00:26:56,005 --> 00:26:57,528
- Jab, cross!
Again, two more times.

388
00:26:57,659 --> 00:26:59,879
Jab, cross.
Let's go, let's go!

389
00:27:00,009 --> 00:27:01,707
Okay, next combo, Lucy,
next combo.

390
00:27:01,837 --> 00:27:04,318
Right cross, left hook,
right cross.

391
00:27:04,448 --> 00:27:05,928
Don't give up, come on,
everybody!

392
00:27:06,059 --> 00:27:07,495
Come on, I see you slacking
back there, come on!

393
00:27:08,975 --> 00:27:11,455
Get your ass in gear,
let's go, come on, guys!

394
00:27:11,586 --> 00:27:13,501
There it is, yeah, you got it.

395
00:27:17,026 --> 00:27:19,812
- That's quite
the right hook you've got.

396
00:27:20,856 --> 00:27:22,292
- It comes in handy.

397
00:27:22,423 --> 00:27:23,990
You'd be surprised the number
of unsavory characters

398
00:27:24,120 --> 00:27:25,208
I've had to use it on.

399
00:27:25,731 --> 00:27:27,297
- I don't doubt it.

400
00:27:27,428 --> 00:27:29,648
- I've never seen you here
before. New hobby?

401
00:27:30,431 --> 00:27:31,650
- That obvious, huh?

402
00:27:32,694 --> 00:27:34,304
- You held your own.

403
00:27:34,435 --> 00:27:37,917
- Yeah, well, I'm thinking
about investing in the studio.

404
00:27:38,047 --> 00:27:40,180
So, figured I'd come
check it out.

405
00:27:40,920 --> 00:27:42,182
- And?

406
00:27:43,966 --> 00:27:46,360
- I can definitely see
the appeal.

407
00:27:49,058 --> 00:27:50,669
- Well, I should get going.

408
00:27:50,799 --> 00:27:52,758
I don't want my employer
to think I'm slacking off.

409
00:27:52,888 --> 00:27:54,194
- Yeah. Of course.

410
00:27:55,804 --> 00:27:57,676
Nice running into you,
Lucy Thompson.

411
00:28:48,814 --> 00:28:50,250
- Have a good night.
Thank you.

412
00:29:12,402 --> 00:29:13,621
- I know you're following me.

413
00:29:15,666 --> 00:29:17,103
I don't want to hear it,

414
00:29:17,233 --> 00:29:19,409
I know Clive put you up to this.

415
00:29:19,540 --> 00:29:22,456
You're not the first person he's
hired to chase me around town.

416
00:29:22,586 --> 00:29:24,327
He's not who you think he is.

417
00:29:25,067 --> 00:29:26,416
I'd be careful if I were you.

418
00:32:00,048 --> 00:32:03,269
- Dean Calvet plus one, bar.

419
00:32:30,165 --> 00:32:31,645
Clive. Hi.

420
00:32:31,775 --> 00:32:33,777
- Hi. I hope I'm not
calling too early.

421
00:32:33,908 --> 00:32:35,823
- No, not at all.
I'm actually at the office.

422
00:32:35,954 --> 00:32:37,999
- Wow. The reviews online
weren't kidding

423
00:32:38,130 --> 00:32:40,045
when they said
you were dedicated.

424
00:32:40,175 --> 00:32:42,134
I was going to see
if you wanted a coffee.

425
00:32:42,264 --> 00:32:44,701
- Yeah, actually,
that would be great.

426
00:32:44,832 --> 00:32:47,487
Um, there's been
a development with your wife,

427
00:32:47,617 --> 00:32:49,184
I'm just not sure
what it is yet.

428
00:32:49,315 --> 00:32:51,882
Do you know a Dean Calvet?

429
00:32:52,013 --> 00:32:55,147
- Uh, no. Why?

430
00:32:55,277 --> 00:32:56,539
- She had dinner with him
last night.

431
00:32:56,670 --> 00:32:58,019
I was hoping maybe
you knew who he was.

432
00:32:58,150 --> 00:33:00,674
- No. I've never heard
that name before.

433
00:33:00,804 --> 00:33:02,676
- I've got a couple photos.

434
00:33:02,806 --> 00:33:04,069
Maybe you could come by
and identify him?

435
00:33:04,199 --> 00:33:06,201
- Absolutely.
I'll be by shortly

436
00:33:06,332 --> 00:33:07,376
with your coffee
and take a look.

437
00:33:07,507 --> 00:33:08,856
- Great.

438
00:33:11,163 --> 00:33:14,209
They didn't so much
as kiss goodbye.

439
00:33:14,340 --> 00:33:17,125
So they're definitely not
romantically involved,

440
00:33:17,256 --> 00:33:20,302
but she did hand him an envelope
right before he got in the Uber.

441
00:33:20,433 --> 00:33:22,913
So you're right,
there's something going on,

442
00:33:23,044 --> 00:33:24,437
I just don't know
what it is yet.

443
00:33:24,567 --> 00:33:27,701
- Well, I don't
recognize him, but...

444
00:33:28,963 --> 00:33:31,096
What happened after
the envelope?

445
00:33:31,226 --> 00:33:34,360
- He just got in the Uber
and then I followed her home.

446
00:33:36,014 --> 00:33:38,668
- What?
So, you were at my place?

447
00:33:39,278 --> 00:33:40,322
- Yeah.

448
00:33:41,193 --> 00:33:42,194
Why?

449
00:33:43,978 --> 00:33:45,327
- Did you see me?

450
00:33:46,937 --> 00:33:47,895
- Yeah.

451
00:33:49,375 --> 00:33:52,378
She came in, went straight
to the kitchen,

452
00:33:52,508 --> 00:33:55,207
kissed you.
That's when I left.

453
00:33:56,251 --> 00:33:57,557
- Lucy...

454
00:33:59,994 --> 00:34:01,343
Nothing happened.

455
00:34:03,128 --> 00:34:06,044
- It doesn't matter.
She's your wife.

456
00:34:07,306 --> 00:34:09,221
- We're not in love anymore.

457
00:34:12,614 --> 00:34:14,878
- Then why do you care
if she's having an affair?

458
00:34:15,009 --> 00:34:16,750
Why don't you just leave her?

459
00:34:17,533 --> 00:34:19,187
- It's not that simple.

460
00:34:20,536 --> 00:34:22,495
I need to prove
she's cheating

461
00:34:22,625 --> 00:34:25,759
or else she'll fight me
for everything in the divorce.

462
00:34:27,021 --> 00:34:28,543
- So, it's about the money.

463
00:34:31,156 --> 00:34:32,722
- It was...

464
00:34:35,725 --> 00:34:37,945
But it's not anymore.

465
00:34:41,079 --> 00:34:42,428
- What's it about?

466
00:34:51,001 --> 00:34:54,440
- Lucy... it's about you.

467
00:34:59,227 --> 00:35:00,750
- I think you should go.

468
00:35:03,318 --> 00:35:04,624
- Yeah.

469
00:35:05,407 --> 00:35:06,930
Right. I'm sorry.

470
00:35:07,061 --> 00:35:08,802
- No. I'm sorry.
- It's just...

471
00:35:11,979 --> 00:35:15,113
I've never felt this way
about anyone.

472
00:35:16,114 --> 00:35:17,767
- Clive, I...

473
00:35:19,334 --> 00:35:20,466
- What?

474
00:35:23,556 --> 00:35:25,297
- I can't cross this line.

475
00:35:31,607 --> 00:35:33,131
- I understand.

476
00:35:35,002 --> 00:35:36,134
I'll go.

477
00:35:41,661 --> 00:35:43,837
- I'll let you know if I find
anything else about your wife.

478
00:35:43,967 --> 00:35:45,012
- Yeah.

479
00:37:20,107 --> 00:37:21,064
- Lucy!

480
00:37:24,459 --> 00:37:25,765
Sorry I'm late.

481
00:37:25,895 --> 00:37:28,333
The line-up at the coffee bar
was nuts.

482
00:37:28,463 --> 00:37:30,160
Damn hipsters!

483
00:37:30,291 --> 00:37:32,728
I'm in here. Come on in.

484
00:37:34,730 --> 00:37:36,863
- Oh, Mr. Cassel,
good morning.

485
00:37:38,386 --> 00:37:40,214
I'd have brought you a coffee
if I knew you were here.

486
00:37:40,345 --> 00:37:41,998
- Clive brought coffee.

487
00:37:42,129 --> 00:37:43,565
I got some pictures
of this guy last night

488
00:37:43,696 --> 00:37:45,872
and Clive was kind enough
to drop by last minute.

489
00:37:46,002 --> 00:37:48,788
- Thanks, August.
I really do need to get going.

490
00:37:48,918 --> 00:37:50,964
- Thanks for coming by.
- Not a problem.

491
00:37:55,577 --> 00:37:58,450
- You okay?
- Yeah, I'm good.

492
00:37:59,233 --> 00:38:01,061
Dean Calvet. Got these photos

493
00:38:01,191 --> 00:38:03,063
of him with Adriana Cassel
last night.

494
00:38:03,193 --> 00:38:05,283
I need you to help me figure out
how they know each other.

495
00:38:06,240 --> 00:38:08,634
- Okay. I'll do some digging.

496
00:39:10,304 --> 00:39:11,218
Ah!

497
00:39:26,973 --> 00:39:29,236
- Okay, you ready?
Come on, let's go! Jab!

498
00:39:30,237 --> 00:39:32,979
Double jab! Good, okay.

499
00:39:33,109 --> 00:39:35,808
Ready? Let's go, fast!
Right hand

500
00:39:35,938 --> 00:39:37,505
Duck! Here we go again!

501
00:39:43,859 --> 00:39:44,904
Ah!

502
00:39:46,384 --> 00:39:49,256
- I'm so sorry!
- What's wrong with you?!

503
00:39:49,387 --> 00:39:51,171
- I was distracted, I'm sorry.
Are you okay?

504
00:39:51,301 --> 00:39:53,303
- Yeah, it's okay.

505
00:39:53,434 --> 00:39:55,958
Alright, everyone,
let's switch partners.

506
00:39:56,089 --> 00:39:57,264
Come on, let's go!

507
00:40:10,408 --> 00:40:11,757
Charles?

508
00:40:11,887 --> 00:40:13,280
Charles!

509
00:40:19,286 --> 00:40:20,548
- Luce! Hey.

510
00:40:21,375 --> 00:40:23,377
What are you doing here?

511
00:40:23,508 --> 00:40:25,597
- I just finished boxing.

512
00:40:25,727 --> 00:40:27,642
Why are you
on this side of town?

513
00:40:27,773 --> 00:40:29,775
- Oh, I'm just meeting
a potential client.

514
00:40:31,080 --> 00:40:32,734
- Here?
- Yeah. He insisted.

515
00:40:32,865 --> 00:40:34,867
He owns a couple
of these places.

516
00:40:34,997 --> 00:40:38,392
- Ah, an underground gambling
ring leader.

517
00:40:38,523 --> 00:40:40,176
Say no more.
- Yeah.

518
00:40:40,307 --> 00:40:42,135
That's why they pay me
the big bucks.

519
00:40:43,702 --> 00:40:45,181
- Well, I won't keep you.
- Nice seeing you.

520
00:40:45,312 --> 00:40:46,444
Hey, Luce?

521
00:40:49,011 --> 00:40:52,101
Would you just mind not telling
Cami about this?

522
00:40:52,885 --> 00:40:54,452
You know how she worries.

523
00:40:56,584 --> 00:40:59,805
- Sure. Okay.
- Great.

524
00:42:20,276 --> 00:42:21,539
- Hey!

525
00:42:31,636 --> 00:42:35,161
- I just don't think
this is something John Cutler
would be capable of.

526
00:42:35,291 --> 00:42:37,903
- Yeah, me neither,
just doesn't fit the profile.

527
00:42:39,382 --> 00:42:43,561
- Well, then, it leaves us
with Dimitri Alexander.

528
00:42:45,606 --> 00:42:46,781
What's his story?

529
00:42:46,912 --> 00:42:49,567
- Last I checked,
Dimitri was in jail.

530
00:42:49,697 --> 00:42:50,959
- Okay. What happened?

531
00:42:51,438 --> 00:42:53,048
- I put him there.

532
00:42:53,179 --> 00:42:55,529
This was years ago when
I was doing surveillance

533
00:42:55,660 --> 00:42:57,183
for the police department.

534
00:42:57,313 --> 00:42:58,967
They had me tailing him
for weeks to gather evidence

535
00:42:59,098 --> 00:43:00,926
against him
in a drug-related incident.

536
00:43:01,056 --> 00:43:03,102
Turns out he wasn't just
into drugs.

537
00:43:04,146 --> 00:43:05,495
He had a thing
for beating his wife.

538
00:43:07,019 --> 00:43:10,109
I testified against him.
Put him away for a long time.

539
00:43:10,239 --> 00:43:12,285
Well, interesting.

540
00:43:13,416 --> 00:43:14,592
- What?

541
00:43:16,855 --> 00:43:18,944
- Well, it says here
Dimitri Alexander was let out
on parole last week.

542
00:43:19,945 --> 00:43:22,774
- Are you kidding me?
- No.

543
00:43:24,602 --> 00:43:26,299
Wait a minute, where you going?
- I'm going to El Caballito.

544
00:43:26,429 --> 00:43:27,953
That's the bar he used to run

545
00:43:28,083 --> 00:43:29,302
his business out of.
- Hold on.

546
00:43:29,432 --> 00:43:30,695
- I'm not leaving this
to the cops.

547
00:43:30,825 --> 00:43:32,174
They couldn't put him away
without me last time.

548
00:43:32,305 --> 00:43:33,567
I'm not trusting them
to do it now.

549
00:43:33,698 --> 00:43:35,308
- Okay, Lucy, sit down. Please.

550
00:43:40,835 --> 00:43:43,882
Listen, just leave this
to me, alright?

551
00:43:44,012 --> 00:43:46,798
Take the day. I will go
through the files,

552
00:43:46,928 --> 00:43:48,538
I'll come up
with some questions.

553
00:43:48,669 --> 00:43:50,845
It's not gonna get us anywhere
if you go over there

554
00:43:50,976 --> 00:43:52,717
and get hurt by a violent
wife-beater

555
00:43:52,847 --> 00:43:54,457
who has a personal vendetta
against you.

556
00:43:56,024 --> 00:43:56,938
- You're right.

557
00:43:58,766 --> 00:44:01,551
- Now, go home, take the day.
You've been through a lot.

558
00:44:01,682 --> 00:44:03,728
- I can't go home.

559
00:44:03,858 --> 00:44:06,382
I've got to get back
to the Cassel case.

560
00:44:06,513 --> 00:44:08,602
Adriana's supposed
to be going out of town
with her sister tonight

561
00:44:08,733 --> 00:44:10,125
and I still don't know
who that guy was

562
00:44:10,256 --> 00:44:11,561
she went out for dinner
with the other night.

563
00:44:11,692 --> 00:44:12,780
- Lucy, breathe.

564
00:44:13,955 --> 00:44:15,653
I'm sure Clive will
understand

565
00:44:15,783 --> 00:44:17,829
if you take one day
for yourself.

566
00:47:12,481 --> 00:47:13,613
- Who's there?

567
00:47:13,743 --> 00:47:14,962
- It's Clive.

568
00:47:22,535 --> 00:47:23,536
- Hi.

569
00:47:24,493 --> 00:47:25,886
What are you doing here?

570
00:47:26,669 --> 00:47:29,194
- I just needed to see you.

571
00:47:31,761 --> 00:47:33,024
You alright?

572
00:47:35,200 --> 00:47:36,375
Hey...

573
00:47:44,687 --> 00:47:46,820
- I don't know what to do.

574
00:47:46,951 --> 00:47:49,214
I don't even feel safe
in my own home anymore.

575
00:47:49,344 --> 00:47:51,042
- It's completely
understandable.

576
00:47:51,172 --> 00:47:53,261
Someone breaks into
your house

577
00:47:53,392 --> 00:47:55,089
and with this Dimitri guy
out there...

578
00:47:55,220 --> 00:47:57,048
- Yeah.

579
00:47:57,178 --> 00:47:58,701
And then,
there's the nightmares.

580
00:47:58,832 --> 00:48:01,139
I feel like I'm losing my mind.

581
00:48:01,269 --> 00:48:03,576
- You're not losing your mind,
Lucy.

582
00:48:03,706 --> 00:48:06,013
Hey. Look at me.

583
00:48:07,101 --> 00:48:08,842
You're being personally
targeted.

584
00:48:08,973 --> 00:48:11,889
This is stressful and scary

585
00:48:12,019 --> 00:48:14,195
and this guy is obviously
deranged.

586
00:48:14,326 --> 00:48:16,415
Something like this would be
enough to rattle anyone.

587
00:48:19,287 --> 00:48:20,898
- So what do I do?

588
00:48:23,248 --> 00:48:25,728
- You could get out of town
for a few days.

589
00:48:25,859 --> 00:48:29,254
At least until August gets some
information out of this guy.

590
00:48:30,081 --> 00:48:33,084
- So what, just... up and leave?

591
00:48:34,041 --> 00:48:36,696
What about your wife?
What about the case?

592
00:48:36,826 --> 00:48:39,177
- You know, Adriana is
out of town with her sister

593
00:48:39,307 --> 00:48:40,395
for the next few days.

594
00:48:40,830 --> 00:48:42,397
- Or so she says.

595
00:48:43,181 --> 00:48:45,183
This could be our smoking gun.

596
00:48:45,313 --> 00:48:47,402
Don't you want to know
where she's really going?

597
00:48:47,533 --> 00:48:50,753
- She's going to Vale to see
her sister and her nieces.

598
00:48:50,884 --> 00:48:53,669
She goes every year, she'll be
posting about it all weekend.

599
00:48:53,800 --> 00:48:55,106
- Yeah, but...

600
00:48:56,107 --> 00:48:58,936
- You can take a break from
the case, Lucy.

601
00:49:00,111 --> 00:49:01,460
Seriously.

602
00:49:05,290 --> 00:49:06,769
It can wait.

603
00:49:09,642 --> 00:49:12,471
- Well...
Where would we even go?

604
00:49:17,389 --> 00:49:18,477
- Trust me.

605
00:49:28,226 --> 00:49:30,489
- August, hi.

606
00:49:30,619 --> 00:49:33,144
- I'm just calling to let
you know that Dimitri no longer

607
00:49:33,274 --> 00:49:34,623
runs his business
out of El Caballito.

608
00:49:35,755 --> 00:49:38,149
- Damn.
- No, no, it's okay.

609
00:49:38,279 --> 00:49:41,021
I've managed to find
where his new front is.

610
00:49:41,152 --> 00:49:42,936
It's a nightclub called
The Blue Grotto.

611
00:49:43,067 --> 00:49:44,285
I'm gonna pay him a visit
later tonight.

612
00:49:44,416 --> 00:49:45,939
- Nice work.

613
00:49:46,070 --> 00:49:47,549
I should come with you.

614
00:49:47,680 --> 00:49:49,160
- No, no.
It's better if I go alone.

615
00:49:49,290 --> 00:49:50,900
He doesn't know who I am

616
00:49:51,031 --> 00:49:52,728
and he won't know I'm connected
to you in any way.

617
00:49:52,859 --> 00:49:56,428
- Right.
Okay, well, be careful.

618
00:49:56,558 --> 00:49:57,733
- Yeah. Of course.

619
00:49:57,864 --> 00:49:59,474
- I, uh... I should let you know

620
00:49:59,605 --> 00:50:01,302
I'm gonna be out of town
for the next few days.

621
00:50:01,433 --> 00:50:02,956
- Oh. That sounds great.

622
00:50:03,087 --> 00:50:04,740
That should be good for you.

623
00:50:04,871 --> 00:50:06,786
- Yeah. At least until you get
something out of Dimitri.

624
00:50:06,916 --> 00:50:09,528
- Yeah. Couldn't agree more.
Where you heading?

625
00:50:09,658 --> 00:50:12,270
- A cabin in Meadowbrooke.

626
00:50:12,400 --> 00:50:13,880
- Nice. You're renting?

627
00:50:14,011 --> 00:50:17,275
- No, it's... it's a friend's.

628
00:50:17,405 --> 00:50:19,059
- Nice friend.

629
00:50:20,452 --> 00:50:22,193
I've heard there's some pretty
fancy cottages out that way.

630
00:50:22,323 --> 00:50:24,543
- Yeah. For sure.

631
00:50:25,718 --> 00:50:27,372
- You okay?

632
00:50:27,894 --> 00:50:29,765
- All things considered?

633
00:50:29,896 --> 00:50:32,116
Yeah. I'm good.

634
00:50:32,246 --> 00:50:34,161
- Alright.
Enjoy the countryside. And...

635
00:50:34,292 --> 00:50:35,771
I'll give you a call after
I talk to Dimitri.

636
00:50:35,902 --> 00:50:37,860
- Sounds good.

637
00:50:37,991 --> 00:50:39,688
Everything okay?

638
00:50:39,819 --> 00:50:42,474
- Yeah. I don't know...

639
00:50:42,604 --> 00:50:44,215
I just feel like he knows
I'm hiding something.

640
00:50:44,345 --> 00:50:46,130
- Well, I wouldn't worry
about him.

641
00:50:46,260 --> 00:50:47,653
You're the boss.

642
00:50:47,783 --> 00:50:50,177
If he finds out, he'll just
have to deal with it.

643
00:51:08,978 --> 00:51:10,241
- This is amazing.

644
00:51:11,372 --> 00:51:12,765
- Thanks.

645
00:51:14,245 --> 00:51:16,247
It's been in my family
for generations.

646
00:51:17,987 --> 00:51:20,077
Oh, it's one of
my favorite places.

647
00:51:22,992 --> 00:51:25,169
- Thank you for
bringing me here.

648
00:51:55,590 --> 00:51:57,026
- Name?
- Hey. No.

649
00:51:57,157 --> 00:51:59,899
I'm not on your list.
I'm here to see Dimitri.

650
00:52:00,029 --> 00:52:02,206
- No one gets in
if they're not on the list.

651
00:52:02,336 --> 00:52:03,729
- I'm one of
his business partners.

652
00:52:03,859 --> 00:52:05,209
He's expecting me.

653
00:52:05,339 --> 00:52:06,688
- Yeah, well, Dimitri
is not here right now.

654
00:52:06,819 --> 00:52:09,169
- Oh yeah?

655
00:52:09,300 --> 00:52:12,129
Why don't you let me go inside
and have a look for myself?

656
00:52:12,259 --> 00:52:15,828
- Like I said, no one gets in if
they're not on the list.

657
00:52:17,308 --> 00:52:19,266
- Right.

658
00:52:27,840 --> 00:52:29,233
Dimitri.

659
00:52:29,363 --> 00:52:30,843
I need to talk to you.

660
00:52:33,062 --> 00:52:34,107
Damn!

661
00:53:10,274 --> 00:53:11,710
- Hmm.

662
00:53:47,224 --> 00:53:48,921
So, what do you think?

663
00:53:49,051 --> 00:53:51,184
Oh, I'm sorry.

664
00:53:51,315 --> 00:53:53,534
You're obviously
still a little on edge.

665
00:53:53,665 --> 00:53:56,885
Well, why don't I put
on a fire

666
00:53:57,016 --> 00:53:58,800
and you can pour us some wine?

667
00:53:58,931 --> 00:54:00,759
- That sounds great.
- Okay.

668
00:54:00,889 --> 00:54:02,239
I'm sorry.

669
00:54:16,905 --> 00:54:18,690
- What?

670
00:54:18,820 --> 00:54:20,692
I'm just looking at you.

671
00:54:24,565 --> 00:54:27,786
Oh, my God. That smile
is gonna be the death of me.

672
00:54:33,182 --> 00:54:34,793
- What is it about you?

673
00:54:36,577 --> 00:54:37,404
- What do you mean?

674
00:54:40,538 --> 00:54:42,757
- I never let my guard down.

675
00:54:45,369 --> 00:54:46,805
But around you...

676
00:54:49,068 --> 00:54:50,983
I know I just met you.

677
00:54:54,334 --> 00:54:56,293
I don't know,
it just feels like...

678
00:54:58,991 --> 00:55:00,775
- Like an instinct?

679
00:55:02,821 --> 00:55:04,779
- Yeah.

680
00:55:52,392 --> 00:55:53,654
- Come on, Dimitri.

681
00:55:53,785 --> 00:55:55,700
I know you're down there.

682
00:56:01,096 --> 00:56:02,881
- What do you want, man?

683
00:56:04,230 --> 00:56:05,623
- I just wanna talk to you.

684
00:56:05,753 --> 00:56:07,364
- What do you wanna know?

685
00:56:09,583 --> 00:56:11,368
- Where were you the night
of April 27th?

686
00:56:17,025 --> 00:56:18,462
Let me phrase it another way.

687
00:56:18,592 --> 00:56:20,333
Did you break into
Lucy Thompson's house?

688
00:56:20,464 --> 00:56:21,726
- Yeah.

689
00:56:21,856 --> 00:56:23,249
- Why?

690
00:56:24,206 --> 00:56:25,773
- I was paid by some guy
to mess with her.

691
00:56:25,904 --> 00:56:28,646
That bitch ruined my life,
seemed like a win-win.

692
00:56:28,776 --> 00:56:31,213
- Someone paid you to break
into her house?

693
00:56:31,344 --> 00:56:35,827
- Yeah, some guy named Clive,
gave me 10 grand,

694
00:56:35,957 --> 00:56:38,003
said it was time for the hunter
to become the hunted

695
00:56:38,133 --> 00:56:40,571
or some crap like that.
- Clive...

696
00:56:47,142 --> 00:56:48,709
- Hey!

697
00:56:48,840 --> 00:56:50,102
Who are you?

698
00:56:51,190 --> 00:56:52,757
Who the hell are you?

699
00:56:57,196 --> 00:56:58,850
- Lucy, pick up the phone.

700
00:56:58,980 --> 00:57:00,591
- Hi, you've reached
Lucy Thompson...

701
00:57:00,721 --> 00:57:02,375
- Lucy, pick up the phone!

702
00:57:02,506 --> 00:57:04,246
- Please leave a detailed
message and I'll get back...

703
00:57:31,665 --> 00:57:32,927
- Meadowbrooke?

704
00:57:42,589 --> 00:57:44,461
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

705
00:57:51,119 --> 00:57:52,991
- How are you feeling?

706
00:57:54,079 --> 00:57:55,602
- I'm feeling a lot better.

707
00:57:56,777 --> 00:57:58,475
- This place has that effect.

708
00:57:59,650 --> 00:58:01,608
- I think you have that effect.

709
00:58:01,739 --> 00:58:03,828
Do I?

710
00:58:12,837 --> 00:58:14,142
Coffee?

711
00:58:14,926 --> 00:58:16,841
Thanks.

712
00:58:17,929 --> 00:58:19,017
- I'll be right back.

713
00:58:44,912 --> 00:58:45,870
- Come on.

714
00:58:47,001 --> 00:58:48,437
- There you are.
- Hey.

715
00:58:48,568 --> 00:58:50,222
Ooh.

716
00:58:50,352 --> 00:58:52,529
Didn't mean to sneak up on you.
Everything okay down here?

717
00:58:52,659 --> 00:58:54,356
- No! August left me a voicemail

718
00:58:54,487 --> 00:58:56,271
and I can't check it
because I have no signal.

719
00:58:56,402 --> 00:58:58,491
- Yeah, the reception here
is pretty awful.

720
00:58:58,622 --> 00:59:00,014
- I don't know what to do.

721
00:59:00,145 --> 00:59:02,626
This could be important.
It could be about Dimitri.

722
00:59:03,714 --> 00:59:06,020
I shouldn't have come here.
- Oh, hey, hey.

723
00:59:06,151 --> 00:59:07,892
It's a good thing you came.

724
00:59:08,022 --> 00:59:09,937
You needed this. Remember?

725
00:59:10,068 --> 00:59:11,722
- I need to get back
to the city.

726
00:59:14,072 --> 00:59:16,378
- I know where we can get
a signal. Come on.

727
00:59:19,599 --> 00:59:21,035
Try now.

728
00:59:23,560 --> 00:59:24,865
- Two bars.

729
00:59:25,692 --> 00:59:27,259
That should do it.

730
00:59:29,566 --> 00:59:31,132
You don't have to wait for me
if you don't want to.

731
00:59:31,263 --> 00:59:32,264
- No, I'll wait.

732
00:59:32,394 --> 00:59:33,918
I want to know what he said.

733
00:59:51,849 --> 00:59:53,111
What did he say?

734
00:59:55,287 --> 00:59:57,594
Lucy, hey! Hey!

735
00:59:59,073 --> 01:00:01,728
Lucy, what did he say? Lucy!

736
01:00:01,859 --> 01:00:03,600
Just talk to me!
- It was you!

737
01:00:03,730 --> 01:00:06,646
You paid Dimitri.
I can't believe I trusted you.

738
01:00:06,777 --> 01:00:09,170
- I've never even met Dimitri.
Lucy, stop! I love you.

739
01:00:18,136 --> 01:00:19,572
- Oh, my God.

740
01:00:19,703 --> 01:00:21,618
No!

741
01:00:24,533 --> 01:00:25,839
Oh, my God!

742
01:00:28,625 --> 01:00:29,800
- Lucy!

743
01:00:30,757 --> 01:00:32,977
What did you do?

744
01:00:39,984 --> 01:00:41,333
Come on.

745
01:00:57,131 --> 01:00:58,350
- Thanks.

746
01:01:03,355 --> 01:01:04,922
- What's going on?

747
01:01:05,052 --> 01:01:06,793
- Self-defense.
They're not gonna hold me.

748
01:01:06,924 --> 01:01:09,013
- Great, then come on.
Let's get out of here.

749
01:01:15,672 --> 01:01:18,196
So... you were sleeping
with the client.

750
01:01:20,589 --> 01:01:22,853
I'm sorry. I'm just trying
to make sense of all this.

751
01:01:22,983 --> 01:01:25,029
- It was stupid, I know.

752
01:01:26,813 --> 01:01:28,380
I can't talk about it
right now.

753
01:01:28,510 --> 01:01:30,034
- Okay.

754
01:01:32,601 --> 01:01:35,866
- Thank you... for warning me.

755
01:01:37,694 --> 01:01:40,000
Who knows what would have
happened if I'd stayed there
with him.

756
01:01:41,045 --> 01:01:42,350
- Hey.

757
01:01:42,960 --> 01:01:44,701
We're in this together.

758
01:02:19,605 --> 01:02:22,303
- Lucy, where the hell were you?

759
01:02:22,434 --> 01:02:24,044
I tried calling.

760
01:02:24,175 --> 01:02:25,872
- Thank you for being there.

761
01:02:26,003 --> 01:02:28,266
- Of course. Get some rest.

762
01:02:29,702 --> 01:02:32,618
- Uh, August,
this is my best friend Cami.

763
01:02:33,184 --> 01:02:34,838
- It's nice to finally meet you!

764
01:02:34,968 --> 01:02:36,491
- Pleasure to meet you.

765
01:02:36,622 --> 01:02:38,450
I should go.

766
01:02:38,580 --> 01:02:40,191
Call me if you need anything.

767
01:02:40,321 --> 01:02:41,627
- I will.

768
01:02:44,151 --> 01:02:46,110
- What's going on?

769
01:02:47,894 --> 01:02:50,114
- Clive's dead.

770
01:02:50,244 --> 01:02:52,029
- What?!

771
01:02:52,159 --> 01:02:53,682
- It was an accident.

772
01:02:53,813 --> 01:02:55,380
I was defending myself.

773
01:02:55,510 --> 01:02:57,425
He wasn't who I thought
he was at all.

774
01:02:58,339 --> 01:03:00,211
I was at his cabin.

775
01:03:00,341 --> 01:03:02,604
He was the one behind
the break-in.

776
01:03:03,780 --> 01:03:05,564
He was after me the whole time.

777
01:03:05,694 --> 01:03:07,218
- Oh, honey.

778
01:03:07,348 --> 01:03:08,654
Let's get you inside.

779
01:03:09,350 --> 01:03:10,787
Come on.

780
01:03:15,879 --> 01:03:17,663
So, what happens next?

781
01:03:20,100 --> 01:03:21,319
- I don't know.

782
01:03:24,539 --> 01:03:26,280
But right now, we drink.

783
01:03:56,180 --> 01:03:57,355
Hey.

784
01:03:58,617 --> 01:04:00,314
What's going on? You okay?

785
01:04:01,663 --> 01:04:03,840
- I'm fine.

786
01:04:03,970 --> 01:04:06,059
I'm sorry. You don't need
to hear this right now.

787
01:04:06,190 --> 01:04:08,235
- Cami, something
is clearly bothering you.

788
01:04:08,366 --> 01:04:10,063
Talk to me.

789
01:04:10,194 --> 01:04:12,239
- You've just been
through so much.

790
01:04:12,370 --> 01:04:15,721
Now is not the time.
- I'm here for you, always.

791
01:04:16,591 --> 01:04:17,592
What's going on?

792
01:04:17,723 --> 01:04:19,377
- It's Charles.

793
01:04:20,465 --> 01:04:21,988
- What about him?

794
01:04:23,511 --> 01:04:25,165
- I just...

795
01:04:29,343 --> 01:04:31,041
I think I might need
to hire you.

796
01:04:33,521 --> 01:04:36,394
- You think Charles
is cheating?

797
01:04:36,524 --> 01:04:38,744
Where is this coming from?

798
01:04:38,875 --> 01:04:41,660
- He's been acting differently.

799
01:04:41,790 --> 01:04:44,837
Going out to see clients, coming
home at five in the morning.

800
01:04:44,968 --> 01:04:47,187
I never know where he is.

801
01:04:47,318 --> 01:04:50,060
- His job has always been
demanding, though, right?

802
01:04:51,322 --> 01:04:52,758
- Not like this.

803
01:04:54,412 --> 01:04:57,763
These past few weeks,
he's been totally withdrawn.

804
01:04:59,808 --> 01:05:03,856
He can't even look at me,
let alone touch me.

805
01:05:03,987 --> 01:05:06,380
The other day, he came home
blackout drunk

806
01:05:06,511 --> 01:05:08,687
with a busted lip.

807
01:05:08,817 --> 01:05:11,255
I think he might be
gambling now. I just...

808
01:05:11,995 --> 01:05:14,432
I don't know what to believe.

809
01:05:16,260 --> 01:05:18,566
- When was that?

810
01:05:18,697 --> 01:05:20,917
- Thursday, I think. Why?

811
01:05:23,745 --> 01:05:25,878
- Okay, I'm gonna
tell you something

812
01:05:26,009 --> 01:05:28,185
and I need you to understand

813
01:05:28,315 --> 01:05:30,796
that it did not seem
like a big deal at the time.

814
01:05:33,930 --> 01:05:35,192
- What do you...

815
01:05:35,322 --> 01:05:37,934
What do you mean?
What are you saying?

816
01:05:38,064 --> 01:05:41,546
- I saw Charles in the Slaphouse
District on Thursday.

817
01:05:41,676 --> 01:05:43,635
- You what?

818
01:05:43,765 --> 01:05:46,290
- He said he was meeting
a client.

819
01:05:46,420 --> 01:05:48,814
He asked me not to say
anything.

820
01:05:48,945 --> 01:05:51,686
- So you listened to Charles
over telling your best friend?

821
01:05:51,817 --> 01:05:53,862
- He said he didn't want you
to worry.

822
01:05:53,993 --> 01:05:55,473
I had no idea.

823
01:05:55,603 --> 01:05:57,736
- Lucy, this is huge!

824
01:05:57,866 --> 01:05:59,825
How could you not have
said anything?

825
01:05:59,956 --> 01:06:01,566
- I didn't think there was
anything to say.

826
01:06:01,696 --> 01:06:05,004
Obviously, I was wrong.

827
01:06:05,135 --> 01:06:08,877
This might explain his behavior
for the last few weeks.

828
01:06:09,008 --> 01:06:11,097
Cami, I'm sorry.

829
01:06:11,228 --> 01:06:12,969
- I have to go.

830
01:06:14,187 --> 01:06:16,973
- Hey. Let's figure this out
together.

831
01:06:18,496 --> 01:06:21,325
- Honestly, Lucy,
I think you've done enough.

832
01:07:07,284 --> 01:07:09,112
Lucy, talk to me!
- It was you!

833
01:07:09,242 --> 01:07:11,897
You paid Dimitri.
I can't believe I trusted you.

834
01:07:12,028 --> 01:07:13,681
- I've never even met Dimitri.
Lucy, stop! I love you.

835
01:07:17,033 --> 01:07:18,947
- No!

836
01:07:36,139 --> 01:07:39,011
- Lucy... I wasn't
expecting you today.

837
01:07:39,881 --> 01:07:42,058
- I need to figure out
what the hell is going on.

838
01:07:45,583 --> 01:07:48,281
- Okay, he hires you
to follow his wife,

839
01:07:48,412 --> 01:07:50,066
so he has tabs on you
at all times,

840
01:07:50,196 --> 01:07:52,633
then, he seduces you,

841
01:07:52,764 --> 01:07:55,375
then hires Dimitri
to terrorize you.

842
01:07:55,506 --> 01:07:58,335
- Yeah. I've been going over it
again and again.

843
01:07:58,465 --> 01:08:00,772
And I just keep asking myself
""why"".

844
01:08:03,775 --> 01:08:07,213
- I think it all goes back
to this sick obsession.

845
01:08:07,344 --> 01:08:09,607
It's clear that he had
this fixation with you.

846
01:08:11,043 --> 01:08:12,653
- Yeah. But he had me.

847
01:08:12,784 --> 01:08:14,786
- Yeah. Not until
after the break-in.

848
01:08:16,569 --> 01:08:19,486
- He kept insisting that he'd
never seen Dimitri in his life.

849
01:08:19,617 --> 01:08:22,576
- Hey, it's perfectly normal
to second-guess yourself

850
01:08:22,707 --> 01:08:24,709
after such a traumatic event.

851
01:08:24,839 --> 01:08:27,014
But, Lucy, you did what
you had to do.

852
01:08:27,146 --> 01:08:29,104
Who knows what he might have
done to you?

853
01:08:31,019 --> 01:08:33,065
I don't know.

854
01:08:33,805 --> 01:08:35,719
The more I replay it in my mind,

855
01:08:35,850 --> 01:08:39,550
the more I think he just
was genuinely confused.

856
01:08:39,680 --> 01:08:42,857
Like, he had no idea about
the break-in or any of it.

857
01:08:42,987 --> 01:08:44,555
- Yeah, well, the only way
to prove that

858
01:08:44,684 --> 01:08:46,469
would be to ask Dimitri.

859
01:08:50,517 --> 01:08:53,607
- August, there's a lot
that's not adding up.

860
01:08:53,737 --> 01:08:56,131
Dimitri is the only one that
can answer these questions.

861
01:08:56,262 --> 01:08:58,568
- Okay, you're the boss.

862
01:08:58,699 --> 01:09:00,136
I'm going with you.

863
01:09:01,180 --> 01:09:03,226
- Good.

864
01:09:37,346 --> 01:09:38,565
- Nice place.

865
01:09:38,696 --> 01:09:40,306
- Yeah, you should've been here
last week.

866
01:09:41,438 --> 01:09:42,874
- What are you looking at?

867
01:09:44,528 --> 01:09:45,877
- Nothing.

868
01:09:48,619 --> 01:09:50,273
Huh, great.

869
01:09:50,403 --> 01:09:51,883
- You know him?

870
01:09:52,013 --> 01:09:53,841
- Yeah. Let's just say that.

871
01:09:53,971 --> 01:09:55,843
- Well, look who it is.

872
01:09:55,974 --> 01:09:58,368
- Yeah, good to see you.

873
01:10:12,817 --> 01:10:15,080
- I should have known
you two were working together.

874
01:10:16,647 --> 01:10:19,084
- Hi, Dimitri.
- What do you want?

875
01:10:19,215 --> 01:10:22,000
- I need to tell me who hired
you to break into my house.

876
01:10:22,130 --> 01:10:23,654
- I already told this guy.

877
01:10:23,784 --> 01:10:25,090
His name was Clive.

878
01:10:28,353 --> 01:10:29,921
- You mean this guy, Clive?

879
01:10:35,535 --> 01:10:37,885
- What do I get
for ID'ing this person?

880
01:10:38,016 --> 01:10:38,930
Why should I help you?

881
01:10:41,148 --> 01:10:44,544
- If you don't cooperate,
I press charges

882
01:10:44,675 --> 01:10:47,939
and you get sent away again,
for a very long time.

883
01:10:54,162 --> 01:10:56,469
- I've never seen this guy
in my life.

884
01:11:00,691 --> 01:11:02,736
- You're sure?
- Positive.

885
01:11:02,867 --> 01:11:07,611
The Clive I met was shorter...
Trying to grow a moustache.

886
01:11:10,962 --> 01:11:12,616
Leave me alone.

887
01:11:26,064 --> 01:11:28,022
- It doesn't make any sense.

888
01:11:28,632 --> 01:11:32,112
- It's... It's just not
adding up.

889
01:11:34,333 --> 01:11:36,422
Hang on a sec.

890
01:11:59,706 --> 01:12:02,709
- Lucy! You okay?

891
01:12:02,840 --> 01:12:05,495
I'll be right out.

892
01:12:19,422 --> 01:12:21,206
What have you done?

893
01:12:24,252 --> 01:12:25,818
I killed him.

894
01:12:26,907 --> 01:12:29,040
I killed the wrong guy.

895
01:12:29,170 --> 01:12:30,911
- You thought you were
in danger.

896
01:12:31,041 --> 01:12:33,261
Anyone else would have done
the same thing.

897
01:12:33,392 --> 01:12:35,655
- He was in love with me

898
01:12:35,786 --> 01:12:37,353
and I killed him.

899
01:12:39,224 --> 01:12:41,879
How could I have gotten
everything so wrong?

900
01:12:46,273 --> 01:12:47,710
- Wait a minute.

901
01:12:48,799 --> 01:12:50,670
Maybe you were supposed to.

902
01:12:52,933 --> 01:12:54,370
Hear me out.

903
01:12:55,719 --> 01:12:57,590
Whoever got Dimitri
to break into your house

904
01:12:57,721 --> 01:12:59,679
knew you were going
to find out it was Clive,

905
01:13:00,463 --> 01:13:03,030
and then that you would
confront him.

906
01:13:05,903 --> 01:13:07,557
- You think Adriana
would have wanted him dead?

907
01:13:07,687 --> 01:13:10,168
- He was a very wealthy man.

908
01:13:10,298 --> 01:13:13,432
People do bad things for money.
Really bad things.

909
01:13:13,563 --> 01:13:15,565
- Got any pings on that guy
she went out for dinner with

910
01:13:15,695 --> 01:13:17,567
the other night?
- None.

911
01:13:19,568 --> 01:13:22,267
- What was the description of
that guy Dimitri actually met?

912
01:13:22,398 --> 01:13:24,008
Can you see if there's
anything there?

913
01:13:24,138 --> 01:13:26,271
- Alright. Will do.
- I'm gonna go to The Regent.

914
01:13:26,402 --> 01:13:28,795
That's where he was staying.
See if I can get any info there.

915
01:13:28,925 --> 01:13:31,362
- Okay and I'll go to Adriana's,
see if I find anything.

916
01:13:31,494 --> 01:13:33,583
- Be careful.
- Yeah, you too.

917
01:14:31,641 --> 01:14:32,468
- Lucy?

918
01:14:34,644 --> 01:14:35,645
Lucy!

919
01:16:12,306 --> 01:16:13,699
- Lucy saw you with him.

920
01:16:15,745 --> 01:16:17,224
We'll deal with her later.

921
01:16:17,355 --> 01:16:19,139
Did you get the passports?

922
01:16:19,270 --> 01:16:22,490
- You are now...

923
01:16:22,621 --> 01:16:25,318
Vanessa Armando.

924
01:16:27,407 --> 01:16:29,106
- Do you think
I can pull it off?

925
01:16:36,156 --> 01:16:39,682
- Did you...
drain all of his accounts?

926
01:16:39,812 --> 01:16:42,467
- Now that Clive is dead,
it all belongs to us.

927
01:16:52,999 --> 01:16:55,306
- Did you use the routing number
that Dean set up?

928
01:16:57,308 --> 01:16:58,831
- Right... the routing number.

929
01:16:59,876 --> 01:17:03,575
- Adriana, that
one's untraceable, right?

930
01:17:03,706 --> 01:17:06,577
We cannot leave until
the funds are in that account.

931
01:17:06,709 --> 01:17:09,233
- I'm sorry! I put the funds
in my account.

932
01:17:09,362 --> 01:17:11,278
I didn't think it would matter.
- Well, it does!

933
01:17:14,804 --> 01:17:16,893
You want people
to be able to find us?

934
01:17:17,023 --> 01:17:18,503
What's your password?

935
01:17:18,634 --> 01:17:19,809
- I think someone's out there.

936
01:17:22,768 --> 01:17:24,987
- Adriana, your password.

937
01:17:29,209 --> 01:17:30,689
Want some more wine?

938
01:17:30,820 --> 01:17:31,995
- Of course.

939
01:18:00,937 --> 01:18:01,981
- To us.

940
01:18:02,112 --> 01:18:04,680
To us.

941
01:18:09,554 --> 01:18:12,383
I love you so much.

942
01:18:12,513 --> 01:18:16,648
I cannot wait to start this next
chapter of our lives.

943
01:18:16,779 --> 01:18:18,389
Together.

944
01:18:34,579 --> 01:18:38,322
Finally free,
without Cami or Clive.

945
01:18:38,975 --> 01:18:41,717
Just you and me, together.

946
01:18:44,763 --> 01:18:47,070
- Yeah, I don't think
that's gonna happen.

947
01:18:50,202 --> 01:18:51,901
- What?

948
01:18:59,865 --> 01:19:01,606
- He's changed
all his passwords.

949
01:19:50,394 --> 01:19:53,136
- After everything I've been
through to get here.

950
01:19:54,964 --> 01:19:58,358
The strings I pulled!
Clive is dead!

951
01:19:58,489 --> 01:20:01,666
- Don't lie to yourself.
You wanted him gone.

952
01:20:02,972 --> 01:20:04,712
If he would've found out
about us,

953
01:20:04,843 --> 01:20:06,496
he would have left you
with nothing.

954
01:20:07,193 --> 01:20:08,673
- The money.

955
01:20:13,068 --> 01:20:14,200
- What are you doing?

956
01:20:14,331 --> 01:20:16,202
- I'm stopping
the funds transfer.

957
01:20:16,333 --> 01:20:18,204
- Hey. I can't let you do that.

958
01:20:18,335 --> 01:20:20,337
- This isn't your money,
Charles.

959
01:20:30,651 --> 01:20:32,305
What did you do?

960
01:20:35,264 --> 01:20:36,788
But I love you.

961
01:21:04,772 --> 01:21:06,731
Oh no. No, no, no.

962
01:21:29,232 --> 01:21:31,669
- Hi, you've reached
Lucy Thompson of
Thompson Investigations.

963
01:21:31,799 --> 01:21:33,714
Please leave a detailed
message and I'll get back
to you shortly.

964
01:21:33,844 --> 01:21:35,847
It's me!

965
01:21:35,978 --> 01:21:37,849
I'm sorry I overreacted
the other day.

966
01:21:37,980 --> 01:21:40,243
I should not have blamed you for
what Charles has done.

967
01:21:42,853 --> 01:21:45,161
It turns out he was hiding a lot
more from me than I thought.

968
01:21:45,291 --> 01:21:46,902
I'm kicking him out!

969
01:21:48,338 --> 01:21:50,906
I love you. Call me back.

970
01:22:25,244 --> 01:22:28,594
Lucy. Hey!

971
01:22:36,342 --> 01:22:37,952
Lucy!

972
01:22:53,228 --> 01:22:54,447
Lucy!

973
01:22:59,017 --> 01:23:00,452
Damn it!

974
01:23:01,977 --> 01:23:04,153
- August! It was Charles
and Adriana.

975
01:23:04,282 --> 01:23:05,981
I think he killed her.
Call me when you get this.

976
01:23:08,548 --> 01:23:09,680
Cami!

977
01:23:09,809 --> 01:23:11,943
- I'm here.

978
01:23:12,074 --> 01:23:14,598
- Okay. Hey... Hey, listen.

979
01:23:14,728 --> 01:23:16,382
I just watched Charles
kill Adriana.

980
01:23:16,513 --> 01:23:18,471
- What are you talking about?
- He wants to kill me now.

981
01:23:18,602 --> 01:23:20,559
Let's go.
- Lucy!

982
01:23:20,691 --> 01:23:22,127
Cami.
- Get out!

983
01:23:22,258 --> 01:23:23,650
- What?! No...
- Get out!

984
01:23:23,781 --> 01:23:25,217
- Cami, no, I can explain.

985
01:23:25,348 --> 01:23:26,610
Don't listen to Lucy,
she's crazy.

986
01:23:26,740 --> 01:23:28,394
- I know you're cheating
on me, Charles.

987
01:23:28,525 --> 01:23:30,353
And the gambling?
I know we're broke!

988
01:23:30,483 --> 01:23:32,442
You are the reason
Clive is dead!

989
01:23:32,572 --> 01:23:34,183
- No. Lucy is trying
to tear us apart.

990
01:23:34,313 --> 01:23:36,750
She's always been jealous
of what we have!

991
01:23:36,880 --> 01:23:39,144
- You're a murderer and
I need you to get

992
01:23:39,275 --> 01:23:41,190
the hell out of my house
and out of my life.

993
01:23:41,320 --> 01:23:43,627
Get out!
- This is all your fault!

994
01:23:43,757 --> 01:23:45,281
- No, Charles.
This is your fault!

995
01:23:45,411 --> 01:23:47,282
You're going to prison!

996
01:23:47,413 --> 01:23:49,589
- Don't listen to her.
Just don't listen to her, okay?

997
01:23:49,719 --> 01:23:52,157
I came back.
Look at this life we have, huh?

998
01:23:52,288 --> 01:23:54,594
I did this to protect that.
I did it all for you.

999
01:23:54,725 --> 01:23:56,509
- You're insane.

1000
01:23:56,639 --> 01:23:58,555
- You don't understand,

1001
01:23:59,556 --> 01:24:01,253
Cami, look.

1002
01:24:01,384 --> 01:24:05,779
Look, just forget everything.
Alright? Yeah?

1003
01:24:05,910 --> 01:24:07,651
I solved our money problems.

1004
01:24:07,781 --> 01:24:09,740
Okay? We can be happy together.
I love you.

1005
01:24:09,870 --> 01:24:12,743
- Okay, Charles... It's over.

1006
01:24:19,967 --> 01:24:21,230
- Charles, wait!

1007
01:24:22,231 --> 01:24:23,449
Stop!

1008
01:24:23,580 --> 01:24:24,885
911, what is
your emergency?

1009
01:24:25,016 --> 01:24:26,452
- Listen to me, listen to me.

1010
01:24:26,583 --> 01:24:28,672
You came back.
That's all that matters.

1011
01:24:28,802 --> 01:24:31,327
Hey, hey! You did
what you had to do for us.

1012
01:24:31,457 --> 01:24:34,330
Look at me.
I see that now. Okay?

1013
01:24:34,460 --> 01:24:36,375
Alright, baby?

1014
01:24:36,984 --> 01:24:38,464
For better for worse, right?

1015
01:24:38,594 --> 01:24:40,423
Yeah.

1016
01:24:49,519 --> 01:24:50,955
Lucy! Lucy!

1017
01:24:53,784 --> 01:24:55,786
Ah!

1018
01:24:57,831 --> 01:24:58,963
- You're okay.

1019
01:25:00,486 --> 01:25:01,966
Hey, it's okay.

1020
01:25:28,471 --> 01:25:30,516
- This guy was fast.
I was out of breath.

1021
01:25:32,083 --> 01:25:34,085
- I've got news!
They love it.

1022
01:25:34,216 --> 01:25:36,043
- Uh... Who loves what?

1023
01:25:36,174 --> 01:25:38,002
- The publisher?
- They literally want to buy

1024
01:25:38,133 --> 01:25:40,657
the rights to your story after
reading the first twenty pages.

1025
01:25:40,787 --> 01:25:42,267
Lucy, this book is going
to be huge.

1026
01:25:42,398 --> 01:25:45,183
- Seriously?
- Yeah. Our story is incredible.

1027
01:25:45,314 --> 01:25:46,880
People are going
to want to hear it.

1028
01:25:47,011 --> 01:25:48,186
- This is so exciting.

1029
01:25:48,317 --> 01:25:49,927
- How is the rest
of the book coming?

1030
01:25:50,057 --> 01:25:51,885
- It's going really well.

1031
01:25:52,016 --> 01:25:53,931
It's been cathartic putting it
all down on paper.

1032
01:25:54,061 --> 01:25:56,151
So, wait, what happens now?

1033
01:25:56,281 --> 01:25:58,544
- Well, the publishers are going
to send over a contract

1034
01:25:58,675 --> 01:26:00,938
and all you have to do is sign!

1035
01:26:01,068 --> 01:26:03,245
You are going to love
the deal I got you.

1036
01:26:03,375 --> 01:26:05,160
- I don't doubt that.
You're a shark.

1037
01:26:05,290 --> 01:26:06,900
I am, aren't I?

1038
01:26:07,031 --> 01:26:08,250
- So I'll see you
for dinner tonight?

1039
01:26:08,380 --> 01:26:09,555
- You know it.
Are you coming, August?

1040
01:26:09,686 --> 01:26:10,991
- Of course. I'll be there.

1041
01:26:11,121 --> 01:26:12,514
- Amazing. Love you.

1042
01:26:13,168 --> 01:26:14,691
- Love you.

1043
01:26:14,821 --> 01:26:17,650
- Wow.
Lucy, congratulations!

1044
01:26:17,781 --> 01:26:19,130
- Yeah, she thinks we've
really got something here.

1045
01:26:19,261 --> 01:26:22,481
- Yeah, so do I. And I, for one,
can't wait to read it.

1046
01:26:22,612 --> 01:26:24,701
- I have a feeling we're about
to get very busy.

1047
01:26:24,831 --> 01:26:26,746
- Yeah. I think so!

1048
01:26:26,877 --> 01:26:28,094
- Ready to dive in, partner?

1049
01:26:28,226 --> 01:26:30,097
- I will do you proud,
Lucy Thompson.

1050
01:26:30,228 --> 01:26:31,708
- I know you will.
Now, go back to work.

[Bo] Okay, see you later. Thank you.

47
00:05:45,125 --> 00:05:46,250
Who's that guy over there?

48
00:05:51,791 --> 00:05:53,625
You've got quite the skill set.

49
00:05:53,750 --> 00:05:55,500
You're too good
to be working in this place.

50
00:06:00,875 --> 00:06:03,291
[wok clattering]

51
00:06:08,458 --> 00:06:09,750
Come by if you're interested.

52
00:06:17,875 --> 00:06:19,875
[chewing loudly]

53
00:06:24,541 --> 00:06:26,333
Keep it down, Jang.

54
00:06:26,416 --> 00:06:29,208
[clears throat] Give me a break.

55
00:06:30,083 --> 00:06:32,208
Let me eat my food. I had a shitty day.

56
00:06:33,750 --> 00:06:34,958
Again? What happened?

57
00:06:36,958 --> 00:06:38,750
What else? My pitch got rejected.

58
00:06:39,750 --> 00:06:43,083
[woman] Well, those old coots
will never understand our generation.

59
00:06:44,208 --> 00:06:45,416
I'm quitting my job.

60
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:46,500
What?

61
00:06:47,458 --> 00:06:50,750
My boss's friend pulled some strings
to get his child promoted.

62
00:06:52,291 --> 00:06:54,208
Whoa. That's rash.

63
00:06:54,958 --> 00:06:57,291
Did you think it through?
You have another job lined up?

64
00:06:57,375 --> 00:06:59,458
- Mm.
- [Jang] Easy for you to say.

65
00:06:59,541 --> 00:07:02,708
Soon as you graduated,
you had this job waiting for you.

66
00:07:02,791 --> 00:07:06,125
We've got nothing.
Working our asses off for chump change!

67
00:07:06,208 --> 00:07:07,291
[scoffs]

68
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,875
Yeah, but at least you have a choice,
whereas I...

69
00:07:11,916 --> 00:07:14,000
I'm the eldest and I bear the cross.

70
00:07:14,083 --> 00:07:15,083
[woman 2] Aoy, come on!

71
00:07:15,166 --> 00:07:17,958
One of you has to carry on
the family business, you know that.

72
00:07:18,041 --> 00:07:19,375
Yeah, but why me?

73
00:07:20,750 --> 00:07:22,333
[Au] I'm glad it's you.

74
00:07:23,291 --> 00:07:24,750
You cook better than Dad.

75
00:07:24,833 --> 00:07:27,250
[Jang] Whoa! Way to suck up to her!

76
00:07:28,291 --> 00:07:29,875
And what about you, Au?

77
00:07:29,958 --> 00:07:33,083
Freelance online content creator, huh?

78
00:07:33,166 --> 00:07:35,291
You have no idea how hard it is for us.

79
00:07:35,375 --> 00:07:36,208
[Au] Of course I do.

80
00:07:36,291 --> 00:07:37,833
I know how poor I am.

81
00:07:38,750 --> 00:07:40,875
How much do you think I earn per gig?

82
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:43,791
Every day, I wake up
feeling so fucking poor.

83
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:49,166
[sighs] I used to think I'd graduate

84
00:07:49,250 --> 00:07:52,083
and then, somehow,
I'd manage to change the world.

85
00:07:52,916 --> 00:07:56,958
Yeah, right! Look at us now.
Menial work, no prospects.

86
00:07:57,041 --> 00:07:59,875
For sure. It's not easy to succeed here.

87
00:07:59,958 --> 00:08:01,708
Especially if you start out with no money.

88
00:08:01,791 --> 00:08:03,831
You have to be
the child of someone rich to make it.

89
00:08:03,875 --> 00:08:07,166
Normal people like us,
we've no right to be happy.

90
00:08:10,291 --> 00:08:11,291
Oh!

91
00:08:12,833 --> 00:08:16,875
Some weirdo came up to me today
and handed me this card.

92
00:08:16,958 --> 00:08:18,833
Asked me to go and work for them.

93
00:08:19,583 --> 00:08:24,166
Holy crap! Hunger! Chef Paul's kitchen.

94
00:08:24,250 --> 00:08:25,666
- Let me see.
- Show me.

95
00:08:25,750 --> 00:08:27,583
Chef Paul? Is he famous?

96
00:08:27,666 --> 00:08:28,750
- Why, of course!
- So cool!

97
00:08:28,833 --> 00:08:31,291
Chef Paul's
the high priest of fine dining!

98
00:08:31,375 --> 00:08:33,708
Don't you know him? He's freaking famous!

99
00:08:33,791 --> 00:08:35,666
Excuse me, sir, is this your car?

100
00:08:36,791 --> 00:08:37,791
You have to move it.

101
00:08:40,750 --> 00:08:41,750
Huh.

102
00:08:48,541 --> 00:08:50,000
[car engine starting]

103
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,583
[car honks twice]

104
00:09:03,166 --> 00:09:05,416
[woman 2] Wait.
I thought that was a no-parking zone.

105
00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:07,708
[Jang] Yeah.
Some people get special treatment.

106
00:09:08,541 --> 00:09:10,083
[woman 2] Gotta be some big shot.

107
00:09:10,166 --> 00:09:13,375
It is what it is.
No parking for the rest of us.

108
00:09:14,375 --> 00:09:15,708
[woman 2] What an asshole.

109
00:09:16,291 --> 00:09:18,451
Let's finish up and get going
before it starts raining.

110
00:09:18,958 --> 00:09:20,291
[sighs heavily]

111

115
00:10:02,541 --> 00:10:03,541
[Joy] Sure.

THIS IS AN EDIBLE WORK OF ART

[dramatic music playing on video]

121
00:10:55,750 --> 00:10:59,166
[Paul] <i>Hunger is cuisine
designed for hungry people.</i>

122
00:10:59,250 --> 00:11:02,583

124
00:11:06,125 --> 00:11:09,083

125
00:11:09,166 --> 00:11:12,375

[percussive music playing]

128
00:11:27,083 --> 00:11:29,166
[Bo] Table four, one regular, two large.

129

[Aoy's dad] Two large <i>Pad See Ew,</i>
table two.

130
00:11:34,041 --> 00:11:35,750
One large <i>Pad See Ew, </i>please.

I'm sorry!

00:14:14,583 --> 00:14:15,750
Is she here for the tryout?

145
00:14:16,291 --> 00:14:17,291
She is.

146
00:14:18,541 --> 00:14:19,625
What?

147
00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:23,291
- Hey. What do you think?
- Fine by me.

148
00:14:30,458 --> 00:14:31,458
[door opens]

149
00:14:49,791 --> 00:14:51,625
- Just the two?
- [sous-chef] Yes, Chef.

150
00:14:53,375 --> 00:14:54,375
Good morning, Chef.

151
00:14:55,458 --> 00:14:57,291
Name's Patt. I was sous-chef at...

152
00:14:57,375 --> 00:14:58,500
Did I ask you?

153
00:15:04,916 --> 00:15:05,916
Fried rice.

154
00:15:07,916 --> 00:15:09,250
Well, a bit simple, no?

155
00:15:13,666 --> 00:15:15,666

[music ends]

162
00:17:18,916 --> 00:17:19,916
You, go home.

163
00:17:20,250 --> 00:17:21,333
Hey, Chef!

164
00:17:22,291 --> 00:17:23,811
- You saying I failed?
- That's enough.

165
00:17:24,500 --> 00:17:27,541
There's no way this hick-chick's
fried rice is better than mine.

166
00:17:28,041 --> 00:17:30,541
- I'm a graduate from...
- I told you to get out of here.

167

I won't!

168
00:17:33,083 --> 00:17:35,625
I told my mom I was gonna work for you.
I'm not leaving.

[Patt gasps]

170
00:17:43,833 --> 00:17:45,125
Screw your mother.

[door opens, closes]

172
00:18:00,875 --> 00:18:01,708
I repeat.

173
00:18:01,791 --> 00:18:03,208
Those culinary school graduates...

174
00:18:03,291 --> 00:18:06,916
Those classically-trained idiots
have no imagination.

175
00:18:08,250 --> 00:18:10,916
They can't work the fire,
they're not stove hands.

176
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,000
Yes, Chef.

177
00:18:16,625 --> 00:18:20,000
So you know
it's better to use leftover rice.

178
00:18:23,541 --> 00:18:25,333
Do you know how to work the fire?

179
00:18:26,125 --> 00:18:27,541
I... think so.

180
00:18:27,625 --> 00:18:28,833
Do you or don't you?

181
00:18:29,750 --> 00:18:30,750
I do.

182
00:18:33,416 --> 00:18:35,125
Why do you want to work at Hunger?

183
00:18:43,916 --> 00:18:44,916
[clicks tongue]

184
00:18:45,958 --> 00:18:48,041
I want to be special.

186
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,000
[sniffs deeply]

187
00:19:19,416 --> 00:19:21,625
The smell from your <i>Pad See Ew </i>joint

188
00:19:22,833 --> 00:19:23,916
doesn't belong here.

189
00:19:27,458 --> 00:19:28,875
Wash up and get changed.

190
00:19:40,958 --> 00:19:42,416

191
00:19:42,500 --> 00:19:44,500

[kitchen tools clattering]

194
00:20:32,333 --> 00:20:34,133
[sous-chef] Go to the market
once you're done,

195
00:20:34,166 --> 00:20:35,750
and don't forget to check the potatoes.

196
00:20:38,416 --> 00:20:42,125
We're a crew of seven... for the moment.
Including Chef Paul.

197
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:45,041
""For the moment""?

198
00:20:45,708 --> 00:20:49,083
Seven for now.
That number can change at any time.

199
00:20:49,166 --> 00:20:50,416
It's up to the Chef.

200
00:20:51,583 --> 00:20:52,583
Come on.

201
00:20:54,041 --> 00:20:56,416
Right here, that's Uncle Dang,
the sous-chef.

202
00:20:56,500 --> 00:20:58,125
Chef Paul's second-in-command.

203
00:20:58,625 --> 00:21:01,125
He's a real veteran. Been through a lot.

204
00:21:01,875 --> 00:21:04,083
That is Tue,
in charge of the soup station.

205
00:21:04,166 --> 00:21:06,250
If you hear him speak, you're lucky!

206
00:21:07,791 --> 00:21:10,708
That's Keng.
He joined us just a few months ago.

207
00:21:11,750 --> 00:21:13,208
He handles cold dishes.

208
00:21:13,708 --> 00:21:16,333
He also makes sauces and desserts.

209
00:21:18,250 --> 00:21:19,250
This is Bae.

210
00:21:19,916 --> 00:21:21,208
The kitchen porter.

211
00:21:21,916 --> 00:21:24,750
He can hardly speak the language,
so all he does is smile.

212
00:21:25,333 --> 00:21:26,583
Hard worker.

213
00:21:27,250 --> 00:21:28,583
And you are...

214
00:21:29,291 --> 00:21:32,666
I'm Tone. Junior sous-chef,
just below Dang.

215
00:21:34,875 --> 00:21:36,333
Um, what about me?

216
00:21:37,125 --> 00:21:39,458
You? You're replacing
someone who got fired.

217
00:21:39,958 --> 00:21:42,500
I'm guessing Paul wants you
to be the fry chef.

218
00:21:43,083 --> 00:21:44,500
That's the same level as me...

219
00:21:45,500 --> 00:21:46,500
more or less.

220
00:21:48,375 --> 00:21:50,375
[objects clatter]

221
00:21:54,041 --> 00:21:55,166
Tomorrow we have a

222
00:21:56,583 --> 00:21:58,083
private birthday party.

223
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:00,583
Fifteen guests, total.

224
00:22:00,666 --> 00:22:05,083
The average age is 40-plus.
The venue is a private residence.

225
00:22:05,166 --> 00:22:08,666
The host is... General Premsak.

226
00:22:14,541 --> 00:22:18,666
Guests are members of the upper crust.
Business and political.

227
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:21,500
The theme for the dinner

228
00:22:22,125 --> 00:22:23,666
will be ""Flesh and Blood.""

229
00:22:26,708 --> 00:22:27,875
Intense colors.

230
00:22:28,375 --> 00:22:31,875
Everything juicy and succulent,
leaving the mouth stained and messy.

231
00:22:32,375 --> 00:22:33,791
A5 BEEF, 16"" GOLD PLATE

232
00:22:33,875 --> 00:22:34,708
[Paul] Got it?

233
00:22:34,791 --> 00:22:36,125
[all] Yes, Chef.

234
00:22:37,083 --> 00:22:38,458
Now, your job

235
00:22:39,291 --> 00:22:42,708
is to fry the Wagyu A5 beef
into tender pieces

236
00:22:43,416 --> 00:22:44,833
that require no chewing.

237
00:22:48,375 --> 00:22:49,458
[hesitantly] Yes, Chef.

238
00:23:05,458 --> 00:23:10,250
Everything depends on perfect slicing
and your control of the fire.

239
00:23:11,083 --> 00:23:13,250
Cook it just enough to keep the juice.

240
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,666
But do not overdo it.

241
00:23:20,916 --> 00:23:21,916
Go on.

242
00:23:41,833 --> 00:23:42,833
Too thick.

243
00:23:48,125 --> 00:23:49,375
Still too thick.

244
00:23:55,750 --> 00:23:57,000
Firm grip on the knife.

245
00:24:02,416 --> 00:24:03,833
Keep the blade straight.

246
00:24:14,833 --> 00:24:16,000
Don't tear it.

247
00:24:20,458 --> 00:24:21,458
Again.

248
00:24:30,375 --> 00:24:31,416
Don't saw it.

249
00:24:43,625 --> 00:24:45,625
I told you not to saw it.

250
00:24:57,291 --> 00:24:58,750
[yelling] Don't fucking saw it!

251
00:25:01,416 --> 00:25:02,416
Again.

252
00:25:03,666 --> 00:25:05,666
[tense music playing]

253
00:25:11,291 --> 00:25:12,625
You're doing it again!

254
00:25:15,708 --> 00:25:19,708
Have you any idea how much this costs?

255
00:25:28,750 --> 00:25:29,750
Cook it.

256
00:25:53,250 --> 00:25:54,250
Overcooked.

257
00:25:55,666 --> 00:25:56,666
Again.

258
00:26:01,458 --> 00:26:02,583
Overdone.

259
00:26:08,833 --> 00:26:10,791
Go home if you're scared of fire.

260
00:26:12,625 --> 00:26:14,166
Overdone. Again.

261
00:26:18,583 --> 00:26:20,250
The meat's stuck to the wok!

262
00:26:20,750 --> 00:26:21,875
Again. Come on!

263
00:26:25,083 --> 00:26:27,083
[tense music continues]

264
00:26:28,708 --> 00:26:30,125
There is too much oil!

265
00:26:34,250 --> 00:26:35,583
[sizzling]

266
00:26:39,708 --> 00:26:41,333
Don't you want to be special?

267
00:26:51,416 --> 00:26:53,500
I hired you to handle the frying.

268
00:26:55,166 --> 00:26:57,083
If you can't do that,
you don't belong here.

269
00:26:58,750 --> 00:26:59,875
I've asked for one thing.

270
00:26:59,958 --> 00:27:03,000
And I've made it perfectly clear
how I want the meat to be cooked.

271
00:27:05,541 --> 00:27:07,041
Do it until you get it right.

272
00:27:12,083 --> 00:27:13,875
If I don't see you when I get back,

273
00:27:15,458 --> 00:27:16,541
then it's proof

274
00:27:17,583 --> 00:27:18,916
that you belong

275
00:27:19,958 --> 00:27:21,583
in your generic noodle joint.

276
00:27:31,333 --> 00:27:35,416
If she can't manage,
we'll change the menu.

277
00:27:35,500 --> 00:27:36,333
[all] Yes, Chef.

278
00:27:36,416 --> 00:27:38,416
[tense music continues]

279
00:27:55,916 --> 00:27:57,958
[tense music fades]

280
00:28:12,875 --> 00:28:15,041
[intense music building]

281
00:28:18,166 --> 00:28:19,625
[wok heating]

282
00:28:25,333 --> 00:28:27,333
[music continues building]

283
00:29:05,166 --> 00:29:06,166
[Aoy exclaims]

284
00:29:07,416 --> 00:29:08,500
[inhales sharply]

285
00:29:12,791 --> 00:29:14,416
[wok sizzling]

286
00:29:49,041 --> 00:29:51,041
[music builds dramatically]

287
00:30:00,291 --> 00:30:02,291
[music ends]

288
00:30:21,166 --> 00:30:22,166
Whoa!

289
00:30:24,708 --> 00:30:26,666
Oh! [laughing] Bro!

290
00:30:27,250 --> 00:30:29,583
Looks like your girl
couldn't find her way home.

291
00:30:50,458 --> 00:30:52,458
[groans]

292
00:31:09,458 --> 00:31:11,500
[suspenseful music playing]

293
00:31:42,041 --> 00:31:43,166
[switches off stove]

294
00:32:23,291 --> 00:32:24,958
[Paul] Aren't you gonna get changed?

295
00:32:25,041 --> 00:32:26,125
[all] Yes, Chef.

296
00:32:32,583 --> 00:32:34,916
Here. Wipe off the oil.

297
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:47,000
[tender music playing]

298
00:33:14,666 --> 00:33:17,458
Sir, could you squeeze in a little please?
That's perfect.

299
00:33:18,250 --> 00:33:20,791
- Smile. One more, please.
- [camera clicks]

300
00:33:23,125 --> 00:33:25,125
- [guests chattering]
- [soft music playing]

301
00:33:29,791 --> 00:33:30,791
[man] How is he doing?

302
00:33:32,750 --> 00:33:35,791
- Hi. Good evening. Good evening.
- Good evening, sir.

303
00:33:36,583 --> 00:33:37,583
Hey, look.

304
00:33:39,041 --> 00:33:40,458
Maya's a guest.

305
00:33:40,541 --> 00:33:41,666
- You look lovely.
- Oh...

306
00:33:41,750 --> 00:33:43,750
- She's dating Lieutenant Pom.
- [camera clicks]

307
00:33:44,250 --> 00:33:47,041
- He'll be a military spokesperson soon.
- [camera clicks]

308
00:33:47,125 --> 00:33:49,791
[Aoy] That guy,
isn't he from the Chaiprakan family?

309
00:33:49,875 --> 00:33:53,000
Why is he here?
It's a politician's birthday party.

310
00:33:53,583 --> 00:33:57,291
Well, yes. Businessmen cozy up
with politicians for favors all the time.

311
00:33:58,125 --> 00:34:00,833
That family, they've been busy
forging connections everywhere.

312
00:34:01,791 --> 00:34:03,541
Getting invited here is a big deal.

313
00:34:15,083 --> 00:34:16,083
Good evening, Chef.

314
00:34:19,333 --> 00:34:20,333
Mr. Tos.

315
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:23,833
This area is reserved for me and my crew...

316
00:34:23,916 --> 00:34:26,916
Come on now.
Don't give me the cold shoulder.

317
00:34:27,458 --> 00:34:31,125
I'm only here so I can sample your menu,
not to pester you.

318
00:34:31,833 --> 00:34:32,833
[Tone] That's Mr. Tos.

319
00:34:32,875 --> 00:34:34,750
He's a prominent restaurateur.

320
00:34:35,666 --> 00:34:38,458
He wanted to be our sponsor
but Chef said no.

321
00:34:47,958 --> 00:34:49,041
[camera clicking]

322
00:35:01,375 --> 00:35:02,375
Evening, General.

323
00:35:03,375 --> 00:35:05,500
- Oh.
- How are you doing, sir?

324
00:35:05,583 --> 00:35:06,708
Are you a general now?

325
00:35:06,791 --> 00:35:08,916
No, not yet, sir.
I'm still just a lieutenant.

326
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:09,833
- Really?
- Yes.

327
00:35:09,916 --> 00:35:12,250
- Let me know when you're a general.
- Yes, sir.

328
00:35:12,333 --> 00:35:15,875
I'll give you my blessing. Oh, I see
you've brought your lady with you.

329
00:35:15,958 --> 00:35:17,416
- Yes, sir.
- May I touch her hair?

330
00:35:17,500 --> 00:35:18,666
[guests chuckling]

331
00:35:18,750 --> 00:35:20,625
- Yes, sir.
- May you both be successful.

332
00:35:20,708 --> 00:35:22,309
- [Pom] Thank you.
- Become a general soon.

333
00:35:22,333 --> 00:35:24,875
- Thank you, sir.
- I wish you a happy birthday, sir.

334
00:35:24,958 --> 00:35:26,791
- Thank you.
- You remember me?

335
00:35:27,291 --> 00:35:29,875
Oh. You look familiar.
Minister of Finance, aren't you?

336
00:35:29,958 --> 00:35:33,000
Yes, sir. I knew you'd remember.
You appointed me yourself.

337
00:35:33,083 --> 00:35:35,000
Right. Now, share some
of that money with me.

338
00:35:35,083 --> 00:35:36,500
[guests chuckling]

339
00:35:36,583 --> 00:35:37,625
All right. Come on now.

340
00:35:37,708 --> 00:35:39,708
[tense music playing]

341
00:35:54,833 --> 00:35:56,833
[tense music building]

342
00:36:20,666 --> 00:36:22,666
[tense music continues]

343
00:36:37,083 --> 00:36:38,416
[switches off stove]

344
00:36:51,375 --> 00:36:53,541
- Amazing.
- Mm.

345
00:36:53,625 --> 00:36:55,625
[music ends]

346
00:37:00,916 --> 00:37:01,916
[Paul] Begin.

347
00:37:02,750 --> 00:37:04,666
[dramatic music playing]

348
00:37:36,291 --> 00:37:38,291
[dramatic music continues]

349
00:38:19,083 --> 00:38:20,416
[music ends]

350
00:38:24,166 --> 00:38:26,166
[discordant music playing]

351
00:39:06,583 --> 00:39:08,583
[discordant music intensifies]

352
00:39:17,500 --> 00:39:18,916
[music ends]

353
00:39:22,333 --> 00:39:26,000
- [guests praising Paul]
- [general] Ah! That was very delicious.

354
00:39:26,083 --> 00:39:26,916
[man] It was perfect.

355
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:30,833
But please, don't tell anyone
how much food I had to eat tonight.

356
00:39:30,916 --> 00:39:32,041
[guests laughing]

357
00:39:32,125 --> 00:39:35,125
- Just say I had a few pieces.
- I didn't want it to end.

358
00:39:40,208 --> 00:39:42,583
If you need anything,
you can call me anytime.

359
00:39:48,708 --> 00:39:50,833
[general] Oh, it was very good.

360
00:39:50,916 --> 00:39:52,916
We're quite lucky to be here.

361
00:39:54,291 --> 00:39:55,416
Well done, sir.

362
00:39:56,166 --> 00:39:58,458
[radio chattering]

363
00:39:58,541 --> 00:39:59,916
[Aoy's dad] What would you like?

364
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,291
[woman] I'll have two regular <i>Pad See Ew.</i>

365
00:40:06,708 --> 00:40:08,541
[Aoy's dad] Two regular <i>Rad Na, </i>table six.

366
00:40:10,583 --> 00:40:12,208
[Bo] Table four, good to go.

367
00:40:12,291 --> 00:40:14,291
[sizzling]

368
00:40:17,083 --> 00:40:18,750
[Aoy's dad] Table five is still waiting.

369
00:40:37,833 --> 00:40:38,875
You look chipper.

370
00:40:43,125 --> 00:40:45,083
What are you doing?
Why don't you eat at home?

371
00:40:47,291 --> 00:40:48,291
'Cause I miss you.

372
00:40:49,875 --> 00:40:52,416
There's nothing more sad
than eating all alone.

373
00:40:54,875 --> 00:40:57,458
What's that? Looks like pigswill.

374
00:40:58,666 --> 00:41:00,333
Pigswill? It's meatballs!

375
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:04,083
What's your problem?
There's nothing weird about my soup.

376
00:41:04,791 --> 00:41:05,791
It looks gross.

377
00:41:08,125 --> 00:41:09,125
[laughs softly]

378
00:41:09,958 --> 00:41:13,666
You get to cook for magnates once
and everything else looks gross to you.

379
00:41:14,250 --> 00:41:17,250
- Do I have to say ""Your Highness"" now?
- [Aoy kicks table] Au!

380
00:41:21,333 --> 00:41:23,666
The food before you,
what you're about to eat,

381
00:41:24,208 --> 00:41:26,083
it should look good, not gross!

382
00:41:26,166 --> 00:41:27,166
Hey!

383
00:41:28,083 --> 00:41:29,250
Au...

384
00:41:34,375 --> 00:41:37,041
[muffled] I'll tell you one thing,
I eat to live.

385
00:41:39,875 --> 00:41:44,041
You see... fancy food might be good,
but I wouldn't know.

386
00:41:44,875 --> 00:41:47,125
It's for rich people
who have money they can throw away.

387
00:41:47,791 --> 00:41:49,708
For you and me, this does the trick.

388
00:41:49,791 --> 00:41:52,541
- [phone buzzing]
- [Au] Cheap, tasty, fills you right up.

389
00:41:53,625 --> 00:41:54,625
Hello, Tone!

390
00:41:56,750 --> 00:41:57,750
What for?

391
00:42:09,125 --> 00:42:11,125
[gentle music playing]

392
00:42:37,500 --> 00:42:40,583
[Tone] <i>What gives the food we cook
such rich and unique flavor</i>

393
00:42:40,666 --> 00:42:43,250
<i>is the quality of the ingredients we use,</i>

394
00:42:44,250 --> 00:42:45,625
<i>as well as their freshness.</i>

395
00:42:47,791 --> 00:42:51,375
<i>Whether it's meat, fish, or spices,</i>

396
00:42:52,375 --> 00:42:54,583
<i>their source give them a unique character.</i>

397
00:42:54,666 --> 00:42:55,958
[man] It's $40 a pound.

398
00:42:56,041 --> 00:42:57,166
Oh, nice.

399
00:42:57,250 --> 00:42:59,125
[man] Unfortunately, it's too small.

400
00:43:01,583 --> 00:43:02,416
This one's big.

401
00:43:02,500 --> 00:43:04,500
[gentle music continues]

402
00:43:10,791 --> 00:43:12,000
This one's good.

403
00:43:14,791 --> 00:43:15,708
I like this one...

404
00:43:15,791 --> 00:43:16,791
That's good.

405
00:43:18,750 --> 00:43:20,250
[man] <i>Is she your girlfriend?</i>

406
00:43:21,958 --> 00:43:25,000
- Mm. No, no. Friend. Just a friend.
- [chuckling]

407
00:43:25,083 --> 00:43:26,375
You're such a liar.

408
00:43:32,791 --> 00:43:34,625
You guys seem very close.

409
00:43:36,250 --> 00:43:37,375
I come here a lot.

410
00:43:38,333 --> 00:43:42,458
I used to come with the Chef.
Now he trusts me to come here alone.

411
00:43:44,291 --> 00:43:45,458
He used to come here?

412
00:43:46,208 --> 00:43:47,208
Hmm.

413
00:43:47,958 --> 00:43:52,333
Chef told me that, uh,
even the most luxurious dishes

414
00:43:52,416 --> 00:43:56,083
rely on ingredients provided
or produced by poorer people.

415
00:43:56,958 --> 00:43:59,666
He always pays them well,
but on one condition.

416
00:43:59,750 --> 00:44:02,250
They should always provide him
with their very best.

417
00:44:04,416 --> 00:44:05,416
That way...

418
00:44:06,458 --> 00:44:10,708
all the villagers feel proud
of their products and earn good money.

419
00:44:10,791 --> 00:44:11,791
[man] Here.

420
00:44:12,541 --> 00:44:13,958
- Thank you.
- [woman chuckles]

421
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:16,583
[woman] Are you full already?

422
00:44:17,416 --> 00:44:19,416
So, cooking for rich people

423
00:44:20,375 --> 00:44:21,708
also benefits the poor?

424
00:44:24,291 --> 00:44:25,375
Chef's all right.

425
00:44:29,208 --> 00:44:30,208
[Tone] Here, Chef.

426
00:44:33,750 --> 00:44:34,910
See if there are any fresher.

427
00:44:35,458 --> 00:44:38,125
- [Tone] Yes, Chef.
- Chef, would you taste the sauce, please?

428
00:44:41,625 --> 00:44:43,708
[Paul] Reduce it and add salt.

429
00:44:43,791 --> 00:44:44,791
Yes, Chef.

430
00:44:45,375 --> 00:44:46,375
[Dang] Chef.

431
00:44:48,666 --> 00:44:51,458
[Paul] Find ingredients
that are more ""golden.""

432
00:44:53,541 --> 00:44:55,458
Chef, is there anything for me to fry?

433
00:44:56,833 --> 00:44:57,833
No.

434
00:44:59,833 --> 00:45:01,273
What am I supposed to be doing then?

435
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:06,833
Scrub the pots and pans.
Mop the floor. Take out the trash.

436
00:45:07,458 --> 00:45:08,833
Lots for you to do.

437
00:45:09,375 --> 00:45:11,125
But I'm a junior sous-chef.

438
00:45:12,791 --> 00:45:13,791
Says who?

439
00:45:15,166 --> 00:45:16,833
Last job, I did all the frying.

440
00:45:17,333 --> 00:45:19,958
Last time is last time.
This time you're a cook helper.

441
00:45:20,750 --> 00:45:23,166
No, but I'm a junior sous-chef.
I should rea...

442
00:45:23,250 --> 00:45:24,458
[Paul inhales sharply]

443
00:45:28,750 --> 00:45:30,750
What makes you think you're so important?

444
00:45:37,708 --> 00:45:38,708
You see Bae?

445
00:45:40,875 --> 00:45:42,416
Try chopping like he does.

446
00:45:59,333 --> 00:46:01,875
[knife slicing]

447
00:46:01,958 --> 00:46:02,958
Faster.

448
00:46:04,166 --> 00:46:06,541
[knife slicing faster]

449
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:11,000
Faster.

450
00:46:13,333 --> 00:46:14,333
Faster.

451
00:46:15,041 --> 00:46:16,833
Faster. Faster.

452
00:46:17,791 --> 00:46:18,916
Faster!

453
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:20,708
- [grunts]
- [knife clatters]

454
00:46:21,958 --> 00:46:23,958
[hisses in pain]

455
00:46:25,875 --> 00:46:27,000
Besides frying...

456
00:46:28,666 --> 00:46:30,583
there is nothing else you can do.

457
00:46:32,291 --> 00:46:34,916
So what makes you think
you deserve the privilege?

458
00:46:51,458 --> 00:46:53,458
[dance music playing]

459
00:47:00,583 --> 00:47:03,541
[cheering]

460
00:47:03,625 --> 00:47:05,625
[woman] More! I want more!

461
00:47:07,500 --> 00:47:08,625
[whoops]

462
00:47:08,708 --> 00:47:10,708
- Oh my God, this is so good.
- Ooh!

463
00:47:11,958 --> 00:47:13,916
- You having fun? Yeah? Keep it up.
- Amazing.

464
00:47:14,625 --> 00:47:17,250
- Hey y'all! Let's party!
- [guests cheering, whooping]

465
00:47:21,166 --> 00:47:22,166
Yeah!

466
00:47:23,250 --> 00:47:24,958
Hey! I said fuck off.

467
00:47:25,583 --> 00:47:28,208
Hey, ladies! Want some cash? There you go!

468
00:47:28,291 --> 00:47:30,541
[women giggling]

469
00:47:30,625 --> 00:47:31,875
[growls playfully]

470
00:47:33,958 --> 00:47:35,958
[dance music continues]

471
00:47:46,541 --> 00:47:47,625
[speaks indistinctly]

472
00:48:01,041 --> 00:48:02,041
Enjoy.

473
00:48:18,333 --> 00:48:19,375
Mm!

474
00:48:21,291 --> 00:48:22,333
It's delicious.

475
00:48:22,833 --> 00:48:25,208
- Hey! This is great.
- [guests cheering]

476
00:48:25,291 --> 00:48:27,666
[man] Whoo! Amazing, dude!
- [host] Wicked!

477
00:48:27,750 --> 00:48:29,541
Wait a sec, I got you a present, bro.

478
00:48:30,166 --> 00:48:31,791
- [all laughing]
- Hey!

479
00:48:31,875 --> 00:48:33,291
I swear you're gonna love it, man!

480
00:48:33,375 --> 00:48:35,791
[host] Let's go, Prang. Come on, come on!

481
00:48:36,750 --> 00:48:38,416
[guests cheering]

482
00:48:48,625 --> 00:48:51,375
- Ooh! That's what I'm talkin' 'bout!
- Hot!

483
00:48:51,458 --> 00:48:54,375
- My man! He rocks!
- [host] Yeah!

484
00:48:55,375 --> 00:48:57,000
Oh! Let me have some of that.

485
00:48:58,333 --> 00:48:59,416
Oh, man!

486
00:49:00,708 --> 00:49:01,833
That's my dream right there.

487
00:49:02,791 --> 00:49:05,458
Look at those brats.
I mean, they're younger than us.

488
00:49:07,250 --> 00:49:08,250
[Tone] That they are.

489
00:49:08,750 --> 00:49:10,541
But can you make a fortune in crypto?

490
00:49:11,208 --> 00:49:12,208
No.

491
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:14,208
But we're Chef Paul's crew.

492
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:17,250
They're all over him.
Practically worship him.

493
00:49:17,958 --> 00:49:20,625
No, you're wrong. Look at them.

494
00:49:21,375 --> 00:49:23,916
They don't even know
what's good and what's not.

495
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:26,666
They only hired Chef Paul
for bragging rights.

496
00:49:26,750 --> 00:49:28,375
We're nobody to them.

497
00:49:29,583 --> 00:49:32,833
We'll never be anything else.
Till the day we die.

498
00:49:34,916 --> 00:49:36,833
As long as you don't make your own menu,

499
00:49:37,833 --> 00:49:39,041
you're invisible.

500
00:49:40,458 --> 00:49:41,625
Just keep that in mind.

501
00:49:43,333 --> 00:49:45,458
[guests continue chattering and laughing]

502
00:49:54,333 --> 00:49:55,958
Wow! Pork chop, sis!

503
00:49:58,166 --> 00:49:59,166
Try it.

504
00:50:04,458 --> 00:50:05,458
Hmm.

505
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:13,000
It's good.

506
00:50:13,541 --> 00:50:14,375
[Aoy] Really?

507
00:50:14,458 --> 00:50:15,833
You really think so?

508
00:50:17,041 --> 00:50:18,791
[Joy] Mm. It's good.

509
00:50:20,250 --> 00:50:24,416
There you go. You wanted to try it.
Cost almost six dollars.

510
00:50:25,166 --> 00:50:26,291
That's expensive!

511
00:50:26,375 --> 00:50:27,375
Oh, yeah.

512
00:50:27,958 --> 00:50:30,208
The barista said the coffee beans
won some kind of award

513
00:50:30,291 --> 00:50:33,291
and are single-sourced
from Kenya, I think.

514
00:50:33,375 --> 00:50:34,583
Anyway, just try it.

515
00:50:39,916 --> 00:50:41,166
- Mm.
- [Au] How is it?

516
00:50:43,583 --> 00:50:44,583
Mm.

517
00:50:45,333 --> 00:50:46,708
Pork chop and coffee.

518
00:50:48,208 --> 00:50:50,291
I don't get the modern world.

519
00:50:50,958 --> 00:50:54,833
It's got to be special.
So they can sell it at a higher price.

520
00:50:54,916 --> 00:50:58,958
Is it expensive 'cause it's special?
Or special 'cause it's expensive?

521
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:03,000
Oh, wow.

522
00:51:07,291 --> 00:51:08,416
Crybaby noodles?

523
00:51:09,125 --> 00:51:10,125
- Yeah!
- Oh, yeah!

524
00:51:10,708 --> 00:51:11,833
All right.

525
00:51:16,125 --> 00:51:16,958
You made this?

526
00:51:17,041 --> 00:51:18,750
- Mm.
- Let me try.

527
00:51:19,291 --> 00:51:20,625
- Hey, hey, hey!
- Hey.

528
00:51:20,708 --> 00:51:21,708
- Wait.
- What?

529
00:51:21,750 --> 00:51:24,708
- Don't use your hands!
- Hey, I do like my ancestors.

530
00:51:26,458 --> 00:51:27,458
Use a fork!

531
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:30,000
Ooh!

532
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:32,960
Tastes like the cheap pork
you find on the street.

533
00:51:33,041 --> 00:51:34,541
- Oh, come on!
- It's true!

534
00:51:34,625 --> 00:51:36,958
- This is Grade-A Kurobuta pork.
- The same.

535
00:51:37,041 --> 00:51:38,750
- Cheap milk-marinated pork.
- Oh!

536
00:51:38,833 --> 00:51:40,708
That's it! I'm right.
You just added pepper.

537
00:51:40,791 --> 00:51:43,208
Hey! Greasy! Au!

538
00:51:43,291 --> 00:51:44,291
Napkin.

539
00:51:51,041 --> 00:51:55,125
Now, that is special.
It's got a killer name too!

540
00:51:55,208 --> 00:51:56,916
- Thank you.
- Crybaby noodles!

541
00:51:59,125 --> 00:52:00,291
Mm. Mm.

542
00:52:02,875 --> 00:52:03,875
The best.

543
00:52:04,666 --> 00:52:05,666
Aw, so good.

544
00:52:14,666 --> 00:52:16,041
<i>Pad See Ew </i>for two.

545
00:52:16,125 --> 00:52:17,791
[laughs] Come on in.

546
00:52:20,791 --> 00:52:22,416
Wow, your place is great!

547
00:52:25,500 --> 00:52:29,125
- Here. For when you're hungry.
- Oh, yeah. I've been craving some of that.

548
00:52:29,750 --> 00:52:32,250
[uplifting music playing]

549
00:52:36,791 --> 00:52:38,416
[Tone] Okay. Wanna try?

550
00:52:38,500 --> 00:52:39,500
[Aoy] Hmm.

551
00:52:41,291 --> 00:52:42,958
- Am I holding it right?
- Yes.

552
00:52:44,208 --> 00:52:46,958
No. Do it like this.
Curl in the fingers of your left hand.

553
00:52:47,041 --> 00:52:49,125
- Mm-hmm.
- Lift the right hand.

554
00:52:49,208 --> 00:52:52,041
Hold it straight, nice and firm,
and press down.

555
00:52:54,583 --> 00:52:57,791
That's the same cut Chef Paul uses.
Isn't it expensive?

556
00:53:01,083 --> 00:53:02,166
[sizzling]

557
00:53:03,666 --> 00:53:05,083
Keep the oil away from you.

558
00:53:06,500 --> 00:53:10,333
Now, press the meat into the pan,
so it cooks evenly.

559
00:53:10,416 --> 00:53:12,000
- This is seared.
- Hmm.

560
00:53:12,083 --> 00:53:13,583
- This is sous-vide.
- Mm.

561
00:53:15,083 --> 00:53:16,083
No condiments?

562
00:53:16,583 --> 00:53:18,541
Why? Good as is.

563
00:53:20,958 --> 00:53:22,250
Come on. Give it a good shake.

564
00:53:22,333 --> 00:53:24,375
- I mean, shake it.
- What about the angle?

565
00:53:24,458 --> 00:53:26,041
- Like this?
- That's good.

566
00:53:26,666 --> 00:53:28,041
There you go, that's it.

567
00:53:29,375 --> 00:53:30,375
Mm.

568
00:53:33,500 --> 00:53:35,291
Well, is it good?

569
00:53:35,875 --> 00:53:37,875
[uplifting music continues]

570
00:54:00,166 --> 00:54:01,708
- Using a wok?
- Mm.

571
00:54:02,708 --> 00:54:04,625
Textbook cooking is kinda boring.

572
00:54:05,708 --> 00:54:08,041
- A pan's a pan.
- [Tone] Uh-huh.

573
00:54:08,625 --> 00:54:11,083
- Whoa! It caught fire!
- Hey!

574
00:54:11,166 --> 00:54:13,166
[uplifting music continues]

575
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:22,291
Hmm! All done.

576
00:54:24,666 --> 00:54:25,916
What do you think, Chef?

577
00:54:27,666 --> 00:54:28,666
See?

578
00:54:29,166 --> 00:54:32,666
It gets charred when you use a wok. Also...

579
00:54:34,125 --> 00:54:37,500
there is, uh,
there is a bit too much sauce.

580
00:54:37,583 --> 00:54:39,125
Oh. Hmm.

581
00:54:39,875 --> 00:54:43,416
And I think
you massaged the meat a little too much.

582
00:54:44,291 --> 00:54:47,916
With a good cut of meat,
a gentle rub is all it takes.

583
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:49,541
Or else, the marinade takes over.

584
00:54:50,708 --> 00:54:52,208
Okay. I'll try it again.

585
00:55:08,666 --> 00:55:09,916
[Tone] I think...

586
00:55:10,416 --> 00:55:11,416
Too hard?

587
00:55:12,125 --> 00:55:14,000
- Gentler.
- Gentler.

588
00:55:17,250 --> 00:55:18,250
[Tone] Like this.

589
00:55:19,666 --> 00:55:20,666
That's it.

00:56:53,166 --> 00:56:54,166
Uncle Dang,

593
00:56:55,208 --> 00:56:58,958
would you be so kind as to try this?

594
00:57:01,291 --> 00:57:03,500
Here. Ah...

595
00:57:06,083 --> 00:57:07,083
How is it?

596
00:57:10,916 --> 00:57:12,166
The fat is undercooked.

597
00:57:12,791 --> 00:57:14,708
- Huh?
- Here. Look.

598
00:57:14,791 --> 00:57:17,416
The fat bits, there's still some white.

599
00:57:19,166 --> 00:57:22,416
You have to be meticulous.
Make sure it's evenly cooked.

600
00:57:23,333 --> 00:57:24,375
Is that clear?

601
00:57:25,500 --> 00:57:29,875
- You still have a lot to learn.
- He's right. Still got a long way to go.

602
00:57:29,958 --> 00:57:32,916
Not just in terms of flavor,
but swagger, also.

603
00:57:38,083 --> 00:57:40,625
- Damn it. Keng!
- Hmm?

604
00:57:40,708 --> 00:57:42,916
- [Aoy] Is that allowed?
- Come on!

605
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:44,041
Unreal!

606
00:57:44,958 --> 00:57:46,166
Now that's swagger.

607
00:57:53,125 --> 00:57:54,125
Why bother?

608
00:58:15,458 --> 00:58:17,333
You look cool, hmm?

609
00:58:22,458 --> 00:58:24,458
What's this? Keep it in!

610
00:58:30,708 --> 00:58:31,708
What is this?

611
00:58:33,166 --> 00:58:34,708
- It's...
- Leave it in your mouth!

612
00:58:36,541 --> 00:58:37,541
[Keng] It's soup, sir.

613
00:58:39,625 --> 00:58:43,291
[Paul] You have to keep checking the soup
to make sure it's properly done.

614
00:58:46,666 --> 00:58:48,333
Now, check it. hmm?

615

[Keng grunts]

If this happens
when you're cooking for customers,

620
00:59:25,708 --> 00:59:27,416
will you take responsibility?

621
00:59:32,500 --> 00:59:33,500
Sorry, Chef.

622
00:59:56,291 --> 00:59:57,708
There's a thief among you.

That's right.

Right here and now in this very kitchen.

626
01:00:09,791 --> 01:00:12,208
There's a pound of dry-aged beef missing.

627
01:00:12,291 --> 01:00:13,833
Also a pound of foie gras.

628
01:00:15,083 --> 01:00:16,708
Anyone care to come forward?

629
01:00:20,416 --> 01:00:22,375
A thief can never be a chef.

630
01:00:23,333 --> 01:00:24,791
Chefs don't behave like that.

631
01:00:31,250 --> 01:00:33,083
If no one will come forward,

632
01:00:35,500 --> 01:00:38,041
I'll have to check
the CCTV camera footage.

633
01:00:40,458 --> 01:00:41,666
But then...

634
01:00:44,166 --> 01:00:45,875
the cops will have to be called in.

I've been here for years.

638

Why can't I have nice things
like we make for other people?

You've been here for years.

640
01:01:15,291 --> 01:01:16,708
Why don't you understand

641
01:01:17,583 --> 01:01:22,916
that the food I make is reserved for
people who have the money to pay for it?

642
01:01:24,750 --> 01:01:28,666
If you want it so much,
then use your money and hire me,

643
01:01:29,583 --> 01:01:30,916
and I'll cook for you.

644
01:01:35,541 --> 01:01:37,041

Since we're understaffed, Dang,

650
01:03:09,791 --> 01:03:12,666
you will cover for Tue and Aoy.

651
01:03:15,625 --> 01:03:16,625
Yes, Chef.

652
01:03:17,875 --> 01:03:18,875

I want to see Caesar.

In a bit, sweetie.

01:04:37,000 --> 01:04:39,916
Our house is getting fixed up.
Caesar's watching it for us.

658

When it's finished,

659
01:04:41,875 --> 01:04:45,375
our house will be a lot bigger
and much prettier too.

660
01:04:46,125 --> 01:04:47,125
Okay.

I didn't, Chef.

It's... When my dad was a child,
he used to cry an awful lot.

01:14:21,583 --> 01:14:23,291
And he was a really fussy eater.

726
01:14:23,916 --> 01:14:26,416
So to get him to stop crying
and start eating,

727
01:14:26,500 --> 01:14:29,750
Grandma tried anything and everything,
and eventually came up with this.

It's a really tasty dish.

How come we never get to use

757
01:17:31,500 --> 01:17:35,250
After I got caught,
we had to clean up the mess.

758
01:17:35,875 --> 01:17:37,583
The caviar was all over the floor.

01:17:55,708 --> 01:17:57,208
You know what really surprised me?

761
01:18:02,416 --> 01:18:04,083
It tasted like total shit!

[tense music intensifies]

763
01:18:12,625 --> 01:18:16,875
What you eat
represents your social status.

764
01:18:18,416 --> 01:18:20,041
It has nothing to do with love.

765
01:18:23,875 --> 01:18:27,875
The poor eat
simply to satisfy their hunger.

766
01:18:29,791 --> 01:18:32,000
But when you have more than enough to eat...

767
01:18:34,500 --> 01:18:35,916
your hunger doesn't end.

768
01:18:39,333 --> 01:18:40,750
You hunger for approval,

769
01:18:42,000 --> 01:18:43,541
for something special,

770
01:18:45,041 --> 01:18:47,166
for exclusive experiences.

771
01:18:52,041 --> 01:18:57,791
That shitty caviar made me realize
that I wanted to be a chef.

772
01:19:00,500 --> 01:19:04,041
I wanted to be the kind of chef
that the rich bow down to,

773
01:19:04,125 --> 01:19:05,750
begging him to cook for them.

774
01:19:10,666 --> 01:19:12,916

[crying] Well, the nurse said
there are no beds available.

787
01:20:19,666 --> 01:20:22,500
[nurse] Please, one at a time.
You have to wait until we call you.

He's just had bypass surgery
but he's still not out of the woods yet.

796

They're keeping him under observation.

we could get a better room?

[music fades]

932
01:37:21,000 --> 01:37:22,958
[Tone] This place won't survive
till next month.

933
01:37:32,541 --> 01:37:35,083
Following my dream
is harder than I thought.

934
01:37:37,250 --> 01:37:38,708
I don't know how to run a business.

935
01:37:43,875 --> 01:37:44,875
No.

936
01:37:46,791 --> 01:37:48,750
It's the location of the restaurant.

937
01:37:48,833 --> 01:37:50,458
You're too far from the main street.

938
01:37:53,083 --> 01:37:54,083
Yeah, right.

939
01:37:56,333 --> 01:37:57,875
I don't have a sponsor like you.

940
01:37:59,708 --> 01:38:00,708
Oh.

941
01:38:01,458 --> 01:38:04,250
This is the only area
where I can afford the rent.

942
01:38:05,208 --> 01:38:06,208
Why do you say that?

943
01:38:10,125 --> 01:38:12,333
Tone, it's not just
because I have a sponsor.

944
01:38:12,416 --> 01:38:14,333
It's because I work really hard.

945
01:38:16,000 --> 01:38:18,000
You mean if I get all these burns,

946
01:38:19,541 --> 01:38:20,708
I'll succeed too?

947
01:38:20,791 --> 01:38:22,208
Hey! Don't be a jerk.

948
01:38:24,125 --> 01:38:26,500
What I've achieved,
you don't think I came by it honestly?

949
01:38:26,583 --> 01:38:28,000
I don't deserve it?

950
01:38:32,375 --> 01:38:33,583
Okay, so what?

951
01:38:38,333 --> 01:38:40,250
You want me to congratulate you?

952
01:38:43,458 --> 01:38:45,208
Congratulations, Aoy!

953
01:38:46,125 --> 01:38:47,708
You are the best.

954
01:38:47,791 --> 01:38:48,791
Tone!

955
01:38:50,791 --> 01:38:53,416
You seem to forget,
you're the one who brought me into this.

956
01:38:55,083 --> 01:38:56,083
Yeah.

957
01:38:58,708 --> 01:39:00,750
And I don't regret the decision one bit.

958
01:39:03,125 --> 01:39:06,000
The day I saw you,
I knew you were better than me.

959
01:39:11,708 --> 01:39:13,625
I saw how much talent you had.

960
01:39:21,916 --> 01:39:22,916
I was jealous.

[somber music playing]

962
01:39:33,166 --> 01:39:34,166
You know what?

963
01:39:35,291 --> 01:39:37,625
The reason why
you can't make your dream come true

964
01:39:39,291 --> 01:39:41,416
is because you're not hungry enough.

965
01:39:47,833 --> 01:39:48,833
That hurt.

966
01:39:52,958 --> 01:39:54,458
You sounded just like Chef.

967
01:39:56,416 --> 01:39:57,500
[inhales sharply]

968
01:40:00,333 --> 01:40:02,000
[Tone] But maybe you're right.

969
01:40:04,541 --> 01:40:06,041
I'm just not hungry enough.

Mr. Tos?

976
01:41:07,166 --> 01:41:10,041
Do you remember Tone,
a sous-chef from Hunger?

977
01:41:10,125 --> 01:41:11,833
You think you could help him out?

978
01:41:12,916 --> 01:41:13,916
[Tos] Tone.

979
01:41:14,291 --> 01:41:15,291
I remember him.

980
01:41:17,166 --> 01:41:18,541
I'll be frank with you, Aoy.

981
01:41:20,250 --> 01:41:22,208
He has absolutely no selling point.

982
01:41:23,583 --> 01:41:26,541
Yes, but he's very skilled and works hard.

983
01:41:26,625 --> 01:41:27,875
He is a brilliant cook.

984
01:41:27,958 --> 01:41:28,958
I'm sure he is.

985
01:41:29,583 --> 01:41:30,583
I believe you.

986
01:41:31,500 --> 01:41:33,416
But there are a million like him
out there.

987
01:41:33,500 --> 01:41:35,500
I don't want someone who cooks well.

988
01:41:35,583 --> 01:41:37,666
I want someone with character.

989
01:41:45,958 --> 01:41:48,916
Okay. I'll have a chat with him.

990
01:41:50,291 --> 01:41:51,291
Thank you.

991
01:42:00,541 --> 01:42:01,541
You're doing well.

992
01:42:03,375 --> 01:42:05,208
But you can definitely do better.

993

994
01:42:16,875 --> 01:42:20,125
By the way,
there's a big event next week.

995
01:42:21,041 --> 01:42:23,541
It'll be your first
since we've opened our restaurant.

996
01:42:24,166 --> 01:42:25,875

997

- What, Madam Milky, the socialite?
- That's right.

998
01:42:30,583 --> 01:42:32,208
Wants you and no one else.

A-listers on the guest list.

1000
01:42:35,375 --> 01:42:38,458
Top celebrities. Business people.

1001
01:42:38,541 --> 01:42:40,791
Even international foodies.

1002
01:42:42,958 --> 01:42:45,958
This restaurant's been open for months.
The hype isn't there yet.

1003
01:42:46,625 --> 01:42:48,208
We need something sensational.

1004
01:42:49,458 --> 01:42:50,708
This is your coming out.

1005

by the whole country.

should come to my restaurant.

Corny, my ass. I mean it.

1037
01:45:45,458 --> 01:45:48,041
The neighbors around here
said you've changed a lot.

1038

I don't buy it.

You're a famous chef now.

Only your customers' do.

Still, I want to know
what you think of it.

From now on,

all you will ever think about

1058
01:48:45,750 --> 01:48:47,666
is, ""When will I fall off the edge?""

1059
01:48:49,416 --> 01:48:50,791
""Am I still relevant?""

1060

""Is this really for me?""

This is just the start.

There is so much more for you to lose.

Triumph of the New Wave.

1111

[lively conversation]

1112
01:54:47,291 --> 01:54:48,375
For you.

1113
01:54:50,083 --> 01:54:51,666
[man] This foam, is it edible?

1114
01:54:51,750 --> 01:54:53,830
- [crew] Everything is edible, sir.
- [camera clicks]

1115
01:54:54,791 --> 01:54:56,500
[woman] The fish is simply amazing.

1116
01:55:01,208 --> 01:55:02,208
Mm!

1117
01:55:07,166 --> 01:55:09,166

[tense music continues]

1122

A Sacrificial Feast.

Crybaby noodles.

1132
02:00:51,458 --> 02:00:54,083
A home recipe passed down from my grandma.

1133
02:00:56,458 --> 02:01:00,750
Each of us has this one dish
that makes us feel right at home.

1134
02:01:02,833 --> 02:01:06,291
As one gets older, you toil away,

1135
02:01:08,000 --> 02:01:09,291
and feel lonely.

1136
02:01:12,041 --> 02:01:14,541
Then you go home and eat this dish...

1137
02:01:17,291 --> 02:01:18,708
and you feel better.

1138
02:01:22,250 --> 02:01:23,916
And it makes you realize...

1139
02:01:27,833 --> 02:01:29,625
there's always someone who loves you.

1140
02:01:31,500 --> 02:01:33,916
And you love them also, just as much.

1141
02:01:40,291 --> 02:01:41,291
Enjoy.

1142
02:02:07,833 --> 02:02:08,833
Mm.

1143
02:02:16,625 --> 02:02:18,416
The noodles taste amazing.

1144
02:02:19,208 --> 02:02:21,666
The look is somewhat ordinary,
but it's delicious.

1145
02:02:29,625 --> 02:02:31,625
[trickling echoes]

1146
02:02:33,750 --> 02:02:36,333

[trickling echoes]

1148
02:03:06,250 --> 02:03:08,125
How about some soup to counter the oil?

1149
02:03:10,833 --> 02:03:12,291
Ordinary people.

1150
02:03:13,333 --> 02:03:16,750
'Cause in the end, we are simply human.

1151
02:03:18,583 --> 02:03:19,708
Enjoy.

1152
02:03:19,791 --> 02:03:21,791
[uneasy music continues]

1153
02:03:24,208 --> 02:03:25,500
[man] That's great.

1154
02:03:27,791 --> 02:03:29,041
Let's go taste this.

1155
02:03:30,166 --> 02:03:32,375
[excited chatter]

1156
02:03:35,208 --> 02:03:36,750
[inhales deeply]

1157
02:03:56,166 --> 02:03:57,166
Wow.

1158
02:04:00,666 --> 02:04:02,666
[guests chatting indistinctly]

1159
02:04:07,708 --> 02:04:09,708
[uneasy music continues]

1160
02:04:18,458 --> 02:04:20,916
This is the final lesson I have for you.

1161
02:04:23,666 --> 02:04:25,875
No matter how good your food is,

1162
02:04:26,416 --> 02:04:28,083
how sophisticated it looks,

1163
02:04:28,833 --> 02:04:30,708
or how creative your menu is...

1164
02:04:33,625 --> 02:04:36,333
prejudice is something
you can never overcome.

1165
02:04:42,916 --> 02:04:44,291
These people know who I am.

1166
02:04:46,375 --> 02:04:48,458
They've already crowned me the winner.

1167
02:04:55,583 --> 02:04:57,625
Because they are hungry for <i>me</i>.

1168
02:05:01,208 --> 02:05:02,208
Don't you get it?

1169
02:05:10,250 --> 02:05:12,250
[music ends]

1170
02:05:17,416 --> 02:05:19,375
We need to bring you in for questioning.

1171

1172
02:05:23,041 --> 02:05:24,500

1173
02:05:24,583 --> 02:05:26,166

1174

[phones chiming]

1175
02:05:33,500 --> 02:05:34,625
[woman] Did you see this?

1176
02:05:34,708 --> 02:05:35,708
[man] What's this?

1177
02:05:38,250 --> 02:05:40,583
[hunter] <i>Chef, put this on a plate for me.</i>

1178

FAMOUS CHEF SERVES HORNBILL

- [guests exclaim]
- [man] That's Chef Paul. It is.

1180
02:05:47,458 --> 02:05:49,583
- [woman] What?
- [man 2] That's disgusting.

1181
02:05:51,458 --> 02:05:52,791
<i>Delicious.</i>

1182
02:05:53,875 --> 02:05:55,083
<i>This is something else!</i>

1183
02:05:56,458 --> 02:05:58,958
- [dramatic music playing]

1184

02:06:13,541 --> 02:06:16,208

02:06:23,250 --> 02:06:25,250
[dramatic music continues]

1187
02:06:49,791 --> 02:06:53,083
Thanks, all of you,
for releasing the clip.

1188
02:06:55,416 --> 02:06:56,958
I will get away with it anyway.

1189
02:07:01,500 --> 02:07:04,166
And then
even more rich people will line up

1190
02:07:04,875 --> 02:07:06,791
and take me out hunting with them.

1191
02:07:06,875 --> 02:07:08,291
[man] Oh, that's disgusting.

1192
02:07:09,333 --> 02:07:10,625
Because people like me...

1193
02:07:12,416 --> 02:07:14,708
we are totally above the law.

1194
02:07:16,916 --> 02:07:19,875
[woman] Take him away! Oh! That's it.

1195
02:07:21,416 --> 02:07:24,250
Are you absolutely sure
that's how you wanna play it?

1196
02:07:24,958 --> 02:07:26,208
[policeman] Come on.

1197
02:07:29,166 --> 02:07:30,958
- Well done, Chef.
- [policeman] Sir, come.

1198
02:07:31,666 --> 02:07:33,000
[Paul] Congratulations, Chef.

1199
02:07:33,541 --> 02:07:34,791
Well done, Chef!

1200
02:07:40,791 --> 02:07:42,000
[music fades]

1201
02:07:55,666 --> 02:07:59,250
I want to say
all your dishes were phenomenal.

1202
02:08:00,000 --> 02:08:04,541
I've always thought that
Chef Paul's cuisine was so pretentious.

1203
02:08:04,625 --> 02:08:06,666
[muffled] Yours is far more genuine.

1204
02:08:06,750 --> 02:08:10,000
[muffled] And now,
the next part of our show, ""Spartacus""!

1205

[somber music playing]

1208
02:08:20,875 --> 02:08:24,250
Aoy. I'm happy for you. You were amazing.

1209
02:08:24,333 --> 02:08:29,000
You have no idea how many strings
I had to pull to get you here tonight.

1210
02:08:31,750 --> 02:08:34,000
Chef Paul's era will soon be over

1211
02:08:34,083 --> 02:08:35,583
and yours will begin.

1212
02:08:36,708 --> 02:08:41,000
Imagine! The rising new chef
who overthrew Chef Paul!

1213
02:08:42,041 --> 02:08:46,625
Thanks to Tone's clip, no one will ever
look at Chef Paul the same way again.

1214
02:08:49,666 --> 02:08:50,958
That's what it's about, huh?

1215
02:08:52,416 --> 02:08:54,833
[Tos] Aoy, this world

1216
02:08:55,500 --> 02:08:57,250
isn't ruled by some principle.

1217
02:08:59,500 --> 02:09:02,041
The clip is the only thing
Tone has to offer

1218
02:09:02,125 --> 02:09:04,666
in exchange for my help,
just like you asked.

1219
02:09:04,750 --> 02:09:06,750
[somber music continues]

1220
02:09:12,500 --> 02:09:13,833
Hey, Aoy!

1221
02:09:14,333 --> 02:09:15,708
Don't be angry.

1222
02:09:17,000 --> 02:09:18,708
You didn't lose to Chef Paul.

1223
02:09:19,541 --> 02:09:20,750
Now all you have to do

1224
02:09:20,833 --> 02:09:23,875
is grow some real clout
and gain influence.

1225
02:09:23,958 --> 02:09:26,291
Let everyone know you're top dog.

1226
02:09:27,041 --> 02:09:28,916
First, we'll need
to work on your appearance.

1227
02:09:29,000 --> 02:09:30,500
It's a question of marketing.

1228
02:09:30,583 --> 02:09:32,083
I'll hire some experts for that.

1229
02:09:42,375 --> 02:09:43,375
Aoy!

1230
02:09:45,000 --> 02:09:49,125
Aren't you the one who told me...
that I wasn't hungry enough for success?

1231
02:09:54,875 --> 02:09:56,708
Isn't this what you were hungry for?

1232
02:09:57,791 --> 02:09:59,791

Well, suddenly Au wanted to sell noodles.

1245
02:15:05,625 --> 02:15:07,791
He was afraid we wouldn't have a chef.

1246
02:15:12,833 --> 02:15:14,166
What took you so long?

1247
02:15:15,416 --> 02:15:16,250
Hmm?

1250
02:15:27,333 --> 02:15:29,125
I'm gonna need your help, you know.

1251
02:15:29,916 --> 02:15:30,916
My help?

1252
02:15:31,583 --> 02:15:32,583
Mm.

1253
02:15:34,000 --> 02:15:35,416
Oh yeah, with what?

1254
02:15:36,291 --> 02:15:38,125
Your specialty, online content.

1255
02:15:42,166 --> 02:15:43,166
You got it.

[emotional music continues]

1257
02:16:11,666 --> 02:16:13,791
I'll be the chef of this restaurant.

1258
02:16:15,375 --> 02:16:17,250
[Joy] What about the other restaurant?

1259
02:16:18,666 --> 02:16:20,041
This is my restaurant.

1260
02:16:33,041 --> 02:16:35,166
This is where I'll set up my menu.

1261
02:16:39,458 --> 02:16:41,250
We'll restart our own thing here.

1262
02:16:46,291 --> 02:16:47,291
You guys hungry?

1263
02:16:47,791 --> 02:16:49,416

00:01:45,666 --> 00:01:47,000
Sweetheart.

15
00:01:47,666 --> 00:01:48,958
Okay. I'll tell him.

16
00:01:49,916 --> 00:01:51,000
No worries at all.

17
00:01:52,541 --> 00:01:55,541
Tomorrow, make her
a wire transfer of 3,000 euros.

18
00:01:55,625 --> 00:01:57,833
3,000 euros?!

19
00:01:59,125 --> 00:02:00,291
What has she done?

20
00:02:00,375 --> 00:02:03,125
She's late with her rent, poor girl.
The Dutch are strict.

21
00:02:04,291 --> 00:02:05,125
Look at this.

22
00:02:05,708 --> 00:02:08,958
A little black dress. Chic.
A classic. Do you like it?

23
00:02:09,041 --> 00:02:12,708
Honey, we're going to an exclusive place.
We need to stand out.

24
00:02:12,791 --> 00:02:14,250
Come on. Raise the bar.

25
00:02:14,333 --> 00:02:18,958
My goodness. What is it the Oscars night?
I thought it was a birthday.

26
00:02:19,041 --> 00:02:22,083
It isn't just a birthday.
Dario's also become a manager.

27
00:02:22,166 --> 00:02:23,583
There. Precisely.

28
00:02:24,083 --> 00:02:27,000
A 1,700-euro watch
sounds very oafish to me.

29
00:02:27,083 --> 00:02:28,541
You'll embarrass people.

30
00:02:29,041 --> 00:02:32,791
Not this again? It's an investment.
I give him a big present,

31
00:02:32,875 --> 00:02:35,208
and he does us
a big favor on our mortgage.

32
00:02:42,333 --> 00:02:43,166
Yes?

33
00:02:43,958 --> 00:02:44,791
Tell me.

34
00:02:47,291 --> 00:02:48,125
A lawyer?

35
00:02:49,416 --> 00:02:50,250
Which lawyer?

36
00:02:51,625 --> 00:02:53,208
No. It's not me.

37
00:02:54,791 --> 00:02:57,416
No. I don't know any Rosario.

38
00:02:57,500 --> 00:03:00,375
Okay, it's me. I'm Rosario. What's up?

39
00:03:00,458 --> 00:03:03,291
You've become a lawyer? I'm happy for you.

40
00:03:03,375 --> 00:03:04,208
Tell me.

41
00:03:07,833 --> 00:03:09,125
When did it happen?

42
00:03:12,750 --> 00:03:15,250
No. I'm not interested in the inheritance.

43
00:03:18,083 --> 00:03:18,916
Bye.

44
00:03:23,833 --> 00:03:24,666
Who was it?

45
00:03:26,333 --> 00:03:27,250
A call center.

46
00:03:27,333 --> 00:03:29,750
You're emotional
because a call center called.

47
00:03:29,833 --> 00:03:32,791
No, it's… the menthol shaving cream.

48
00:03:33,833 --> 00:03:34,666
Yeah.

49
00:03:44,375 --> 00:03:45,458
I knew it.

50
00:03:47,125 --> 00:03:50,666
-I'm going home and changing.
-Honey, don't exaggerate.

51
00:03:50,750 --> 00:03:53,916
You're making it bigger than it is.
Nobody looks at our clothes.

52
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,250
Where's the restroom?

53
00:03:56,208 --> 00:03:57,125
We've just…

54
00:03:57,791 --> 00:03:59,875
Usually, it's at the far right.

55
00:03:59,958 --> 00:04:00,958
Thanks.

56
00:04:01,041 --> 00:04:05,000
See? You should be friendly too
and make new friends. Let's go.

57
00:04:05,083 --> 00:04:06,375
Come on.

58
00:04:07,666 --> 00:04:09,708
What's wrong? Shall I drag you?

59
00:04:11,125 --> 00:04:12,041
I am a guest.

60
00:04:14,958 --> 00:04:17,625
Darione! Great to see you.

61
00:04:17,708 --> 00:04:20,291
-Ramona, let me hug you.
-Hi.

62
00:04:20,375 --> 00:04:22,833
Dario. Listen.

63
00:04:24,166 --> 00:04:28,375
I could use a little breathing space.
I've received a writ of execution.

64
00:04:30,708 --> 00:04:31,541
Now that

65
00:04:32,208 --> 00:04:35,041
you are a manager,
you could stop it, right?

66
00:04:35,125 --> 00:04:39,208
No, because the head office
has confirmed the securitization.

67
00:04:40,291 --> 00:04:42,125
-Meaning?
-Meaning that…

68
00:04:42,208 --> 00:04:46,666
The most I can do is give you two weeks,
but if you don't cover at least 25%

69
00:04:46,750 --> 00:04:50,333
of mortgage arrears,
then it's bye to Gelso.

70
00:04:50,416 --> 00:04:52,166
But that's 50,000 euros.

71
00:04:52,250 --> 00:04:55,208
I know, but I told you
not to buy the space next door.

72
00:04:55,291 --> 00:04:56,833
-Dario.
-Hey there.

73
00:04:57,500 --> 00:04:58,916
-Listen, Dario.
-Yeah.

74
00:04:59,958 --> 00:05:02,583
-Can you not say anything to Teresa?
-Okay.

75
00:05:02,666 --> 00:05:05,083
-Don't worry. Come on.
-Thanks.

76
00:05:05,958 --> 00:05:07,916
Excuse me? Some Prosecco, please?

77
00:05:08,416 --> 00:05:09,333
Not this again…

78
00:05:21,833 --> 00:05:23,041
Olé!

79
00:05:23,625 --> 00:05:27,458
A mug with a skull!
I really wanted it. It's too cool.

80
00:05:32,458 --> 00:05:34,458
-Olé!
-You're crazy. You are!

81
00:05:35,166 --> 00:05:36,000
I love them.

82
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:42,541
Attention. ""Happy birthday,
Dario, from Salvo and Teresa.""

83
00:05:42,625 --> 00:05:45,625
Thank you.

84
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:51,875
Olé!

85
00:05:54,375 --> 00:05:55,750
Did he buy him a watch?

86
00:05:55,833 --> 00:05:57,666
-It's not real. Is it?
-A watch?

87
00:05:57,750 --> 00:05:58,583
Come on.

88
00:05:59,791 --> 00:06:03,458
-Not at all. Are you joking? It's a fake.
-It's fake.

89
00:06:03,541 --> 00:06:06,291
I really thought he went for
a kitschy, Southern-style gift.

90
00:06:08,833 --> 00:06:11,875
-It looks fucking real though.
-Well, yeah.

91
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,208
-It looks real to me.
-What the fuck are you saying?

92
00:06:17,291 --> 00:06:20,958
Can't you tell it's a fake? If you throw
it in the sangria, it won't even float.

93
00:06:22,125 --> 00:06:23,708
You're crazy!

94
00:06:26,875 --> 00:06:27,750
What's here?

95
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:29,958
I am not the waiter--

96
00:06:30,041 --> 00:06:32,541
Attention. No card here.

97
00:06:36,333 --> 00:06:37,166
Olé!

98
00:06:38,291 --> 00:06:39,125
Put it away.

99
00:06:40,625 --> 00:06:42,041
Put it away. Take it.

100
00:06:49,041 --> 00:06:49,875
Olé!

101
00:07:16,958 --> 00:07:18,166
Good morning.

102
00:07:19,250 --> 00:07:21,083
You got up early this morning.

103
00:07:21,708 --> 00:07:22,541
Yeah.

104
00:07:23,125 --> 00:07:25,500
-Early start.
-And how was last night?

105
00:07:25,583 --> 00:07:28,458
Good. We worked our ass off, but…

106
00:07:28,541 --> 00:07:30,000
-Good.
-Good boy.

107
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:33,333
-Thanks.
-I know Fārūq did everything, you fool.

108
00:07:34,416 --> 00:07:37,833
Who did you take after?
Your sister never lied to me. Never.

109
00:07:37,916 --> 00:07:40,708
-Are you sure?
-Did she tell you she's feeling down?

110
00:07:40,791 --> 00:07:43,125
That's why I want to go and see her.

111
00:07:43,208 --> 00:07:45,166
Now you worry about your sister.

112
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:47,750
I have to…

113
00:07:48,791 --> 00:07:51,541
-I have to give a demo to a label.
-Who's this?

114
00:07:51,625 --> 00:07:54,291
A label means a record label.

115
00:07:55,041 --> 00:07:59,000
They're not replying to my emails,
so I wanna go there and bring my tracks.

116
00:07:59,083 --> 00:08:02,250
Look how proactive he can be
when it comes to playing

117
00:08:02,333 --> 00:08:03,750
the deejay.

118
00:08:03,833 --> 00:08:05,250
Producer sound designer.

119
00:08:10,458 --> 00:08:12,000
You're opening today.

120
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,291
Tidy up your thoughts, Freddy Mercury.

121
00:08:16,375 --> 00:08:19,000
Freddy Mercury's got
jack shit to do with it.

122
00:08:19,083 --> 00:08:22,875
-You don't even know what music I play.
-Do you call that music?

123
00:08:24,833 --> 00:08:30,083
Oh my goodness, this sucks.
You twist and turn and pull the blankets.

124
00:08:31,666 --> 00:08:33,291
A bed is made for sleeping.

125
00:08:35,708 --> 00:08:39,458
-Not just for sleeping.
-Get off, will you?

126
00:08:40,291 --> 00:08:43,375
If you don't want to treat insomnia,
do whatever you want.

127
00:08:43,875 --> 00:08:47,916
Go out. Go for a walk.
Take the usual walk. As long as you go.

128
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:50,541
So at least one of us will sleep.

129
00:08:51,583 --> 00:08:52,708
God willing.

130
00:09:24,375 --> 00:09:26,250
Have you tried sleeping pills?

131
00:09:26,333 --> 00:09:27,750
That's for bumpkins.

132
00:09:28,416 --> 00:09:30,500
I solve problems without any help.

133
00:09:31,208 --> 00:09:35,375
But if La Zia is still there,
it means you could do with a little help.

134
00:09:35,458 --> 00:09:38,083
A good debt always drives away a bad one.

135
00:09:39,208 --> 00:09:41,041
It's the trap of neoliberalism.

136
00:09:44,041 --> 00:09:46,000
Too much culture is bad for you.

137
00:09:49,541 --> 00:09:50,375
So.

138
00:09:52,041 --> 00:09:53,791
So you know the conditions.

139
00:09:54,750 --> 00:09:59,666
Increased by 10% since this time,
the amount is pretty high.

140
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,541
Do we have to do this?

141
00:10:16,125 --> 00:10:18,666
Don't lean on that. You're a jinx.

142
00:10:22,291 --> 00:10:25,041
Darione! Big news!

143
00:10:25,125 --> 00:10:29,250
We have the 50,000 euros,
but you'll let me defer the rest, right?

144
00:10:30,875 --> 00:10:33,833
Talk soon. See you tomorrow.
I'll drop by tomorrow.

145
00:11:09,166 --> 00:11:11,875
I knew you wouldn't have come
to my funeral.

146
00:11:12,541 --> 00:11:14,000
You are a dissolute son.

147
00:11:15,333 --> 00:11:16,500
Everyone was there.

148
00:11:16,583 --> 00:11:20,916
Even Uncle Cicco from Canicattì
was there, and he's 95! You weren't.

149
00:11:21,625 --> 00:11:22,458
Well done.

150
00:11:23,333 --> 00:11:24,375
Where are we?

151
00:11:24,458 --> 00:11:28,291
It's a hiatus, which separates us
from the living and the dead.

152
00:11:28,375 --> 00:11:31,041
And since when do you use
words such as ""hiatus""

153
00:11:31,125 --> 00:11:34,666
when the most difficult word you used
when alive was sausage?

154
00:11:34,750 --> 00:11:38,041
Help me unload the tractor, or will you
just stand there and look pretty?

155
00:11:41,208 --> 00:11:44,875
Salvo, stop! Thank you.
Pretend I have accepted your help.

156
00:11:44,958 --> 00:11:46,375
Stop it. I'll take care.

157
00:11:48,041 --> 00:11:50,125
You're a useless thing. Useless.

158
00:11:50,958 --> 00:11:52,916
Why don't you give me lotto numbers

159
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:56,166
and save me
from this postmortem lecturing?

160
00:11:56,250 --> 00:11:58,375
Remember one thing. I came in peace,

161
00:11:58,958 --> 00:12:01,666
and you're upsetting me
even now that I'm dead.

162
00:12:02,250 --> 00:12:03,583
Do you know that saying?

163
00:12:03,666 --> 00:12:07,208
""Blessed is the bird
who builds its nest in its own village.""

164
00:12:07,875 --> 00:12:09,208
I leave you with that.

165
00:12:15,583 --> 00:12:18,500
Don't worry.
You've only got a few bruises.

166
00:12:18,583 --> 00:12:21,416
I'll discharge you
as soon as the report's ready.

167
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:25,666
By the way, looking at your scooter,
you've been blessed by a miracle.

168
00:12:25,750 --> 00:12:29,416
-Someone up there must love you.
-Curse me, more than anything.

169
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:32,041
From the hiatus.

170
00:12:35,750 --> 00:12:40,708
You seem to be a little stressed out,
Mr. Macaluso. I suggest you get some rest.

171
00:12:41,833 --> 00:12:43,916
-See you later.
-Thank you, Doctor.

172
00:12:48,458 --> 00:12:49,458
What happened?

173
00:12:54,291 --> 00:12:56,250
-My father has died.
-No!

174
00:12:57,750 --> 00:13:00,041
Honey, I am so sorry,
but when did it happen?

175
00:13:01,583 --> 00:13:05,666
-Help me get down. I want to take a walk.
-Yes, come on. Easy.

176
00:13:06,291 --> 00:13:09,250
Listen. Is there anything that…

177
00:13:09,333 --> 00:13:10,416
Some water?

178
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:13,083
-No, a plum cake.
-You idiot. Hop off.

179
00:13:13,166 --> 00:13:15,875
What a villain.
Instead of giving me lotto numbers,

180
00:13:15,958 --> 00:13:19,375
he told me about
an old Sicilian saying, Verga style.

181
00:13:19,458 --> 00:13:22,333
He who could hardly read a shampoo label.

182
00:13:22,416 --> 00:13:23,500
Which saying?

183
00:13:23,583 --> 00:13:29,125
Like, ""The happy bird makes its nest
in its own village."" Something like that.

184
00:13:30,375 --> 00:13:34,625
Well, it's a very clear sign
that you must go down south.

185
00:13:34,708 --> 00:13:37,916
You wanna be like rednecks
who believe in this crap?

186
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:41,333
Come on. Give me a coin.
I'll get a coffee.

187
00:13:42,125 --> 00:13:44,875
You're his only child.
He deserves a farewell.

188
00:13:44,958 --> 00:13:47,291
Don't be a shithead as usual. Come on.

189
00:13:47,375 --> 00:13:50,291
-How does this work?
-Up. That's for coins. Here.

190
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,708
He said I'm a useless thing.

191
00:13:54,083 --> 00:13:59,375
So, keep calm. Stay cool.
Didn't you hear what the doctor said?

192
00:13:59,458 --> 00:14:01,000
You're stressed out, okay?

193
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:06,208
Why don't you go down south a few days?
Say your last farewell to your dad, rest…

194
00:14:06,291 --> 00:14:11,000
-It'd be good for you. You can relax.
-Don't you dare. I'm not going back there.

195
00:14:11,083 --> 00:14:12,125
And I am not…

196
00:14:12,625 --> 00:14:13,708
I'm not…

197
00:14:14,458 --> 00:14:16,583
I am not stressed out!

198
00:14:17,458 --> 00:14:18,708
What's your problem?!

199
00:14:24,875 --> 00:14:27,708
Dad hasn't been sleeping
since things have gone bad at work.

200
00:14:27,791 --> 00:14:31,750
-So he nags me at night too.
-I told him not to expand his business.

201
00:14:32,875 --> 00:14:35,291
Mom gives in to him all the time. Always.

202
00:14:36,833 --> 00:14:39,583
I can't wait to move out, honestly.

203
00:14:40,833 --> 00:14:44,333
A friend of mine will have
a room available soon.

204
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:48,791
Enzo, it's been three years that
your friend's meant to have a free room.

205
00:14:48,875 --> 00:14:50,166
It's now available.

206
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,666
Anyway, how did it go
with that record label?

207
00:14:56,500 --> 00:14:58,791
-Good.
-Did they listen to your demo?

208
00:14:58,875 --> 00:15:01,291
Yes. They said they'll let me know soon.

209
00:15:14,916 --> 00:15:16,791
Why didn't you give it to them?

210
00:15:17,833 --> 00:15:18,916
I knew it already.

211
00:15:20,250 --> 00:15:22,750
Enzo, why don't you tell me things?
I'm not Dad.

212
00:15:22,833 --> 00:15:24,625
-You can talk to me.
-You're worse.

213
00:15:24,708 --> 00:15:28,000
-He doesn't rummage in my pockets.
-You asked for money for this trip.

214
00:15:28,083 --> 00:15:31,375
And you haven't got the guts
to go and give a fucking envelope?

215
00:15:34,916 --> 00:15:37,791
I come to see you to get a break,
and I get a lecture here too?

216
00:15:37,875 --> 00:15:39,291
You love lectures, Enzo.

217
00:15:40,083 --> 00:15:42,250
You love being the baby of the family.

218
00:15:42,333 --> 00:15:46,333
Otherwise, look, keep staying
in your nice little bedroom,

219
00:15:46,416 --> 00:15:49,625
with the Dragon Ball poster on the wall,
moaning all day long

220
00:15:49,708 --> 00:15:52,625
about wanting to move out,
and nobody will say anything.

221
00:15:54,750 --> 00:15:59,250
I've got an idea. Let's get up,
walk in that coffee shop,

222
00:15:59,333 --> 00:16:02,333
and smoke a big joint,
so you can chill a bit, okay?

223
00:16:02,416 --> 00:16:04,333
-See how you are?
-Seriously, Emma.

224
00:16:04,416 --> 00:16:07,208
I mean it. So you can chill
and stop criticizing.

225
00:16:07,291 --> 00:16:09,750
If I may, it's easy
to criticize from here.

226
00:16:09,833 --> 00:16:12,333
Who's the one home with Dad in Milan? Me.

227
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:13,916
Are you coming?

228
00:16:15,541 --> 00:16:16,750
Whatever. I'm going.

229
00:16:24,541 --> 00:16:27,708
Moro speaking from Via Venezia, 26 red…

230
00:16:34,083 --> 00:16:37,208
POLICE

231
00:16:41,125 --> 00:16:44,000
Okay, copy that.
We're arriving at the police station

232
00:16:44,083 --> 00:16:47,458
with the loan shark from Via Sala Bar.
We're leaving now.

233
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:48,875
Received.

234
00:17:28,458 --> 00:17:31,291
-I bet you're from here.
-You lost the bet. I'm from Milan.

235
00:17:31,375 --> 00:17:32,333
I'm here on business.

236
00:17:32,416 --> 00:17:35,708
-I have a cousin in Milan who owns a bar.
-Could you look ahead, please?

237
00:17:35,791 --> 00:17:40,541
You know, it was a dump. Then he expanded,
and my cousin has made real money.

238
00:17:40,625 --> 00:17:42,333
Look ahead now, please!

239
00:17:43,083 --> 00:17:44,416
What a bad temper.

240
00:18:40,708 --> 00:18:43,416
Lillo! Is that really you?

241
00:18:46,083 --> 00:18:48,750
You've grown a lot.
Have you been eating wild boars?

242
00:18:49,416 --> 00:18:50,833
Come give me a hug.

243
00:18:59,625 --> 00:19:01,500
Rosario called me.

244
00:19:01,583 --> 00:19:03,500
My goodness, what a tragedy.

245
00:19:03,583 --> 00:19:04,958
That was so unexpected.

246
00:19:06,208 --> 00:19:07,375
A real blow.

247
00:19:08,500 --> 00:19:11,875
He mentioned inheritance,
as if I am interested in that.

248
00:19:13,333 --> 00:19:16,166
But how much would we inherit exactly?

249
00:19:19,208 --> 00:19:20,208
How much?

250
00:19:21,625 --> 00:19:22,750
I mean, not that I…

251
00:19:24,416 --> 00:19:25,500
am interested.

252
00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:34,583
Thank you for the warm welcome.

253
00:19:54,333 --> 00:19:58,083
-Where are you running to, Napoli?
-Napoli, come here!

254
00:19:58,166 --> 00:20:00,000
Where are you going? Come here.

255
00:20:01,250 --> 00:20:02,458
Where are you going?

256
00:20:02,541 --> 00:20:05,166
-What do you do now?
-You can't run away now.

257
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,166
Where did you want to go?

258
00:20:09,250 --> 00:20:11,791
-What did you want to do?
-Neapolitan, you can't run now.

259
00:20:11,875 --> 00:20:13,666
I'd spit in your mouth.

260
00:20:28,333 --> 00:20:30,416
-Yes?
-Rosario, it's Salvo.

261
00:20:34,958 --> 00:20:37,041
Mazzacana!

262
00:20:48,458 --> 00:20:49,291
Here it is.

263
00:20:52,541 --> 00:20:56,208
-Why are you touching it?
-You were giving it, and I was taking it.

264
00:20:56,291 --> 00:20:58,958
I mean, clearly,
that's what you were doing.

265
00:20:59,041 --> 00:21:01,458
Are you putting it away? You called me.

266
00:21:02,250 --> 00:21:05,166
I've traveled 2,000 kilometers.
I came from Milan.

267
00:21:05,250 --> 00:21:08,666
-Your brother needs to be here too.
-He's not even talking to me.

268
00:21:08,750 --> 00:21:11,583
I get it, but we can't do it otherwise.

269
00:21:15,875 --> 00:21:17,916
Do you remember when we were kids?

270
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:21,583
Those two waiting for you
outside the school because they wanted

271
00:21:22,291 --> 00:21:23,541
to beat you up?

272
00:21:23,625 --> 00:21:25,791
Just because you were
the smartest in the class.

273
00:21:26,833 --> 00:21:28,333
But I cared about you.

274
00:21:28,416 --> 00:21:33,083
And if you are where you are today,
I'm not saying you owe me a bit.

275
00:21:33,166 --> 00:21:35,041
No, I don't, but...

276
00:21:38,541 --> 00:21:41,333
It won't leave this room. It won't.

277
00:21:48,708 --> 00:21:49,541
So.

278
00:21:50,708 --> 00:21:51,583
""Last will.""

279
00:21:52,916 --> 00:21:58,291
""I, the undersigned, Nunzio Macaluso,
being of sound mind,

280
00:21:58,375 --> 00:22:01,541
appoint my sons, Calogero and Salvatore,

281
00:22:01,625 --> 00:22:04,583
co-heirs of the family home
and its attached plots.""

282
00:22:05,291 --> 00:22:07,375
""Yours sincerely, Nunzio Macaluso.""

283
00:22:07,458 --> 00:22:09,958
Well, I can sell and monetize.

284
00:22:10,041 --> 00:22:14,625
By the way, this reminds me
that the mayor would like to welcome you.

285
00:22:14,708 --> 00:22:16,875
Don't tell me it's still Beppe Randazzo?

286
00:22:16,958 --> 00:22:18,416
No way. It's his son.

287
00:22:18,500 --> 00:22:22,791
Mimmo U' Catarrusu. I used to beat him up
one day yes and the other one too.

288
00:22:30,958 --> 00:22:32,083
See, I ask about you.

289
00:22:32,166 --> 00:22:37,083
I've done my research and was told
that you make the best pizza in Milan.

290
00:22:37,166 --> 00:22:38,625
The best in Lombardy.

291
00:22:41,541 --> 00:22:43,000
Your father, how is he?

292
00:22:43,541 --> 00:22:44,750
He passed away.

293
00:22:44,833 --> 00:22:46,791
-Really? I'm sorry.
-Yes.

294
00:22:47,291 --> 00:22:50,208
Sure, he's with Nunzio.
He cared about your dad.

295
00:22:50,291 --> 00:22:55,125
Because he was the only one who supported
him in that damned business with snails.

296
00:22:55,208 --> 00:22:58,000
Do you remember? The snails business.

297
00:22:58,083 --> 00:22:59,708
You did some bullshit, Dad.

298
00:23:00,916 --> 00:23:02,125
Listen up.

299
00:23:02,875 --> 00:23:05,125
I wanted to meet with you because…

300
00:23:06,583 --> 00:23:09,750
Salvo, let's be clear.
I'm interested in your family house.

301
00:23:09,833 --> 00:23:13,458
-What's wrong with that?
-Nothing wrong. I want to retire there.

302
00:23:13,541 --> 00:23:17,041
And I also want
to make peace with the ecosystem.

303
00:23:17,125 --> 00:23:18,250
Good.

304
00:23:18,333 --> 00:23:22,416
So I thought about an amount,
which I might be embarrassed to say.

305
00:23:23,708 --> 00:23:24,583
Salvo,

306
00:23:24,666 --> 00:23:29,333
considering its abandoned state,
the unbuildable state of the lot,

307
00:23:30,208 --> 00:23:33,583
and the devaluation
of the very old property,

308
00:23:34,375 --> 00:23:35,458
this is my figure.

309
00:23:43,500 --> 00:23:45,291
-Salvuccio.
-It's--

310
00:23:47,250 --> 00:23:48,250
What do you think?

311
00:23:50,875 --> 00:23:53,583
I mean, it sounds good. I don't know…

312
00:23:56,791 --> 00:23:58,666
-Salvo.
-It can be done.

313
00:23:59,833 --> 00:24:03,625
-Tell me where to sign.
-Slow down.

314
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:09,250
There's one little thing. Very little…

315
00:24:09,333 --> 00:24:10,416
What little thing?

316
00:24:10,500 --> 00:24:14,291
Salvuccio, you need to convince
your brother to give up his share too.

317
00:24:14,375 --> 00:24:15,333
A piece of cake.

318
00:24:15,416 --> 00:24:18,833
A piece of cake? When was the last time
you saw your brother?

319
00:24:18,916 --> 00:24:23,083
No. Keep this.
It helps lubricate the gears.

320
00:24:23,750 --> 00:24:26,541
My love. All good. I'll tell you later.

321
00:24:27,458 --> 00:24:31,333
I was right.
I knew I had to come back down south.

322
00:24:31,416 --> 00:24:33,666
-Salvo!
-No. Sure.

323
00:24:33,750 --> 00:24:36,583
-But I called. The line's always busy.
-Salvo.

324
00:24:36,666 --> 00:24:39,291
-Or there's no connection. I don't know…
-Is that you?

325
00:24:39,375 --> 00:24:40,708
Is that you? Sa'!

326
00:24:42,416 --> 00:24:43,458
Salvo, dude!

327
00:24:43,541 --> 00:24:46,375
No, they're not robbing me.
They're old friends.

328
00:24:46,458 --> 00:24:49,791
Honey, I'll call you later
when I have more time.

329
00:24:49,875 --> 00:24:51,375
-Salvo, come on.
-Bye.

330
00:24:51,458 --> 00:24:53,750
The new Aci Fontana Stadium, Salvo,

331
00:24:53,833 --> 00:24:55,750
with 15,000 covered seating.

332
00:24:55,833 --> 00:25:00,041
You won't get 15,000 people
even if you invite the whole province.

333
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:04,125
The president promised
to take us to Serie B in three years.

334
00:25:04,791 --> 00:25:07,375
He's a builder
and lives in Milan, like you.

335
00:25:07,458 --> 00:25:10,583
-Maybe you know him too.
-Of course I do!

336
00:25:10,666 --> 00:25:14,416
Three million people, and I know them all.
What the hell, Castagna?

337
00:25:14,500 --> 00:25:15,916
-Take it easy.
-He's right.

338
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,625
Let's show respect
to the Schillaci of pizza.

339
00:25:18,708 --> 00:25:21,250
He's made some good money up there!

340
00:25:22,541 --> 00:25:25,666
Don Angelo, another round
on the uncle from America!

341
00:25:25,750 --> 00:25:27,666
-You still like her, right?
-Excuse me.

342
00:25:29,125 --> 00:25:31,458
Salvo, where are you going? Salvo!

343
00:25:31,541 --> 00:25:32,875
Pussy is pussy.

344
00:25:48,833 --> 00:25:50,916
-Good morning.
-Good morning.

345
00:26:03,625 --> 00:26:05,500
So, Bettina, what are we doing?

346
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:07,958
My usual. Brazilian waxing.

347
00:26:10,125 --> 00:26:12,333
He doesn't want to go,
then he buys the ticket.

348
00:26:12,416 --> 00:26:14,041
Then he doesn't want to go anymore.

349
00:26:14,125 --> 00:26:16,958
Then he packs last minute
and nearly misses his flight.

350
00:26:17,041 --> 00:26:19,458
Teresa, you don't have to be so paranoid.

351
00:26:19,541 --> 00:26:22,500
If a man wants to cheat on you,
he'll do it anyway.

352
00:26:22,583 --> 00:26:26,291
And if you want to get hurt,
go and rummage in his bedside table.

353
00:26:26,375 --> 00:26:28,750
Yeah. His bedside table.

354
00:26:28,833 --> 00:26:33,250
Yeah, that's ingenious. They put it
under your nose where you'll never look.

355
00:26:33,333 --> 00:26:35,416
And if you find out, they say,

356
00:26:35,500 --> 00:26:39,750
""You think if I wanted to hide something,
I'd put it in the bedside table?""

357
00:26:41,500 --> 00:26:44,083
Breathe in the scent of salt. Breathe in.

358
00:26:44,750 --> 00:26:45,583
Breathe in.

359
00:27:23,083 --> 00:27:23,958
Hey.

360
00:27:24,958 --> 00:27:25,833
Enzo.

361
00:27:33,958 --> 00:27:36,541
-How did it go?
-No one knocks in this house.

362
00:27:36,625 --> 00:27:39,500
-Did you give them your demo?
-Yes. I did.

363
00:27:39,583 --> 00:27:42,333
-Good. You must be happy.
-Yes, I'm happy.

364
00:27:42,416 --> 00:27:47,250
Listen, I was just curious,

365
00:27:48,291 --> 00:27:51,875
if you had to hide something,
where would you put it?

366
00:27:51,958 --> 00:27:54,708
-What do you need to hide?
-Forget about ""what.""

367
00:27:54,791 --> 00:27:58,375
If you have to hide it,
without thinking, where would you put it?

368
00:27:58,458 --> 00:28:00,083
I don't know, Mom,

369
00:28:01,625 --> 00:28:03,541
in the bedside table?

370
00:28:27,250 --> 00:28:29,083
""I'm waiting for you, Carme'.""

371
00:28:37,958 --> 00:28:38,791
""Carme',

372
00:28:39,625 --> 00:28:42,208
with your hand, you messed up my head.""

373
00:28:43,250 --> 00:28:46,583
""You messed up my heart too.""

374
00:28:47,333 --> 00:28:50,541
""My heart burns and steals my thoughts,

375
00:28:51,416 --> 00:28:53,416
then it moves away and goes down…""

376
00:28:53,500 --> 00:28:56,083
I'm gonna kill you, you son of a bitch.

377
00:28:59,250 --> 00:29:01,291
-The number you have di…
-Fuck you.

378
00:29:31,291 --> 00:29:32,208
You're awake?

379
00:29:34,416 --> 00:29:37,416
I thought that you farmers
went to bed with the sun.

380
00:29:41,916 --> 00:29:44,208
You don't talk to me
because you're angry with me?

381
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:48,125
I've invited you to Milan many times,
but you never came.

382
00:29:51,208 --> 00:29:54,166
You're leaving me
in the disused part of the house?

383
00:29:55,500 --> 00:29:59,375
You're taking the bathroom, and if I need
to pee, do I do it in the fireplace?

384
00:30:05,500 --> 00:30:08,208
Why don't we talk about
the mayor's proposal?

385
00:30:10,500 --> 00:30:13,083
Hey, look at this. Look.

386
00:30:14,291 --> 00:30:18,708
Let's lubricate your rusty gears.
Check this out.

387
00:30:26,750 --> 00:30:27,666
Screw this.

388
00:30:30,666 --> 00:30:33,083
See, I managed to make you talk.

389
00:30:39,500 --> 00:30:40,333
Lillo?

390
00:30:41,416 --> 00:30:43,625
Do not enter my part of the house.

391
00:30:46,791 --> 00:30:50,500
I have a pizzeria in Milan
and I am drowning in debt.

392
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:52,875
I need that money.

393
00:30:54,958 --> 00:30:56,750
Do you want me to go broke?

394
00:30:57,708 --> 00:30:59,916
Where were you when Dad went broke?

395
00:31:00,750 --> 00:31:04,333
I was here, among snails
and promissory notes,

396
00:31:04,416 --> 00:31:07,416
while you were enjoying
your nice pizzeria up north!

397
00:31:08,458 --> 00:31:10,958
You didn't even come to the funeral, Cain!

398
00:31:16,791 --> 00:31:18,625
Are you playing the jaw harp?

399
00:31:21,166 --> 00:31:23,125
Can you play me ""Wish You Were Here""?

400
00:32:23,625 --> 00:32:24,833
Salvo.

401
00:32:25,708 --> 00:32:27,041
Do you know who he is?

402
00:32:27,875 --> 00:32:29,291
It's Mazzacana.

403
00:32:29,958 --> 00:32:31,166
Mazzacana!

404
00:32:33,083 --> 00:32:36,458
If he finds out that you stole his shoes,
he'll kill you.

405
00:32:36,541 --> 00:32:37,875
No, he can't find out.

406
00:32:39,041 --> 00:32:42,458
Lillo? Can you see the pizzeria?
They opened it last week.

407
00:32:43,875 --> 00:32:45,666
People come here from Aci Fontana.

408
00:32:46,416 --> 00:32:48,125
They must be making a lot of money.

409
00:32:49,166 --> 00:32:51,500
Look at that. It never ends!

410
00:32:52,791 --> 00:32:54,708
Close your eyes and make a wish.

411
00:32:58,875 --> 00:33:00,958
Can you teach me how to make pizza?

412
00:33:01,666 --> 00:33:02,750
Of course, I will.

413
00:33:04,375 --> 00:33:07,583
Do you think I'd leave you here
slaving with Dad and his snails?

414
00:33:07,666 --> 00:33:10,166
I can't work alone in our pizzeria, can I?

415
00:33:14,833 --> 00:33:18,208
Can you see the damage these snails do?

416
00:33:19,125 --> 00:33:22,083
With those antennas, they move big stones

417
00:33:23,833 --> 00:33:25,625
-Swear.
-I swear.

418
00:33:28,916 --> 00:33:30,250
Do we have to do this?

419
00:33:30,333 --> 00:33:31,666
Give me your hand.

420
00:35:43,083 --> 00:35:44,125
Son of a bitch!

421
00:35:59,500 --> 00:36:02,166
Selling our family's house
is a sacrifice for me too,

422
00:36:02,250 --> 00:36:04,666
but I have to protect my pizzeria.

423
00:36:04,750 --> 00:36:07,708
Actually, you said
we'd open the pizzeria together.

424
00:36:08,666 --> 00:36:09,916
What did you call it?

425
00:36:11,458 --> 00:36:12,416
Sciuri Sciuri.

426
00:36:12,958 --> 00:36:14,041
That's original.

427
00:36:15,708 --> 00:36:18,333
Dad's will is for us to scatter his ashes.

428
00:36:18,416 --> 00:36:20,333
If we don't do it,
the house won't be ours.

429
00:36:20,416 --> 00:36:23,500
Easy. Get them and we'll scatter them.
Plenty of room here.

430
00:36:23,583 --> 00:36:26,458
He said we should do it
with this and with this.

431
00:36:26,958 --> 00:36:30,125
On top of the mountain,
and when the wind is mungibiddisi.

432
00:36:30,208 --> 00:36:32,291
Is he giving orders even when dead?

433
00:36:32,375 --> 00:36:35,458
What does he care
if the wind is or isn't mungibiddisi?

434
00:36:35,541 --> 00:36:37,750
And your family must be present too.

435
00:36:37,833 --> 00:36:39,333
But he's never even met them!

436
00:36:40,166 --> 00:36:41,375
That's what he said.

437
00:36:54,375 --> 00:36:58,583
I have no family anymore, Lillo.
My wife left me, and she took my house.

438
00:36:59,208 --> 00:37:01,708
I swap alimony
with vouchers at the pizzeria.

439
00:37:04,958 --> 00:37:06,625
I basically live and sleep there.

440
00:37:07,666 --> 00:37:08,500
My son

441
00:37:09,083 --> 00:37:11,916
got lost in music and drugs.

442
00:37:13,250 --> 00:37:15,333
Crack, purple, Special K,

443
00:37:16,541 --> 00:37:21,125
CBD, THC, TNT,
and my wife says it's all my fault.

444
00:37:22,708 --> 00:37:25,208
My daughter ran away and she's missing.

445
00:37:25,291 --> 00:37:27,416
-And my wife--
-Says it's your fault.

446
00:37:27,500 --> 00:37:29,166
You haven't changed, Salvo.

447
00:37:29,958 --> 00:37:31,583
Lillo.

448
00:37:37,375 --> 00:37:38,583
Okay. Let's see now.

449
00:37:40,666 --> 00:37:41,875
Did you say ""sell""?

450
00:37:42,458 --> 00:37:43,708
I said ""see.""

451
00:37:49,166 --> 00:37:51,208
How long has it been since you washed?

452
00:37:51,291 --> 00:37:53,583
Since you haven't let me
use your bathroom.

453
00:37:56,666 --> 00:38:00,041
Shall we go and scatter the ashes
on the top of the mountain?

454
00:38:00,125 --> 00:38:02,541
Can't you see the wind isn't mungibiddisi?

455
00:38:02,625 --> 00:38:03,833
-Tomorrow.
-Tomorrow.

456
00:38:07,375 --> 00:38:08,583
I love you, Lillo.

457
00:38:13,125 --> 00:38:13,958
Salvo.

458
00:38:14,666 --> 00:38:16,500
Do you know what Geronimo said?

459
00:38:17,291 --> 00:38:18,666
That you can't give in.

460
00:38:20,666 --> 00:38:21,583
You must fight.

461
00:38:22,375 --> 00:38:24,000
Until you're the last.

462
00:38:30,791 --> 00:38:32,375
Have you ever seen Dad cry?

463
00:38:34,375 --> 00:38:35,708
He doesn't have a heart.

464
00:38:44,541 --> 00:38:45,875
Damn slimesucker.

465
00:38:51,666 --> 00:38:52,500
What's this?

466
00:38:56,208 --> 00:38:57,416
Here's the tree.

467
00:38:57,500 --> 00:39:01,875
We place the tables near the oven,
and in the summer, we install a pergola.

468
00:39:02,791 --> 00:39:03,625
I like it.

469
00:39:05,333 --> 00:39:06,500
But the name sucks.

470
00:39:08,750 --> 00:39:09,583
Il Gelso?

471
00:39:10,791 --> 00:39:12,708
We need something more original.

472
00:39:14,541 --> 00:39:15,375
Sciuri Sciuri.

473
00:39:15,458 --> 00:39:17,083
I don't like Sciuri Sciuri.

474
00:39:17,166 --> 00:39:19,208
Shouldn't the majority decide?

475
00:39:19,291 --> 00:39:20,416
Yeah, the majority.

476
00:39:21,625 --> 00:39:22,750
But I'm the eldest.

477
00:39:35,125 --> 00:39:38,458
-The number you have…
-I don't know why he doesn't pick up.

478
00:39:38,541 --> 00:39:42,041
Ma'am, even if he answers,
I'll have to put the locks on.

479
00:39:42,125 --> 00:39:45,125
-The pizzeria is going on auction--
-What auction?

480
00:39:45,208 --> 00:39:48,291
-You never gave us a warning.
-Not even the army can drag me out!

481
00:39:48,375 --> 00:39:51,333
Come on, guys. Don't you start too.

482
00:39:51,416 --> 00:39:55,083
Be good, guys.
Now open the locks and we'll go. Okay?

483
00:39:55,166 --> 00:39:56,000
Come on.

484
00:39:56,625 --> 00:39:57,875
-What?
-The key.

485
00:39:59,958 --> 00:40:01,875
-The key--
-I ate it.

486
00:40:11,041 --> 00:40:13,166
-We're done.
-Ma'am, have a good day.

487
00:40:13,250 --> 00:40:14,833
-Goodbye.
-Goodbye.

488
00:40:22,666 --> 00:40:23,500
Mom.

489
00:40:25,166 --> 00:40:26,833
What's happening?

490
00:40:26,916 --> 00:40:29,541
Sweetheart, what are you doing here?

491
00:40:30,333 --> 00:40:33,791
Are you sure all the money
from the auction goes to the bank?

492
00:40:33,875 --> 00:40:39,541
Yes. Anyway, we couldn't buy it back.
I mean, we're not allowed at the auction.

493
00:40:40,625 --> 00:40:41,458
Good.

494
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:10,250
Get rid of that stupid face.
Who are you, and mainly, what do you want?

495
00:41:11,583 --> 00:41:15,166
Nice to meet you. I'm Alfonsino,
but everybody calls me Fofò.

496
00:41:17,875 --> 00:41:19,833
You're a master to me.

497
00:41:19,916 --> 00:41:23,500
I made a cover of your song
and launched it on the Internet.

498
00:41:23,583 --> 00:41:27,416
-I wanted you to hear it.
-What makes you think I'm interested?

499
00:41:28,708 --> 00:41:30,916
Come on. Piss off.

500
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:32,375
Redneck, go back home.

501
00:41:33,500 --> 00:41:34,333
Wait.

502
00:41:36,250 --> 00:41:37,333
I'll listen to it.

503
00:41:38,166 --> 00:41:40,041
Only if you let me make a phone call.

504
00:41:41,208 --> 00:41:42,041
Swear.

505
00:41:43,333 --> 00:41:44,166
I swear.

506
00:42:07,541 --> 00:42:11,291
I'M WAITING FOR YOU, CARME'

507
00:42:11,375 --> 00:42:13,916
I miss you tonight…

508
00:42:15,750 --> 00:42:17,583
So? What do you think?

509
00:42:18,541 --> 00:42:22,458
That you gotta get your ass kicked a lot
before you can do something good.

510
00:42:22,541 --> 00:42:25,291
-Too bad that I have almost 5,000 views.
-What?

511
00:42:25,375 --> 00:42:28,833
-5,000 views.
-I mean…

512
00:42:28,916 --> 00:42:33,125
You're trying to find long-term success
off of someone else's career?

513
00:42:33,208 --> 00:42:36,416
What are you talking about?
I only made this song.

514
00:42:36,916 --> 00:42:38,416
Wind is mungibiddisi.

515
00:42:39,125 --> 00:42:40,708
-Good.
-We can go.

516
00:42:40,791 --> 00:42:42,666
I'll get the stick and we'll go.

517
00:42:42,750 --> 00:42:45,791
Fofò. Get lost. We gotta do
something important.

518
00:42:53,750 --> 00:42:55,166
What are you doing here?

519
00:42:55,791 --> 00:42:56,625
Emma.

520
00:42:57,166 --> 00:43:00,916
-You're here too? Why?
-Thanks to you, they kicked me out, Dad.

521
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:03,583
What's it got to do with me?
I'll call the bank

522
00:43:03,666 --> 00:43:05,916
and they'll remember
my sermon till Christmas…

523
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:11,375
Pray to God you have a valid reason
why this fucking phone is always off.

524
00:43:11,458 --> 00:43:14,708
Did you want to leave me in the shit?
Do you know they seized Il Gelso?

525
00:43:14,791 --> 00:43:15,625
Jackass!

526
00:43:17,791 --> 00:43:22,333
-What do you think you'll do now?
-Teresa, can't you let me explain? I mean…

527
00:43:23,583 --> 00:43:27,333
It's the trap of neoliberalism.
It's a thing…

528
00:43:27,416 --> 00:43:29,125
While we're at it!

529
00:43:29,208 --> 00:43:31,208
Please, tell me who this whore is?

530
00:43:31,291 --> 00:43:33,625
Hey, watch your tongue. That's my mom.

531
00:43:33,708 --> 00:43:36,791
-Carmela is your mom?
-You have an illegitimate son too?

532
00:43:36,875 --> 00:43:38,333
-No.
-And didn't say anything?

533
00:43:39,375 --> 00:43:40,458
What the-- Ouch!

534
00:43:40,541 --> 00:43:43,041
-Are you crazy?
-You hid it in the bedside table!

535
00:43:43,125 --> 00:43:45,750
I'll kill you.
I'll take your life away. I swear to God!

536
00:43:45,833 --> 00:43:49,875
Bloody hell, Teresa. It's just a song!
There's nothing wrong with it!

537
00:43:49,958 --> 00:43:52,208
I wouldn't hide
it in the bedside table otherwise!

538
00:43:52,291 --> 00:43:55,250
I knew you'd say that, coward!

539
00:43:55,333 --> 00:43:56,208
Enzo.

540
00:43:57,166 --> 00:44:00,083
Talk some sense into your mother.
Please, help me.

541
00:44:05,250 --> 00:44:07,666
You used to sing Sceneggiate Napoletane,

542
00:44:08,250 --> 00:44:10,875
with that hairdo,
and you criticize my music?

543
00:44:11,833 --> 00:44:13,625
Tidy up your thoughts.

544
00:44:14,125 --> 00:44:16,666
Guys, let's go find a hotel.
Enough. Let's go.

545
00:44:17,416 --> 00:44:22,000
Salvo. You found your missing daughter,
and you didn't tell me?

546
00:44:22,083 --> 00:44:24,208
It's wonderful. We should celebrate.

547
00:44:26,291 --> 00:44:27,791
And who's this young man?

548
00:44:28,750 --> 00:44:29,833
Your son,

549
00:44:30,541 --> 00:44:33,750
the drug addict, DBC, THC, SPA…

550
00:44:33,833 --> 00:44:35,291
The lady, of course…

551
00:44:36,875 --> 00:44:40,833
She's your wife, isn't she?
The one who divorced you

552
00:44:41,458 --> 00:44:42,625
and left you broke.

553
00:44:43,416 --> 00:44:46,208
Excuse the interference. I'm Lillo.

554
00:44:47,125 --> 00:44:48,083
Salvo's brother.

555
00:44:48,916 --> 00:44:51,833
-His…
-Your brother, Dad?

556
00:44:51,916 --> 00:44:53,416
You have a brother?

557
00:44:54,125 --> 00:44:57,250
Yes, but he didn't tell you
because I don't exist for him.

558
00:45:00,583 --> 00:45:03,625
Hi, pleased to meet you.
I'm Teresa, Salvo's ex-wife.

559
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:17,000
Hi Lillo. Have you seen Fofò?
I don't know where to look anymore.

560
00:45:17,083 --> 00:45:20,625
Yes, he's here.
Look who came to see me, Salvo's family.

561
00:45:20,708 --> 00:45:23,041
-Salvo.
-She's Teresa, my sister-in-law.

562
00:45:23,625 --> 00:45:25,166
Nice to meet you. Carmela.

563
00:45:25,666 --> 00:45:27,833
Salvo. My God, it's been ages!

564
00:45:28,916 --> 00:45:29,875
Hello.

565
00:45:30,875 --> 00:45:33,833
-I'm sorry about your dad.
-These things happen.

566
00:45:33,916 --> 00:45:39,291
Carmela is a nice person.
She raised her son alone in Naples.

567
00:45:39,375 --> 00:45:42,125
-Nice to meet you. Carmela.
-Fofò's father was an asshole.

568
00:45:42,208 --> 00:45:44,000
He abandoned her when she was…

569
00:45:45,875 --> 00:45:49,833
-And she came back here about a year ago.
-Okay.

570
00:45:49,916 --> 00:45:52,791
Let's go home to do your homework
or I'll break your neck.

571
00:45:52,875 --> 00:45:54,708
-Mom, let's stay here.
-Why?

572
00:45:54,791 --> 00:45:59,083
I promised Enzo I'll show him
the video clip of Salvo's original song.

573
00:45:59,166 --> 00:46:01,000
-That video clip…
-Still around.

574
00:46:01,083 --> 00:46:02,791
I'd be glad if you stayed.

575
00:46:02,875 --> 00:46:05,208
Yeah, so you can tell us some things.

576
00:46:05,291 --> 00:46:06,916
Dad told us nothing about you.

577
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:09,750
-He didn't even tell us he had a brother.
-You didn't?

578
00:46:09,833 --> 00:46:11,875
-No.
-Maybe he wanted to surprise us.

579
00:46:11,958 --> 00:46:15,500
I don't like talking about myself.
I'm not that self-centered.

580
00:46:17,250 --> 00:46:18,083
Okay, then.

581
00:46:19,083 --> 00:46:21,500
Stay here, everyone. Refresh yourselves.

582
00:46:21,583 --> 00:46:24,416
-We'll eat something. No hotels, Teresa.
-Thanks.

583
00:46:24,500 --> 00:46:28,166
-There's room for everyone in this house.
-Thank you so much.

584
00:46:28,250 --> 00:46:30,375
-I'll deal with you later.
-The luggage.

585
00:46:30,458 --> 00:46:32,916
-You can leave it. No thieves here.
-Okay.

586
00:46:33,583 --> 00:46:37,000
When I said everyone,
I meant everyone but you.

587
00:46:37,083 --> 00:46:38,916
Stay in your part of the house.

588
00:46:40,416 --> 00:46:44,625
Dad, if there are any leftovers,
I'll make you a doggy bag.

589
00:46:47,916 --> 00:46:50,500
Be my guests.
Stay all squeezed like sardines

590
00:46:51,083 --> 00:46:54,041
while I enjoy my entire space for myself.

591
00:46:56,250 --> 00:46:58,166
In harmony with nature.

592
00:46:58,833 --> 00:47:01,375
What the fuck do you want? Hey!

593
00:47:12,208 --> 00:47:13,125
No way.

594
00:47:19,125 --> 00:47:20,125
Oh my God.

595
00:47:24,291 --> 00:47:27,875
I miss you tonight…

596
00:47:27,958 --> 00:47:30,208
He's really into it. Marvelous.

597
00:47:30,291 --> 00:47:31,916
See how good he is?

598
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:33,541
This can't be real.

599
00:47:35,375 --> 00:47:37,875
-Anyway, the song is nice.
-Yes, it's nice.

600
00:47:37,958 --> 00:47:40,666
-Not exactly joyful, let's say.
-There she is.

601
00:47:40,750 --> 00:47:43,833
-You were beautiful.
-Thanks. I had long hair…

602
00:47:43,916 --> 00:47:45,708
Your brother is shocked. Look.

603
00:47:47,041 --> 00:47:50,375
-And I lay awake…
-I feel emotional.

604
00:47:50,916 --> 00:47:53,750
-Here comes the instrumental bit.
-Thank God.

605
00:47:53,833 --> 00:47:56,500
A bit of a break from your dad singing.

606
00:47:58,416 --> 00:48:00,416
I miss you

607
00:48:00,500 --> 00:48:02,875
Carmela--
You need to show pain. That's not enough.

608
00:48:02,958 --> 00:48:07,166
I miss you, Carmela, tonight

609
00:48:09,708 --> 00:48:10,958
What an awful thing.

610
00:48:11,041 --> 00:48:13,625
I miss you tonight

611
00:48:14,875 --> 00:48:18,333
You, Christmas Star

612
00:48:18,416 --> 00:48:23,750
And I lay awake, Carmela

613
00:48:25,958 --> 00:48:29,833
But for you, I'm a betrayal

614
00:48:29,916 --> 00:48:33,625
An enemy during war

615
00:48:33,708 --> 00:48:37,041
I'm a door that you lock

616
00:48:39,500 --> 00:48:40,833
Carmela

617
00:48:43,208 --> 00:48:48,000
When he heard that I was in Naples,
he moved there, using pizza as an excuse.

618
00:48:48,083 --> 00:48:50,791
And he insisted on making this video.

619
00:48:50,875 --> 00:48:53,666
I didn't mind the song, so I said yes.

620
00:48:54,916 --> 00:48:58,708
I don't know, maybe because of this,
he deluded himself a bit.

621
00:48:58,791 --> 00:49:02,708
Let's say it was a kind
of unrequited love.

622
00:49:03,958 --> 00:49:05,958
But then this song was a flop.

623
00:49:06,041 --> 00:49:08,041
-Really?
-Strange, really.

624
00:49:08,750 --> 00:49:12,375
So then, he went to Milan,
and I never saw him again.

625
00:49:13,250 --> 00:49:15,750
Alfonsino's been listening to it
since he was little.

626
00:49:15,833 --> 00:49:17,166
Sweetheart, I'm sorry.

627
00:49:17,250 --> 00:49:20,250
When I was younger,
I thought Salvo was my dad.

628
00:49:20,333 --> 00:49:22,291
Consider yourself lucky he isn't.

629
00:49:22,375 --> 00:49:28,708
You died without any bell ringing

630
00:49:28,791 --> 00:49:32,833
And trallaleru lalleru lalleru lalleru

631
00:49:32,916 --> 00:49:35,750
Lalleru lalleru lallà

632
00:49:46,958 --> 00:49:49,208
-Two more beers, Don Angelo.
-Yes.

633
00:49:53,791 --> 00:49:54,625
Thanks.

634
00:49:58,250 --> 00:50:01,916
Your father was a good man.
Then he was caught by the evil eye.

635
00:50:03,458 --> 00:50:06,375
And his path crossed
with some really mean people.

636
00:50:06,458 --> 00:50:08,500
Who are these very mean people?

637
00:50:08,583 --> 00:50:10,000
Ask your brother.

638
00:50:11,750 --> 00:50:12,583
I also know

639
00:50:13,333 --> 00:50:15,125
that he once went to Milan,

640
00:50:15,208 --> 00:50:18,625
but he didn't have the guts
to go to your pizzeria.

641
00:50:26,916 --> 00:50:27,833
Salvo.

642
00:50:27,916 --> 00:50:32,750
Lallaleru lalleru lalleru
Lalleru lalleru lallà!

643
00:50:32,833 --> 00:50:34,041
""Carme',

644
00:50:34,125 --> 00:50:36,708
with your hand, you messed up my head,

645
00:50:37,291 --> 00:50:39,958
which burns and steals my thoughts.""

646
00:50:40,041 --> 00:50:42,125
""Then it moves away and goes down.""

647
00:50:42,208 --> 00:50:45,000
""It doesn't know
whether to beat or sing anymore.""

648
00:50:45,083 --> 00:50:47,083
""I have no voice now, Carme'.""

649
00:50:47,625 --> 00:50:51,083
""All I have left of you
is the spring, a big breath,

650
00:50:51,166 --> 00:50:52,583
a jump from the sky.""

651
00:50:54,208 --> 00:50:55,625
-It's awful.
-Beautiful.

652
00:51:36,083 --> 00:51:38,125
It'll be hell divorcing at my age.

653
00:51:38,208 --> 00:51:40,875
Dad, why didn't you tell her
you were risking seizure?

654
00:51:43,125 --> 00:51:45,750
I tried,
but she always has something to do.

655
00:51:53,083 --> 00:51:55,583
-Sugar?
-No. Bitter like life.

656
00:51:56,958 --> 00:51:59,625
To me, you're a betrayal

657
00:52:00,291 --> 00:52:02,625
An enemy during…

658
00:52:06,333 --> 00:52:07,166
Night.

659
00:52:08,083 --> 00:52:11,666
You're a door opening

660
00:52:12,541 --> 00:52:13,875
Carmela

661
00:52:16,083 --> 00:52:16,916
Finished.

662
00:52:17,750 --> 00:52:18,666
That's enough.

663
00:52:20,166 --> 00:52:25,416
So, I'll explain it once more. I write
to the bank and ask for new installments.

664
00:52:25,500 --> 00:52:29,250
While Dad calls Dario
and pledges to give 50,000 in arrears,

665
00:52:29,333 --> 00:52:33,583
mortgaging our house in Milan.
This is the only way to stop the auction.

666
00:52:33,666 --> 00:52:35,458
No, honey, you can forget about it.

667
00:52:35,541 --> 00:52:38,500
Half of the house's mine.
Without my signature, he can do nothing.

668
00:52:38,583 --> 00:52:41,208
Calm down. There are always two options.

669
00:52:41,291 --> 00:52:43,333
-One is this.
-And the other one?

670
00:52:43,416 --> 00:52:45,666
I inherited half of the family house.

671
00:52:45,750 --> 00:52:49,791
The mayor fell in love with this place
and wants to retire here.

672
00:52:49,875 --> 00:52:53,958
I worked hard on him,
and I got a huge figure.

673
00:52:54,041 --> 00:52:56,208
I almost convinced Lillo to sell.

674
00:52:57,000 --> 00:53:00,125
But then you arrived,
and everything has gone to hell.

675
00:53:00,208 --> 00:53:03,125
-You nearly convinced him?
-I opened up his heart.

676
00:53:03,208 --> 00:53:05,250
You go and talk to that grumpy man.

677
00:53:06,041 --> 00:53:08,625
Shall we take a step at a time? Shall we?

678
00:53:08,708 --> 00:53:11,625
The mayor has given me till San Procopio.

679
00:53:11,708 --> 00:53:13,958
Little step? We need an elephant step.

680
00:53:14,041 --> 00:53:18,250
Exactly. Thus, you have to apologize.

681
00:53:18,333 --> 00:53:19,458
What for?

682
00:53:19,958 --> 00:53:22,833
For crossing him out,
stealing his name for the pizzeria

683
00:53:22,916 --> 00:53:25,541
and the idea of the pizzeria.
Shall I go on?

684
00:53:25,625 --> 00:53:29,625
I refuse to regress to adolescence
because my brother's stuck there

685
00:53:29,708 --> 00:53:31,500
and my wife dropped to his level.

686
00:53:32,166 --> 00:53:34,500
Look, you know what? Do as you please.

687
00:53:37,125 --> 00:53:40,166
-You're leaving already?
-We made some progress since this morning.

688
00:53:40,250 --> 00:53:42,916
Five minutes ago we were about to divorce.

689
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:46,125
You didn't even teach
that poor man how to make pizza.

690
00:53:46,208 --> 00:53:48,916
Did he tell you
all my fucking business in just one night?

691
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:51,625
Come on, Dad. It's easy. Repeat after me,

692
00:53:51,708 --> 00:53:54,291
""I wanted to say I'm sorry.""

693
00:53:55,875 --> 00:53:56,708
Listen, Lillo.

694
00:53:57,208 --> 00:53:59,583
I wanted to say… You know that

695
00:53:59,666 --> 00:54:03,000
with the money from the house,
you could reopen the pizzeria?

696
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:09,916
Go on. Roll the dough.

697
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:12,625
You want to teach me
how to make pizza now after 40 years?

698
00:54:12,708 --> 00:54:14,500
Jeez, you're so fussy!

699
00:54:14,583 --> 00:54:15,750
Come on. Come here.

700
00:54:17,541 --> 00:54:18,416
Do what I do.

701
00:54:19,458 --> 00:54:22,166
Widen the dough, thoroughly, okay?

702
00:54:22,958 --> 00:54:24,541
Then with your fingertips…

703
00:54:25,125 --> 00:54:28,000
Loosen up, soft on your legs. That's it.

704
00:54:28,916 --> 00:54:30,458
See, you're good at it.

705
00:54:32,541 --> 00:54:34,208
You're a born pizza maker.

706
00:54:36,500 --> 00:54:38,250
I'll give you the franchise.

707
00:54:38,333 --> 00:54:39,958
Il Gelso 2.

708
00:54:40,458 --> 00:54:43,958
It would be like realizing
our old project from afar.

709
00:54:44,541 --> 00:54:48,916
-From 1,500 kilometers?
-Jeez! You're still so fussy.

710
00:54:49,833 --> 00:54:53,041
All right, you are Il Gelso,
and I'll be Il Gelso 2.

711
00:54:54,291 --> 00:54:55,666
Lay the tomato.

712
00:54:55,750 --> 00:54:59,000
Add a bit of basil,
a handful of mozzarella,

713
00:54:59,541 --> 00:55:03,000
then you add a bit of olive oil,
if you like. Now you try.

714
00:55:04,625 --> 00:55:06,708
Now take a handful of mozzarella.

715
00:55:07,333 --> 00:55:11,166
-Put it on, that's too much, but…
-I'll put it on the edges.

716
00:55:11,666 --> 00:55:14,208
-You'll eat this one.
-What's wrong with it?

717
00:55:14,291 --> 00:55:17,125
Take the peel. Wait. It's not--

718
00:55:17,208 --> 00:55:19,250
Come closer. Well done.

719
00:55:20,208 --> 00:55:23,541
Perfect. Let's make a calzone with this,
which is better.

720
00:55:23,625 --> 00:55:27,083
Let's make a calzone.
This is yours. Put it in the oven.

721
00:55:27,166 --> 00:55:31,833
I had a look, and there are only
a few competitors in such a wide area.

722
00:55:31,916 --> 00:55:33,333
-Who?
-""Competitor.""

723
00:55:33,416 --> 00:55:36,708
She got a master's degree in economics
and now she speaks like this.

724
00:55:36,791 --> 00:55:39,791
-I mean, there isn't a pizzeria nearby?
-Tell me about it.

725
00:55:39,875 --> 00:55:44,375
To eat a pizza with Fofò,
I end up spending more on gas.

726
00:55:44,458 --> 00:55:47,750
Because there are no competitors.

727
00:55:47,833 --> 00:55:50,750
And as a business administrator,
you know about this…

728
00:55:52,291 --> 00:55:53,333
Who wants a beer?

729
00:55:55,875 --> 00:55:57,708
Wait. Give it one more minute.

730
00:55:59,291 --> 00:56:03,250
Mozzarella took off its clothes

731
00:56:03,333 --> 00:56:06,625
And a hug melts into your chest

732
00:56:06,708 --> 00:56:10,666
And you forget all your suffering!

733
00:56:12,583 --> 00:56:13,875
Lillo helped me too.

734
00:56:13,958 --> 00:56:15,958
A round of applause for Lillo.

735
00:56:17,958 --> 00:56:20,000
Wow, Uncle.

736
00:56:20,083 --> 00:56:22,000
Some guys have all the luck.

737
00:56:22,083 --> 00:56:23,666
A little trim maybe…

738
00:56:26,291 --> 00:56:27,791
I'd like to make a toast.

739
00:56:29,666 --> 00:56:30,791
I drink to you,

740
00:56:31,375 --> 00:56:32,583
long-lost brother,

741
00:56:33,375 --> 00:56:36,166
in the hope of becoming business partners

742
00:56:36,250 --> 00:56:37,125
at a distance.

743
00:56:37,791 --> 00:56:41,625
-He made a rhyme.
-Of course. Without it, it's not a toast.

744
00:56:41,708 --> 00:56:42,791
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

745
00:56:42,875 --> 00:56:44,666
-Cheers, sweetheart.
-Cheers.

746
00:56:50,750 --> 00:56:51,958
To this family.

747
00:56:52,541 --> 00:56:53,875
To this family.

748
00:56:58,000 --> 00:56:58,833
So,

749
00:57:00,041 --> 00:57:02,000
tomorrow, we fulfill

750
00:57:03,458 --> 00:57:04,625
our old man's will

751
00:57:05,375 --> 00:57:06,750
on the top of the hill,

752
00:57:07,291 --> 00:57:09,375
all together, okay?

753
00:57:10,916 --> 00:57:11,791
All together.

754
00:57:13,041 --> 00:57:15,916
-Enjoy your meal, or it'll get cold.
-Enjoy your meal.

755
00:57:25,375 --> 00:57:27,000
Damn. Where is he?

756
00:57:27,541 --> 00:57:29,375
This farce will never end.

757
00:57:29,458 --> 00:57:31,375
-Did you apologize to him?
-Sure.

758
00:57:32,666 --> 00:57:35,500
I mean, I didn't use those exact words.

759
00:57:35,583 --> 00:57:38,708
-But it was implied.
-Because you are still shitty like always.

760
00:57:38,791 --> 00:57:40,958
Oh well. That's an improvement.

761
00:57:41,041 --> 00:57:43,041
From shithead to shitty.

762
00:57:43,125 --> 00:57:45,666
-Now it's my fault, is it?
-It's not mine.

763
00:57:48,916 --> 00:57:51,833
Grandpa, this is Enzo.
Enzo, this is Grandpa.

764
00:57:51,916 --> 00:57:53,041
Here. Do something.

765
00:57:56,458 --> 00:57:57,291
Lillo!

766
00:57:58,208 --> 00:58:00,333
Lillo. We're waiting for you.

767
00:58:12,791 --> 00:58:14,958
Impressive how much our uncle reads.

768
00:58:15,875 --> 00:58:18,291
I've always said too much culture is bad.

769
00:58:20,083 --> 00:58:22,916
Maybe he's there already?
He always gets up at dawn.

770
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:25,208
Blessed is he who sleeps. Let's go.

771
00:58:28,333 --> 00:58:31,208
I miss you tonight

772
00:58:31,291 --> 00:58:33,250
Indiana Jones, are you sure?

773
00:58:33,333 --> 00:58:35,625
You asking me every two minutes isn't fun!

774
00:58:35,708 --> 00:58:37,166
Are you sure?

775
00:58:38,916 --> 00:58:40,500
My dear, I grew up here.

776
00:58:54,916 --> 00:58:55,750
This way.

777
00:58:56,250 --> 00:58:57,750
Okay. If he grew up here…

778
00:58:58,583 --> 00:59:02,125
I didn't think it was so urgent.
You should have explained it better.

779
00:59:02,208 --> 00:59:06,375
-If you hide things from me…
-I remind you, you hid your brother.

780
00:59:06,458 --> 00:59:09,333
You didn't ask me
if I had a brother, did you?

781
00:59:09,416 --> 00:59:12,083
Did you ask me
if I quit my master's studies?

782
00:59:12,166 --> 00:59:13,750
-No, I didn't.
-Exactly.

783
00:59:14,791 --> 00:59:17,750
-What the fuck did you do?
-Why do you act like this?

784
00:59:17,833 --> 00:59:22,166
You intimidate me. I was opening up
with you. I won't talk to you anymore.

785
00:59:22,250 --> 00:59:23,166
Is there more?

786
00:59:24,875 --> 00:59:27,041
It's a boar. I know it's a boar!

787
00:59:31,125 --> 00:59:34,291
But it's Lillo.
Lillo, where are you going? It's us.

788
00:59:35,916 --> 00:59:38,291
Thank God the head
of the family's protecting us.

789
00:59:38,375 --> 00:59:40,791
I was watching your back.

790
00:59:41,375 --> 00:59:42,958
Let's follow him. Come on.

791
00:59:43,833 --> 00:59:47,458
He's playing cowboys
and Indians, silly man. Lillo!

792
00:59:48,791 --> 00:59:49,875
Lillo!

793
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:53,541
Little brother, I saw you.

794
00:59:54,375 --> 00:59:57,666
Come out.
I know that you want me to sweat for it.

795
00:59:58,375 --> 01:00:02,916
That's fine, but a prank isn't funny
if it goes on for too long.

796
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:16,208
I didn't forget. You stole my shoes.

797
01:00:18,083 --> 01:00:18,958
Mazzacana.

798
01:00:19,916 --> 01:00:22,041
Have you been barefoot for 40 years?

799
01:00:44,458 --> 01:00:46,208
-Good afternoon.
-Hello.

800
01:00:53,791 --> 01:00:57,833
-Did you really steal his shoes?
-He's confusing me with your uncle.

801
01:00:58,875 --> 01:01:01,208
How will you manage without shoes now?

802
01:01:01,291 --> 01:01:04,750
He managed for 40 years.
I will make it for 40 minutes.

803
01:01:06,416 --> 01:01:07,250
See?

804
01:01:14,416 --> 01:01:15,250
Lillo?

805
01:01:18,791 --> 01:01:21,541
-I miss you, Uncle Lillo
-Uncle?

806
01:01:21,625 --> 01:01:22,541
Lillo?

807
01:01:51,166 --> 01:01:52,041
See?

808
01:01:52,791 --> 01:01:54,166
I added a stage too.

809
01:01:55,875 --> 01:01:58,375
So you can sing Neapolitan songs,
how you like it.

810
01:01:58,458 --> 01:02:03,458
Good idea. And we could also host
Communions, confirmations, weddings…

811
01:02:04,333 --> 01:02:07,375
And give me this poison

812
01:02:07,916 --> 01:02:11,333
Don't wait until tomorrow

813
01:02:11,416 --> 01:02:14,375
Regardless

814
01:02:15,500 --> 01:02:20,083
Whether you kill me or not
I won't tell you anything

815
01:02:20,666 --> 01:02:22,583
Wow! This pizza is delicious!

816
01:02:22,666 --> 01:02:24,666
Can I order one more?

817
01:02:24,750 --> 01:02:27,250
I'll give you a nice ""pizza"" in your face.

818
01:02:28,458 --> 01:02:29,708
How is this then?

819
01:02:30,750 --> 01:02:34,500
I work hard, spitting blood,
and you're here dicking around?

820
01:02:36,916 --> 01:02:38,125
What's this?

821
01:02:42,958 --> 01:02:43,875
Pizzeria

822
01:02:44,541 --> 01:02:45,625
Il Gelso.

823
01:02:49,541 --> 01:02:51,541
Whose idea is this? Yours?

824
01:02:55,375 --> 01:02:58,958
You just say it to protect your brother,
aka ""useless thing.""

825
01:02:59,833 --> 01:03:02,666
Salvo, I tell you something,
and write it here.

826
01:03:03,208 --> 01:03:04,583
""He who lives upon hope

827
01:03:06,041 --> 01:03:07,375
will die fasting.""

828
01:03:08,041 --> 01:03:10,625
Tonight you'll suck snails' slime.

829
01:03:10,708 --> 01:03:11,666
And with this…

830
01:03:13,791 --> 01:03:14,625
With this,

831
01:03:15,375 --> 01:03:17,500
you can wipe your ass!

832
01:03:18,875 --> 01:03:19,916
The engineer.

833
01:03:20,500 --> 01:03:23,083
We have an engineer at home, an architect,

834
01:03:23,166 --> 01:03:25,000
a singer. ""And give me this poison.""

835
01:03:25,833 --> 01:03:27,166
He wants to do everything!

836
01:03:29,708 --> 01:03:30,583
Get to work!

837
01:03:40,541 --> 01:03:42,208
What's that, a treasure map?

838
01:03:49,000 --> 01:03:49,916
Hey, Dad.

839
01:03:50,583 --> 01:03:51,916
Don't blame yourself.

840
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:57,500
Some years ago,
I also wrote on the wall in the cellar,

841
01:03:58,625 --> 01:04:00,083
""Salvo, shit pizza.""

842
01:04:22,458 --> 01:04:25,708
Little brother,
see how I fulfill our old man's wishes!

843
01:04:27,250 --> 01:04:31,291
Now, slimesucker, you're free to nag
all the microfauna you'll meet.

844
01:04:52,791 --> 01:04:56,000
I knew I shouldn't have come back
to this shitty place.

845
01:05:01,791 --> 01:05:03,750
When was the last time you slept?

846
01:05:05,916 --> 01:05:09,166
A whole life criticizing your dad,
then you do the same things.

847
01:05:09,250 --> 01:05:11,291
Proud, touchy.

848
01:05:12,041 --> 01:05:14,166
Constantly dwelling on the past.

849
01:05:14,250 --> 01:05:16,416
-You know what my mom used to say?
-What?

850
01:05:16,500 --> 01:05:20,500
""If you walk looking back,
you'll bang your head.""

851
01:05:20,583 --> 01:05:22,250
Luckily, I listened to her.

852
01:05:22,333 --> 01:05:27,041
Or else I'd still be in Naples
getting abused by Fofò's father.

853
01:05:27,125 --> 01:05:30,416
I'm glad you listened to her,
or you wouldn't be here.

854
01:05:31,208 --> 01:05:33,250
Then you should listen to her too.

855
01:05:35,208 --> 01:05:37,583
That's why I decided to go ""all in.""

856
01:05:37,666 --> 01:05:38,500
""All in""?

857
01:05:39,458 --> 01:05:41,375
What's that, like ""coming out""?

858
01:05:41,458 --> 01:05:44,041
-Jeez, I didn't know.
-What are you talking about?

859
01:05:44,125 --> 01:05:47,041
-That's why you get waxed. You're gay!
-What are you saying?

860
01:05:47,125 --> 01:05:48,166
What nice news.

861
01:05:48,250 --> 01:05:51,458
Cut it out, Carmela.
""All in"" is a poker thing,

862
01:05:51,541 --> 01:05:53,333
when you risk all you have.

863
01:05:53,416 --> 01:05:57,208
If you lose, you're screwed,
but if you win, you really win.

864
01:05:58,125 --> 01:06:00,208
If I don't do it now,
I won't ever be able to.

865
01:06:00,291 --> 01:06:02,041
Well done, Lillo. Thank God.

866
01:06:02,125 --> 01:06:05,500
Once in a while, a bit of bravery
in life is good for you.

867
01:06:06,375 --> 01:06:07,541
What are those?

868
01:06:08,125 --> 01:06:11,583
Who knows. Since I've been back,
nearly every morning,

869
01:06:11,666 --> 01:06:13,333
I find one outside the door.

870
01:06:14,125 --> 01:06:16,166
-Why don't you open them?
-No.

871
01:06:16,250 --> 01:06:19,708
I'll open them when whoever leaves them
has the guts to show himself.

872
01:06:21,416 --> 01:06:22,333
Come on.

873
01:06:22,416 --> 01:06:24,250
On the count of three. One,

874
01:06:24,916 --> 01:06:25,750
two!

875
01:06:27,875 --> 01:06:30,375
-Didn't you say three?
-I forgot.

876
01:06:30,458 --> 01:06:33,833
Do you know what your son calls me?
""Shit pizza.""

877
01:06:33,916 --> 01:06:34,750
Really?

878
01:06:35,708 --> 01:06:36,916
Did you know that?

879
01:06:37,958 --> 01:06:38,791
You too?

880
01:06:42,625 --> 01:06:46,666
I'm sorry. Could you stop a moment?
I'd like to tell you something.

881
01:06:46,750 --> 01:06:48,041
Me too.

882
01:06:48,125 --> 01:06:51,916
I miss you, Carmela

883
01:06:52,000 --> 01:06:53,791
Caress me

884
01:06:54,291 --> 01:06:56,083
-Dad!
-No! What are you doing?

885
01:06:56,166 --> 01:06:58,000
-Dad!
-Stop it! Let go of him!

886
01:06:58,833 --> 01:07:00,208
Have you gone mad?

887
01:07:02,166 --> 01:07:05,458
He's taking the piss.
You think I have an illegitimate son.

888
01:07:05,541 --> 01:07:08,916
She quit her master's,
and I'm the one who's gone mad?

889
01:07:10,583 --> 01:07:12,333
You're all with Lillo.

890
01:07:12,416 --> 01:07:14,791
You brought me here
to make me dwell on my past.

891
01:07:17,291 --> 01:07:19,083
Bravo. Always blaming others!

892
01:07:21,041 --> 01:07:21,875
Gosh.

893
01:07:24,833 --> 01:07:26,250
Did you quit your master's?

894
01:08:11,125 --> 01:08:12,083
Sorry, Lillo.

895
01:08:13,041 --> 01:08:16,166
Can I ask you
how did your brother convince you?

896
01:08:24,458 --> 01:08:25,291
Sure.

897
01:08:41,791 --> 01:08:42,625
Beautiful.

898
01:08:48,291 --> 01:08:52,541
Emma! It's not that way.
It's this way. We're almost there!

899
01:08:54,500 --> 01:08:56,958
You'll have to find your way back!

900
01:08:57,041 --> 01:08:59,833
I won't call the forest ranger!

901
01:09:01,541 --> 01:09:02,750
I'm going!

902
01:09:04,416 --> 01:09:05,250
Bye!

903
01:09:06,833 --> 01:09:08,625
You too? But I'm barefoot.

904
01:09:10,125 --> 01:09:10,958
I'm going!

905
01:09:54,916 --> 01:09:56,250
Did you see Mazzacana?

906
01:10:03,375 --> 01:10:06,041
Where were you?
We've been looking for you all day.

907
01:10:06,541 --> 01:10:09,083
The wind isn't mungibiddisi.
I went for a walk.

908
01:10:09,166 --> 01:10:11,750
But what's this wind blowing mungibuddisi?

909
01:10:11,833 --> 01:10:15,666
Wind is mungibiddisi when it's
a wind coming from the mountain.

910
01:10:17,583 --> 01:10:20,041
A wind that gets into your bones,
a wind of change.

911
01:10:22,625 --> 01:10:24,416
Are you playing games with me?

912
01:10:25,041 --> 01:10:28,541
Did you plan everything
so that I'd find it there? Did you?

913
01:10:29,333 --> 01:10:30,250
Dad ripped this up

914
01:10:30,333 --> 01:10:33,625
because he didn't want to admit
that you were right and the idea was good.

915
01:10:34,208 --> 01:10:35,625
Then he patched it up.

916
01:10:36,625 --> 01:10:38,416
Because he hoped you'd come back.

917
01:10:40,708 --> 01:10:41,666
And I buried it.

918
01:10:44,958 --> 01:10:47,041
Let's go and fetch some oil.

919
01:10:47,541 --> 01:10:48,958
Will you cut some bread?

920
01:11:07,166 --> 01:11:08,750
Snails ate Dad up.

921
01:11:12,166 --> 01:11:14,125
He asked Peppu Sinnaco for money.

922
01:11:16,333 --> 01:11:18,083
And that bastard usurer

923
01:11:19,000 --> 01:11:20,583
took advantage of that.

924
01:11:23,166 --> 01:11:24,000
Here. Try it.

925
01:11:39,666 --> 01:11:40,916
Dad was proud of you.

926
01:11:42,833 --> 01:11:44,500
His pride zipped his mouth.

927
01:11:53,083 --> 01:11:54,291
And I trusted you.

928
01:12:03,291 --> 01:12:04,916
Does your ass hurt?

929
01:12:05,000 --> 01:12:05,833
Shut up.

930
01:12:06,375 --> 01:12:09,458
Idiot. You're lucky
I'm the only one who gets blamed.

931
01:12:17,333 --> 01:12:20,541
-Shall we write him a few words, Salvo?
-Write what?

932
01:12:21,708 --> 01:12:22,583
""Dear Father,

933
01:12:23,625 --> 01:12:24,583
without 'dear'.""

934
01:12:25,666 --> 01:12:31,125
""We ran away because any other place
is better than here.""

935
01:12:32,291 --> 01:12:38,250
""But don't worry, the belts you gave us
will be paid back with interest.""

936
01:12:41,208 --> 01:12:44,666
He took all the gas.
Damn slimesucker. Lillo, let's go.

937
01:12:46,250 --> 01:12:47,375
Lillo! Let's go!

938
01:12:48,416 --> 01:12:52,666
I wrote to Dad, also on your behalf,
that he shouldn't be angry with us,

939
01:12:52,750 --> 01:12:55,375
and that we'll come back when we're rich.

940
01:12:57,291 --> 01:13:00,500
Salvo, are you sure
it's the right night to run away?

941
01:13:01,083 --> 01:13:02,666
Are you shitting yourself?

942
01:13:02,750 --> 01:13:05,583
If you say you wanna do something,
you gotta go till the end.

943
01:13:05,666 --> 01:13:07,125
You said it, didn't you?

944
01:13:08,083 --> 01:13:09,000
Lillo!

945
01:13:09,083 --> 01:13:11,833
-Salvo, help me!
-Lillo, did you hurt yourself?

946
01:13:11,916 --> 01:13:14,250
-Help me!
-Lillo! Salvo!

947
01:13:14,333 --> 01:13:16,916
-How am I gonna get you out of there?
-Help me!

948
01:13:17,000 --> 01:13:19,958
-Come here.
-I can't reach it!

949
01:13:20,083 --> 01:13:22,208
-Come! Jump!
-You come down here.

950
01:13:22,291 --> 01:13:26,833
No, I can't come down in the hole.
We'll both be stuck! Jump. Find a way.

951
01:13:26,916 --> 01:13:29,291
-Salvo! Lillo!
-Almost there.

952
01:13:29,375 --> 01:13:31,500
-Is it you two?
-Reach down.

953
01:13:32,666 --> 01:13:34,625
Lillo, quick! Your hand, quick!

954
01:13:34,708 --> 01:13:35,708
Where are you going?

955
01:13:35,791 --> 01:13:37,458
-Give me your hand!
-I can't reach!

956
01:13:37,541 --> 01:13:41,583
-Your hand, quick, Lillo. He's coming.
-Come down. Lift me up.

957
01:13:41,666 --> 01:13:44,166
Lillo. I fought.

958
01:13:44,250 --> 01:13:47,416
-No, Salvo.
-I'm the last one standing.

959
01:13:47,500 --> 01:13:51,166
-If I catch you! I'll deal with you later!
-I'm sorry. I swear.

960
01:13:51,250 --> 01:13:55,791
-I'll be in touch.
-No, Salvo! Don't leave me! Salvo!

961
01:13:55,875 --> 01:13:56,833
Salvo.

962
01:14:07,500 --> 01:14:08,833
The night we ran away,

963
01:14:10,958 --> 01:14:13,291
I knew you fell in the hole on purpose.

964
01:14:14,375 --> 01:14:15,875
You didn't want to leave.

965
01:14:16,500 --> 01:14:19,958
You hoped the old man would catch us,
so I couldn't run away either.

966
01:14:20,041 --> 01:14:23,083
This is what you tell yourself.
The truth is you abandoned me.

967
01:14:23,166 --> 01:14:26,750
-You threw me like an anchor with no rope.
-Are you saying I betrayed you?

968
01:14:33,000 --> 01:14:37,458
You are just jealous.

969
01:14:37,541 --> 01:14:40,625
It's not my fault
if your life went the way it did.

970
01:14:40,708 --> 01:14:43,166
But now that you can change it,

971
01:14:44,125 --> 01:14:48,666
only because I'll gain something,
you cling to everything to avoid selling.

972
01:14:49,916 --> 01:14:51,333
Why are you saying this?

973
01:14:51,416 --> 01:14:54,208
-I went to the mayor's and signed.
-I'm telling--

974
01:14:58,333 --> 01:15:01,125
The cards are on the table.
Now it's your turn.

975
01:15:01,750 --> 01:15:06,458
My dear Salvo, you have to decide
whether to save our family's house

976
01:15:06,541 --> 01:15:08,583
or save your own pale ass.

977
01:15:10,125 --> 01:15:11,416
Like you always have.

978
01:15:16,250 --> 01:15:18,166
Get the bread and shut the door.

979
01:15:50,666 --> 01:15:52,750
So? What do you think?

980
01:15:54,583 --> 01:15:59,291
Excuse my honesty,
but this ""stomp"" is not my thing.

981
01:16:03,708 --> 01:16:07,625
-No way. I can't believe it.
-No, trust me. I really don't like it.

982
01:16:07,708 --> 01:16:12,458
My stupid sister sent
my demo to the producer in Amsterdam.

983
01:16:12,541 --> 01:16:16,750
-Aren't you happy?
-No, I'm not happy. He says it sucks.

984
01:16:16,833 --> 01:16:18,125
And he's right.

985
01:16:18,208 --> 01:16:22,083
This ""stomp"" without a bit
of Neapolitan ain't worth shit.

986
01:16:27,041 --> 01:16:29,750
As if that's a way
to break up with a girl!

987
01:16:30,250 --> 01:16:34,333
-He disappeared into thin air.
-Stop it. You sound like you've been left.

988
01:16:34,416 --> 01:16:36,416
Jerk. Coward.

989
01:16:36,500 --> 01:16:37,833
-Yokel.
-Yokel!

990
01:16:37,916 --> 01:16:41,083
I'll find him. I swear to God
I'll take a flight to Amsterdam

991
01:16:41,166 --> 01:16:43,416
and have him arrested! Bastard.

992
01:16:44,000 --> 01:16:44,875
Cuckold.

993
01:16:44,958 --> 01:16:48,375
-Cuckold.
-Mom! It's my fault. I messed up.

994
01:16:51,958 --> 01:16:55,541
Honey? What's up? Are you sick?

995
01:16:56,375 --> 01:16:57,833
Hey. Breathe.

996
01:16:59,125 --> 01:17:01,041
There. She got upset. See?

997
01:17:02,125 --> 01:17:03,416
Bloody scoundrel.

998
01:17:03,500 --> 01:17:06,666
Honey, I think
it could have been your uncle's salami.

999
01:17:07,500 --> 01:17:10,666
It's very tasty,
but the food here is very rich so…

1000
01:17:17,541 --> 01:17:22,083
-Here. You'll feel better now, lighter.
-Here. Drink some water.

1001
01:17:22,166 --> 01:17:23,750
How's that? Better?

1002
01:17:24,250 --> 01:17:28,041
I remember when I was pregnant.
The first months, I lived in the bathroom.

1003
01:17:33,083 --> 01:17:36,416
Oh my God. Of course.
How did I not get it?

1004
01:17:37,125 --> 01:17:38,083
Sweetheart.

1005
01:17:39,250 --> 01:17:41,750
-Have you seen a gynecologist?
-Never.

1006
01:17:41,833 --> 01:17:46,000
Never? How come?
It's bad you've never been.

1007
01:17:47,208 --> 01:17:49,541
-No.
-Can you do it now?

1008
01:17:49,625 --> 01:17:51,166
-Yes.
-Is it too late?

1009
01:17:51,250 --> 01:17:53,000
-No.
-I don't remember.

1010
01:17:53,083 --> 01:17:55,833
-God. She's sick…
-What's wrong? Come here.

1011
01:17:55,916 --> 01:17:58,041
-Come and sit down.
-I can't breathe.

1012
01:17:58,125 --> 01:18:01,250
No. Take a deep breath. Deep.

1013
01:18:02,375 --> 01:18:04,458
Again. There. Yes, have some water.

1014
01:18:17,125 --> 01:18:20,291
I miss you tonight

1015
01:18:20,375 --> 01:18:23,458
A faraway caress

1016
01:18:23,541 --> 01:18:26,875
I miss you tonight

1017
01:18:26,958 --> 01:18:30,500
You, in my heart, and it hurts

1018
01:18:30,583 --> 01:18:32,500
I miss you tonight

1019
01:18:32,583 --> 01:18:36,041
You, Christmas Star

1020
01:18:36,666 --> 01:18:39,958
And I lay awake

1021
01:18:40,041 --> 01:18:42,208
Carmela

1022
01:18:43,083 --> 01:18:45,916
To you, I am a betrayal

1023
01:18:46,000 --> 01:18:48,500
An enemy during war

1024
01:18:49,250 --> 01:18:52,791
A door that you lock

1025
01:18:52,875 --> 01:18:53,791
Carmela

1026
01:19:09,625 --> 01:19:13,458
People would do anything for power.
I'm not interested in that.

1027
01:19:14,958 --> 01:19:17,416
A busy life and lethargic sex

1028
01:19:17,500 --> 01:19:20,500
haven't allowed me to have heirs.

1029
01:19:20,583 --> 01:19:23,916
For this reason, I wanted to leave a mark.

1030
01:19:24,791 --> 01:19:26,125
Can you keep a secret?

1031
01:19:30,166 --> 01:19:32,666
The new stadium for Aci Fontana.

1032
01:19:36,041 --> 01:19:38,333
At least the tree stayed. I'm glad.

1033
01:19:39,916 --> 01:19:40,875
It'll be cut down

1034
01:19:41,375 --> 01:19:45,333
and it will be commemorated
by a more stylish mulberry tree

1035
01:19:45,416 --> 01:19:46,791
in Swedish fiberboard.

1036
01:19:47,416 --> 01:19:49,333
Placed at the entrance to the VIP Area.

1037
01:19:49,416 --> 01:19:51,583
I insisted on this

1038
01:19:51,666 --> 01:19:53,875
to honor your father's memory.

1039
01:19:54,458 --> 01:19:55,291
Thanks.

1040
01:19:56,541 --> 01:20:01,541
I'm sorry, but weren't you against it?
Didn't you say you liked the ecosystem?

1041
01:20:01,625 --> 01:20:05,166
Yes. But there's one thing
I like more than the ecosystem.

1042
01:20:05,250 --> 01:20:06,875
-Football?
-Money.

1043
01:20:07,541 --> 01:20:10,416
Damn it, how much I love
the beautiful money.

1044
01:20:10,500 --> 01:20:14,708
I knew right away
you're not moralistic like your brother.

1045
01:20:14,791 --> 01:20:16,416
You're an entrepreneur.

1046
01:20:18,625 --> 01:20:20,875
I'm enchanted every time I look at it.

1047
01:20:22,125 --> 01:20:24,208
A watched pot never boils.

1048
01:20:24,291 --> 01:20:26,500
Shall we let this pot boil?

1049
01:20:38,708 --> 01:20:39,708
An entrepreneur.

1050
01:20:58,333 --> 01:20:59,458
What are you doing?

1051
01:21:00,708 --> 01:21:01,666
Don't pull that face.

1052
01:21:01,750 --> 01:21:05,500
-You went to the Town Hall. You signed.
-What are you doing?

1053
01:21:05,583 --> 01:21:09,833
I won't give that jerk the satisfaction
of cutting down my mulberry. I'll do it.

1054
01:21:09,916 --> 01:21:12,666
You wanna cut down the mulberry?
What are you thinking?

1055
01:21:12,750 --> 01:21:15,416
He wants to demolish our whole property.
Don't you get it?

1056
01:21:15,500 --> 01:21:21,000
Ah! I know it all! I don't sign,
then I sign, then he passes the ball.

1057
01:21:21,083 --> 01:21:24,208
Then he gets angry if I sign.
What the fuck is in your head?

1058
01:21:24,291 --> 01:21:26,416
I had a doubt in my head but not anymore.

1059
01:21:27,083 --> 01:21:30,250
Give me the urn back
and get the fuck out of here.

1060
01:21:31,083 --> 01:21:32,500
-The urn?
-That's right.

1061
01:21:32,583 --> 01:21:35,416
-That vase with inside…
-Precisely.

1062
01:21:36,166 --> 01:21:37,833
That-- That box?

1063
01:21:38,416 --> 01:21:43,000
That… We went to the top of the mountain…

1064
01:21:43,083 --> 01:21:45,208
-But we didn't intend--
-What are you saying?

1065
01:21:45,291 --> 01:21:48,125
-I was saying--
-Salvo, what?

1066
01:21:48,208 --> 01:21:51,083
-Do you want it to end badly?
-No. The wind blew.

1067
01:21:51,166 --> 01:21:53,625
And Dad is now in the microfauna.

1068
01:21:53,708 --> 01:21:56,166
-He's happy--
-Cain!

1069
01:21:56,250 --> 01:21:58,125
-What Cain? You Cain.
-Cain!

1070
01:21:58,208 --> 01:21:59,500
-Cain!
-Easy!

1071
01:22:00,125 --> 01:22:03,291
Cain. You sold
your family for 4,000 Lira. Cain!

1072
01:22:04,958 --> 01:22:07,500
-You signed!
-Suck.

1073
01:22:09,041 --> 01:22:11,458
-You signed!
-Suck.

1074
01:22:26,000 --> 01:22:27,125
How are you, Mayor?

1075
01:22:28,083 --> 01:22:31,666
-Don't touch me! Go away!
-Are you all right?

1076
01:22:31,750 --> 01:22:34,375
Everyone get out!

1077
01:22:36,708 --> 01:22:39,000
Suck. I signed ""Suck.""

1078
01:22:39,583 --> 01:22:40,458
""Suck.""

1079
01:22:41,708 --> 01:22:44,375
S-U-C-K.

1080
01:22:47,541 --> 01:22:49,541
Which is also an anagram for ""Sorry.""

1081
01:22:56,833 --> 01:22:59,791
It's not an anagram.
It's alliterative because of the ""S.""

1082
01:23:00,291 --> 01:23:02,708
Yeah, S as in the shithead that you are.

1083
01:23:07,416 --> 01:23:09,875
-Were you fighting?
-No. We were talking.

1084
01:23:09,958 --> 01:23:11,833
Just an intense discussion.

1085
01:23:11,916 --> 01:23:13,875
Honey, please, enough.

1086
01:23:13,958 --> 01:23:16,458
You're too old for this. Come on.

1087
01:23:17,458 --> 01:23:19,708
Also because you'll be a grandpa soon.

1088
01:23:22,875 --> 01:23:25,791
Enzo. Have you knocked up a girl?

1089
01:23:25,875 --> 01:23:27,500
Did I?

1090
01:23:28,083 --> 01:23:30,083
Have you knocked up a girl?!

1091
01:23:31,375 --> 01:23:32,333
Did you know it?

1092
01:23:34,583 --> 01:23:35,416
Emma.

1093
01:23:45,875 --> 01:23:46,708
Is it a boy?

1094
01:23:48,791 --> 01:23:52,291
-I'm joking.
-It's a girl.

1095
01:23:52,375 --> 01:23:54,833
Six of one and half a dozen of the other.

1096
01:24:02,250 --> 01:24:06,625
You said it. To save the pizzeria,
we need to mortgage our house in Milan.

1097
01:24:06,708 --> 01:24:09,541
-But there are always two options.
-That's right.

1098
01:24:09,625 --> 01:24:12,541
-You mentioned one now.
-What's the other one?

1099
01:24:12,625 --> 01:24:14,208
It's that you stay here.

1100
01:24:15,125 --> 01:24:16,000
Doing what?

1101
01:24:24,208 --> 01:24:27,333
There are a lot of European funds
available for things like these.

1102
01:24:28,083 --> 01:24:31,541
And you could sell the house in Milan
instead of mortgaging it.

1103
01:24:32,500 --> 01:24:35,541
-You could make money.
-Your mom doesn't want to.

1104
01:24:35,625 --> 01:24:38,166
Your mom may have changed her mind.

1105
01:24:38,250 --> 01:24:40,041
-When?
-Just now.

1106
01:24:40,125 --> 01:24:43,083
And I could help you
to start off the business

1107
01:24:43,166 --> 01:24:44,791
until we go back to Amsterdam.

1108
01:24:44,875 --> 01:24:45,833
""We"" who?

1109
01:24:46,625 --> 01:24:48,000
-Didn't I tell you?
-No.

1110
01:24:48,500 --> 01:24:51,500
-I decided she'll be born here.
-She'll call her Carmela.

1111
01:24:51,583 --> 01:24:53,541
-Joking.
-Yes. Maybe the next one.

1112
01:24:54,375 --> 01:24:56,916
There's even a music stage?

1113
01:24:58,708 --> 01:24:59,541
Hey.

1114
01:25:03,500 --> 01:25:04,416
Dad…

1115
01:25:05,583 --> 01:25:07,625
I have to tell you something too.

1116
01:25:08,125 --> 01:25:10,000
I don't want to be a pizza maker.

1117
01:25:10,958 --> 01:25:14,458
And what do you want to be,
a sound designer?

1118
01:25:14,541 --> 01:25:18,708
Yes. I want to be a sound designer.
Maybe I won't succeed, but I'll try.

1119
01:25:19,291 --> 01:25:21,583
And I want to live on my own.

1120
01:25:21,666 --> 01:25:23,791
Oh my God. I miss you a lot already.

1121
01:25:24,750 --> 01:25:27,708
-How will you pay the rent?
-I'll find a job.

1122
01:25:27,791 --> 01:25:31,041
Maybe at the beginning,
only at the beginning,

1123
01:25:31,875 --> 01:25:33,208
I could help you here.

1124
01:25:33,875 --> 01:25:37,041
In the beginning. Until I become an uncle.

1125
01:25:49,708 --> 01:25:52,625
Whereas I'd like to sleep
until I become a grandpa.

1126
01:25:53,166 --> 01:25:55,750
Get out of here, Salvo. God help us.

1127
01:26:01,875 --> 01:26:03,583
You want to live on your own?

1128
01:26:04,375 --> 01:26:06,416
-Dad saw that.
-Sweetheart.

1129
01:26:25,291 --> 01:26:26,416
Guys, soon…

1130
01:26:28,875 --> 01:26:30,166
Music!

1131
01:26:39,583 --> 01:26:40,500
Good party.

1132
01:26:43,666 --> 01:26:44,791
Music!

1133
01:26:58,541 --> 01:26:59,375
What's up?

1134
01:27:01,708 --> 01:27:02,791
Do you want to smoke?

1135
01:27:04,291 --> 01:27:05,541
Do you want to dance?

1136
01:27:13,791 --> 01:27:15,291
It was you then.

1137
01:27:21,416 --> 01:27:22,541
I made it myself.

1138
01:27:22,625 --> 01:27:23,541
Do you like it?

1139
01:27:25,791 --> 01:27:28,833
Yes. It's not really my style,

1140
01:27:30,000 --> 01:27:31,083
but it's pretty.

1141
01:27:31,666 --> 01:27:32,666
I'll put it on.

1142
01:27:34,625 --> 01:27:38,500
Sorry, Carmela, don't be offended,
but I wanted to ask you

1143
01:27:40,375 --> 01:27:41,583
if I could kiss you.

1144
01:27:44,875 --> 01:27:46,333
But I'm out of practice.

1145
01:27:49,583 --> 01:27:51,041
It's just like swimming.

1146
01:27:51,125 --> 01:27:52,416
But I can't swim.

1147
01:27:55,791 --> 01:27:58,375
You start with a dive…

1148
01:28:00,583 --> 01:28:01,875
On the count of three.

1149
01:28:04,500 --> 01:28:05,458
One…

1150
01:28:33,375 --> 01:28:35,083
Can I ask you something?

1151
01:28:35,166 --> 01:28:37,083
Hurry up. I've got things to do.

1152
01:28:38,125 --> 01:28:40,333
Why didn't you ever tell me anything nice?

1153
01:28:40,416 --> 01:28:41,916
What should I have told you?

1154
01:28:42,000 --> 01:28:46,416
If you encouraged me, I could have become
a rock star, the king of pizza.

1155
01:28:47,000 --> 01:28:50,458
The inventor of the pillow to sleep
with your arm under your head.

1156
01:28:50,958 --> 01:28:51,916
Just anything.

1157
01:28:53,125 --> 01:28:55,666
Maybe because I'm a useless thing.

1158
01:28:57,708 --> 01:28:58,541
No.

1159
01:28:59,666 --> 01:29:01,000
I am a useless thing.

1160
01:29:01,500 --> 01:29:03,916
That means that we're two useless things.

1161
01:29:04,791 --> 01:29:06,958
As they say, I passed you the gene.

1162
01:29:08,708 --> 01:29:10,708
I'm sorry I got it too late.

1163
01:29:12,375 --> 01:29:14,166
But it's not too late for you.

1164
01:29:14,250 --> 01:29:15,083
Dad.

1165
01:29:16,875 --> 01:29:19,250
We'll open a pizzeria
on our family estate.

1166
01:29:20,458 --> 01:29:21,666
As they say,

1167
01:29:21,750 --> 01:29:25,166
""Blessed is the bird
that makes its nest in its own village.""

1168
01:29:25,250 --> 01:29:26,708
You remembered it.

1169
01:29:28,958 --> 01:29:29,958
Good job, Salvo.

1170
01:29:30,583 --> 01:29:31,416
My dear son.

1171
01:29:37,000 --> 01:29:38,541
Dad, since we made peace,

1172
01:29:40,041 --> 01:29:43,666
can you give me the lotto numbers?
I need them like oxygen.

1173
01:29:44,541 --> 01:29:45,708
Now more than ever.

1174
01:29:47,958 --> 01:29:48,875
Forty-seven.

1175
01:29:50,208 --> 01:29:51,250
Forty-seven?

1176
01:29:53,166 --> 01:29:54,208
Sixty-eight.

1177
01:29:54,291 --> 01:29:57,416
-Can you turn off the tractor?
-Eighty-eight.

1178
01:29:57,500 --> 01:29:58,791
I didn't get that.

1179
01:30:00,583 --> 01:30:02,250
Can you spell it, please?

1180
01:30:04,333 --> 01:30:05,958
Speak up. Spell it.

1181
01:30:09,000 --> 01:30:10,291
Fuck off.

1182
01:30:22,750 --> 01:30:24,500
Did you get this white wine?

1183
01:35:48,208 --> 01:35:51,791

00:03:12,359 --> 00:03:13,402
I have cancer.

2
00:03:14,737 --> 00:03:18,365
Of course not. It's an ulcer.
You're complaining.

3
00:03:20,534 --> 00:03:22,578
Give me a glass of wine.
- It isn't good for you.

4
00:03:22,870 --> 00:03:24,455
It's good for your heart.

5
00:03:24,740 --> 00:03:27,080
There's nothing wrong with your heart.
- That's what you say.

6
00:03:30,666 --> 00:03:31,480
It's cold here.

7
00:03:32,463 --> 00:03:33,172
It's June.

8
00:03:39,136 --> 00:03:40,429
Shall I fetch you something else?

9
00:03:46,894 --> 00:03:47,770
Yes?

10
00:03:48,687 --> 00:03:50,147
Alex?
- Yes.

11
00:03:51,023 --> 00:03:52,191
It's Aram.

12
00:04:11,460 --> 00:04:12,836
Shouldn't you pick it up?

13
00:04:19,426 --> 00:04:22,179
It's not nice to hang up
on your brother, Alex.

14
00:04:23,514 --> 00:04:25,224
It's been a long time.
- You can say that again.

15
00:04:25,516 --> 00:04:27,226
Mum is severely ill.

16
00:04:30,354 --> 00:04:33,274
What's wrong?
- Her stomach.

17
00:04:36,652 --> 00:04:38,612
Do you still live at home?

18
00:04:38,904 --> 00:04:41,657
Yes. But I have to go away
for a few days.

19
00:04:45,869 --> 00:04:48,914
Christ, Alex.
Do it for mother, not for me.

20
00:04:49,373 --> 00:04:50,416
Will you come?

21
00:04:53,335 --> 00:04:54,295
Yes.

22
00:05:03,590 --> 00:05:04,400
Who was that?

23
00:05:08,100 --> 00:05:09,268
That was my brother.

24
00:05:10,978 --> 00:05:12,146
You have to get dressed.

25
00:05:13,605 --> 00:05:15,649
Won't you tell me your name first?

26
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:36,003
You should go to bed.

27
00:05:43,844 --> 00:05:44,678
My name's Sandra.

28
00:05:48,599 --> 00:05:50,434
Drive on or we'll have an accident.

29
00:06:11,372 --> 00:06:12,331
Go on, ask.

30
00:06:13,457 --> 00:06:14,416
What?

31
00:06:15,584 --> 00:06:17,836
You want to know
what I'm doing in your car.

32
00:06:19,963 --> 00:06:21,715
You must have your reasons.

33
00:06:23,217 --> 00:06:25,094
Everyone has their reasons.

34
00:06:28,097 --> 00:06:29,473
Well ask then.

35
00:06:31,517 --> 00:06:33,477
What are you doing in this car?

36
00:06:34,395 --> 00:06:36,522
It's none of your business.

37
00:06:36,897 --> 00:06:37,648
It's my car.

38
00:06:39,942 --> 00:06:40,776
It's my life.

39
00:06:46,031 --> 00:06:48,867
Let me drive.
- Do you have a driving licence?

40
00:06:49,952 --> 00:06:50,369
No.

41
00:06:54,289 --> 00:06:55,124
Don't you trust me?

42
00:07:06,885 --> 00:07:08,637
Are you sure it's here?

43
00:07:10,889 --> 00:07:11,849
Yes.

44
00:07:14,351 --> 00:07:17,104
Completely?
- Completely.

45
00:07:22,901 --> 00:07:27,489
I'm not sure.
It looks so quiet.

46
00:07:27,823 --> 00:07:30,659
That's right,
there's no one around.

47
00:07:32,786 --> 00:07:33,954
Are you sure?

48
00:07:34,288 --> 00:07:37,249
We'll go inside,
take that thing and walk out.

49
00:07:45,674 --> 00:07:47,301
I think it's guarded.

50
00:07:48,969 --> 00:07:52,806
I told you before.
Eugene said there's no one here.

51
00:08:01,064 --> 00:08:02,941
And you're sure it's here?

52
00:08:08,489 --> 00:08:11,617
Why visit your mother so late?
- She's ill.

53
00:08:12,490 --> 00:08:13,893
What's the matter with her?

54
00:08:16,538 --> 00:08:17,956
Something about her stomach.

55
00:08:20,083 --> 00:08:21,877
Is your father there?

56
00:08:22,169 --> 00:08:23,212
He's dead.

57
00:08:25,881 --> 00:08:27,424
Does your mother live all alone?

58
00:08:30,177 --> 00:08:32,471
No. My brother lives at home.

59
00:09:17,432 --> 00:09:20,018
Oh. It's not there.

60
00:09:21,228 --> 00:09:24,356
Are they expecting you?
- Yes.

61
00:09:25,649 --> 00:09:27,401
And the key is always there?

62
00:09:29,736 --> 00:09:31,738
I haven't been here for a long time.

63
00:09:32,114 --> 00:09:33,782
How long?

64
00:09:34,950 --> 00:09:35,951
Long.

65
00:09:36,780 --> 00:09:39,693
You don't know how long it is
since you saw your mother?

66
00:09:45,460 --> 00:09:46,295
Alex?

67
00:09:58,849 --> 00:10:01,059
Jesus Christ.

68
00:10:02,936 --> 00:10:04,146
Just keep breathing calmly.

69
00:10:06,189 --> 00:10:07,232
I don't understand.

70
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:09,443
What don't you?

71
00:10:09,776 --> 00:10:13,405
The only way he could shoot me
was through you.

72
00:10:13,780 --> 00:10:14,823
I don't understand.

73
00:10:16,825 --> 00:10:18,702
And where's Eugene?

74
00:10:20,787 --> 00:10:22,122
He should have been here long ago.

75
00:10:23,874 --> 00:10:24,958
Maybe he won't come.

76
00:10:25,959 --> 00:10:27,336
Eugene always keeps his word.

77
00:10:31,006 --> 00:10:33,383
You don't want anything, girl?
It's good for your heart.

78
00:10:34,468 --> 00:10:36,261
And you, Alex?
- No. Thanks.

79
00:10:36,553 --> 00:10:40,766
It's up to you.
I'm so happy you're home again.

80
00:10:43,977 --> 00:10:45,520
Are you warm enough?

81
00:10:45,979 --> 00:10:47,898
It's June, Mum.
- It feels cold.

82
00:10:48,190 --> 00:10:51,234
It's a pity Aram has to work.
You don't want any coffee?

83
00:10:52,027 --> 00:10:55,197
I want to sleep.
We've been up all-night.

84
00:10:56,281 --> 00:10:59,451
What does Aram does for a living?
- But haven't seen your mother for years.

85
00:10:59,743 --> 00:11:01,578
We've been up all night. I'm exhausted.

86
00:11:01,870 --> 00:11:05,916
I never see you.
I want to enjoy having you here.

87
00:11:06,708 --> 00:11:08,543
I'm staying a while.
- Really?

88
00:11:08,919 --> 00:11:09,920
You're staying a while?
- Yes.

89
00:11:10,212 --> 00:11:12,172
How long?
- That depends. A while.

90
00:11:12,881 --> 00:11:15,008
Until you get better.
- There's nothing wrong.

91
00:11:16,385 --> 00:11:18,136
Aram said you were ill.

92
00:11:18,512 --> 00:11:20,972
I cough up blood.
- That's not normal.

93
00:11:21,264 --> 00:11:23,392
You should see a doctor.
- I thought so, but Aram refused.

94
00:11:23,684 --> 00:11:26,186
He doesn't like doctors.
I may have cancer.

95
00:11:26,680 --> 00:11:28,320
We'll go to the doctor tomorrow.

96
00:11:28,730 --> 00:11:30,607
I'm sure my stomach won't kill me.

97
00:11:30,899 --> 00:11:32,859
My heart is weak, like my mother's.

98
00:11:33,610 --> 00:11:34,569
We'll check that too.

99
00:11:37,906 --> 00:11:42,119
Sweden, Holland, Germany, Britain...

100
00:11:42,536 --> 00:11:44,079
All monarchies, except Germany.

101
00:11:45,414 --> 00:11:46,415
Your turn.

102
00:11:46,707 --> 00:11:48,250
Jesus, Buddha, Mohammed or Bhishma...

103
00:11:49,209 --> 00:11:51,378
Or who?
- Bhishma from the Mahabharata.

104
00:11:53,422 --> 00:11:55,507
It must be him.
- That's right.

105
00:12:00,095 --> 00:12:02,305
I don't think he's coming.
- Of course he is.

106
00:12:03,181 --> 00:12:05,809
He must have heard what happened.
He won't come.

107
00:12:22,576 --> 00:12:23,952
So you are Sandra.

108
00:12:25,245 --> 00:12:26,872
And you are Alex.

109
00:12:30,375 --> 00:12:32,461
I never met an Alex before.

110
00:12:34,045 --> 00:12:35,422
You're my first Sandra.

111
00:12:50,103 --> 00:12:52,731
What's your brother like?

112
00:12:54,024 --> 00:12:56,359
Why doesn't he take
your mother to the doctor?

113
00:12:57,319 --> 00:12:59,488
My mother used to go every week.

114
00:13:00,447 --> 00:13:02,157
There was always something.

115
00:14:16,231 --> 00:14:17,774
Where the hell are we?
- Home.

116
00:14:19,985 --> 00:14:21,862
You can meet my mother at last.

117
00:14:24,739 --> 00:14:26,700
I'm thirsty.
- I'll get you something later.

118
00:14:26,992 --> 00:14:29,828
I'm thirsty now.
- When you're lying down.

119
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:31,872
What happened?

120
00:14:32,247 --> 00:14:33,999
Nothing to worry about.

121
00:14:34,291 --> 00:14:36,459
Who's that?
- Wouter. Nice to meet you.

122
00:14:37,711 --> 00:14:39,170
You have to see a doctor.

123
00:14:39,460 --> 00:14:41,746
We don't have to do anything.
- And certainly not see a doctor.

124
00:14:41,756 --> 00:14:43,300
He can't lie on the sofa.

125
00:14:43,592 --> 00:14:46,011
Why not?
- He'll get it dirty. Take him to bed.

126
00:14:47,679 --> 00:14:49,931
He can lie in Alex's room.
- No, Alex is there.

127
00:14:51,141 --> 00:14:51,725
Is he back?

128
00:14:52,017 --> 00:14:53,894
I want the sofa.
- With his new girlfriend.

129
00:14:54,185 --> 00:14:56,021
I say.
- I'm thirsty.

130
00:14:56,313 --> 00:14:58,023
Do you have any Chinese beer?
- No, sorry.

131
00:14:58,398 --> 00:15:00,066
Christ almighty!
You know I drink Chinese beer.

132
00:15:00,358 --> 00:15:03,653
I thought you'd be away for days.
I haven't gone shopping yet.

133
00:15:04,195 --> 00:15:07,616
Excuses! A good housewife
always has beer for visitors.

134
00:15:07,908 --> 00:15:10,869
We never have visitors.
- What about me, goddamnit?!

135
00:15:11,703 --> 00:15:14,706
I've been back five minutes
and I'm already regretting it.

136
00:16:18,395 --> 00:16:19,354
How are you?

137
00:16:19,854 --> 00:16:22,315
Why did you take photos of me?

138
00:16:23,942 --> 00:16:25,694
I'm a photographer.

139
00:16:53,930 --> 00:16:55,765
Is it nice?
- Delicious.

140
00:16:56,057 --> 00:16:57,892
I thought as much.

141
00:16:58,184 --> 00:17:00,145
Everyone sleeps here all day.

142
00:17:03,314 --> 00:17:04,315
Shall I wake up Alex?

143
00:17:05,191 --> 00:17:06,234
He was very tired.

144
00:17:07,402 --> 00:17:09,696
Isn't it nice and quiet;
just the two of us?

145
00:17:09,988 --> 00:17:13,575
Did you quarrel?
Oh my god, what happened?

146
00:17:13,867 --> 00:17:15,785
No. We've never quarrelled.

147
00:17:24,210 --> 00:17:26,004
This is nice?
- Great.

148
00:17:29,549 --> 00:17:31,134
What are the pills for?

149
00:17:32,427 --> 00:17:33,428
Nothing special.

150
00:17:33,762 --> 00:17:37,599
If you can't tell your mother-in-law,
who can you tell?

151
00:17:38,725 --> 00:17:41,102
It would only worry you.
- No, really.

152
00:17:42,979 --> 00:17:44,981
Epilepsy.
- Oh God...

153
00:17:45,273 --> 00:17:48,193
It's nothing to worry about.
I take my medicine.

154
00:17:48,485 --> 00:17:51,446
Medicine?
- Against attacks.

155
00:17:52,072 --> 00:17:53,114
Attacks?

156
00:17:53,615 --> 00:17:56,451
No need for hysteria.

157
00:17:56,743 --> 00:17:58,828
It's years since I had an attack.

158
00:17:59,704 --> 00:18:00,789
The pills take care of that.

159
00:18:05,668 --> 00:18:06,544
Does Alex know?

160
00:18:09,798 --> 00:18:11,091
It hasn't come up yet.

161
00:18:16,346 --> 00:18:18,223
May I use the bathroom?

162
00:19:33,548 --> 00:19:35,884
Good morning!
- Good morning.

163
00:19:36,384 --> 00:19:38,303
I should say good afternoon.

164
00:19:38,595 --> 00:19:42,557
I'll make you some hot chocolate.
- Great!

165
00:19:42,891 --> 00:19:46,311
Hot chocolate for the late sleeper.
If you say please, at least.

166
00:19:46,811 --> 00:19:47,979
Please at least.

167
00:19:48,313 --> 00:19:50,899
No, just please.
- Just please.

168
00:19:52,483 --> 00:19:55,028
We are in a good mood.
- Stop that!

169
00:20:41,032 --> 00:20:41,574
Who are you?

170
00:20:44,118 --> 00:20:45,662
You must be Alex.

171
00:20:47,497 --> 00:20:48,665
How do you know who I am?

172
00:20:48,957 --> 00:20:53,711
Right description: identical,
but with a loser's look on his face.

173
00:20:55,838 --> 00:20:57,966
Who said that?
- Me. You heard.

174
00:21:00,218 --> 00:21:04,889
Which is the odd one out:
Jesus, Mohammed, Buddha or Bhishma?

175
00:21:06,015 --> 00:21:06,432
The last one.

176
00:21:08,268 --> 00:21:10,395
You're guessing.
You don't know who he is.

177
00:21:11,229 --> 00:21:14,274
Bhishma was invincible and
could decide when he would die.

178
00:21:16,651 --> 00:21:18,444
Who told you about me?

179
00:21:22,991 --> 00:21:24,075
Where's my brother?

180
00:21:30,456 --> 00:21:31,207
What are you doing?

181
00:21:33,126 --> 00:21:36,337
I'm blowing the milk back.
- I can see that. Throw it away.

182
00:21:37,380 --> 00:21:39,382
What's wrong with the milk?
- Throw it away, I said.

183
00:21:49,225 --> 00:21:50,226
Sandra?

184
00:21:52,979 --> 00:21:56,232
Aram is here. With a friend.

185
00:21:58,401 --> 00:21:59,694
Then I can meet him.

186
00:22:00,778 --> 00:22:02,530
What did I give you
for your birthday?!

187
00:22:03,865 --> 00:22:04,615
Oh yes.

188
00:22:05,950 --> 00:22:09,912
Don't look a gift horse in the mouth.

189
00:22:10,705 --> 00:22:14,751
Especially when you need the gift
and the giver is present.

190
00:22:16,336 --> 00:22:19,297
I don't know how it works.
- I explained it four times!

191
00:22:19,589 --> 00:22:20,381
Pour a glass of milk.

192
00:22:30,099 --> 00:22:31,601
Give it to me.

193
00:22:41,152 --> 00:22:42,111
That's not difficult, is it?

194
00:22:43,654 --> 00:22:45,156
Think you can do that next time?

195
00:22:47,742 --> 00:22:50,036
Who's this then?
Another late sleeper.

196
00:22:50,213 --> 00:22:50,866
Good morning.

197
00:22:50,995 --> 00:22:52,955
Would you like hot chocolate?
Where is Sandra?

198
00:22:53,581 --> 00:22:54,415
Hello little brother.

199
00:22:55,917 --> 00:22:59,587
Hi, Aram. How are you?
- Oh, fine so far.

200
00:23:00,254 --> 00:23:02,757
Would you like some hot chocolate?
- Yes.

201
00:23:03,049 --> 00:23:06,177
If you say please, at least.
- Please at least.

202
00:23:06,969 --> 00:23:08,971
Where's Sandra?
- Who the hell is Sandra?

203
00:23:09,263 --> 00:23:11,391
Alec's girlfriend. She takes pills.
- Pills?

204
00:23:11,682 --> 00:23:14,185
Against the attacks.
- What kind of attacks?

205
00:23:14,477 --> 00:23:16,562
She has attacks of fury.
- Really?

206
00:23:16,854 --> 00:23:19,607
She told me herself.
She foams at the mouth without the pills.

207
00:23:19,941 --> 00:23:23,986
I didn't notice that.
- She keeps it secret from you.

208
00:23:24,278 --> 00:23:27,115
It's because of the children.
- Children? We don't have any.

209
00:23:27,448 --> 00:23:30,410
All you have to do
is add some cocoa...

210
00:23:44,590 --> 00:23:45,633
How are you?

211
00:23:46,759 --> 00:23:47,802
Bad.

212
00:23:48,302 --> 00:23:49,929
Are you in pain?

213
00:23:50,847 --> 00:23:54,392
What did you think?
What are we doing here?

214
00:23:54,976 --> 00:23:57,603
Waiting for Eugene to call.
- Shouldn't you call him?

215
00:23:58,187 --> 00:23:59,230
That's not a good idea.

216
00:24:00,356 --> 00:24:05,778
You're not professional. Get focused.
Leave your brother out of it.

217
00:24:06,529 --> 00:24:08,990
Two birds with one stone.

218
00:24:10,575 --> 00:24:13,953
You're messing up.
What's the matter these days?

219
00:24:34,765 --> 00:24:37,685
You were to be away for a few days?
- Yes.

220
00:24:38,227 --> 00:24:42,064
But I didn't want to leave
those boring sleepy fossils.

221
00:24:42,356 --> 00:24:44,150
How can a fossil be sleepy?

222
00:24:46,235 --> 00:24:47,278
What?

223
00:24:49,489 --> 00:24:50,781
A fossil is dead.

224
00:24:51,699 --> 00:24:54,410
So it already dropped off.

225
00:24:55,036 --> 00:24:56,913
What are you trying to say?

226
00:24:57,830 --> 00:25:00,541
You can't say ""sleepy fossil"".
Just like white snow.

227
00:25:00,958 --> 00:25:02,793
It's a pleonasm.

228
00:25:04,295 --> 00:25:09,050
Are you saying I'm stupid enough
to utter a pleonasm?

229
00:25:10,426 --> 00:25:12,512
You think you're cleverer than me?

230
00:25:14,388 --> 00:25:17,683
Did you know ""white snow""
was a pleonasm?

231
00:25:20,561 --> 00:25:22,772
Try to think one up with Alex.

232
00:25:24,065 --> 00:25:28,027
What you mean?
- A pleonasm with Alex. Dot dot Alex.

233
00:25:29,820 --> 00:25:30,988
I'll help you.

234
00:25:31,280 --> 00:25:33,074
Dumb Alex.

235
00:25:33,491 --> 00:25:35,284
Come on.
- Now you, damn it!

236
00:25:38,579 --> 00:25:41,499
Boring Alex.
- Good. Another one.

237
00:25:43,793 --> 00:25:46,045
Cowardly Alex.
- Stinking Alex.

238
00:25:47,046 --> 00:25:48,881
Disgusting Alex.

239
00:25:49,674 --> 00:25:52,051
Unmannered Alex.

240
00:26:08,859 --> 00:26:10,945
Send in the next.

241
00:26:13,864 --> 00:26:14,949
Hello doctor.

242
00:26:17,201 --> 00:26:18,369
Sit down.

243
00:26:25,084 --> 00:26:29,171
Did you come along anyway?
- I'm Alex. Aram's brother.

244
00:26:29,922 --> 00:26:32,633
Alex lets me come to the doctor.

245
00:26:34,927 --> 00:26:40,641
I checked your mother last week.
Nothing wrong with her heart.

246
00:26:40,933 --> 00:26:43,936
She's completely fit.
- It's her stomach.

247
00:27:02,830 --> 00:27:04,165
Are you cold, or what?

248
00:27:11,631 --> 00:27:13,466
I'll be honest.

249
00:27:14,425 --> 00:27:16,093
I'm Alex's brother.

250
00:27:18,679 --> 00:27:20,640
You're Aram?
- Well...

251
00:27:20,931 --> 00:27:25,519
So Alex did mention me.
- Not that you...

252
00:27:25,811 --> 00:27:29,899
Are his twin brother?
Half an hour older. It's strange.

253
00:27:30,274 --> 00:27:34,070
We don't meet for years and
then have about the same haircut.

254
00:27:34,362 --> 00:27:36,489
Wasn't I good to you?

255
00:27:39,116 --> 00:27:41,786
Wouter, this is Sandra.
Sandra, Wouter.

256
00:27:42,286 --> 00:27:44,246
Hello.
- Hello.

257
00:27:44,664 --> 00:27:47,375
Aram?
- Yes?

258
00:27:47,667 --> 00:27:49,418
Wasn't I good to you?

259
00:27:49,710 --> 00:27:52,797
You always were.
- I always asked you on a job.

260
00:27:53,089 --> 00:27:55,174
I appreciate that.
And you know who I ask for?

261
00:27:56,008 --> 00:27:57,802
Who for?
- I ask for you.

262
00:28:00,429 --> 00:28:02,556
You're a real Christian.
- It's nothing.

263
00:28:03,099 --> 00:28:05,351
No, you're really good to me.
- It's nothing. You're capable.

264
00:28:05,643 --> 00:28:09,563
No, I really appreciate it.
- Unnecessary to repeat yourself.

265
00:28:10,731 --> 00:28:13,818
You're right, sorry.
- Yes, quite unnecessary.

266
00:28:16,153 --> 00:28:18,030
It can give you heart problems.

267
00:28:18,322 --> 00:28:20,032
There's nothing wrong
with your heart.

268
00:28:21,867 --> 00:28:24,370
The pills can give me palpitations.
It says so.

269
00:28:26,038 --> 00:28:28,332
Just take them.
They're good for you.

270
00:28:36,048 --> 00:28:38,467
Alex?
- Yes?

271
00:28:41,220 --> 00:28:44,140
Couldn't you work in the garage?

272
00:28:47,268 --> 00:28:49,103
You know I'm not very handy.

273
00:28:52,440 --> 00:28:54,275
Your father would have loved it.

274
00:28:58,571 --> 00:29:01,657
It hurts.
- Pain is in the head.

275
00:29:02,158 --> 00:29:03,117
I'm dying.

276
00:29:03,743 --> 00:29:05,828
He has to go to a doctor.
- I don't have to go anywhere.

277
00:29:06,871 --> 00:29:10,249
Sandra, can you get a drink?

278
00:29:18,174 --> 00:29:19,508
Are you afraid of death?

279
00:29:21,343 --> 00:29:22,303
No.

280
00:29:34,482 --> 00:29:36,400
I know what you think.

281
00:29:38,068 --> 00:29:39,528
I bet you don't.

282
00:29:42,782 --> 00:29:45,534
You think Wouter
should see a doctor.

283
00:29:46,702 --> 00:29:48,746
What do you have
against doctors?

284
00:29:49,497 --> 00:29:51,081
Anyone can be a doctor.

285
00:29:52,917 --> 00:29:54,877
Anyone can be ill.

286
00:29:55,169 --> 00:29:57,171
Pain and illness are in your head.

287
00:30:06,806 --> 00:30:08,599
Don't you know a nice story, Alex?

288
00:30:08,891 --> 00:30:12,311
He always told those lovely stories,
just like his father.

289
00:30:12,728 --> 00:30:16,482
I'm right out of nice stories.
- Goodness, I wonder why?

290
00:30:18,025 --> 00:30:21,070
Alex's father was the best storyteller.
And your father?

291
00:30:21,987 --> 00:30:23,197
No, he was a good liar.

292
00:30:23,864 --> 00:30:26,450
What a pity. Theo's stories
took people's breath away.

293
00:30:26,992 --> 00:30:29,453
He was also the best car mechanic.
What does your father do?

294
00:30:30,746 --> 00:30:32,540
He's in jail because of me.

295
00:30:36,460 --> 00:30:40,798
Theo could repair a car
by looking at it.

296
00:30:41,715 --> 00:30:43,843
It's a pity nothing happens
in the garage.

297
00:30:44,134 --> 00:30:46,220
You don't do anything?
- No.

298
00:30:46,804 --> 00:30:51,058
He stopped work a year after you left.
Now it all just rots.

299
00:31:01,026 --> 00:31:02,903
My mother is very ill.

300
00:31:12,246 --> 00:31:14,164
What did the doctor say?

301
00:31:16,417 --> 00:31:19,211
Nothing, but I could see
it was serious.

302
00:31:23,382 --> 00:31:25,551
And now he's doing tests.

303
00:31:27,011 --> 00:31:29,555
We'll know more in a few days.

304
00:31:30,931 --> 00:31:34,310
Christ almighty.
- Yes, you can say that again.

305
00:31:40,024 --> 00:31:41,984
I'm glad I came back.

306
00:31:51,785 --> 00:31:54,872
Why didn't you say
you had a twin brother?

307
00:31:57,166 --> 00:31:58,792
I didn't?

308
00:31:59,335 --> 00:32:00,377
No.

309
00:32:14,725 --> 00:32:17,895
We're making a report about
a working woman in this area.

310
00:32:18,187 --> 00:32:21,690
Don't you want photos
of me at work?

311
00:32:22,066 --> 00:32:25,861
Yes. But that's for later.

312
00:32:28,238 --> 00:32:31,283
What do you most
like photographing?

313
00:32:33,369 --> 00:32:34,411
Animals.

314
00:32:35,871 --> 00:32:37,706
Everything except people.

315
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:43,754
Why?
- Look what I have for you, Sandra.

316
00:32:44,046 --> 00:32:46,924
I used to wear it myself.

317
00:32:49,051 --> 00:32:50,219
Put it on.

318
00:33:01,522 --> 00:33:03,315
It'll suit her.

319
00:33:05,067 --> 00:33:07,611
That child dresses so badly.
- What makes you say that?

320
00:33:07,903 --> 00:33:09,738
All that crap on her face,
just like Babylon.

321
00:33:10,030 --> 00:33:11,865
Mum!
- Well, it's true.

322
00:34:07,463 --> 00:34:09,381
Yes, lovely!

323
00:34:11,842 --> 00:34:13,177
What do you think?

324
00:34:14,803 --> 00:34:17,806
I don't know. Maybe
I have to get used to it.

325
00:34:18,098 --> 00:34:20,434
Get used to it? It looks lovely.

326
00:34:20,726 --> 00:34:22,561
Take a good look, Alex.

327
00:34:24,772 --> 00:34:27,024
I want to go,
to take some photos.

328
00:34:28,150 --> 00:34:29,401
I'll come along.

329
00:34:43,582 --> 00:34:46,794
We'll have to walk.
- Try again.

330
00:35:06,730 --> 00:35:08,732
I used to play here.

331
00:35:09,566 --> 00:35:11,568
It's lovely.
- Yes.

332
00:35:12,111 --> 00:35:14,071
Will you take pictures here?

333
00:35:15,906 --> 00:35:19,201
They'd be postcard landscapes.
- Rubbish.

334
00:35:24,164 --> 00:35:25,624
Maybe you're right.

335
00:35:37,719 --> 00:35:39,805
There's a nice spot.

336
00:35:41,265 --> 00:35:44,184
It's a lovely background, isn't it, Alex?

337
00:35:45,144 --> 00:35:46,353
Very nice.

338
00:35:47,604 --> 00:35:51,400
I'll stand there.
- But of course.

339
00:36:14,590 --> 00:36:16,383
It's going wrong.

340
00:36:16,884 --> 00:36:18,719
Did I do something wrong?

341
00:36:21,054 --> 00:36:23,724
I can't take pictures of people.

342
00:36:24,057 --> 00:36:26,727
It goes wrong if
a person crosses my lens.

343
00:36:32,357 --> 00:36:34,234
How long has it been like that?

344
00:36:36,612 --> 00:36:38,322
Quite a while.

345
00:36:45,662 --> 00:36:47,664
Maybe I should do
something else.

346
00:36:49,208 --> 00:36:50,876
Yes, maybe.

347
00:36:56,173 --> 00:36:58,383
I could work in the garage.

348
00:36:59,676 --> 00:37:02,471
Will you call him?
- No, not yet.

349
00:37:02,763 --> 00:37:04,640
You have to call him.

350
00:37:07,559 --> 00:37:10,729
We messed up.
- What makes you think that?

351
00:37:11,146 --> 00:37:12,564
I...

352
00:37:14,149 --> 00:37:16,068
I messed up.

353
00:37:25,494 --> 00:37:27,329
Can I ask?

354
00:37:44,972 --> 00:37:46,556
What happened?

355
00:37:50,686 --> 00:37:53,647
I once photographed
a terrible accident.

356
00:37:55,732 --> 00:37:56,900
By accident.

357
00:38:00,070 --> 00:38:02,781
It happened while
I pressed the shutter.

358
00:38:12,207 --> 00:38:14,042
I burned the film.

359
00:38:16,211 --> 00:38:18,380
I didn't even dare develop it.

360
00:38:32,978 --> 00:38:34,980
You trust me, don't you?

361
00:38:49,119 --> 00:38:50,746
I have to pee.

362
00:38:53,373 --> 00:38:56,168
I'll go with you.
- No, I want to pee outside.

363
00:38:58,962 --> 00:39:01,214
I'll work on my car.

364
00:39:39,753 --> 00:39:42,089
I could kick that jack away.

365
00:39:47,052 --> 00:39:50,180
Aram?
- Since when do you repair cars?

366
00:39:52,140 --> 00:39:53,308
Since today.

367
00:39:54,226 --> 00:39:58,605
Maybe you should be a mechanic.
- Yes, maybe.

368
00:39:59,523 --> 00:40:02,901
You never were a good photographer.
- And you know all about that?

369
00:40:03,777 --> 00:40:06,655
Well the last session I attended
wasn't very impressive.

370
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:09,783
I don't want to talk about it.

371
00:40:10,283 --> 00:40:12,160
It was your idea, damn it.

372
00:40:50,532 --> 00:40:52,826
Mum, have you seen Sandra?

373
00:40:57,456 --> 00:41:00,834
Did you set fire to that thing?
- No. Why should I?

374
00:41:01,126 --> 00:41:05,088
Be nice to each other.
How long since you last met?

375
00:41:05,380 --> 00:41:06,673
Not long enough.

376
00:41:09,759 --> 00:41:11,595
Are you expecting a call?

377
00:41:12,596 --> 00:41:13,597
You?

378
00:41:14,723 --> 00:41:17,559
Will someone pick it up?

379
00:41:18,852 --> 00:41:20,020
Alex speaking...

380
00:41:30,155 --> 00:41:31,406
Yes, I'll be right there.

381
00:41:34,451 --> 00:41:35,452
Who was that?

382
00:41:36,411 --> 00:41:39,080
Just an acquaintance.
- Which acquaintance?

383
00:41:39,581 --> 00:41:41,833
You don't know him.
- How d'you know?

384
00:41:42,125 --> 00:41:44,085
Let it be, Aram.

385
00:41:48,507 --> 00:41:51,968
The doctor called.
- And?

386
00:41:53,428 --> 00:41:55,388
I have to come round.

387
00:41:57,432 --> 00:41:59,267
It didn't sound good.

388
00:42:01,853 --> 00:42:03,438
Does she know?

389
00:42:04,814 --> 00:42:05,815
No.

390
00:42:08,193 --> 00:42:12,155
Why are you so nasty to your brother?
- Because he's a fool.

391
00:42:12,447 --> 00:42:15,200
He's a good photographer.
You don't win prizes for nothing.

392
00:42:15,492 --> 00:42:18,036
Have you watched him
all these years, then?

393
00:42:18,578 --> 00:42:20,330
You should be proud of him.

394
00:42:20,622 --> 00:42:23,667
He wants to be a car mechanic.
- Oh yes? Since when?

395
00:42:25,043 --> 00:42:26,962
Why d'you love him more than me?

396
00:42:30,257 --> 00:42:33,051
He didn't call for years.
- He's busy.

397
00:42:33,343 --> 00:42:36,805
Who stayed here?
Who took over the business?

398
00:42:37,097 --> 00:42:40,016
For two years,
then you stopped.

399
00:42:40,308 --> 00:42:43,311
And now you think Alex will
take care of it? I know you.

400
00:42:44,187 --> 00:42:47,649
Alex could be a good mechanic.
- Rubbish.

401
00:42:48,483 --> 00:42:50,902
Dad was proud of me,
you know that.

402
00:42:52,779 --> 00:42:54,573
Your father is dead.

403
00:43:15,719 --> 00:43:17,971
Do you notice people treating you
as a woman?

404
00:43:18,930 --> 00:43:22,851
What do you mean?
- People think doctors should be men.

405
00:43:24,060 --> 00:43:28,231
Sometimes.
But most male patients don't mind.

406
00:43:28,523 --> 00:43:30,442
They may even prefer it.

407
00:43:31,401 --> 00:43:33,612
That never causes tension?

408
00:43:34,529 --> 00:43:37,699
Why are male doctors
never asked that?

409
00:43:40,493 --> 00:43:42,662
There's something on your face.
- What?

410
00:43:44,080 --> 00:43:46,833
A smudge. On your face.

411
00:43:49,252 --> 00:43:50,962
It's your turn.

412
00:44:03,558 --> 00:44:05,435
What do you do for a living?

413
00:44:05,727 --> 00:44:07,687
You first.
- Car mechanic.

414
00:44:08,688 --> 00:44:10,023
Hairdresser.
- God, that's nice.

415
00:44:10,315 --> 00:44:13,026
Aram!
- Did you cut Alex's hair?

416
00:44:14,194 --> 00:44:16,446
No? What's all this? Why not?

417
00:44:17,238 --> 00:44:20,325
I'm really still learning.
- Aram!

418
00:44:21,326 --> 00:44:22,452
One moment.

419
00:44:23,453 --> 00:44:25,705
Aram!

420
00:44:27,666 --> 00:44:28,875
Yes, what's up?

421
00:44:29,167 --> 00:44:31,753
I'm thirsty.
- But there's no beer.

422
00:44:32,045 --> 00:44:35,965
Where's your mother?
- What? Gone somewhere.

423
00:44:36,800 --> 00:44:39,260
There must be something
to drink in the house.

424
00:44:41,471 --> 00:44:44,224
To be honest,
I may have been exaggerating.

425
00:44:44,599 --> 00:44:46,142
Really?

426
00:44:46,851 --> 00:44:48,728
I only had a couple of lessons.

427
00:44:49,312 --> 00:44:51,314
Then you need some more practice.

428
00:44:52,565 --> 00:44:55,985
I only worked with the dummy,
not real people.

429
00:45:07,497 --> 00:45:09,165
What are you doing?

430
00:45:10,291 --> 00:45:11,793
I'm having my hair styled.

431
00:45:13,420 --> 00:45:15,338
You're wearing rollers.

432
00:45:15,755 --> 00:45:16,756
You don't say...

433
00:45:22,137 --> 00:45:23,888
Shouldn't someone look at that?

434
00:45:26,307 --> 00:45:29,269
Don't you mind me exaggerating?
- Of course.

435
00:45:29,561 --> 00:45:33,523
But it's water under the bridge.
I have something to admit too.

436
00:45:35,692 --> 00:45:39,529
I haven't been a car mechanic for years.
Honesty lasts longer.

437
00:45:39,821 --> 00:45:42,699
My mother always said that.
- How sensible.

438
00:45:43,533 --> 00:45:47,829
Shall we promise to be honest
with each other now?

439
00:45:48,955 --> 00:45:51,166
No more lies?
- Nothing but the truth!

440
00:45:51,458 --> 00:45:53,126
Ask me something.

441
00:45:55,670 --> 00:45:58,548
Don't you ever wear shoes?
- No shoes, no socks.

442
00:45:59,632 --> 00:46:01,468
Never?
- Not ever.

443
00:46:02,761 --> 00:46:03,928
Why not?

444
00:46:04,721 --> 00:46:07,891
Do you know Abbey Road?
- Who gave Wouter curls?

445
00:46:15,356 --> 00:46:16,357
Aram.

446
00:46:16,983 --> 00:46:19,194
Hello, Eugene.
I was about to call.

447
00:46:19,611 --> 00:46:22,030
Of course not... Just a scratch.

448
00:46:23,740 --> 00:46:26,201
I have to talk to you.

449
00:46:26,910 --> 00:46:28,286
Of course you can.

450
00:46:28,703 --> 00:46:30,538
My mother has cancer.

451
00:46:35,668 --> 00:46:37,837
She only has a couple of months.

452
00:46:39,255 --> 00:46:40,799
Christ.

453
00:46:44,344 --> 00:46:46,429
How are you going to tell her?

454
00:46:49,432 --> 00:46:51,434
She wouldn't believe it.

455
00:46:52,811 --> 00:46:56,606
She always thought
she'd die of a heart attack.

456
00:47:01,027 --> 00:47:02,111
And now?

457
00:47:04,030 --> 00:47:05,198
I don't know.

458
00:47:08,326 --> 00:47:10,203
I can't leave now.

459
00:47:17,627 --> 00:47:18,795
Take a look.

460
00:47:24,133 --> 00:47:25,969
That's cheeky.

461
00:47:33,142 --> 00:47:34,936
Christ, what do we want
with an animal?

462
00:47:35,228 --> 00:47:37,313
It's nice for mum.
A rabbit, like the old days.

463
00:47:37,605 --> 00:47:41,276
The past is gone.
- The past never dies.

464
00:47:41,693 --> 00:47:44,362
Big words from my little brother.

465
00:47:44,654 --> 00:47:47,156
If you'd been that clever,
your father might still live.

466
00:47:47,907 --> 00:47:49,909
It was an accident.
- Oh yes?

467
00:47:50,243 --> 00:47:52,787
Yes, you know that as well as I do.

468
00:47:53,162 --> 00:47:57,208
How lovely, a rabbit!
Guess what I won at bingo?

469
00:47:58,042 --> 00:48:01,546
A trip round the world!
- It's only the village bingo.

470
00:48:01,838 --> 00:48:03,756
You'll never guess.
- Tell us.

471
00:48:04,299 --> 00:48:07,343
No, you guess.
- Something for the living room?

472
00:48:07,635 --> 00:48:09,804
It's a cake. Who'd have thought?

473
00:48:10,138 --> 00:48:14,142
Can I take out the curlers?
- Alex, did you think it was a cake?

474
00:48:14,726 --> 00:48:18,313
Of course not.
- Can I take them out, or what?

475
00:48:18,938 --> 00:48:21,107
I bought Chinese beer too.

476
00:48:21,482 --> 00:48:26,112
Our father, who art in Heaven,
hallowed by thy name...

477
00:48:38,041 --> 00:48:39,125
Amen.

478
00:48:44,213 --> 00:48:48,509
More respect for the Word of God
would not be misplaced.

479
00:48:56,851 --> 00:49:00,521
He was part of me.
- But not worth a dig?

480
00:49:00,813 --> 00:49:04,692
We have laborers for that.
You want to be a laborer, don't you?

481
00:49:05,109 --> 00:49:08,947
That's no way to be buried.
- It happens the way I say.

482
00:49:09,280 --> 00:49:12,283
I didn't like it, the last time
I listened to you.

483
00:49:16,329 --> 00:49:19,248
We wouldn't mention it again.
- Also your idea.

484
00:49:19,540 --> 00:49:21,626
God, you have bad ideas.

485
00:49:21,918 --> 00:49:23,836
You think it's so easy for me?

486
00:49:24,879 --> 00:49:26,589
What d'you think it meant to me?

487
00:49:26,881 --> 00:49:29,092
The poor boy can't take
any more pictures.

488
00:49:29,384 --> 00:49:31,803
You were the one who left,
you bastard. Now dig!

489
00:49:51,698 --> 00:49:54,742
You thought you could
get round Mum with a rabbit?

490
00:49:55,910 --> 00:49:58,371
You think that's why
I captured the beast?

491
00:50:00,498 --> 00:50:02,583
Dad mechanic, you mechanic.

492
00:50:03,167 --> 00:50:05,420
Dad rabbit, you rabbit.

493
00:50:07,672 --> 00:50:08,965
You're crazy.

494
00:50:19,100 --> 00:50:20,309
Give that dirty mess to me.

495
00:50:20,893 --> 00:50:22,937
I'll put it in the wash with
the rest of your clothes.

496
00:50:23,229 --> 00:50:25,565
The rest? They weren't dirty.

497
00:50:26,107 --> 00:50:27,358
They stank.

498
00:50:38,995 --> 00:50:41,080
A microwave damages the health.

499
00:50:41,956 --> 00:50:43,750
So does smoking.

500
00:50:44,042 --> 00:50:45,918
My health isn't important.

501
00:50:48,087 --> 00:50:50,256
Those microwaves
could make you impotent.

502
00:50:50,548 --> 00:50:52,675
If you climb inside.

503
00:50:55,803 --> 00:50:59,891
What will Sandra think if you stop taking
pictures and become a mechanic?

504
00:51:01,100 --> 00:51:04,020
She'll understand.
- Oh really? You think so?

505
00:51:05,021 --> 00:51:10,860
You think Sandra with her skinny
yet delicious body would agree?

506
00:51:23,498 --> 00:51:25,750
Why treat the animal like that?

507
00:51:26,042 --> 00:51:28,669
Your boyfriend has strange ideas
about rabbits.

508
00:51:28,961 --> 00:51:31,881
Did you put it in, Alex?
- No, of course not.

509
00:51:32,340 --> 00:51:34,842
I think I'll leave you alone
to sort it out.

510
00:51:35,134 --> 00:51:38,262
You can quarrel in peace.
- We're not quarrelling.

511
00:51:54,112 --> 00:51:56,155
Are you still mad at me?

512
00:51:58,407 --> 00:52:01,077
Can you give this to Alex?

513
00:52:01,452 --> 00:52:03,329
What is it?
- Open it.

514
00:52:10,378 --> 00:52:12,380
It was years ago.

515
00:52:12,755 --> 00:52:15,967
Alex gave them to me. I thought...

516
00:52:16,759 --> 00:52:18,803
...he might want them back.

517
00:52:19,762 --> 00:52:21,889
Aram gave me this.

518
00:52:36,696 --> 00:52:38,614
Don't you want to see them?

519
00:53:18,279 --> 00:53:19,572
Who's that woman?

520
00:53:22,992 --> 00:53:25,369
She used to be our doctor.

521
00:53:27,872 --> 00:53:29,081
And the man?

522
00:53:34,045 --> 00:53:35,338
That's my father.

523
00:53:45,890 --> 00:53:48,809
Aram said you gave them to him.

524
00:53:55,691 --> 00:53:56,734
That's right.

525
00:54:01,113 --> 00:54:03,157
I followed my father.

526
00:54:05,368 --> 00:54:07,370
I thought something was going on.

527
00:54:12,708 --> 00:54:14,627
Did your mother know?

528
00:54:21,050 --> 00:54:21,968
No.

529
00:54:23,344 --> 00:54:25,096
We never told her.

530
00:54:28,474 --> 00:54:30,518
It would have broken her.

531
00:54:36,941 --> 00:54:38,901
How long did this go on?

532
00:54:45,825 --> 00:54:47,285
I don't remember exactly.

533
00:54:49,954 --> 00:54:52,123
At a certain point it was all over.

534
00:54:54,625 --> 00:54:56,502
She probably moved.

535
00:55:05,886 --> 00:55:08,681
You think Aram was involved?

536
00:55:15,438 --> 00:55:17,023
I don't know.

537
00:55:20,276 --> 00:55:21,402
A little to the left.

538
00:55:25,698 --> 00:55:27,533
It's still there.

539
00:55:27,825 --> 00:55:30,995
Stop taking pictures
and do something about it.

540
00:56:12,828 --> 00:56:14,497
Goodnight.

541
00:57:11,137 --> 00:57:12,930
Have you been awake long?

542
00:57:15,933 --> 00:57:17,226
All night.

543
00:57:20,729 --> 00:57:22,356
What's worrying you?

544
00:57:25,526 --> 00:57:26,485
Aram.

545
00:57:34,910 --> 00:57:36,745
I think he's creepy.

546
00:57:39,165 --> 00:57:40,833
He's changed.

547
00:57:42,585 --> 00:57:45,171
Why is he always barefoot?

548
00:57:47,214 --> 00:57:48,507
I don't know.

549
00:57:51,343 --> 00:57:53,345
Things used to be different.

550
00:57:53,679 --> 00:57:56,599
If I look in his eyes,
I can't feel anything anymore.

551
00:58:18,787 --> 00:58:22,583
...Yours is the kingdom, the power
and the glory, for ever and ever...

552
00:58:23,042 --> 00:58:24,043
...Amen.

553
00:58:29,006 --> 00:58:32,426
I'm pleased you behaved this time.

554
00:58:35,137 --> 00:58:36,680
There they are.

555
00:58:44,855 --> 00:58:46,065
Aram!

556
00:58:47,691 --> 00:58:48,901
Eugene!

557
00:58:55,032 --> 00:58:56,450
Isn't Wouter here?

558
00:58:58,244 --> 00:59:00,079
He didn't make it.

559
00:59:02,581 --> 00:59:05,584
Eugene doesn't like that, Aram.
You know that.

560
00:59:06,919 --> 00:59:07,962
I know.

561
00:59:08,879 --> 00:59:10,965
Where is the corpse?

562
00:59:16,136 --> 00:59:18,264
That isn't right, Aram.

563
00:59:19,390 --> 00:59:20,516
I know.

564
00:59:22,393 --> 00:59:25,062
That's not what we agreed.

565
00:59:25,354 --> 00:59:29,817
Just creep in,
take the things and go.

566
00:59:33,529 --> 00:59:36,031
That always worked out in the past.

567
00:59:36,323 --> 00:59:39,159
A man in my position
can't tolerate this.

568
00:59:43,122 --> 00:59:47,418
If I didn't have position, it would
be no problem. But I have a position.

569
00:59:48,711 --> 00:59:50,588
You certainly have one, Eugene.

570
00:59:50,879 --> 00:59:53,299
I shall never deny it.

571
00:59:53,966 --> 00:59:55,551
I understand.

572
00:59:56,468 --> 00:59:58,762
Piss on the grave, Esther.

573
00:59:59,930 --> 01:00:00,848
I say, Eugene.

574
01:00:01,140 --> 01:00:04,184
You say what?
You had enough to drink.

575
01:00:16,614 --> 01:00:19,491
Let this be a lesson to you, Aram.

576
01:00:21,493 --> 01:00:23,704
It certainly is, Eugene.

577
01:00:24,788 --> 01:00:29,001
I have a respectable business
and want to keep it that way.

578
01:00:34,131 --> 01:00:36,091
Now let's have a barbecue.

579
01:00:40,387 --> 01:00:41,597
We're going to have a barbecue.

580
01:00:42,348 --> 01:00:44,683
But we're just having dinner.
Delicious stew.

581
01:00:44,975 --> 01:00:47,936
With all due respect,
I thought something more festive.

582
01:00:48,228 --> 01:00:51,649
I have chickens in the car,
beef and wine.

583
01:00:51,940 --> 01:00:53,734
Let's have a good time.

584
01:00:54,902 --> 01:00:57,112
You'll have to change, Alex.

585
01:01:03,535 --> 01:01:05,496
Would you like some wine?
- Oh, please.

586
01:01:05,829 --> 01:01:07,873
I don't know if it's a good idea.

587
01:01:08,415 --> 01:01:11,794
What does Aram do for a living?
He's always so vague.

588
01:01:12,086 --> 01:01:15,964
Aram works for Eugene.
- Exactly. And usually very well.

589
01:01:28,560 --> 01:01:30,479
I'll take you to bed, Mum.

590
01:01:32,981 --> 01:01:35,651
You shouldn't drink too much wine.
It's not good for your stomach.

591
01:01:35,943 --> 01:01:38,696
Nothing wrong with my stomach.

592
01:01:39,697 --> 01:01:42,825
My mother died of a heart attack,
and her mother too.

593
01:01:43,117 --> 01:01:47,496
That doesn't mean you'll have problems.
You have a healthy heart.

594
01:01:48,038 --> 01:01:50,332
Thanks to the wine.

595
01:01:52,334 --> 01:01:53,585
Go to sleep.

596
01:01:58,465 --> 01:01:59,466
Alex?

597
01:02:00,884 --> 01:02:01,844
Yes?

598
01:02:04,054 --> 01:02:06,181
I'm glad you're here.

599
01:02:07,433 --> 01:02:09,309
Yes, so am I.

600
01:02:10,519 --> 01:02:14,690
Your father would be pleased
the garage is being used again.

601
01:02:16,650 --> 01:02:18,736
Yes, I miss him too.

602
01:02:21,613 --> 01:02:23,532
You're so like him.

603
01:02:25,784 --> 01:02:26,827
You think so?

604
01:02:27,661 --> 01:02:28,871
Come here.

605
01:02:35,085 --> 01:02:36,962
I'm so proud of you.

606
01:02:37,546 --> 01:02:39,256
I'm glad of that.

607
01:02:39,631 --> 01:02:41,592
Dad loved you a lot too.

608
01:02:47,681 --> 01:02:49,808
Your collar is wrong, Theo.

609
01:02:50,976 --> 01:02:52,728
I'm Alex.

610
01:03:02,696 --> 01:03:06,158
That took a long time.
- I had to take my mother to bed.

611
01:03:06,450 --> 01:03:07,868
I was going to look for you.

612
01:03:08,368 --> 01:03:11,789
Hide and seek!
- That's a good idea.

613
01:03:12,706 --> 01:03:15,918
Don't we have business to settle?
- Aram, you're too serious.

614
01:03:16,210 --> 01:03:19,087
The night is young.
Let's play hide and seek.

615
01:03:19,963 --> 01:03:22,132
Now?
- Yes, hide and seek.

616
01:03:22,424 --> 01:03:25,010
You know what it is?

617
01:03:27,721 --> 01:03:30,432
You can use the whole house.

618
01:03:36,897 --> 01:03:38,899
You have something of mine.

619
01:03:39,775 --> 01:03:41,109
It's outside.

620
01:03:53,372 --> 01:03:55,624
... 50! I'm coming!

621
01:04:03,799 --> 01:04:07,010
Is that you, Theo?
- It's me, Alex.

622
01:04:10,013 --> 01:04:13,267
I trust you, Aram.
- I know.

623
01:04:15,477 --> 01:04:19,398
I won't look in the box.
I know what's there.

624
01:04:21,775 --> 01:04:24,444
I wouldn't be insulted if you counted.

625
01:04:24,736 --> 01:04:27,906
I trust you too, Eugene.
- That's good.

626
01:04:31,827 --> 01:04:34,079
It's time to have a rest, Aram.

627
01:04:35,914 --> 01:04:38,417
I'm tired.
- I know.

628
01:05:03,358 --> 01:05:04,985
Found you.

629
01:05:05,277 --> 01:05:08,155
I thought you'd never find me here.

630
01:05:11,700 --> 01:05:13,785
I can't get down.

631
01:05:14,494 --> 01:05:17,039
Are you stuck?
- I think so.

632
01:05:21,126 --> 01:05:23,837
Do you still love me, Theo?

633
01:05:24,212 --> 01:05:26,131
I'm Alex, mum.

634
01:05:27,049 --> 01:05:28,550
Were you working late?

635
01:05:29,426 --> 01:05:31,678
We're playing hide and seek.

636
01:05:32,846 --> 01:05:36,600
Aren't you a bit old for that?

637
01:05:37,559 --> 01:05:38,810
You're sweet.

638
01:05:46,109 --> 01:05:47,778
Esther, let's go.

639
01:05:50,238 --> 01:05:53,158
Our mission is completed.
Say thanks to Aram.

640
01:05:53,533 --> 01:05:54,534
Thanks.

641
01:05:55,160 --> 01:05:58,497
You don't have to go.
Don't you want to stay?

642
01:05:58,789 --> 01:06:00,874
No, it's up to you now.

643
01:06:04,086 --> 01:06:07,714
You're my favourite employee, Aram.
- I'm glad of that.

644
01:06:12,886 --> 01:06:15,138
It's been such a long time, Theo.

645
01:06:16,056 --> 01:06:18,600
Mum, don't.

646
01:06:19,685 --> 01:06:23,480
What do you see in Alex?
- He's very kind to me.

647
01:06:23,772 --> 01:06:25,899
What you think about his brother?

648
01:06:26,441 --> 01:06:27,943
He's not bad.

649
01:06:28,944 --> 01:06:31,780
I'm going to look for Alex.
- Just call out loud.

650
01:06:32,072 --> 01:06:33,740
That'll wake your mother.

651
01:06:34,032 --> 01:06:36,785
Theo... Theo...

652
01:06:39,538 --> 01:06:41,415
Where could he be?

653
01:06:42,541 --> 01:06:44,584
Alex is good at hide and seek.

654
01:06:45,711 --> 01:06:47,212
Theo...

655
01:06:57,014 --> 01:06:58,807
Jesus Christ.

656
01:07:21,079 --> 01:07:23,081
I don't think this is normal.

657
01:07:28,170 --> 01:07:30,172
It's just like a slaughtered pig.

658
01:07:30,630 --> 01:07:32,340
But then without blood.

659
01:07:39,973 --> 01:07:41,975
I did First Aid.

660
01:08:07,751 --> 01:08:10,712
Sandra is a strange girl, Alex.

661
01:08:31,566 --> 01:08:33,110
I think she's better now.

662
01:09:38,550 --> 01:09:42,554
I'm sorry. I'm really sorry.

663
01:09:44,181 --> 01:09:46,641
You don't do things like that.
- Certainly not.

664
01:09:46,933 --> 01:09:48,685
I think I should be punished.

665
01:09:48,977 --> 01:09:52,814
No, just don't do it again.
- No, I have to be punished.

666
01:09:58,111 --> 01:10:00,280
One hard blow should be enough.

667
01:10:09,915 --> 01:10:11,082
Come on.

668
01:10:12,042 --> 01:10:13,877
One hard blow.

669
01:10:20,175 --> 01:10:22,052
Is that all?
- Yes.

670
01:10:24,679 --> 01:10:27,682
I got off lightly.
- Yes, I think so too.

671
01:10:28,850 --> 01:10:31,561
Failure is human,
forgiveness is divine.

672
01:10:31,853 --> 01:10:33,021
It's all right.

673
01:10:40,028 --> 01:10:43,448
It's nice and clean.
Do you understand greenfly?

674
01:10:45,200 --> 01:10:47,702
What do you mean?
- There isn't a single greenfly.

675
01:10:48,245 --> 01:10:51,665
But when it gets sick,
it'll be covered in greenfly.

676
01:10:52,374 --> 01:10:56,419
They can smell a sick plant?
- That's the nice bit.

677
01:10:56,836 --> 01:10:59,923
A strong plant is left alone,
a weak one is consumed.

678
01:11:00,799 --> 01:11:02,926
I understand that much
about the greenfly.

679
01:11:03,218 --> 01:11:05,804
So what don't you understand?
- Where are they now?

680
01:11:06,972 --> 01:11:11,017
They must be somewhere.
When it's sick, you see hundreds.

681
01:11:11,309 --> 01:11:13,770
Where do the greenfly come from?

682
01:11:14,813 --> 01:11:19,901
Have you never thought about that?
- No, not really.

683
01:11:20,986 --> 01:11:22,737
I have, boy.

684
01:11:24,030 --> 01:11:26,992
Maybe they warn
each other with walkie-talkies.

685
01:11:27,284 --> 01:11:30,829
Don't you take anything seriously?
Is everything a joke?

686
01:11:31,121 --> 01:11:35,208
Why so serious?
- Your jokes made father commit suicide.

687
01:11:36,376 --> 01:11:38,628
It was an accident.
- What do you know?

688
01:11:39,421 --> 01:11:42,299
The police said so.
- Don't always believe them.

689
01:11:44,467 --> 01:11:47,762
Why on earth should Dad kill himself?
- The man was unhappy.

690
01:11:48,179 --> 01:11:50,849
So am I.
- But you're a coward.

691
01:11:52,017 --> 01:11:53,268
A weakling.

692
01:11:53,893 --> 01:11:56,896
You'd rather be eaten by greenfly.

693
01:12:34,017 --> 01:12:35,977
Where were you this morning?

694
01:12:36,644 --> 01:12:38,646
You were sleeping so soundly.

695
01:12:40,357 --> 01:12:42,275
I got the fright of my life
when I woke up.

696
01:12:42,984 --> 01:12:44,402
Ah, you did?

697
01:12:48,281 --> 01:12:51,493
You're the one
with some explaining to do.

698
01:12:52,369 --> 01:12:55,288
If you mean last night,
that was nothing.

699
01:12:55,622 --> 01:12:57,374
My mother was confused.

700
01:12:58,041 --> 01:13:00,710
You want me to hurt her
in her last few months?

701
01:13:04,172 --> 01:13:06,257
You're mad at me,
aren't you?

702
01:13:07,926 --> 01:13:12,055
No, I just don't know how to cope.

703
01:13:17,519 --> 01:13:19,938
How long will you go on like this?

704
01:13:22,607 --> 01:13:23,650
Like what?

705
01:13:23,942 --> 01:13:27,737
When something happens,
you just stand there and watch.

706
01:13:34,411 --> 01:13:37,038
You can't replace your father.

707
01:13:39,165 --> 01:13:40,625
I'm not trying to.

708
01:13:42,419 --> 01:13:44,712
You do his work,
you wear his clothes.

709
01:14:12,615 --> 01:14:14,826
We have to leave here, Alex.

710
01:14:17,996 --> 01:14:22,083
You're thinking of your mother,
but Aram isn't good for you.

711
01:14:46,149 --> 01:14:47,442
I had a call.

712
01:14:49,444 --> 01:14:50,987
Who from?

713
01:14:51,279 --> 01:14:52,530
From a client.

714
01:14:54,324 --> 01:14:58,703
You not saying you're going to leave?
- No, Alex is staying a while.

715
01:15:00,038 --> 01:15:01,581
I'm afraid I have to go.

716
01:15:01,873 --> 01:15:04,667
You promised.
- What do you have to do?

717
01:15:05,710 --> 01:15:08,755
A job. Photography.
- Can't you do it here?

718
01:15:09,047 --> 01:15:12,467
No. I have to leave tomorrow.
- Don't stay away so long this time.

719
01:15:15,303 --> 01:15:19,474
You can't leave.
- I decide about my own life.

720
01:15:21,601 --> 01:15:23,603
Your life is mine too.

721
01:15:26,606 --> 01:15:29,150
We aren't finished, Alex.

722
01:15:30,235 --> 01:15:32,362
You know that as well as I do.

723
01:16:00,014 --> 01:16:01,933
Alex, we're leaving.

724
01:18:32,375 --> 01:18:33,668
It was your fault too, Alex.

725
01:18:38,715 --> 01:18:40,049
I didn't want it.
- Don't lie.

726
01:18:41,551 --> 01:18:43,970
Who produced those photos
of her and Dad?

727
01:18:45,221 --> 01:18:46,764
It was your idea.

728
01:18:47,056 --> 01:18:48,975
Are you so sure of that?

729
01:18:55,106 --> 01:18:57,442
I knew what you thought, Alex.

730
01:19:01,821 --> 01:19:03,614
I always knew what you thought.

731
01:19:07,034 --> 01:19:09,078
I didn't want it.
- Don't lie.

732
01:19:09,704 --> 01:19:13,040
I did what you wanted.
You were too scared.

733
01:19:17,628 --> 01:19:21,090
After that I didn't know
what you thought anymore.

734
01:19:26,471 --> 01:19:28,431
You're just as guilty as me, Alex.

735
01:19:32,977 --> 01:19:34,061
Say it.

736
01:19:38,065 --> 01:19:39,275
Say it!

737
01:19:42,195 --> 01:19:44,030
I'm just as guilty.

738
01:19:44,322 --> 01:19:45,615
Same with Dad's death.

739
01:19:46,199 --> 01:19:48,409
It was an accident.
- Really?

740
01:19:48,910 --> 01:19:51,662
Yes, you know that.
- It was suicide.

741
01:19:52,538 --> 01:19:54,499
You only say that to hurt me.

742
01:19:54,791 --> 01:19:56,501
It was suicide.
- Stop it.

743
01:19:56,793 --> 01:19:59,128
Dad did it because she was dead.
- I said stop it.

744
01:19:59,420 --> 01:20:02,048
You really think he was stupid enough
to drive into the water?

745
01:20:02,160 --> 01:20:04,880
Your father killed himself
because we made his life pointless.

746
01:20:05,176 --> 01:20:07,261
You're lying!

747
01:20:08,513 --> 01:20:10,681
You knew all along, Alex.

748
01:20:12,266 --> 01:20:15,603
You always thought so.
- You're lying...

749
01:20:16,646 --> 01:20:19,482
You're lying! You're lying!

750
01:20:24,028 --> 01:20:25,279
Maybe.

751
01:21:54,619 --> 01:21:57,038
I still wonder whether
it's high enough.

752
01:21:58,956 --> 01:22:00,082
Of course it is.

753
01:22:34,575 --> 01:22:35,618
I pushed.

754
01:22:38,663 --> 01:22:40,247
I can't do it.

00:01:18,815 --> 00:01:20,408
I'm stronger than you!

2
00:01:21,951 --> 00:01:23,214
There's Uncle Jeff.

3
00:01:24,787 --> 00:01:26,153
Bye, guys.

4
00:01:30,059 --> 00:01:31,823
- You'll bring us salmon?
- You bet!

5
00:01:32,295 --> 00:01:33,295
Bye, my love.

6
00:01:33,796 --> 00:01:34,796
Safe trip.

7
00:01:39,235 --> 00:01:40,635
Bye, kiddos.

8
00:02:21,277 --> 00:02:22,277
You alright?

9
00:02:23,012 --> 00:02:24,503
Yeah, top shape. Why?

10
00:02:55,211 --> 00:02:58,670
<i>With sunny skies everywhere,
it's a beautiful fall day,</i>

11
00:02:58,815 --> 00:03:00,579
<i>and the weekend...</i>

12
00:06:19,549 --> 00:06:21,381
I'm not so sure about this.

13
00:06:21,551 --> 00:06:22,551
What?

14
00:06:27,557 --> 00:06:28,557
OK.

15
00:06:31,227 --> 00:06:34,129
Yes!

16
00:07:34,590 --> 00:07:37,822
Let's keep it tidy.
Which drawer do you want?

17
00:07:37,994 --> 00:07:39,860
I'd like the bottom one.

18
00:07:40,029 --> 00:07:42,362
Marco, take whatever one you want.

19
00:07:43,165 --> 00:07:45,191
Sam, mind if I take
the bottom drawer?

20
00:07:46,602 --> 00:07:47,602
Sam?

21
00:08:05,187 --> 00:08:06,849
What are you doing?

22
00:08:07,023 --> 00:08:09,458
If I want to be in shape for later...

23
00:08:09,625 --> 00:08:11,856
Hey, bank boss, we're in Amsterdam.

24
00:08:12,028 --> 00:08:13,826
Move, before I slug you.

25
00:08:17,033 --> 00:08:19,867
- What are you doing?
- Getting ready to go out.

26
00:08:20,036 --> 00:08:23,006
No shaving. We've gone fishing.
Wake up!

27
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:25,804
I'll put on clean undies at least.

28
00:08:30,046 --> 00:08:31,412
What are you doing?

29
00:08:31,647 --> 00:08:33,479
Aren't you going to unpack?

30
00:08:33,649 --> 00:08:34,878
You bet.

31
00:08:35,051 --> 00:08:37,748
Guys, wait for me. Guys!

32
00:08:55,504 --> 00:08:56,665
Who's gonna roll?

33
00:09:05,848 --> 00:09:08,511
Eeny, meeny, miny, moe,

34
00:09:08,684 --> 00:09:10,277
Catch a tiger by the toe...

35
00:09:10,419 --> 00:09:12,718
And you are it!

36
00:09:23,699 --> 00:09:25,725
Why do I always lose?

37
00:09:25,901 --> 00:09:27,699
Want to vote instead?

38
00:09:29,705 --> 00:09:30,764
I hate you.

39
00:09:30,940 --> 00:09:32,101
Come on!

40
00:10:51,787 --> 00:10:54,018
I'm as nervous
as for my first communion.

41
00:10:54,190 --> 00:10:56,716
All you need
is your leopard g-string.

42
00:11:05,201 --> 00:11:08,797
So, have you ever played around?

43
00:11:09,371 --> 00:11:12,808
I'd have told you.
Why are you asking?

44
00:11:14,210 --> 00:11:15,210
No reason.

45
00:11:17,847 --> 00:11:19,213
Move over.

46
00:11:19,381 --> 00:11:21,373
- Move, move!
- Take it easy.

47
00:11:23,085 --> 00:11:24,246
What are you doing?

48
00:11:25,588 --> 00:11:27,022
Here.

49
00:11:30,392 --> 00:11:32,224
You can't be serious.

50
00:11:32,394 --> 00:11:33,657
Where'd you find it?

51
00:11:33,829 --> 00:11:35,764
It'll help us rise and shine.

52
00:11:35,931 --> 00:11:37,593
What are you up to?

53
00:11:39,034 --> 00:11:41,230
We're here to party, but...

54
00:11:41,403 --> 00:11:45,238
Shit, guys. When we were
planning our trip back home,

55
00:11:45,407 --> 00:11:48,377
you were ready for anything,
but now you're...

56
00:11:49,745 --> 00:11:51,213
What did we say?

57
00:11:52,848 --> 00:11:54,407
You only live once.

58
00:11:58,087 --> 00:11:59,087
C'mon!

59
00:11:59,255 --> 00:12:01,087
If I'm going to hell,

60
00:12:01,257 --> 00:12:02,555
then with my pals!

61
00:12:03,626 --> 00:12:04,626
Cheers!

62
00:12:10,399 --> 00:12:11,924
- Godawful!
- Your turn.

63
00:12:27,449 --> 00:12:29,384
So, in the Red Light District...?

64
00:12:29,551 --> 00:12:32,715
The book says,
when you see a girl you like,

65
00:12:32,888 --> 00:12:37,258
you knock on her door, pay her,
and you get it on.

66
00:12:37,426 --> 00:12:38,724
Love at first sight!

67
00:12:40,462 --> 00:12:42,158
Do you have to bargain?

68
00:12:42,331 --> 00:12:44,926
I hope not
'cause you'd get screwed.

69
00:12:46,101 --> 00:12:47,467
Jerks!

70
00:12:49,905 --> 00:12:51,897
Don't worry, it's a flat rate.

71
00:13:03,919 --> 00:13:05,820
But how do you choose?

72
00:13:07,690 --> 00:13:11,320
Me, to get hard,
I need to chat a bit first.

73
00:13:12,928 --> 00:13:17,332
Choose one who looks like Béatrice.
It'll feel like home.

74
00:13:20,502 --> 00:13:21,800
I hope they're OK.

75
00:13:22,504 --> 00:13:24,473
My daughter was getting a cold.

76
00:13:26,342 --> 00:13:27,970
Why don't we call them?

77
00:13:28,143 --> 00:13:30,305
Ask if they did their homework,

78
00:13:30,479 --> 00:13:33,381
what they ate for supper,
if things are OK?

79
00:13:34,350 --> 00:13:35,716
Guys...

80
00:13:39,154 --> 00:13:40,622
You sound like old farts.

81
00:13:43,459 --> 00:13:44,483
Party.

82
00:13:44,793 --> 00:13:46,523
Let's go, you clowns!

83
00:14:01,076 --> 00:14:02,169
Well...

84
00:14:03,178 --> 00:14:04,373
see you later.

85
00:14:32,775 --> 00:14:34,403
See you at the hotel.

86
00:14:43,218 --> 00:14:44,413
Hello.

87
00:17:06,562 --> 00:17:08,190
Christ, you're gorgeous.

88
00:17:11,733 --> 00:17:13,361
You have the same eyes.

89
00:19:54,529 --> 00:19:57,021
It's just, we've been trying for 10 years.

90
00:19:57,199 --> 00:19:59,327
I find it strange, that's all.

91
00:20:02,204 --> 00:20:04,105
I don't give a shit about statistics.

92
00:20:08,744 --> 00:20:10,906
Anything to tell me, Madeleine?

93
00:20:15,751 --> 00:20:18,118
No, no, course not.

94
00:20:18,754 --> 00:20:19,915
I'm happy.

95
00:20:21,356 --> 00:20:23,120
Yeah, they're really biting.

96
00:20:27,763 --> 00:20:29,129
Kiss you. Bye.

97
00:20:33,135 --> 00:20:34,135
Me too.

98
00:21:19,781 --> 00:21:21,682
Jeff? Jeff!

99
00:21:22,984 --> 00:21:24,418
Sam's not back!

100
00:21:50,345 --> 00:21:51,836
71.

101
00:21:54,216 --> 00:21:56,185
What's he doing here?

102
00:21:57,219 --> 00:21:58,949
75. This is the place.

103
00:22:03,458 --> 00:22:04,858
Hey, you clowns!

104
00:22:05,460 --> 00:22:07,452
Wanna tango with some trout?

105
00:22:19,374 --> 00:22:20,398
Hi!

106
00:22:20,509 --> 00:22:23,502
This is Juul, our fishing guide.
C'mon.

107
00:23:07,088 --> 00:23:09,284
We won't be completely lying.

108
00:23:18,733 --> 00:23:19,928
So, you studs?

109
00:23:22,103 --> 00:23:23,103
Last night?

110
00:23:27,943 --> 00:23:29,104
It was alright.

111
00:23:29,945 --> 00:23:31,937
Shit, I want details, boys!

112
00:23:32,948 --> 00:23:35,543
It's like bicycling.
You don't forget.

113
00:23:38,553 --> 00:23:41,751
Like bicycling?
Wow, must've been steamy!

114
00:23:42,657 --> 00:23:44,125
Me, not so good.

115
00:23:45,894 --> 00:23:46,953
Oh yeah?

116
00:23:48,129 --> 00:23:49,129
Yeah.

117
00:23:55,403 --> 00:23:56,427
Couldn't get it up?

118
00:23:59,975 --> 00:24:01,568
I thought of Madeleine.

119
00:24:05,180 --> 00:24:06,580
No big deal.

120
00:24:07,248 --> 00:24:08,443
Nah, it's no big deal.

121
00:24:08,583 --> 00:24:10,176
You'll do better tonight.

122
00:24:16,458 --> 00:24:19,121
Fish on, boys!

123
00:24:19,294 --> 00:24:20,785
Holy shit!

124
00:24:54,829 --> 00:24:56,354
Madeleine's pregnant.

125
00:24:57,032 --> 00:24:59,194
She told me as I was leaving.

126
00:24:59,300 --> 00:25:00,300
What?

127
00:25:01,202 --> 00:25:02,329
So that explains it!

128
00:25:04,072 --> 00:25:06,041
Welcome to the club!

129
00:25:07,842 --> 00:25:11,870
Finally! You'd given up hope!
One guy squirmed through.

130
00:25:12,047 --> 00:25:14,744
Mom said never trust doctors,

131
00:25:14,916 --> 00:25:16,407
or bank managers!

132
00:25:17,652 --> 00:25:18,652
Right.

133
00:25:19,054 --> 00:25:20,215
Brother-in-law,

134
00:25:20,388 --> 00:25:22,357
I'm so happy for you both.

135
00:25:24,426 --> 00:25:26,224
You tried for so long.

136
00:25:46,247 --> 00:25:48,341
Sam, this calls for a celebration!

137
00:25:50,685 --> 00:25:52,244
See you at the hotel.

138
00:25:53,188 --> 00:25:55,089
Sam, don't freak out.

139
00:25:55,724 --> 00:25:57,454
I was a wreck with my first.

140
00:25:58,093 --> 00:25:59,686
Sam, come on!

141
00:26:12,107 --> 00:26:13,700
He didn't come back.

142
00:26:23,284 --> 00:26:25,116
Good idea, let's pack.

143
00:26:28,723 --> 00:26:31,454
There must be something else.
I'm sure.

144
00:26:31,593 --> 00:26:33,289
It's not just the baby.

145
00:26:35,063 --> 00:26:37,726
There's gotta be more to it.

146
00:26:38,333 --> 00:26:41,132
Come on, you freaked out
with your first.

147
00:26:44,272 --> 00:26:47,265
- What are you doing?
- My mouth's dry.

148
00:26:48,276 --> 00:26:50,905
Go easy on that,
we're flying home.

149
00:27:03,691 --> 00:27:05,853
Maybe he's in
the Red Light District.

150
00:27:06,294 --> 00:27:08,525
To see if he can get it up.

151
00:27:10,498 --> 00:27:13,991
I'll go shower.
Save time in the morning.

152
00:27:14,135 --> 00:27:16,127
Tell the front desk to wake us.

153
00:29:09,617 --> 00:29:12,052
Jeff! Sam's not back.

154
00:29:15,123 --> 00:29:16,123
No way!

155
00:29:16,224 --> 00:29:17,385
Christ, our flight.

156
00:29:21,129 --> 00:29:23,496
Bea can't find out about our trip.

157
00:29:23,665 --> 00:29:25,964
- OK, relax.
- Yeah, relax.

158
00:29:26,134 --> 00:29:29,901
And you? They'll love this
at the bank. Fucking shit!

159
00:29:30,071 --> 00:29:32,631
- Look, don't freak out!
- Freak out?

160
00:29:33,074 --> 00:29:34,565
We have to look for him.

161
00:29:35,410 --> 00:29:36,434
Where?

162
00:29:42,183 --> 00:29:44,277
Don't ever pull that again!

163
00:29:45,453 --> 00:29:47,684
I figured I should tell you.

164
00:29:47,855 --> 00:29:49,084
What?

165
00:29:50,959 --> 00:29:53,155
That I won't be flying with you.

166
00:29:53,328 --> 00:29:55,297
Wait. You can't do that.

167
00:29:55,463 --> 00:29:58,456
I need some time.
A couple of days.

168
00:29:59,267 --> 00:30:01,668
The plan only works
if you come too.

169
00:30:05,373 --> 00:30:07,933
Enough horsing around.
You're coming!

170
00:30:08,109 --> 00:30:10,135
We're all boarding that plane.

171
00:30:10,311 --> 00:30:11,438
Get off me.

172
00:30:11,612 --> 00:30:13,205
What'll we tell the girls?

173
00:30:13,681 --> 00:30:15,115
Sam, shit!

174
00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:20,679
Sam, wait, fuck!

175
00:30:22,690 --> 00:30:25,159
- Tell 'em I stayed at the camp.
- No.

176
00:30:25,326 --> 00:30:27,727
Madeleine will charge down there.

177
00:30:28,129 --> 00:30:31,327
Forget it. You're coming with us.
That's final.

178
00:30:33,901 --> 00:30:35,335
Please, guys.

179
00:30:36,137 --> 00:30:37,469
Help me, OK?

180
00:30:42,377 --> 00:30:43,377
Sam, stop.

181
00:30:47,048 --> 00:30:49,176
Shit, what are we going to do?

182
00:30:49,250 --> 00:30:50,718
Quit fooling around.

183
00:30:50,885 --> 00:30:52,080
Sam, stop.

184
00:30:53,354 --> 00:30:54,913
Shit!

185
00:30:56,524 --> 00:30:58,720
You can't. Fuck, our plan!

186
00:31:02,930 --> 00:31:04,330
Sam, stop it.

187
00:31:04,499 --> 00:31:06,400
If you do this, you bastard...

188
00:31:06,567 --> 00:31:09,366
I don't want that baby. No way.

189
00:31:09,537 --> 00:31:11,369
Don't you get it?

190
00:31:18,946 --> 00:31:21,438
I'll come Wednesday.
Do it for me, guys.

191
00:31:25,953 --> 00:31:27,546
I love you, guys.

192
00:32:52,440 --> 00:32:53,533
It's Daddy!

193
00:32:57,645 --> 00:32:59,773
Hi, kiddo. Where's Dad?

194
00:32:59,947 --> 00:33:01,779
Let me catch my breath.

195
00:33:01,949 --> 00:33:03,850
I hope you brought trout.

196
00:33:03,985 --> 00:33:05,510
Or we'll be eating you.

197
00:33:05,686 --> 00:33:07,314
Don't I get a kiss?

198
00:33:07,488 --> 00:33:09,047
Sorry.

199
00:33:09,657 --> 00:33:11,285
Where's my dad?

200
00:33:11,492 --> 00:33:14,155
Give Uncle Jeff a break.
Take your bath.

201
00:33:16,497 --> 00:33:19,296
Forget the bath.
Just put them to bed.

202
00:33:23,137 --> 00:33:25,504
Should we order some pizza?

203
00:33:28,509 --> 00:33:31,138
Jeff, has anything happened?

204
00:33:31,312 --> 00:33:32,507
Well...

205
00:33:33,514 --> 00:33:35,676
- Yes and no.
- Where are the others?

206
00:33:37,518 --> 00:33:39,510
We think that

207
00:33:39,687 --> 00:33:41,519
Sam went into the woods.

208
00:33:41,889 --> 00:33:43,016
What?

209
00:33:43,524 --> 00:33:44,890
What do you mean?

210
00:33:45,326 --> 00:33:46,919
It's been 24 hours.

211
00:33:47,094 --> 00:33:49,723
- 24 hours?
- He'll be back.

212
00:33:49,897 --> 00:33:52,332
Tomorrow or the day after...

213
00:33:52,700 --> 00:33:55,363
- He probably wanted to be alone.
- Wait.

214
00:33:55,937 --> 00:33:57,667
Did he leave or is he lost?

215
00:33:58,706 --> 00:34:02,165
We woke up yesterday, he was gone.
So we figure...

216
00:34:02,343 --> 00:34:05,370
I bet he's at Jodoin's trailer.
He must be.

217
00:34:05,546 --> 00:34:07,071
We checked. He wasn't there.

218
00:34:07,915 --> 00:34:09,315
Since it was raining, we...

219
00:34:09,450 --> 00:34:10,975
It was sunny here.

220
00:34:11,118 --> 00:34:12,677
Well, it rained there.

221
00:34:14,121 --> 00:34:15,919
We wanted to tell you.

222
00:34:16,924 --> 00:34:18,415
I'm going back to search
with Marco.

223
00:34:18,559 --> 00:34:20,619
Why'd he go off by himself?

224
00:34:22,129 --> 00:34:24,121
We had a few beers that night.

225
00:34:24,365 --> 00:34:26,527
He became, like... aggressive.

226
00:34:26,734 --> 00:34:30,364
You know how he can be.
So then, well lubricated...

227
00:34:30,571 --> 00:34:33,302
Aggressive?
What were you talking about?

228
00:34:36,577 --> 00:34:38,910
We were riding each other,
that's all.

229
00:34:40,147 --> 00:34:41,945
Not me, mostly Marco.

230
00:34:42,083 --> 00:34:43,949
Marco and Sam fought?

231
00:34:44,151 --> 00:34:47,952
We all got carried away.
Sam went for a walk to calm down.

232
00:34:48,155 --> 00:34:50,317
Next morning he wasn't back.

233
00:34:51,259 --> 00:34:53,387
Look. You stay here.

234
00:34:53,594 --> 00:34:58,123
I'll return to the camp and look
with Marco. We'll find him, OK?

235
00:34:58,966 --> 00:35:00,958
- Don't panic.
- Don't panic?

236
00:35:01,168 --> 00:35:04,570
My brother's been gone 24 hours
and I shouldn't panic?

237
00:35:05,106 --> 00:35:07,769
It's not like he's never
been in the woods.

238
00:35:08,242 --> 00:35:09,767
No cause for alarm.

239
00:35:11,012 --> 00:35:12,012
We'll find him.

240
00:35:16,017 --> 00:35:17,610
Trust me.

241
00:35:33,034 --> 00:35:34,832
Sam and I own a sawmill.

242
00:35:35,036 --> 00:35:36,800
A lumberyard.

243
00:35:37,271 --> 00:35:40,435
Nothing big,
but enough to feed two families.

244
00:35:42,043 --> 00:35:46,447
I got married first, to Simone,
Sam's sister.

245
00:35:46,814 --> 00:35:48,783
Marc and Sam were my best men.

246
00:35:49,784 --> 00:35:52,811
Jeff's the godfather
of my youngest, Jeremy.

247
00:35:54,055 --> 00:35:56,388
Every year we go on a fishing trip.

248
00:35:56,624 --> 00:35:58,217
Like when we were kids.

249
00:35:59,293 --> 00:36:03,458
We'd been drinking. You know
how it is, with old friends...

250
00:36:04,131 --> 00:36:07,033
Nothing happened.
Just a little quarrel.

251
00:36:08,035 --> 00:36:11,665
Can I be more specific?
Just guys being guys.

252
00:36:11,872 --> 00:36:14,239
I have no idea why he left.

253
00:36:14,475 --> 00:36:16,808
I figured he wanted to sober up.

254
00:36:19,647 --> 00:36:22,640
Sam can be touchy.
He got upset, and then...

255
00:36:23,484 --> 00:36:25,180
Tempers flared and finally,

256
00:36:25,386 --> 00:36:26,820
he stormed out.

257
00:36:35,096 --> 00:36:36,096
OK, everybody.

258
00:36:36,197 --> 00:36:40,328
Gather round, please.
We're going to start.

259
00:36:41,502 --> 00:36:46,338
First of all, thanks for the big
turnout, we really appreciate it.

260
00:36:48,542 --> 00:36:50,542
This is Detective Thibault,
who'll say a few words.

261
00:36:50,878 --> 00:36:52,073
Detective...

262
00:36:52,279 --> 00:36:54,544
We'll form groups of four or five.

263
00:36:55,716 --> 00:36:59,676
Mr Patenaude is a woodsman, so
from experience, I'd say he's hurt.

264
00:37:00,721 --> 00:37:04,055
Team leaders, don't forget
your first aid kits.

265
00:37:04,291 --> 00:37:06,260
Check Jodoin's trailer.

266
00:37:06,394 --> 00:37:07,726
I'm sure he's there.

267
00:37:08,696 --> 00:37:10,221
The guys looked. He's not there.

268
00:37:10,431 --> 00:37:12,195
As kids it was our hangout.

269
00:37:13,367 --> 00:37:14,630
You know.

270
00:37:15,936 --> 00:37:16,936
Tell them!

271
00:37:19,740 --> 00:37:22,232
- Go on, Detective.
- We'll focus on

272
00:37:22,443 --> 00:37:25,538
where he was last seen,
west of the mountain.

273
00:37:27,381 --> 00:37:28,747
Is that right, guys?

274
00:37:39,794 --> 00:37:41,763
Calm down. You look suspicious.

275
00:37:42,496 --> 00:37:44,761
Weren't we stalling for time?

276
00:37:45,499 --> 00:37:49,300
Look, the girls overreacted.
We just have to play along.

277
00:37:49,970 --> 00:37:52,599
They'll realize we weren't here.

278
00:37:59,180 --> 00:38:00,341
Relax.

279
00:38:00,581 --> 00:38:02,140
They won't investigate.

280
00:38:03,417 --> 00:38:07,650
- If they call customs?
- Why would they? He's in the woods.

281
00:38:07,855 --> 00:38:08,948
Everything OK?

282
00:38:09,824 --> 00:38:11,019
Yeah, sure.

283
00:38:11,826 --> 00:38:14,660
Sorry, I need you
to each lead a team.

284
00:38:15,830 --> 00:38:16,957
It's all good.

285
00:38:17,631 --> 00:38:19,964
Come on,
I'll take you to your group.

286
00:38:55,669 --> 00:38:57,638
Did you check the stream?

287
00:38:57,838 --> 00:38:59,397
Yeah, I think so.

288
00:38:59,907 --> 00:39:02,172
- You think so?
- I dunno, Bea.

289
00:39:02,376 --> 00:39:04,743
- It was dark.
- Even so...

290
00:39:04,979 --> 00:39:07,175
You would've heard the stream.

291
00:39:08,249 --> 00:39:09,410
Maybe, but...

292
00:39:11,485 --> 00:39:13,147
What did you fight about?

293
00:39:13,687 --> 00:39:17,988
Sam started to rag us. We were soused,
having fun, and suddenly,

294
00:39:18,192 --> 00:39:21,424
- he didn't feel so hot.
- I bet. Gimme a break.

295
00:39:21,896 --> 00:39:23,421
What happened?

296
00:39:28,235 --> 00:39:29,863
Look me in the eyes.

297
00:39:31,505 --> 00:39:34,441
I know you. You're hiding something.

298
00:39:36,510 --> 00:39:38,376
Look, Bea...

299
00:39:39,513 --> 00:39:41,072
We behaved like jerks.

300
00:39:44,285 --> 00:39:47,881
You fought about the loan, right?
I knew it.

301
00:39:49,089 --> 00:39:51,456
That's right. It was about my debt.

302
00:39:52,092 --> 00:39:55,085
With the renovations,
I'm behind. Sam's mad.

303
00:39:55,296 --> 00:39:57,788
I'll be glad when that's over with.

304
00:39:58,032 --> 00:40:00,900
Me too. It'll be behind us soon.

305
00:40:01,735 --> 00:40:02,896
I promise.

306
00:40:06,106 --> 00:40:08,268
Let's get back to the others.

307
00:40:22,323 --> 00:40:24,258
Ask for Martine at the bank.

308
00:40:25,960 --> 00:40:27,929
I'll call you next week.

309
00:40:29,964 --> 00:40:31,091
Right.

310
00:40:31,966 --> 00:40:33,298
Thank you, Mr Paquette.

311
00:40:41,976 --> 00:40:43,239
He called me.

312
00:40:45,579 --> 00:40:46,579
When?

313
00:40:46,747 --> 00:40:48,739
While you were fishing.

314
00:40:51,986 --> 00:40:53,420
What did he say?

315
00:40:53,621 --> 00:40:55,487
Did you tell him about us?

316
00:40:55,689 --> 00:40:56,952
Of course not.

317
00:40:57,591 --> 00:40:58,957
No way!

318
00:41:00,361 --> 00:41:02,330
I haven't told anyone.

319
00:41:04,164 --> 00:41:07,328
Shit, why did we do it?

320
00:41:15,609 --> 00:41:17,134
I'm pregnant, Jeff.

321
00:41:35,396 --> 00:41:36,557
I know.

322
00:41:38,632 --> 00:41:39,998
He told you?

323
00:41:41,835 --> 00:41:44,236
I'm sure that's why he took off.

324
00:41:49,643 --> 00:41:51,305
How many weeks?

325
00:41:56,050 --> 00:41:57,382
Sam's the father.

326
00:42:01,355 --> 00:42:03,017
I'm sure it's his.

327
00:42:07,661 --> 00:42:09,095
Isn't it strange that...

328
00:42:09,329 --> 00:42:11,264
Jeff, please.

329
00:43:22,736 --> 00:43:23,736
Hi, Noémie.

330
00:43:24,605 --> 00:43:26,403
Sorry, we're late.

331
00:43:29,443 --> 00:43:30,934
- Everything OK?
- Sure.

332
00:43:31,245 --> 00:43:32,941
Cathy said she was cold upstairs.

333
00:43:37,017 --> 00:43:38,781
We have to insulate.

334
00:43:38,986 --> 00:43:42,013
- Winter's coming.
- I know, I'm on it.

335
00:43:46,627 --> 00:43:48,425
- Do you have any cash?
- Sure.

336
00:43:49,263 --> 00:43:50,595
- Thanks.
- Bye.

337
00:43:52,866 --> 00:43:54,425
1, 2, 3... Here.

338
00:43:55,936 --> 00:43:56,936
Where's this from?

339
00:43:58,539 --> 00:43:59,700
This?

340
00:43:59,840 --> 00:44:01,001
It's nothing.

341
00:44:01,608 --> 00:44:02,974
- Thanks.
- Bye.

342
00:44:03,143 --> 00:44:04,202
Say hi to your parents.

343
00:44:11,285 --> 00:44:13,618
Come, I'll put you to bed.

344
00:44:31,305 --> 00:44:32,398
My baby.

345
00:44:53,894 --> 00:44:55,157
I'm off.

346
00:44:55,529 --> 00:44:57,088
You're going back now?

347
00:44:59,333 --> 00:45:01,199
We start early tomorrow.

348
00:45:05,105 --> 00:45:06,869
What's wrong?

349
00:45:07,908 --> 00:45:10,002
I don't want to become like them.

350
00:45:10,911 --> 00:45:12,709
- Like who?
- Jeff and Simone...

351
00:45:12,913 --> 00:45:15,439
Sam who's always sniping
at Madeleine.

352
00:45:18,719 --> 00:45:20,585
We're not like them, Bea.

353
00:45:28,362 --> 00:45:31,799
- I have to go.
- I know but, I need a cuddle.

354
00:45:33,634 --> 00:45:34,634
You!

355
00:45:35,569 --> 00:45:36,901
Well...

356
00:45:59,159 --> 00:46:00,159
Here.

357
00:46:00,294 --> 00:46:01,728
I stopped taking them.

358
00:46:02,763 --> 00:46:05,323
- Why?
- I need a clear head.

359
00:46:05,766 --> 00:46:06,927
Come on.

360
00:46:07,167 --> 00:46:10,001
We have to tell Julie
her uncle's missing.

361
00:46:12,172 --> 00:46:13,800
Let's not upset her.

362
00:46:14,007 --> 00:46:17,774
- She has her mid-terms.
- Don't worry, I'll do it.

363
00:46:17,978 --> 00:46:21,506
No reason to involve everyone.
We'll find him soon.

364
00:46:21,748 --> 00:46:23,580
Why'd you let him leave?

365
00:46:24,785 --> 00:46:26,253
What were you thinking?

366
00:47:32,419 --> 00:47:36,857
<i>We said you're lost in the woods.
Nake sure you let your beard grow.</i>

367
00:48:16,096 --> 00:48:17,096
<i>Hello?</i>

368
00:48:18,298 --> 00:48:19,459
<i>Nadeleine?</i>

369
00:48:30,911 --> 00:48:33,278
Sam, it's me.

370
00:48:35,148 --> 00:48:36,377
<i>Why are you there?</i>

371
00:48:37,117 --> 00:48:40,713
We're all at the cottage.
We said you got lost.

372
00:48:41,755 --> 00:48:44,725
The cops are here. It's no joke.

373
00:48:45,125 --> 00:48:47,287
The whole village is worried sick.

374
00:48:47,561 --> 00:48:49,723
Let's not make things worse.

375
00:48:49,930 --> 00:48:51,296
<i>Where's Nadeleine?</i>

376
00:48:53,333 --> 00:48:54,733
She's sleeping.

377
00:48:55,335 --> 00:48:56,735
On the sofa.

378
00:48:56,937 --> 00:48:59,497
<i>Wake her up. I want to talk to her.</i>

379
00:49:00,140 --> 00:49:03,110
You'll talk to her when you're back, OK?

380
00:49:04,344 --> 00:49:06,745
- It'll all work out.
<i>- No, it won't.</i>

381
00:49:06,947 --> 00:49:08,745
<i>The baby's not mine.</i>

382
00:50:04,304 --> 00:50:05,363
Hi.

383
00:50:13,380 --> 00:50:15,246
I was just saying.

384
00:50:15,515 --> 00:50:18,713
He stopped gambling.
He's paying off his loan.

385
00:50:20,253 --> 00:50:21,653
What's up?

386
00:50:21,855 --> 00:50:24,415
I was explaining your fight
with Sam.

387
00:50:25,892 --> 00:50:27,224
Why didn't you tell me?

388
00:50:27,727 --> 00:50:30,526
Well, 'cause... there's nothing to say.

389
00:50:30,730 --> 00:50:32,699
I pay off my loan monthly.

390
00:50:33,700 --> 00:50:35,862
Jeff endorsed the loan at the bank.

391
00:50:37,237 --> 00:50:38,603
Mind if we check?

392
00:50:39,706 --> 00:50:41,265
No problem. Right, Jeff?

393
00:50:46,713 --> 00:50:47,713
Perfect.

394
00:50:50,717 --> 00:50:52,242
OK, everybody!

395
00:50:52,619 --> 00:50:54,247
You're fewer today.

396
00:50:55,088 --> 00:50:57,887
So you have to be
even more vigilant.

397
00:50:58,858 --> 00:51:01,293
Why not just say
I smashed his skull?

398
00:51:01,528 --> 00:51:04,293
I said the first thing
that occurred to me.

399
00:51:04,531 --> 00:51:08,195
Fuck! Don't go putting ideas
into their head!

400
00:51:17,544 --> 00:51:19,706
I want my life the way it was.

401
00:51:24,751 --> 00:51:26,481
That's not going to happen.

402
00:51:28,555 --> 00:51:30,080
What do you mean?

403
00:51:31,391 --> 00:51:34,225
Look at us, Marco.
What are we doing?

404
00:51:36,396 --> 00:51:38,262
We're sticking to the plan.

405
00:51:38,798 --> 00:51:40,323
We should tell them.

406
00:51:41,234 --> 00:51:43,465
Shit, tell them what?

407
00:51:43,670 --> 00:51:45,161
The truth.

408
00:51:45,405 --> 00:51:46,634
The truth?

409
00:51:47,073 --> 00:51:48,097
What truth, Jeff?

410
00:51:48,775 --> 00:51:51,768
""Sorry, girls,
but we were lying to you.

411
00:51:51,978 --> 00:51:57,110
We went to Amsterdam to screw around
and get high. Sam's still there.""

412
00:51:57,584 --> 00:52:00,110
I'd love to see Simone's face
when she hears.

413
00:52:05,158 --> 00:52:06,524
Your truth means...

414
00:52:08,161 --> 00:52:10,756
I'd see my kids every second weekend.

415
00:52:15,001 --> 00:52:16,970
I don't want to lose Béatrice.

416
00:52:17,370 --> 00:52:20,340
I'm lucky she's still here
after all I've done.

417
00:52:22,609 --> 00:52:23,770
I know.

418
00:52:29,182 --> 00:52:30,878
We have to play the game.

419
00:52:31,484 --> 00:52:32,543
We've no choice.

420
00:53:03,583 --> 00:53:06,382
We'll stop here.
We're beyond the perimeter.

421
00:53:07,053 --> 00:53:08,385
Simone, come back!

422
00:53:08,822 --> 00:53:12,657
- Have you gone crazy?
- Don't call me crazy!

423
00:53:15,228 --> 00:53:18,027
Am I the only one
who wants to find him?

424
00:53:34,247 --> 00:53:36,216
How can we break his ankle?

425
00:53:38,084 --> 00:53:40,576
Take it easy.
We're not gonna break it,

426
00:53:40,787 --> 00:53:42,221
just sprain it.

427
00:53:45,458 --> 00:53:46,858
Is it dirty enough?

428
00:53:55,101 --> 00:53:57,229
Will they buy that he stayed here?

429
00:53:58,905 --> 00:54:00,237
If he's wounded...

430
00:54:01,741 --> 00:54:03,209
We actually pulled it off.

431
00:54:04,277 --> 00:54:06,769
Tomorrow it'll all be over.

432
00:54:06,913 --> 00:54:09,246
Good job, dude. Come on.

433
00:54:18,925 --> 00:54:21,724
Noémie's going to sleep over tonight.

434
00:54:21,928 --> 00:54:25,092
- And tomorrow?
- My mom will fill in, OK?

435
00:54:26,933 --> 00:54:28,799
I was just asking. Jeez!

436
00:54:34,140 --> 00:54:35,768
What's going on, Marco?

437
00:54:38,745 --> 00:54:39,838
Nothing.

438
00:54:44,517 --> 00:54:46,748
The card was declined at the store.

439
00:54:49,155 --> 00:54:51,681
Darnit, I forgot to pay this month.

440
00:55:03,536 --> 00:55:04,629
How you doing?

441
00:55:14,214 --> 00:55:17,446
He knows the area
like the back of his hand.

442
00:55:19,986 --> 00:55:21,511
He's either hurt,

443
00:55:22,355 --> 00:55:23,948
or gone.

444
00:55:26,125 --> 00:55:27,787
With the weather getting colder...

445
00:55:33,566 --> 00:55:35,159
I meant, with the baby.

446
00:55:48,381 --> 00:55:50,350
You started gambling again.

447
00:55:54,220 --> 00:55:56,348
We'll get through this together.

448
00:55:57,390 --> 00:55:59,552
We've seen worse. Right, baby?

449
00:56:01,594 --> 00:56:03,358
We have a great family.

450
00:56:04,063 --> 00:56:08,262
Nothing and no one
is going to destroy it, OK?

451
00:56:15,942 --> 00:56:17,774
I'm not an idiot.

452
00:56:20,046 --> 00:56:21,046
I know it's mine.

453
00:56:21,080 --> 00:56:22,080
Look...

454
00:56:23,249 --> 00:56:25,946
We did something stupid, one night.

455
00:56:27,053 --> 00:56:29,045
But now...

456
00:56:29,255 --> 00:56:33,784
I was stupid not to invite you
to the prom before him.

457
00:56:38,264 --> 00:56:39,562
What do you mean?

458
00:56:48,875 --> 00:56:50,605
Goddamn shitty day!

459
00:56:55,882 --> 00:56:57,817
What? Did I piss in your punch?

460
00:57:05,291 --> 00:57:07,419
I'm going to bed. G'night.

461
00:57:09,662 --> 00:57:10,823
Good night.

462
00:57:16,903 --> 00:57:18,428
What did I do?

463
00:57:18,905 --> 00:57:20,066
Nothing.

464
00:57:21,307 --> 00:57:22,639
Forget it.

465
00:57:53,940 --> 00:57:55,670
He's out there somewhere.

466
00:57:57,343 --> 00:57:59,676
We'll find him, Simone.

467
00:58:01,514 --> 00:58:04,313
When he's upset,
he goes off and pouts.

468
00:58:06,152 --> 00:58:08,883
He always comes back.
You know that.

469
00:58:11,157 --> 00:58:13,126
Close the window, it's cold.

470
00:58:17,530 --> 00:58:19,123
Come to bed.

471
00:58:19,966 --> 00:58:21,457
I'm beat.

472
00:58:23,970 --> 00:58:25,233
Yeah, right.

473
00:58:57,270 --> 00:58:58,898
<i>Help!</i>

474
00:59:28,301 --> 00:59:29,929
Simone's not with you?

475
00:59:42,248 --> 00:59:44,808
She can't go
looking in the trailer!

476
00:59:45,051 --> 00:59:48,112
Leave her to me. Stick to the plan.
You pick him up.

477
00:59:48,321 --> 00:59:50,984
I'll say you had work.

478
00:59:52,458 --> 00:59:54,586
- Did you see Simone?
- She's not inside?

479
00:59:56,996 --> 00:59:58,430
Jeff!

480
01:00:08,641 --> 01:00:10,234
Did we forget anything?

481
01:00:11,277 --> 01:00:14,008
Marco! Jeff! Come on! It's Simone!

482
01:00:15,281 --> 01:00:16,442
Shit.

483
01:00:17,083 --> 01:00:18,608
We stick to the plan.

484
01:00:27,593 --> 01:00:28,925
Girls!

485
01:00:29,128 --> 01:00:30,824
What's going on?

486
01:00:41,674 --> 01:00:42,835
Down there!

487
01:01:39,165 --> 01:01:41,657
<i>Uh, no. Nr Nasson?</i>

488
01:01:42,168 --> 01:01:43,168
Yes.

489
01:01:43,369 --> 01:01:46,533
<i>This is Nadine Cousineau
from Citibank Visa.</i>

490
01:01:46,739 --> 01:01:49,106
<i>Did you leave the country recently?</i>

491
01:01:49,942 --> 01:01:51,376
No, why?

492
01:01:51,577 --> 01:01:55,878
<i>Your company credit card
may have been used fraudulently.</i>

493
01:01:57,516 --> 01:01:59,451
Fucking hell!

494
01:01:59,585 --> 01:02:00,917
<i>Nr Nasson?</i>

495
01:02:02,755 --> 01:02:07,352
- What happened?
<i>- Someone in Amsterdam withdrew $1000.</i>

496
01:02:09,729 --> 01:02:10,753
<i>Nr Nasson?</i>

497
01:02:15,735 --> 01:02:17,863
Mommy, I'm bored.

498
01:02:18,971 --> 01:02:20,940
Daddy will be here soon.

499
01:02:22,975 --> 01:02:25,376
What's keeping him so long?

500
01:02:32,418 --> 01:02:33,579
Mr Décarie?

501
01:02:37,056 --> 01:02:38,581
How is she?

502
01:02:38,991 --> 01:02:40,755
She's out of danger.

503
01:02:42,094 --> 01:02:45,087
She suffered a hip fracture
and a slight concussion.

504
01:02:45,798 --> 01:02:47,232
Can we see her?

505
01:02:47,433 --> 01:02:50,164
Not just yet. She needs to rest.

506
01:02:51,237 --> 01:02:53,638
- What's going on?
- Where were you?

507
01:02:53,839 --> 01:02:56,900
- We almost lost her.
- You're not serious?

508
01:03:01,280 --> 01:03:03,579
She has a concussion and a broken hip.

509
01:03:04,417 --> 01:03:05,942
What if we hadn't found her?

510
01:03:06,152 --> 01:03:09,281
She's in good hands here.

511
01:03:09,455 --> 01:03:11,447
How did she fall?

512
01:03:13,426 --> 01:03:15,088
Will he be OK?

513
01:03:22,268 --> 01:03:23,793
Jeff, listen.

514
01:03:24,270 --> 01:03:26,637
I waited two hours.
He wasn't there.

515
01:03:27,673 --> 01:03:30,040
You get it? He just withdrew $1000!

516
01:03:30,276 --> 01:03:31,801
Simone nearly died.

517
01:03:32,478 --> 01:03:33,810
Because of us.

518
01:03:40,486 --> 01:03:41,920
Marco...

519
01:03:42,054 --> 01:03:42,851
What?

520
01:03:43,055 --> 01:03:45,047
I have to tell you something.

521
01:03:45,691 --> 01:03:47,819
But promise to keep it to yourself.

522
01:03:48,694 --> 01:03:50,026
Yeah, sure.

523
01:03:58,504 --> 01:04:00,666
I got Madeleine pregnant.

524
01:04:07,079 --> 01:04:08,672
You're kidding me.

525
01:04:14,887 --> 01:04:17,186
When? When did you do it?

526
01:04:17,890 --> 01:04:21,258
The week you were both
logging up north.

527
01:04:24,530 --> 01:04:27,022
How could you do it, shit?

528
01:04:28,534 --> 01:04:30,264
We just did.

529
01:04:36,542 --> 01:04:38,704
Bravo, you fuck!

530
01:04:41,380 --> 01:04:44,544
All this bullshit is your fault!

531
01:04:44,750 --> 01:04:46,878
I told you
because you're my friend.

532
01:04:47,753 --> 01:04:49,619
I couldn't keep it in anymore.

533
01:04:49,922 --> 01:04:52,289
No, it's so I'll take your side.

534
01:04:52,925 --> 01:04:56,089
Why didn't you tell me before?

535
01:05:02,768 --> 01:05:06,102
You ruined our lives
for a roll in the hay!

536
01:05:11,777 --> 01:05:13,109
I love her.

537
01:05:17,917 --> 01:05:20,546
Jesus fucking Christ...

538
01:06:08,367 --> 01:06:12,031
<i>We are starting our approach to Nontreal.</i>

539
01:06:13,038 --> 01:06:15,872
<i>The ground temperature is -16° C.</i>

540
01:06:16,709 --> 01:06:21,511
<i>Thank you for flying with us.
Happy holidays to you all.</i>

541
01:08:31,577 --> 01:08:32,738
Madeleine?

542
01:10:07,673 --> 01:10:09,005
Stop running.

543
01:10:12,177 --> 01:10:14,840
I never thought
it could happen to me.

544
01:10:15,047 --> 01:10:18,677
Like, the dumb cliché:
""The love of my life.""

545
01:10:19,051 --> 01:10:21,748
Well, bang! It hit me too.

546
01:10:21,954 --> 01:10:23,855
I'm so happy for you.

547
01:10:24,256 --> 01:10:25,256
Name's Philippe.

548
01:10:26,058 --> 01:10:28,618
Julie, you're 17.

549
01:10:29,061 --> 01:10:31,087
- So what?
- If it's true,

550
01:10:31,296 --> 01:10:33,856
you've got at least
50 years with him.

551
01:10:34,066 --> 01:10:36,626
- Mom...
- 50 years is a long time.

552
01:10:42,074 --> 01:10:46,068
As I was saying, I met him in class in...

553
01:10:48,480 --> 01:10:49,880
Another.

554
01:11:43,969 --> 01:11:49,101
I know we open our presents tomorrow,
but I have a little surprise for us.

555
01:11:52,544 --> 01:11:54,103
Merry Christmas, <i>mi amor.</i>

556
01:11:59,785 --> 01:12:02,311
You'll have to shop for a swimsuit.

557
01:12:02,521 --> 01:12:07,323
- We'll roast our pina coladas.
- Marco, I'm so happy!

558
01:12:07,559 --> 01:12:09,027
Thank you, my love!

559
01:12:22,574 --> 01:12:24,008
BUSINESS FOR SALE: SOLD

560
01:12:47,533 --> 01:12:49,729
No, don't.

561
01:12:50,602 --> 01:12:52,571
I'll have a white wine.

562
01:15:42,374 --> 01:15:45,037
Don't touch or talk to her.
Understand?

563
01:15:45,243 --> 01:15:47,405
- Relax.
- Your wife is in there!

564
01:15:47,612 --> 01:15:49,240
And your daughter! Everyone!

565
01:15:49,448 --> 01:15:52,680
- Stay away from her!
- I just wanted to dance.

566
01:15:52,884 --> 01:15:55,410
We got lucky with the cops.

567
01:15:55,620 --> 01:15:57,748
Don't screw things up!

568
01:16:05,797 --> 01:16:07,231
You got a problem, bud?

569
01:16:14,606 --> 01:16:16,438
What's going on?

570
01:16:16,641 --> 01:16:18,974
- Nothing. We're fine.
- It's cool.

571
01:16:19,745 --> 01:16:21,577
I'm glad you two are talking.

572
01:16:23,415 --> 01:16:25,782
It's Christmas, after all.

573
01:16:26,885 --> 01:16:28,376
Right.

574
01:16:28,820 --> 01:16:31,619
Come inside.
We're going to toast Sam.

575
01:16:31,823 --> 01:16:33,382
I'll just finish this.

576
01:16:36,828 --> 01:16:39,627
Wake up!
I won't let you ruin my life.

577
01:16:39,831 --> 01:16:41,800
You bet, old man.

578
01:18:05,817 --> 01:18:08,651
Thanks for the lift.

579
01:18:09,487 --> 01:18:10,487
Our pleasure.

580
01:18:12,157 --> 01:18:14,717
Next year, you'll dance too,
Simone.

581
01:18:14,926 --> 01:18:16,326
Yeah, sure.

582
01:18:16,728 --> 01:18:18,594
Bye, Auntie. See you tomorrow?

583
01:18:18,830 --> 01:18:19,830
Yup...

584
01:18:20,732 --> 01:18:21,893
See you tomorrow.

585
01:18:49,527 --> 01:18:50,620
Hello?

586
01:19:30,802 --> 01:19:32,168
Anybody there?

587
01:19:38,443 --> 01:19:39,638
Who's there?

588
01:20:03,034 --> 01:20:05,196
I thought you were dead.

589
01:20:07,639 --> 01:20:09,198
With my best friend.

590
01:20:23,288 --> 01:20:25,223
I'm pregnant and you abandoned me.

591
01:20:33,865 --> 01:20:35,458
What did you expect?

592
01:20:37,669 --> 01:20:40,036
I'd pretend nothing happened?

593
01:20:45,343 --> 01:20:46,470
Do you know

594
01:20:46,878 --> 01:20:49,507
how many nights
I spent waiting for you?

595
01:20:49,681 --> 01:20:51,206
It's not mine, fuck!

596
01:20:56,521 --> 01:20:57,521
Sam...

597
01:21:04,863 --> 01:21:06,832
When did it happen?

598
01:21:08,366 --> 01:21:10,028
When did you betray me?

599
01:21:15,874 --> 01:21:19,242
While... you stopped
looking at me, Sam.

600
01:21:21,880 --> 01:21:24,907
So everything we said was bullshit?

601
01:21:26,684 --> 01:21:29,244
- The adoption, tests, doctors...
- Where were you?

602
01:21:35,894 --> 01:21:37,055
Where were you?

603
01:21:40,698 --> 01:21:42,064
Where?

604
01:21:43,968 --> 01:21:45,266
Where?

605
01:21:52,911 --> 01:21:54,277
Amsterdam.

606
01:22:36,354 --> 01:22:37,913
Come on, kiddos!

607
01:22:38,123 --> 01:22:40,115
I need help cutting the tree!

608
01:22:46,698 --> 01:22:48,792
Mom, you need to rest.

609
01:22:49,200 --> 01:22:51,294
I won't stay in bed all my life.

610
01:22:51,870 --> 01:22:54,772
The doctor said to take it easy.

611
01:22:55,306 --> 01:22:57,070
Julie, get off my back.

612
01:22:57,208 --> 01:22:59,234
Be reasonable. Lie down.

613
01:22:59,377 --> 01:23:00,606
I'll bring your coffee.

614
01:23:01,613 --> 01:23:03,138
Let her help you.

615
01:23:04,983 --> 01:23:06,975
- I don't need help.
- Mom...

616
01:23:07,619 --> 01:23:09,952
Especially not your dad
and his pity!

617
01:23:20,632 --> 01:23:21,964
I'm sorry.

618
01:23:22,800 --> 01:23:24,166
All this...

619
01:23:25,203 --> 01:23:26,569
It's my fault.

620
01:23:29,007 --> 01:23:31,169
The perfect father!

621
01:23:38,216 --> 01:23:39,377
You disgust me.

622
01:23:44,022 --> 01:23:45,581
Where are you going?

623
01:23:48,026 --> 01:23:49,585
To buy cigarettes.

624
01:23:50,228 --> 01:23:51,856
Think I'm stupid?

625
01:23:55,033 --> 01:23:57,229
- Tell the truth for once!
- Stop.

626
01:23:58,369 --> 01:23:59,701
Go on, tell your daughter!

627
01:23:59,837 --> 01:24:02,204
- Want me to tell the truth?
- Yes.

628
01:24:02,407 --> 01:24:06,208
Every morning since Julie moved out,
I wonder why I stay.

629
01:24:10,248 --> 01:24:11,546
Yeah, right.

630
01:24:12,617 --> 01:24:15,018
Next you'll beg my forgiveness.

631
01:25:51,949 --> 01:25:54,942
We'll find an even bigger one
than last year.

632
01:25:55,153 --> 01:25:58,146
Chanel's dad got an artificial one.

633
01:25:58,356 --> 01:26:00,951
It's cold.
I want to play on the computer!

634
01:26:01,159 --> 01:26:04,357
Quit griping. It's Christmas,
you need fresh air.

635
01:26:04,562 --> 01:26:05,894
Go on, get in.

636
01:26:08,166 --> 01:26:09,532
You too, sweetie.

637
01:26:10,168 --> 01:26:12,535
Buckle up your brother.
OK.

638
01:26:25,817 --> 01:26:27,479
What's wrong?

639
01:26:27,685 --> 01:26:30,678
Dad's going to cut the tree
with Uncle Jeff.

640
01:26:30,888 --> 01:26:33,858
- How come?
- He said it won't take long.

641
01:26:34,392 --> 01:26:35,985
What now?

642
01:28:06,083 --> 01:28:08,814
To: Marc & Jeff
From: Santa

643
01:28:40,318 --> 01:28:41,684
Like a beer, guys?

644
01:29:16,153 --> 01:29:18,520
Sit down.
Make yourselves comfortable.

645
01:29:31,369 --> 01:29:32,894
Have you been back long?

646
01:29:34,372 --> 01:29:36,773
30 years we're friends.
You realize?

647
01:29:40,578 --> 01:29:44,345
Look, Sam, it hasn't been easy
for us here either.

648
01:29:46,017 --> 01:29:47,747
You really screwed us.

649
01:29:48,619 --> 01:29:51,555
Amsterdam only worked
if we stuck together.

650
01:29:53,791 --> 01:29:54,952
30 years.

651
01:29:55,860 --> 01:29:57,556
You were gone two months.

652
01:29:58,396 --> 01:29:59,955
We did what we could.

653
01:30:04,201 --> 01:30:05,201
Sure.

654
01:30:06,203 --> 01:30:07,728
Your renovations, great.

655
01:30:09,607 --> 01:30:10,870
I did nothing wrong.

656
01:30:12,043 --> 01:30:13,978
How else could I support my family?

657
01:30:14,812 --> 01:30:17,372
You were blowing company money
in Amsterdam.

658
01:30:19,417 --> 01:30:21,079
I had to sell.

659
01:30:22,420 --> 01:30:24,787
That's alright, Marco.
I understand.

660
01:30:28,225 --> 01:30:29,625
I'm sorry, buddy.

661
01:30:30,428 --> 01:30:31,794
That's alright.

662
01:30:32,830 --> 01:30:33,830
Yeah.

663
01:30:39,637 --> 01:30:42,163
It hurt to see the mill closed.

664
01:30:46,310 --> 01:30:47,403
It was our dream, remember?

665
01:30:53,451 --> 01:30:55,818
So much happens in two months.

666
01:30:57,455 --> 01:30:58,821
But there's one thing...

667
01:31:00,257 --> 01:31:02,624
I couldn't stop thinking about.

668
01:31:03,127 --> 01:31:04,186
Look, Sam...

669
01:31:05,463 --> 01:31:07,830
Who got my wife pregnant?

670
01:31:21,278 --> 01:31:22,644
Where's Madeleine?

671
01:31:26,684 --> 01:31:28,448
What do you want me to do?

672
01:31:30,121 --> 01:31:31,214
Say I'm sorry?

673
01:31:31,689 --> 01:31:35,649
Yeah, apologize.
All this crap is your fault.

674
01:31:36,293 --> 01:31:38,455
You know, if I did it,

675
01:31:40,131 --> 01:31:41,463
it's 'cause...

676
01:31:42,133 --> 01:31:43,658
'Cause why?

677
01:31:46,203 --> 01:31:48,069
Just say you're sorry.
Now's the time.

678
01:31:51,709 --> 01:31:53,678
I wanted to take her to the prom.

679
01:31:57,515 --> 01:31:59,074
She's my wife, Jeff.

680
01:32:01,152 --> 01:32:02,677
You slept with my wife.

681
01:32:11,896 --> 01:32:13,489
The baby's mine.

682
01:32:17,168 --> 01:32:18,261
I know.

683
01:32:23,941 --> 01:32:25,500
I can't have kids.

684
01:32:29,346 --> 01:32:32,111
But you know how much
I wanted to be a dad.

685
01:32:49,967 --> 01:32:51,128
I'm sorry.

686
01:33:04,381 --> 01:33:06,077
Where's Madeleine?

687
01:33:06,283 --> 01:33:07,546
She's gone.

688
01:33:09,386 --> 01:33:10,547
Gone where?

689
01:33:12,590 --> 01:33:14,752
The truth was too much for her.

690
01:33:16,460 --> 01:33:18,759
- What did you tell her?
- Everything.

691
01:33:18,963 --> 01:33:21,558
Amsterdam, the drugs, the girls.
Everything.

692
01:33:22,233 --> 01:33:24,327
Christ, she'll tell everyone.

693
01:33:25,736 --> 01:33:27,170
No, I don't think so.

694
01:33:28,005 --> 01:33:29,337
She just left.

695
01:33:30,608 --> 01:33:32,008
She was furious.

696
01:33:38,415 --> 01:33:39,974
What were you hoping?

697
01:33:41,252 --> 01:33:42,777
She'd leave with you?

698
01:33:51,262 --> 01:33:52,662
There's only one solution.

699
01:33:55,266 --> 01:33:56,962
We get in the car and go.

700
01:33:57,635 --> 01:33:58,830
What? Go where?

701
01:33:59,036 --> 01:34:00,368
Christmas dinner.

702
01:34:02,439 --> 01:34:03,805
And we tell them.

703
01:34:05,042 --> 01:34:06,374
Like men.

704
01:34:06,644 --> 01:34:10,945
The return of the Messiah on Christmas?
No one will buy it.

705
01:34:11,148 --> 01:34:12,616
Why not?

706
01:34:12,817 --> 01:34:15,810
What's the plan?
We buy back the mill?

707
01:34:16,287 --> 01:34:20,156
You two share custody of the kid
with Madeleine?

708
01:34:20,357 --> 01:34:21,882
Gimme a break!

709
01:34:24,295 --> 01:34:25,820
There's another solution.

710
01:34:27,464 --> 01:34:29,160
A lot simpler, too.

711
01:34:44,381 --> 01:34:47,215
- Don't be an idiot!
- Eeny meeny miny moe...

712
01:34:47,418 --> 01:34:48,909
Calm down. Calm down.

713
01:34:50,387 --> 01:34:51,480
Calm down!

714
01:34:54,391 --> 01:34:55,391
Me.

715
01:34:55,693 --> 01:34:57,457
It's OK, Marco.

716
01:34:57,595 --> 01:34:58,927
For once I lose.

717
01:34:59,163 --> 01:35:01,257
- Better for everyone.
- What?

718
01:35:01,498 --> 01:35:03,262
- I'm going.
- Wait.

719
01:35:03,500 --> 01:35:05,901
I'll jump in the lake.
It'll be over.

720
01:35:06,103 --> 01:35:07,503
- Sam, please...
- Get back.

721
01:35:07,705 --> 01:35:09,606
- Calm down.
- I said, back!

722
01:35:09,840 --> 01:35:11,570
- Let's talk.
- Fuck you!

723
01:35:11,775 --> 01:35:13,266
Stop!

724
01:35:20,517 --> 01:35:22,042
It's been fun, guys.

725
01:35:31,295 --> 01:35:32,295
Sam!

726
01:35:33,697 --> 01:35:35,097
What are you doing?

727
01:36:20,511 --> 01:36:21,740
<i>Don't be stupid!</i>

728
01:36:59,616 --> 01:37:00,982
Fuck!

729
01:37:45,662 --> 01:37:48,029
Enough! Enough!

730
01:38:40,317 --> 01:38:42,912
Mommy, when do we open
the presents?

731
01:38:43,420 --> 01:38:44,649
After supper, sweetie.

732
01:38:45,923 --> 01:38:48,085
Still no word from Madeleine?

733
01:38:56,333 --> 01:38:58,666
Make an effort. It's Christmas.

734
01:39:06,743 --> 01:39:08,905
What's wrong, darling?

735
01:39:11,348 --> 01:39:12,680
What's wrong?

736
01:39:15,752 --> 01:39:17,084
Sam's dead.

737
01:39:21,158 --> 01:39:23,684
Of course you're sad he's not here.

738
01:39:24,962 --> 01:39:26,521
I miss him too.

739
01:39:33,770 --> 01:39:36,103
- Are you alright?
- I'll be OK.

740
01:39:37,174 --> 01:39:39,336
- Take a few minutes.
- Sure.

741
01:39:40,177 --> 01:39:41,177
I'm coming.

742
01:39:41,612 --> 01:39:44,548
Supper everybody.
Too bad for Madeleine.

743
01:42:57,541 --> 01:42:59,339
Merry Christmas!

00:05:03,125 --> 00:05:04,525
Nice work!

2
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:06,353
That takes the cake!

3
00:05:08,096 --> 00:05:11,430
Hey, come help me.
Hurry up, we'll carry it together.

4
00:05:53,532 --> 00:05:55,576
What are you daydreaming about?!

5
00:05:58,103 --> 00:05:59,309
Oh, I see.

6
00:05:59,777 --> 00:06:01,200
Lewd things, again.

7
00:06:01,783 --> 00:06:05,083
That's not it,
you uncultivated woman!

8
00:06:05,506 --> 00:06:07,099
Can't you see what this is?

9
00:06:07,441 --> 00:06:09,069
No? Can't you see?

10
00:06:09,341 --> 00:06:11,019
It's a Foujita!

11
00:06:11,549 --> 00:06:14,055
Foujita, the painter!

12
00:06:14,752 --> 00:06:17,063
He sells quite well,
that Japanese fellow.

13
00:06:17,191 --> 00:06:20,067
This painting is well known, too.
Kiki is his model.

14
00:06:20,151 --> 00:06:22,367
- Who?
- Kiki, I'm telling you!

15
00:06:23,754 --> 00:06:25,490
Come, I'll show you something.

16
00:06:31,653 --> 00:06:32,780
Stop that!

17
00:06:32,854 --> 00:06:34,254
Don't move!

18
00:06:34,665 --> 00:06:36,327
I'll give you Kiki's eyes.

19
00:06:36,467 --> 00:06:38,800
They call her
the Queen of Montparnasse.

20
00:06:43,341 --> 00:06:46,834
Back when she had no money,
she'd use matches to do her make-up.

21
00:06:47,530 --> 00:06:49,240
Look at me now.

22
00:06:51,610 --> 00:06:53,270
How beautiful!

23
00:06:53,823 --> 00:06:56,745
I don't want to look like a whore!

24
00:08:00,341 --> 00:08:03,175
Master, Kiki has been delivered.

25
00:08:05,180 --> 00:08:06,739
Some wind today, huh?

26
00:08:06,844 --> 00:08:08,779
Master, what's wrong with you?

27
00:08:08,879 --> 00:08:10,733
Wait, wait, wait!

28
00:08:10,848 --> 00:08:12,564
Here's your receipt.

29
00:08:13,016 --> 00:08:16,618
Master, what are you doing?
What's the matter?

30
00:08:38,066 --> 00:08:40,360
<i>Oishii saké-san.</i>

31
00:08:45,794 --> 00:08:48,764
Your Japanese pronunciation
is very good.

32
00:08:49,113 --> 00:08:51,514
But that is not a Japanese name.

33
00:08:52,301 --> 00:08:55,032
It means ""the good saké.""

34
00:08:55,237 --> 00:08:57,399
No! Is that so?

35
00:08:58,507 --> 00:08:59,668
That's weird.

36
00:09:00,893 --> 00:09:02,452
You know, about my painting,

37
00:09:02,845 --> 00:09:04,814
the first buyer was Japanese.

38
00:09:05,648 --> 00:09:07,139
And that was his name.

39
00:09:07,993 --> 00:09:09,812
I remember it perfectly.

40
00:09:13,464 --> 00:09:14,591
Oshi.

41
00:09:15,124 --> 00:09:16,319
Sakai.

42
00:09:17,393 --> 00:09:19,362
That name exists.

43
00:09:21,808 --> 00:09:23,572
<i>Oishii saké.</i>

44
00:09:24,126 --> 00:09:25,933
Yes, that's it.

45
00:09:33,961 --> 00:09:35,542
But, Fernande,

46
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:41,035
you don't paint anymore?
Did you stop?

47
00:09:42,351 --> 00:09:43,788
It's not that...

48
00:09:44,622 --> 00:09:45,932
I don't paint anymore.

49
00:09:47,624 --> 00:09:48,672
Why?

50
00:09:50,059 --> 00:09:51,789
No, it's nothing.

51
00:09:55,177 --> 00:09:56,844
You can paint here if you want.

52
00:09:57,712 --> 00:09:59,439
I reckon it's not
the most comfortable.

53
00:10:04,429 --> 00:10:06,426
I will sell your paintings,
you know.

54
00:10:07,764 --> 00:10:09,136
You must apply yourself.

55
00:10:31,662 --> 00:10:33,858
You've forbidden me
to enter your studio.

56
00:10:34,048 --> 00:10:36,089
You see?
I keep my promises.

57
00:10:42,019 --> 00:10:43,988
It's bad faith on your part.

58
00:10:44,308 --> 00:10:47,676
You say I'm free,
that I can do what I desire,

59
00:10:48,245 --> 00:10:49,839
but you come out on top.

60
00:10:50,290 --> 00:10:52,391
In the end, I come out a slut.

61
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:55,889
Is that what you wanted?

62
00:10:56,993 --> 00:10:58,007
Very well.

63
00:10:59,928 --> 00:11:01,314
You're wrong.

64
00:11:02,130 --> 00:11:04,865
I don't force you to do anything,
you don't force me either.

65
00:11:05,782 --> 00:11:07,273
We each make our choices.

66
00:11:07,486 --> 00:11:11,479
The stairs of life
can be taken a step at a time.

67
00:11:35,446 --> 00:11:38,294
Selling your paintings
made you really arrogant.

68
00:11:40,568 --> 00:11:42,424
Did you forget
who made you successful?

69
00:11:42,685 --> 00:11:44,604
Did you forget everything
I did for you?

70
00:11:58,579 --> 00:12:01,912
And remember who showed you
how a French girl kisses!

71
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:29,621
Fou-fou!

72
00:12:30,867 --> 00:12:32,086
Where are you going?

73
00:12:33,443 --> 00:12:35,263
Do you know where van Dongen is?

74
00:12:36,316 --> 00:12:37,841
At <i>La Rotonde.</i>

75
00:12:40,854 --> 00:12:42,416
But, it's on the other side.

76
00:12:45,836 --> 00:12:47,162
Yes, yes.

77
00:12:47,387 --> 00:12:48,681
I know.

78
00:13:05,315 --> 00:13:07,459
Hot wine!

79
00:13:09,195 --> 00:13:11,187
Get your hot wine!

80
00:13:18,198 --> 00:13:19,830
Hot wine!

81
00:13:46,123 --> 00:13:47,850
Good evening, daddy Libion.

82
00:13:49,048 --> 00:13:50,853
Today I posed for Man.

83
00:13:52,281 --> 00:13:53,715
He's good looking, Man.

84
00:13:53,908 --> 00:13:55,825
Daddy, daddy.

85
00:13:57,035 --> 00:13:59,170
Everyone who's pennyless
calls you daddy,

86
00:13:59,278 --> 00:14:02,451
so won't you buy me a round,
daddy?

87
00:14:02,738 --> 00:14:05,194
Can the gentleman paint?

88
00:14:05,488 --> 00:14:07,364
Can the gentleman pose?

89
00:14:11,566 --> 00:14:12,816
For the Queen!

90
00:14:22,425 --> 00:14:23,425
Kiki!

91
00:14:24,971 --> 00:14:27,600
Come and teach these beginners
what it takes...

92
00:14:28,136 --> 00:14:30,832
to be a good model.

93
00:14:31,409 --> 00:14:33,657
There is nothing to learn.

94
00:14:35,202 --> 00:14:36,852
At first sight,

95
00:14:37,719 --> 00:14:39,359
there is nothing to learn.

96
00:14:39,700 --> 00:14:42,347
This is why
there is everything to learn.

97
00:14:42,929 --> 00:14:46,284
Here, Youki,
tell them the story of Utrillo.

98
00:14:47,612 --> 00:14:48,612
Me?

99
00:15:14,789 --> 00:15:16,262
Get undressed.

100
00:15:55,977 --> 00:15:57,138
One day,

101
00:16:00,835 --> 00:16:03,815
Utrillo descended from Montmartre

102
00:16:04,057 --> 00:16:05,655
to sketch Kiki.

103
00:16:07,704 --> 00:16:08,919
Of course,

104
00:16:09,474 --> 00:16:13,433
Uncle Utrillo descended from Montmartre,
with his bottle of wine.

105
00:16:20,083 --> 00:16:21,312
""I...""

106
00:16:24,602 --> 00:16:28,407
""I never show what I draw.""

107
00:16:35,690 --> 00:16:38,728
But the moment he turned his back,

108
00:16:39,734 --> 00:16:42,164
Kiki looked at what he was drawing.

109
00:16:49,093 --> 00:16:51,124
It was a landscape.

110
00:16:55,046 --> 00:16:56,371
Nice one!

111
00:17:03,406 --> 00:17:04,905
Bravo! Bravo!

112
00:17:10,751 --> 00:17:13,277
For a sketch, that was a sketch!

113
00:17:15,459 --> 00:17:16,743
She was naked.

114
00:17:17,859 --> 00:17:20,617
And she was an appetizer
to go with his wine.

115
00:17:25,894 --> 00:17:26,894
Bravo!

116
00:17:26,940 --> 00:17:28,549
Bravo!
Bravo!

117
00:17:30,702 --> 00:17:32,364
For a good pose,

118
00:17:34,516 --> 00:17:36,062
you should stand like this.

119
00:17:41,338 --> 00:17:42,594
Be beautiful.

120
00:17:46,234 --> 00:17:47,461
And just not care.

121
00:17:48,546 --> 00:17:49,977
There's nothing to learn.

122
00:17:50,510 --> 00:17:51,539
However,

123
00:17:53,247 --> 00:17:57,810
if you want to know how the
Montparnasse art was invented,

124
00:17:59,203 --> 00:18:02,977
that, I can teach you.
And it concerns us all.

125
00:18:03,586 --> 00:18:05,453
Fou-fou, come help me.

126
00:18:06,078 --> 00:18:09,040
Oh, a new cocktail!

127
00:18:10,477 --> 00:18:11,797
For starters,

128
00:18:13,424 --> 00:18:15,422
a generous dose,

129
00:18:16,252 --> 00:18:18,250
a generous dose of Zadkine.

130
00:18:32,594 --> 00:18:35,922
Anyone here can guess where
this gentleman came from?

131
00:18:36,277 --> 00:18:37,328
Russia.

132
00:18:38,739 --> 00:18:40,211
Russia!

133
00:18:42,894 --> 00:18:44,453
Good answer!

134
00:18:45,437 --> 00:18:48,188
And next, next I'll add,

135
00:18:49,191 --> 00:18:51,195
three drops of van Dongen.

136
00:18:51,358 --> 00:18:53,844
For that sweet juniper taste
from the Netherlands.

137
00:18:57,148 --> 00:18:59,524
Then what, Fou-fou?

138
00:19:00,085 --> 00:19:02,406
You haven't put any beer yet.

139
00:19:05,323 --> 00:19:06,328
Yes!

140
00:19:06,519 --> 00:19:10,000
And a polish beer, Kisling!

141
00:19:11,233 --> 00:19:13,055
<i>Na zdrowie!</i>

142
00:19:13,231 --> 00:19:14,766
Ah, excuse me, Kiki,

143
00:19:14,984 --> 00:19:19,414
I have French citizenship, given to me
by the bullet that injured me!

144
00:19:19,668 --> 00:19:22,313
I am critically French, Madam!

145
00:19:24,555 --> 00:19:25,945
Bravo!

146
00:19:30,788 --> 00:19:31,788
Me,

147
00:19:32,284 --> 00:19:34,879
I was rejected from the legion.

148
00:19:35,703 --> 00:19:37,054
With Zadkine,

149
00:19:37,671 --> 00:19:40,866
we ended up making bandages

150
00:19:41,380 --> 00:19:43,539
for the Red Cross.

151
00:19:51,383 --> 00:19:54,063
So, Fou-fou, they don't have
any saké at <i>La Rotonde</i>?

152
00:19:55,890 --> 00:19:56,890
Yes, yes!

153
00:19:57,195 --> 00:19:59,016
Of course they do!

154
00:20:09,664 --> 00:20:10,679
Kiki!

155
00:20:10,898 --> 00:20:12,844
Did you put some Soutine?

156
00:20:15,066 --> 00:20:18,527
So, a double dose of vodka...

157
00:20:18,997 --> 00:20:21,662
from Belarus for Mr. Soutine.

158
00:20:21,887 --> 00:20:27,537
- Soutine!
- Soutine!

159
00:20:29,417 --> 00:20:30,448
Wait! Wait!

160
00:20:30,551 --> 00:20:31,827
Let us not forget,

161
00:20:31,917 --> 00:20:34,797
the only French painter here,
in the end, is Utrillo.

162
00:20:35,030 --> 00:20:36,591
Quick, wine!

163
00:20:56,384 --> 00:20:58,076
Bravo, Kiki!

164
00:20:58,340 --> 00:21:01,436
Drink the Montparnasse art.

165
00:22:21,837 --> 00:22:23,024
The full moon?

166
00:22:24,696 --> 00:22:25,704
The wolf.

167
00:22:29,486 --> 00:22:30,797
Not very original.

168
00:22:31,922 --> 00:22:32,961
And you?

169
00:22:34,280 --> 00:22:35,311
Water.

170
00:22:38,806 --> 00:22:39,828
Why?

171
00:22:42,850 --> 00:22:45,979
It's as if the moon
started to drip.

172
00:22:49,588 --> 00:22:51,555
That's a feeling I know well.

173
00:22:58,313 --> 00:23:00,164
<i>Under the Mirabeau bridge...</i>

174
00:23:01,097 --> 00:23:02,759
<i>flows the Seine</i>

175
00:23:04,821 --> 00:23:06,267
<i>And our loves</i>

176
00:23:07,829 --> 00:23:09,743
<i>Must I remember them</i>

177
00:23:13,367 --> 00:23:16,907
<i>Joy always followed pain</i>

178
00:23:19,751 --> 00:23:21,007
<i>The night falls...</i>

179
00:23:22,211 --> 00:23:23,712
<i>and the hours ring</i>

180
00:23:25,482 --> 00:23:27,041
<i>The days go away</i>

181
00:23:28,216 --> 00:23:29,680
<i>I remain</i>

182
00:23:41,798 --> 00:23:45,399
This is a poem for the exiled,
don't you think?

183
00:23:50,189 --> 00:23:51,649
Did you meet him?

184
00:23:52,326 --> 00:23:53,353
Apollinaire.

185
00:23:53,563 --> 00:23:54,563
Yes.

186
00:23:55,979 --> 00:23:58,860
At the Bateau-Lavoir,
with Picasso.

187
00:24:00,340 --> 00:24:04,297
In fact, it is where
Apollinaire met Marie.

188
00:24:05,566 --> 00:24:07,524
He fell in love instantly.

189
00:24:17,742 --> 00:24:21,696
How can you pierce the carpet
with the needle...

190
00:24:21,953 --> 00:24:23,118
in that position?

191
00:24:24,732 --> 00:24:26,347
I'm not piercing.

192
00:24:27,244 --> 00:24:29,264
The needles are bent...

193
00:24:30,882 --> 00:24:34,715
so I use them like a hook.

194
00:24:37,261 --> 00:24:39,125
Did you bend them yourself?

195
00:24:39,334 --> 00:24:40,392
But, of course.

196
00:24:43,226 --> 00:24:44,694
You're so strange.

197
00:24:56,047 --> 00:24:57,078
Tell me.

198
00:24:58,596 --> 00:25:00,060
I was wondering.

199
00:25:01,411 --> 00:25:03,813
Can I call you Fou-fou as well?

200
00:25:04,414 --> 00:25:05,848
Of course!

201
00:25:07,085 --> 00:25:09,816
But that means scatterbrained.

202
00:25:10,278 --> 00:25:12,024
It's not a very nice word.

203
00:25:12,446 --> 00:25:15,931
I know ""scatterbrained""
means ""a bit twisted""...

204
00:25:16,293 --> 00:25:17,849
like the needles.

205
00:25:18,530 --> 00:25:20,430
It's me.
Why not?

206
00:25:21,445 --> 00:25:23,352
Everyone calls me Fou-fou.

207
00:25:23,567 --> 00:25:25,900
That way, they remember me.

208
00:25:26,739 --> 00:25:28,944
Is it important
that people remember you?

209
00:25:29,242 --> 00:25:31,357
Very important, sure!

210
00:25:32,163 --> 00:25:34,907
I am a foreigner here.

211
00:25:36,675 --> 00:25:38,483
Even if my drawings are good,

212
00:25:38,982 --> 00:25:41,713
do you think they'll notice me

213
00:25:42,619 --> 00:25:44,542
if they don't know my name?

214
00:25:49,378 --> 00:25:50,879
How many years already?

215
00:25:52,691 --> 00:25:55,593
Ten.
I was 27.

216
00:26:05,976 --> 00:26:07,694
Five years for me.

217
00:26:14,729 --> 00:26:17,206
After my aunt died in Belgium.

218
00:26:19,820 --> 00:26:21,730
No, I'm not sad.

219
00:26:24,577 --> 00:26:26,252
I never wanted...

220
00:26:27,015 --> 00:26:29,342
a life like everybody else.

221
00:26:37,261 --> 00:26:39,334
A life like everybody else?

222
00:26:43,573 --> 00:26:45,167
What do you think, Fou-fou?

223
00:26:46,828 --> 00:26:48,180
You call that a life?

224
00:26:49,074 --> 00:26:51,114
An existence like ours?

225
00:26:52,171 --> 00:26:53,213
What?

226
00:26:53,839 --> 00:26:55,412
Live in a hotel?

227
00:26:58,292 --> 00:26:59,308
No.

228
00:27:01,784 --> 00:27:03,015
It's not that.

229
00:27:09,854 --> 00:27:10,957
I'm finished.

230
00:27:14,107 --> 00:27:16,721
Today, I baked bread.

231
00:27:17,362 --> 00:27:21,503
Can you find
what I cooked yesterday?

232
00:27:23,516 --> 00:27:25,124
Come on, take a guess.

233
00:31:10,658 --> 00:31:12,444
Master, can we strike a pose?

234
00:31:14,146 --> 00:31:15,405
No, no!

235
00:31:15,715 --> 00:31:17,707
<i>Sono mama, sono mama.</i>

236
00:31:20,378 --> 00:31:24,223
<i>""Sono mama</i>"" means
""don't move"" in Japanese.

237
00:31:25,014 --> 00:31:28,382
Therefore, <i>sono mama.</i>
Do you understand?

238
00:31:49,414 --> 00:31:52,227
Your standing posture is too bulky.

239
00:31:52,558 --> 00:31:53,890
Too bulky!

240
00:31:54,829 --> 00:31:58,357
Pretend that you just landed,

241
00:31:58,642 --> 00:32:00,316
that you just touched down.

242
00:32:10,768 --> 00:32:12,963
Free your senses.

243
00:32:13,681 --> 00:32:15,582
Spread your arms.

244
00:32:15,984 --> 00:32:17,748
Yes, good!

245
00:32:18,786 --> 00:32:21,088
That's it. Gently.

246
00:32:22,983 --> 00:32:26,131
Marie, is your ear bothering you?

247
00:32:26,600 --> 00:32:27,607
No.

248
00:33:15,510 --> 00:33:16,510
One!

249
00:33:17,412 --> 00:33:18,537
Two!

250
00:33:19,475 --> 00:33:20,966
Three! Go!

251
00:33:48,158 --> 00:33:49,180
Good morning.

252
00:33:50,855 --> 00:33:52,118
Don't go so fast.

253
00:33:52,981 --> 00:33:54,381
Slowly, slowly.

254
00:34:13,228 --> 00:34:14,463
I'm terribly sorry,

255
00:34:14,952 --> 00:34:17,581
a studio was finally available,

256
00:34:17,817 --> 00:34:21,002
but I'm afraid
others beat you to it.

257
00:34:21,587 --> 00:34:24,729
No, it's me who's sorry.

258
00:34:25,354 --> 00:34:27,284
So many of us showing up
without notice.

259
00:34:27,536 --> 00:34:29,424
You'll see, it's small...

260
00:34:29,651 --> 00:34:32,385
inside too.

261
00:34:33,939 --> 00:34:35,838
Please, take a closer look.

262
00:34:36,010 --> 00:34:38,393
Everyone is trying their best.

263
00:34:38,696 --> 00:34:39,696
Yes!

264
00:34:43,470 --> 00:34:45,823
Over 200 painters...

265
00:34:46,088 --> 00:34:48,471
are in the hive.

266
00:34:50,193 --> 00:34:53,391
In total, there might be tens
of thousands in Paris.

267
00:34:57,208 --> 00:34:59,336
Do you think you can win?

268
00:35:02,124 --> 00:35:03,963
This place's nickname,

269
00:35:04,613 --> 00:35:07,456
is the Villa Medici of Poverty.

270
00:35:11,560 --> 00:35:15,924
While this is not as respected
as the Medici residence is,

271
00:35:17,342 --> 00:35:19,334
I still cannot feel luckier.

272
00:35:21,935 --> 00:35:24,026
Paris is incredible!

273
00:35:25,578 --> 00:35:29,440
They accept any foreigner
regardless of their nationality.

274
00:35:29,959 --> 00:35:32,111
By the way,
Soutine came back yesterday.

275
00:35:32,464 --> 00:35:36,635
He had to throw rocks
at Chagall's studio.

276
00:35:37,684 --> 00:35:39,877
He broke a few windows too,
that fellow.

277
00:35:41,416 --> 00:35:44,617
He overdoes it a little,
even if he doesn't like him.

278
00:35:44,799 --> 00:35:48,992
The fact is, Soutine doesn't live here,
he's just passing by.

279
00:35:49,781 --> 00:35:50,797
Where's he staying?

280
00:35:53,050 --> 00:35:54,835
At everyone's.

281
00:35:55,641 --> 00:35:58,305
Modigliani did the same.

282
00:36:03,248 --> 00:36:04,546
Hive.

283
00:36:04,821 --> 00:36:05,982
Cube.

284
00:36:06,953 --> 00:36:08,216
Fauve.

285
00:36:08,836 --> 00:36:10,011
Shul.

286
00:36:10,916 --> 00:36:13,545
Various kinds of bees
have built hives.

287
00:36:14,305 --> 00:36:18,452
However, you are not
supposed to follow them.

288
00:36:48,438 --> 00:36:51,306
Bravo, it's coming together nicely.
Very good.

289
00:36:52,608 --> 00:36:53,615
Good.

290
00:36:57,547 --> 00:37:01,703
I was in Paris several years ago.

291
00:37:02,671 --> 00:37:03,695
Is that so?

292
00:37:05,700 --> 00:37:07,524
There is a poem I like.

293
00:37:10,393 --> 00:37:11,884
Can I read it?

294
00:37:12,662 --> 00:37:15,195
It's quite long, but I'd like
to read the beginning.

295
00:37:16,737 --> 00:37:17,797
Go ahead.

296
00:37:32,351 --> 00:37:34,938
""Cathedral in the Thrashing Rain,""

297
00:37:35,775 --> 00:37:37,344
by Kotaro Takamura.

298
00:37:41,724 --> 00:37:45,718
<i>O another deluge of
wind and rain</i>

299
00:37:49,842 --> 00:37:51,970
<i>Collar turned up,</i>

300
00:37:53,295 --> 00:37:56,129
<i>getting drenched
in this splashing rain,</i>

301
00:37:59,572 --> 00:38:02,474
<i>and looking up at you:
it's me...</i>

302
00:38:05,738 --> 00:38:09,266
<i>me who never fails to come here
once a day</i>

303
00:38:12,394 --> 00:38:14,454
<i>It's that Japanese</i>

304
00:38:19,801 --> 00:38:21,016
<i>This morning,</i>

305
00:38:21,852 --> 00:38:25,880
<i>about daybreak the storm suddenly
went violent, terrible,</i>

306
00:38:26,959 --> 00:38:28,039
<i>and now,</i>

307
00:38:29,242 --> 00:38:32,576
<i>is blowing through Paris
from one end to the other</i>

308
00:38:35,376 --> 00:38:39,143
<i>I have yet to know
the directions of this land</i>

309
00:38:41,782 --> 00:38:45,781
<i>I don't even know which way
this storm is facing,</i>

310
00:38:45,875 --> 00:38:48,289
<i>raging over the lie-de-France</i>

311
00:38:51,225 --> 00:38:53,126
<i>Only because even today</i>

312
00:38:54,097 --> 00:38:56,211
<i>I wanted to stand there</i>

313
00:38:57,505 --> 00:39:00,737
<i>and look up at you,
Cathedral of Notre-Dame de Paris,</i>

314
00:39:01,767 --> 00:39:04,672
<i>I came, getting drenched,</i>

315
00:39:07,708 --> 00:39:10,234
<i>only because I wanted
to touch you,</i>

316
00:39:12,120 --> 00:39:14,438
<i>only because I wanted
to kiss your skin,</i>

317
00:39:14,624 --> 00:39:17,320
<i>the stone, unknown to anyone</i>

318
00:39:20,500 --> 00:39:24,301
<i>O another deluge
of wind and rain</i>

319
00:39:29,516 --> 00:39:32,490
<i>Though it's already time
for morning coffee,</i>

320
00:39:33,416 --> 00:39:36,485
<i>a little while ago
I looked from the Pont-Neuf,</i>

321
00:39:36,748 --> 00:39:38,844
<i>the boats on the Seine</i>

322
00:39:39,199 --> 00:39:43,328
<i>were still tied up
to the banks, like puppies</i>

323
00:40:12,627 --> 00:40:14,979
What do you want from me,
ogling me like that?

324
00:40:17,677 --> 00:40:20,588
How can I draw without looking?

325
00:40:30,463 --> 00:40:31,502
Take it.

326
00:40:31,762 --> 00:40:32,916
It's yours.

327
00:40:42,826 --> 00:40:43,885
Thank you.

328
00:40:56,955 --> 00:41:00,379
When you pull out a sketchbook
and draw a rough sketch,

329
00:41:00,521 --> 00:41:02,870
it is the same as drawing
a portrait.

330
00:41:06,249 --> 00:41:09,354
How many times have you
visited the Louvre?

331
00:41:10,135 --> 00:41:11,694
I recognize it.

332
00:41:12,690 --> 00:41:14,221
I think I know him.

333
00:41:14,466 --> 00:41:15,798
He's a famous artist.

334
00:41:16,361 --> 00:41:19,330
I have gone there for three years.

335
00:41:21,335 --> 00:41:25,198
When I felt I couldn't even
draw a flower properly,

336
00:41:25,384 --> 00:41:27,651
I hung around the Louvre,

337
00:41:27,836 --> 00:41:32,331
found something most similar to the image
I had in my head and copied it repeatedly.

338
00:41:33,749 --> 00:41:37,557
Every human
has to try hard in this life.

339
00:41:46,035 --> 00:41:48,143
Aren't you Foujita,
by any chance?

340
00:41:49,019 --> 00:41:50,619
Ah, yes.

341
00:41:50,807 --> 00:41:51,900
Oh, dear!

342
00:41:52,304 --> 00:41:56,205
I saw a wax figure of you in a display,
your spitting image.

343
00:41:57,996 --> 00:42:01,260
Tell me, Mr. Foujita,
can you draw me as well?

344
00:42:02,992 --> 00:42:04,643
It's already done.

345
00:42:11,452 --> 00:42:14,845
Say, how did you guess
my underwear?

346
00:42:20,271 --> 00:42:23,737
Do we have to do this much?

347
00:42:25,061 --> 00:42:27,030
There are two Foujitas.

348
00:42:27,265 --> 00:42:31,760
Thanks to this, the real Foujita
becomes known to the public.

349
00:42:36,923 --> 00:42:38,391
What's up?

350
00:42:41,644 --> 00:42:43,728
There is a painting from
Mr. Foujita's collection

351
00:42:43,823 --> 00:42:46,210
of landscape paintings
from his early career.

352
00:42:50,858 --> 00:42:53,987
It shows a distant view
of the outskirts of Paris...

353
00:42:55,202 --> 00:42:57,190
in a dark tint.

354
00:43:06,422 --> 00:43:10,932
Can we view this painting as a departure
from your great white backgrounds?

355
00:43:17,658 --> 00:43:18,658
My white...

356
00:43:19,829 --> 00:43:24,424
isn't meant to separate
shadows from light.

357
00:43:25,985 --> 00:43:27,143
My white...

358
00:43:27,661 --> 00:43:29,527
is a color in itself.

359
00:43:33,666 --> 00:43:37,276
The beautiful fair skin
of European women,

360
00:43:38,359 --> 00:43:41,791
must be caressed by the gaze.

361
00:43:47,007 --> 00:43:48,807
Caressed by the gaze?

362
00:43:55,683 --> 00:43:57,831
I'm speaking about the painting,
of course.

363
00:43:59,879 --> 00:44:03,581
Ah, yes.
The vision is the sense

364
00:44:03,644 --> 00:44:06,530
that measures the distance
to the subject,

365
00:44:06,605 --> 00:44:09,370
whereas the touch...

366
00:44:09,994 --> 00:44:12,104
records the memory of the hand.

367
00:44:14,835 --> 00:44:17,339
A painting should convey...

368
00:44:17,645 --> 00:44:21,557
not only the distance
perceived by vision

369
00:44:22,501 --> 00:44:24,605
but also the perception of touch.

370
00:44:25,128 --> 00:44:27,800
That which we feel close to.

371
00:44:29,684 --> 00:44:32,894
That's how I understand it,
anyway.

372
00:44:34,469 --> 00:44:36,620
You're probably right.

373
00:44:38,050 --> 00:44:39,269
But for me,

374
00:44:39,863 --> 00:44:42,854
only my hand moves.

375
00:44:44,327 --> 00:44:47,722
And the question is to know,

376
00:44:47,921 --> 00:44:49,839
if this line here...

377
00:44:50,280 --> 00:44:51,331
is alive.

378
00:44:57,109 --> 00:44:58,362
Are you Youki?

379
00:44:59,784 --> 00:45:00,784
Yes.

380
00:45:01,167 --> 00:45:02,519
Mr. Picasso.

381
00:45:06,184 --> 00:45:07,894
You're prettier than this painting.

382
00:46:23,870 --> 00:46:27,752
If I buy them,
will you miss them?

383
00:46:31,541 --> 00:46:33,268
Obviously.

384
00:46:36,194 --> 00:46:37,815
But I'm here for that.

385
00:46:38,313 --> 00:46:40,002
For people to buy.

386
00:46:45,417 --> 00:46:47,495
I attach myself to objects,

387
00:46:48,057 --> 00:46:49,698
to their form.

388
00:46:51,549 --> 00:46:54,105
But only when they're free
from the hands...

389
00:46:54,379 --> 00:46:56,128
that used them.

390
00:46:57,720 --> 00:46:59,222
Strange, isn't it?

391
00:46:59,674 --> 00:47:01,438
Not at all.

392
00:47:06,455 --> 00:47:07,479
<i>Arigatõ.</i>

393
00:47:16,842 --> 00:47:19,209
It's pretty.
Don't you think so?

394
00:47:20,713 --> 00:47:22,198
She's going to win!

395
00:47:23,865 --> 00:47:25,834
Look!
Did you see?

396
00:47:27,886 --> 00:47:29,252
A drink, gentlemen?

397
00:47:29,347 --> 00:47:31,152
Well, thank you.
How nice of you!

398
00:47:32,300 --> 00:47:34,761
How am I supposed to sell them now?

399
00:47:34,826 --> 00:47:36,441
You're so cheeky!

400
00:47:36,646 --> 00:47:39,582
But I like them.
I never asked to sell them.

401
00:47:40,243 --> 00:47:42,136
Yes, I see that.

402
00:47:47,054 --> 00:47:49,114
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

403
00:48:18,439 --> 00:48:19,869
The roof can be opened.

404
00:48:36,716 --> 00:48:38,346
It's astonishing!

405
00:49:39,591 --> 00:49:40,684
Fou-fou.

406
00:49:41,658 --> 00:49:43,300
What are you doing tonight?

407
00:49:47,578 --> 00:49:48,987
I have work.

408
00:49:49,152 --> 00:49:51,205
A thousand things to finish.

409
00:49:58,673 --> 00:50:00,175
I wonder,

410
00:50:00,641 --> 00:50:02,550
can I go out alone?

411
00:50:03,479 --> 00:50:06,760
Of course!
Go wherever you want. Go.

412
00:50:07,440 --> 00:50:09,007
Do you have enough money?

413
00:50:09,140 --> 00:50:10,140
Yes.

414
00:50:10,870 --> 00:50:12,112
Thank you.

415
00:50:28,889 --> 00:50:31,073
Kiki sings at <i>Le Jockey</i> tonight.

416
00:50:32,081 --> 00:50:35,610
Ah, dancing?

417
00:50:36,972 --> 00:50:39,448
That's a professional obligation.

418
00:50:40,512 --> 00:50:42,855
Fun comes first.

419
00:51:02,472 --> 00:51:06,262
<i>The women were wearing laces</i>

420
00:51:06,574 --> 00:51:11,069
<i>And especially adorable
frilly skirts</i>

421
00:51:11,378 --> 00:51:15,110
<i>And when we walked behind them</i>

422
00:51:15,214 --> 00:51:19,886
<i>We had to guess
what was underneath!</i>

423
00:51:20,017 --> 00:51:24,536
<i>They only showed
the tips of their boots</i>

424
00:51:24,698 --> 00:51:28,910
<i>But as soon as it began to rain</i>

425
00:51:29,037 --> 00:51:32,439
<i>They rolled them up,
the naughty ones</i>

426
00:51:32,839 --> 00:51:34,441
<i>""Oh no, rain!""</i>

427
00:51:34,641 --> 00:51:37,975
<i>In order to be seen!</i>

428
00:51:38,393 --> 00:51:42,651
<i>Ah! How beautiful was my village</i>

429
00:51:42,884 --> 00:51:47,322
<i>My Paris, our Paris</i>

430
00:51:47,483 --> 00:51:51,298
<i>We only spoke one language</i>

431
00:51:51,392 --> 00:51:56,228
<i>That's enough to be understood</i>

432
00:51:56,455 --> 00:52:00,798
<i>We danced the polka,
the waltz and the mazurka</i>

433
00:52:00,931 --> 00:52:05,164
<i>It may have been a little silly</i>

434
00:52:05,308 --> 00:52:09,712
<i>But the boys and girls dancing,
they were so innocent</i>

435
00:52:09,816 --> 00:52:14,198
<i>Maybe that was true happiness</i>

436
00:52:14,487 --> 00:52:18,925
<i>Ah! How beautiful was my village</i>

437
00:52:19,025 --> 00:52:21,324
<i>My Paris</i>

438
00:52:22,180 --> 00:52:26,456
<i>Our Paris</i>

439
00:53:54,748 --> 00:53:57,912
Introducing the lady!

440
00:55:00,107 --> 00:55:02,008
- Are we going?
- Let's drink.

441
00:55:04,080 --> 00:55:05,091
Let's go!

442
00:57:01,089 --> 00:57:02,887
Be careful, Kiki!
Be careful!

443
00:57:21,025 --> 00:57:22,048
Careful!

444
00:57:26,767 --> 00:57:28,326
Like that, like that.

445
00:58:36,213 --> 00:58:38,962
The more I provoke scandals...

446
00:58:40,049 --> 00:58:41,798
and act scatterbrained,

447
00:58:43,463 --> 00:58:46,194
the closer I get to myself.

448
00:58:47,890 --> 00:58:49,931
My paintings are
that much more beautiful.

449
00:58:51,259 --> 00:58:53,236
Fun only lasts the night.

450
00:58:55,013 --> 00:58:56,478
It's pointless.

451
00:58:57,785 --> 00:58:59,455
And that's why I love it.

452
00:59:02,083 --> 00:59:03,251
I love it...

453
00:59:03,679 --> 00:59:06,150
because its meaning fades
very quickly.

454
00:59:11,633 --> 00:59:13,783
I will make a tatoo...

455
00:59:14,823 --> 00:59:16,658
on your white skin.

456
00:59:55,074 --> 00:59:56,438
What's the matter?

457
01:00:02,168 --> 01:00:03,822
Why not a painting?

458
01:00:16,892 --> 01:00:18,164
Melancholic?

459
01:00:26,929 --> 01:00:28,158
Of course,

460
01:00:28,404 --> 01:00:30,232
I'll continue to paint.

461
01:00:31,726 --> 01:00:32,991
However,

462
01:00:33,928 --> 01:00:35,827
thanks to the beauty
of your skin,

463
01:00:37,189 --> 01:00:38,459
my paintings...

464
01:00:39,192 --> 01:00:40,842
will sell even better.

465
01:00:43,209 --> 01:00:44,499
They'll sell...

466
01:00:45,779 --> 01:00:47,233
better than you imagine.

467
01:00:54,299 --> 01:00:55,385
Okay.

468
01:01:04,443 --> 01:01:06,099
What do you want to tattoo on me?

469
01:01:08,522 --> 01:01:09,785
On you,

470
01:01:10,233 --> 01:01:11,368
a mermaid.

471
01:01:14,030 --> 01:01:15,362
And on me,

472
01:01:15,930 --> 01:01:17,281
at first,

473
01:01:19,050 --> 01:01:20,302
a watch, here,

474
01:01:21,404 --> 01:01:24,069
that will always point to noon,

475
01:01:25,582 --> 01:01:27,993
to ensure my good health.

476
01:01:29,204 --> 01:01:32,420
I must tattoo a lion as well.

477
01:01:34,217 --> 01:01:37,038
One that will protect you forever.

478
01:03:39,129 --> 01:03:43,191
Wow, I didn't know you
were that famous.

479
01:03:43,467 --> 01:03:45,095
I am sorry!

480
01:03:45,953 --> 01:03:50,550
I was the one who decided to
stay here on a whim, that's all.

481
01:03:52,549 --> 01:03:55,516
Right now,
the newspaper reporters...

482
01:03:55,913 --> 01:03:58,712
must be struggling to find me
searching inns one by one,

483
01:03:59,014 --> 01:04:02,279
from the best to the worst one,
in that order.

484
01:05:58,884 --> 01:06:00,073
Mister.

485
01:06:01,929 --> 01:06:04,708
Is that a sword battle?

486
01:06:07,002 --> 01:06:09,062
Your voice is too loud.

487
01:06:12,207 --> 01:06:18,238
You told me that a sword battle
would take place in Attu Island.

488
01:06:24,605 --> 01:06:28,838
It's a sword battle because swords
are involved, right?

489
01:06:36,159 --> 01:06:43,992
I don't like drawing something still,
after all.

490
01:06:46,164 --> 01:06:50,746
I draw people in close proximity,

491
01:06:52,440 --> 01:06:55,239
to such extent
that I can even touch them.

492
01:06:58,440 --> 01:07:00,893
In war, the situation is similar.

493
01:07:04,721 --> 01:07:07,898
The only problem
is that I have to use...

494
01:07:08,568 --> 01:07:12,096
special drawing technique
because of the shaking.

495
01:07:14,837 --> 01:07:16,310
This time,

496
01:07:17,635 --> 01:07:21,249
I merely bet my life in order
to test my capabilities, that's all.

497
01:07:36,045 --> 01:07:40,277
Anyway, I ended up creating
a satisfactory piece of work.

498
01:07:43,868 --> 01:07:48,402
For the first time,
I learned firsthand...

499
01:07:49,851 --> 01:07:54,008
that drawings can move
people's minds.

500
01:07:57,528 --> 01:07:58,655
Today...

501
01:08:00,155 --> 01:08:02,454
was an unforgettable day.

502
01:09:20,344 --> 01:09:22,210
Are you still lost?

503
01:09:27,251 --> 01:09:28,685
But...

504
01:09:31,856 --> 01:09:34,451
If you cannot finish it
with one piece,

505
01:09:35,386 --> 01:09:37,082
just buy two.

506
01:09:40,140 --> 01:09:41,836
Are you satisfied?

507
01:09:45,368 --> 01:09:49,265
Women look prettier when
they spend money on accessories.

508
01:09:52,693 --> 01:09:54,301
You know, Master,

509
01:09:54,772 --> 01:09:56,172
this here...

510
01:09:57,659 --> 01:09:59,594
has stripes, though.

511
01:10:00,471 --> 01:10:03,771
You call me ""Master""
only in this kind of situations.

512
01:10:06,696 --> 01:10:07,937
But...

513
01:10:09,934 --> 01:10:12,233
I think that one looks good too.

514
01:10:16,758 --> 01:10:21,719
I definitely saw that kind of color
on a Mexican traditional cloth.

515
01:11:42,137 --> 01:11:43,160
Oh, dear.

516
01:11:50,450 --> 01:11:52,952
I have an extra.

517
01:11:55,506 --> 01:11:57,099
You're welcome.

518
01:12:00,140 --> 01:12:01,699
Your fourth wife,

519
01:12:02,969 --> 01:12:04,896
Miss Madeleine, is that right?

520
01:12:05,196 --> 01:12:06,357
Hey, hey!

521
01:12:09,592 --> 01:12:12,770
I know it because
I am your fifth wife.

522
01:12:17,068 --> 01:12:21,528
Everyone can tell by your drawings.

523
01:12:27,732 --> 01:12:28,855
But,

524
01:12:30,365 --> 01:12:35,712
why is there no drawing
of your first Japanese wife?

525
01:12:39,709 --> 01:12:42,865
Before I went to Paris,

526
01:12:44,630 --> 01:12:47,952
I was just a student.

527
01:12:53,745 --> 01:12:54,775
Say,

528
01:12:56,075 --> 01:12:57,703
if Ms. Madeleine...

529
01:12:58,459 --> 01:13:02,231
were a fabric,
which fabric would she be?

530
01:13:08,570 --> 01:13:11,250
Velvet, maybe?

531
01:13:19,815 --> 01:13:22,257
How about Ms. Youki?

532
01:13:25,204 --> 01:13:27,867
She was fair-complexioned,
wasn't she?

533
01:13:31,935 --> 01:13:34,610
Silk, maybe?

534
01:13:35,579 --> 01:13:37,309
Please, stop.

535
01:13:39,709 --> 01:13:40,790
Say,

536
01:13:42,472 --> 01:13:43,997
how about me?

537
01:13:52,316 --> 01:13:55,860
We don't have enough
material right now.

538
01:13:57,128 --> 01:13:59,563
What do you mean by that?

539
01:14:08,398 --> 01:14:12,130
I have one with stronger tips,

540
01:14:13,253 --> 01:14:18,889
but it's hard to find soft ones
that will fit your style.

541
01:14:51,818 --> 01:14:54,879
Ever since Mr. Fujishima
passed away,

542
01:14:55,439 --> 01:15:02,710
I've heard that Mr. Foujita became the
president of the Army Art Association.

543
01:15:03,768 --> 01:15:05,851
It must have been hard.

544
01:15:10,621 --> 01:15:14,080
Please, provide your contribution
for a <i>senninbari.</i>

545
01:15:16,804 --> 01:15:19,300
- Please, contribute.
- Please, contribute.

546
01:15:34,439 --> 01:15:36,908
Every oil painter...

547
01:15:37,520 --> 01:15:39,605
goes to Paris to learn more.

548
01:15:41,476 --> 01:15:45,379
Paris is under German control
right now.

549
01:15:47,538 --> 01:15:51,584
Nobody can learn arts
in Paris anymore.

550
01:15:56,769 --> 01:15:58,897
There is no doubt about it.

551
01:16:00,002 --> 01:16:01,748
This is the best opportunity...

552
01:16:02,033 --> 01:16:06,596
to stay away from those imported art styles
influenced by Impressionism.

553
01:16:11,459 --> 01:16:13,985
The Great Depression...

554
01:16:14,930 --> 01:16:17,711
made Paris a sad city in no time.

555
01:16:22,162 --> 01:16:24,222
Nowadays,
the trend in the art scene...

556
01:16:24,792 --> 01:16:28,126
moves from Europe to the U.S.
Don't you think?

557
01:16:31,047 --> 01:16:33,189
Even if a country has no history,

558
01:16:33,483 --> 01:16:35,782
matured capitalism...

559
01:16:36,916 --> 01:16:38,891
can make flowers bloom anywhere.

560
01:16:41,797 --> 01:16:43,231
I want you two masters...

561
01:16:43,686 --> 01:16:46,417
to come up with an idea
that will better fit

562
01:16:48,091 --> 01:16:49,404
Our Great East Asian Vision.

563
01:16:49,472 --> 01:16:51,965
We have to end this
White Domination over Asians.

564
01:16:54,900 --> 01:16:56,391
Master Miyamoto.

565
01:16:58,068 --> 01:17:00,264
We have to, at least,

566
01:17:00,970 --> 01:17:04,230
win the war on paper like this.

567
01:17:06,777 --> 01:17:07,870
I see.

568
01:17:09,360 --> 01:17:10,953
I'm trying.

569
01:17:33,295 --> 01:17:37,164
Do you know the God-of-War
Squad Yamasaki?

570
01:17:37,894 --> 01:17:42,208
It surprises me that they even built
Yamasaki Shrine for that.

571
01:17:44,191 --> 01:17:45,853
It's not a big deal.

572
01:17:46,698 --> 01:17:50,783
I am very happy that the Army...

573
01:17:51,269 --> 01:17:53,568
made up the narrative.

574
01:17:55,628 --> 01:17:58,504
Drawings are all about falsehood,

575
01:17:58,698 --> 01:18:01,481
so narratives actually makes
them better.

576
01:18:05,739 --> 01:18:08,072
I don't think falsehood...

577
01:18:09,142 --> 01:18:11,475
is a bad thing in itself.

578
01:18:14,103 --> 01:18:15,571
I understand.

579
01:18:17,354 --> 01:18:18,822
Good drawings...

580
01:18:19,659 --> 01:18:23,052
will last longer than
the narratives themselves.

581
01:18:27,707 --> 01:18:31,047
What do you think about taking
a walk before going home?

582
01:18:32,425 --> 01:18:33,825
That sounds good.

583
01:18:39,672 --> 01:18:41,664
We lost the Midway Battle,

584
01:18:42,755 --> 01:18:47,097
that was the total opposite of the
announcement by the Headquarters.

585
01:18:49,542 --> 01:18:54,493
The U.S. already took control of the
air superiority over the Pacific Ocean.

586
01:18:56,299 --> 01:18:58,365
Even Tokyo is in danger.

587
01:19:05,458 --> 01:19:07,222
The walls have ears.

588
01:19:07,601 --> 01:19:09,092
I should be careful.

589
01:20:51,321 --> 01:20:54,415
Is it okay for us to enter?

590
01:20:56,192 --> 01:20:57,683
Thank you very much.

591
01:20:58,547 --> 01:21:00,641
Please, go inside.

592
01:22:43,535 --> 01:22:45,436
I am glad that I came.

593
01:22:47,506 --> 01:22:49,975
It's not even an important event.

594
01:22:50,576 --> 01:22:52,214
Why are you here?

595
01:22:52,423 --> 01:22:55,877
Why did you suddenly scream,
""Kamakura""?

596
01:23:00,876 --> 01:23:02,435
It's fine.

597
01:23:03,624 --> 01:23:05,991
I can leave for Chiba now,
if you want.

598
01:23:07,125 --> 01:23:09,822
Would you like to visit your grave?

599
01:23:11,697 --> 01:23:13,029
Why would I do...

600
01:23:14,066 --> 01:23:15,466
such a thing?

601
01:23:25,052 --> 01:23:26,350
I have seen...

602
01:23:28,113 --> 01:23:29,775
for almost twenty years...

603
01:23:30,475 --> 01:23:33,741
Jesus Christ nailed on the cross.

604
01:24:14,170 --> 01:24:18,591
<i>Last night, our soldiers ferociously
attacked the enemy's mobile unit...</i>

605
01:24:18,888 --> 01:24:20,966
<i>on the eastern coastline</i>

606
01:24:21,600 --> 01:24:25,154
<i>and destroyed half of them.</i>

607
01:24:25,600 --> 01:24:28,570
<i>The battle gave us...</i>

608
01:24:29,834 --> 01:24:32,895
<i>several tactical benefits,</i>

609
01:24:33,522 --> 01:24:36,178
<i>such as the following.</i>

610
01:24:36,869 --> 01:24:38,735
<i>Firstly...</i>

611
01:24:48,956 --> 01:24:51,194
- Goodbye, master.
- Goodbye.

612
01:24:52,966 --> 01:24:54,127
Mr. Seiroku.

613
01:24:55,804 --> 01:24:58,908
Thank you for your help the other day.
You saved me.

614
01:24:59,129 --> 01:25:02,446
Is Mr. Skillful Painter okay now?

615
01:25:06,135 --> 01:25:10,727
Being in the countryside helps.
But I am not sure what the future brings.

616
01:25:13,606 --> 01:25:16,838
Please, let me know
if you need any help.

617
01:25:17,602 --> 01:25:18,982
Thank you very much.

618
01:25:22,000 --> 01:25:24,492
Seiroku! The tea is ready!

619
01:26:00,215 --> 01:26:03,140
Mr. Yatsu, that's enough.

620
01:26:03,358 --> 01:26:05,735
Beans should be...

621
01:26:06,454 --> 01:26:08,889
managed carefully all the time.

622
01:26:13,237 --> 01:26:15,353
- Ah, Bo! Welcome back.
- Welcome back.

623
01:26:15,570 --> 01:26:16,690
I am back.

624
01:26:20,235 --> 01:26:21,726
Welcome back.

625
01:26:27,042 --> 01:26:29,671
Is your name Bo?

626
01:26:33,214 --> 01:26:34,288
Not really.

627
01:26:34,933 --> 01:26:38,567
It's my fault. I've called him
like that for a long time.

628
01:27:08,932 --> 01:27:12,509
Are you really going to walk in that?

629
01:27:15,921 --> 01:27:18,652
I was honored to receive it...

630
01:27:19,510 --> 01:27:22,537
from the country
as a major general.

631
01:27:23,397 --> 01:27:25,593
I have to wear it sometimes.

632
01:27:26,084 --> 01:27:29,020
Otherwise, it's the same
as disrespecting the country.

633
01:27:29,763 --> 01:27:32,509
Drawings are tasteless.

634
01:27:38,323 --> 01:27:39,882
Drawings gradually...

635
01:27:41,113 --> 01:27:45,339
get more serious and different from
the taste of the general public

636
01:27:46,016 --> 01:27:48,679
once you start digging deeper.

637
01:27:50,495 --> 01:27:52,934
Whether they are tasteless or not,

638
01:27:53,265 --> 01:27:56,394
everyone has to get over
this kind of phase.

639
01:27:57,797 --> 01:28:00,425
You didn't show me
the military boots yet.

640
01:28:04,668 --> 01:28:05,964
What?

641
01:28:06,928 --> 01:28:09,864
It doesn't have to be
an official issue?

642
01:28:11,275 --> 01:28:12,709
A pair of <i>getas</i> will do?

643
01:28:18,882 --> 01:28:22,080
Those <i>getas</i> are brand-new.

644
01:28:23,815 --> 01:28:26,808
When you wear new shoes
after dark,

645
01:28:27,488 --> 01:28:29,423
foxes will ridicule you.

646
01:28:31,440 --> 01:28:34,968
I am surprised that
you believe in that kind of myth.

647
01:28:36,409 --> 01:28:38,207
Let's go get ridiculed.

648
01:28:47,919 --> 01:28:51,763
Once you do this,
they will become used <i>getas.</i>

649
01:30:52,424 --> 01:30:56,331
Who would have ever thought
that farmers would ever receive rice

650
01:30:56,496 --> 01:30:58,624
from Tokyo people?

651
01:30:59,564 --> 01:31:01,148
That's right.

652
01:31:02,701 --> 01:31:04,260
It's strange.

653
01:31:05,345 --> 01:31:07,598
I am a strange one.

654
01:31:08,548 --> 01:31:12,952
Also, you need to use crushed rice
for rice flour.

655
01:31:13,669 --> 01:31:17,936
Why would you crush decent rice
into pieces?

656
01:31:18,592 --> 01:31:20,315
You are committing a sin.

657
01:31:21,861 --> 01:31:23,352
I'm sorry.

658
01:31:23,949 --> 01:31:27,784
I had to share
with my neighbors anyway.

659
01:31:29,436 --> 01:31:31,337
That's how it is supposed to go.

660
01:31:33,092 --> 01:31:35,949
We are desperate
for food right now.

661
01:31:36,519 --> 01:31:40,388
I guess human beings
will get happier than the Moon God.

662
01:31:41,721 --> 01:31:44,195
Let's have a break.

663
01:31:44,628 --> 01:31:45,827
Okay?

664
01:31:55,948 --> 01:32:01,353
I have never celebrated
the 13th Night Ritual before.

665
01:32:03,656 --> 01:32:05,648
Only the 15th Night Ritual, then?

666
01:32:06,592 --> 01:32:11,553
In the past, the 13th Night Ritual used
to be called <i>Mochi Tsukimi</i> by people.

667
01:32:12,561 --> 01:32:17,196
When you finish the 15th Night Ritual,
you see a half moon.

668
01:32:18,828 --> 01:32:22,765
The moon on the 13th night
is more beautiful...

669
01:32:23,567 --> 01:32:27,153
because it hasn't reached
the 15th night yet.

670
01:32:28,765 --> 01:32:30,631
The air is crisp.

671
01:33:11,791 --> 01:33:14,761
What a beautiful moon.

672
01:33:24,040 --> 01:33:27,977
Are you okay with the house
without decorations?

673
01:33:37,095 --> 01:33:38,144
Yes.

674
01:33:39,129 --> 01:33:42,429
Drawings don't look nice when
the <i>engawa</i> is not shown properly.

675
01:33:54,542 --> 01:33:56,534
Master! Master!

676
01:33:56,845 --> 01:34:00,140
I still think this is weird.
You are not supposed to do it.

677
01:34:02,649 --> 01:34:07,309
I need the stamina to keep drawing.
I am doing it right without any problem.

678
01:34:08,732 --> 01:34:11,531
If I don't put proper efforts,
I will die one day.

679
01:34:13,726 --> 01:34:14,854
In Tokyo,

680
01:34:14,997 --> 01:34:19,128
I used to work 14 hours a day
in my atelier.

681
01:34:30,705 --> 01:34:31,639
Hey!

682
01:34:31,725 --> 01:34:33,591
Aren't you Suzuki?

683
01:34:40,574 --> 01:34:41,972
Oh, master!

684
01:34:42,765 --> 01:34:45,030
I didn't recognize you!

685
01:34:47,789 --> 01:34:51,317
The home front has more
things to do than drawing.

686
01:34:53,054 --> 01:34:54,613
Thank you for your service.

687
01:34:55,091 --> 01:34:58,994
I will tell the village chief.
Please, go see him immediately.

688
01:34:59,893 --> 01:35:01,259
Thank you very much.

689
01:35:03,457 --> 01:35:06,689
We lost all ammo due
to the airstrikes.

690
01:35:08,162 --> 01:35:09,755
I can see that.

691
01:35:10,765 --> 01:35:12,961
I am just glad
that you didn't get hurt.

692
01:35:14,720 --> 01:35:16,348
Thank you very much.

693
01:35:20,708 --> 01:35:21,732
Gramps!

694
01:35:22,476 --> 01:35:25,241
I need to use some tools!

695
01:35:25,721 --> 01:35:27,849
You don't need them, do you?

696
01:35:28,215 --> 01:35:29,342
And also,

697
01:35:30,017 --> 01:35:33,977
is it okay for me to repair...

698
01:35:34,630 --> 01:35:38,830
the roof of the unused warehouse?

699
01:36:33,300 --> 01:36:35,266
Hey! Keep crushing!

700
01:36:51,519 --> 01:36:53,681
You finally took them all out!

701
01:37:01,919 --> 01:37:03,888
Which temple is it?

702
01:37:05,022 --> 01:37:07,958
The Jiganji Temple.
It's a decent one.

703
01:37:18,705 --> 01:37:19,729
Master!

704
01:37:40,103 --> 01:37:41,360
Today,

705
01:37:41,703 --> 01:37:45,868
two of our villagers
received conscription cards.

706
01:37:48,147 --> 01:37:50,889
I hope Kanji
won't receive it this time.

707
01:37:54,909 --> 01:37:59,337
I think Mr. Kanjiro officially left
the military in Manchuria.

708
01:38:01,679 --> 01:38:04,649
Conscription can take place
more than once.

709
01:38:06,672 --> 01:38:10,238
Tsuneichi,
who received the card today,

710
01:38:11,500 --> 01:38:13,435
is almost fifty.

711
01:38:18,914 --> 01:38:20,610
Kanji's older brother...

712
01:38:21,301 --> 01:38:23,738
died four years ago.

713
01:38:25,923 --> 01:38:27,687
As a brother,

714
01:38:29,460 --> 01:38:35,593
Kanji made
his older brother's wife as his.

715
01:38:38,868 --> 01:38:40,995
They did not have any children.

716
01:38:42,801 --> 01:38:45,134
I thought it was better
for the family...

717
01:38:45,730 --> 01:38:48,256
that they didn't have children.

718
01:38:51,120 --> 01:38:52,782
But in the end,

719
01:38:53,406 --> 01:38:55,341
the wife ran away from home.

720
01:38:58,226 --> 01:39:02,220
Some people even spread
malicious rumors about that.

721
01:39:06,616 --> 01:39:08,744
She was a beautiful woman.

722
01:39:13,123 --> 01:39:16,169
Three of them had been
very close with each other.

723
01:39:18,730 --> 01:39:19,925
That must...

724
01:39:21,317 --> 01:39:24,571
have made Kanji suffer deeply.

725
01:40:45,009 --> 01:40:46,773
In the night,

726
01:40:47,269 --> 01:40:49,649
someone called me out.

727
01:40:51,624 --> 01:40:53,923
He even shouted my name.

728
01:40:54,335 --> 01:40:56,912
So, I got out.
There was no one.

729
01:40:59,507 --> 01:41:02,067
That kind of thing
continued for days.

730
01:41:02,759 --> 01:41:05,511
People told me that foxes did that.

731
01:41:10,872 --> 01:41:15,742
If that is so,
foxes don't know the concept of time.

732
01:41:16,177 --> 01:41:17,736
If they cannot answer...

733
01:41:19,491 --> 01:41:22,154
when I ask for the time,

734
01:41:22,537 --> 01:41:24,470
it means that it was
a fox who did it.

735
01:41:25,910 --> 01:41:27,469
I see.

736
01:41:29,979 --> 01:41:35,836
So, I asked them,
""What time is it?""

737
01:41:37,457 --> 01:41:39,187
How interesting.

738
01:41:40,420 --> 01:41:42,082
And the answer was?

739
01:41:43,840 --> 01:41:46,503
They jumped once,

740
01:41:48,405 --> 01:41:51,366
""Time is time.""

741
01:41:52,876 --> 01:41:54,310
They told me.

742
01:42:12,469 --> 01:42:16,873
I also like the story
of a ghost train.

743
01:42:19,368 --> 01:42:23,635
In the Meiji era, a railroad was built
on the outskirts of the village.

744
01:42:26,717 --> 01:42:30,781
One night,
a train crossed the rice field.

745
01:42:31,638 --> 01:42:34,540
Another train came
from the opposite direction.

746
01:42:36,593 --> 01:42:40,155
The train operator got scared
and stopped the train.

747
01:42:40,532 --> 01:42:43,024
The other train stopped as well...

748
01:42:43,487 --> 01:42:44,887
and disappeared.

749
01:42:47,204 --> 01:42:50,072
That kind of thing kept happening.

750
01:42:51,452 --> 01:42:53,045
One day,

751
01:42:53,473 --> 01:42:55,169
he turned off the light...

752
01:42:55,447 --> 01:42:58,884
and kept advancing,
honking its horn.

753
01:43:01,479 --> 01:43:07,248
The train disappeared
right before it was about to crash.

754
01:43:12,362 --> 01:43:13,694
On the next day,

755
01:43:14,230 --> 01:43:16,049
due to the train crash,

756
01:43:16,243 --> 01:43:21,031
several foxes were found dead.

757
01:43:34,842 --> 01:43:36,578
These fox tales,

758
01:43:37,311 --> 01:43:39,507
don't make much sense.

759
01:43:40,787 --> 01:43:42,915
But I can easily guess...

760
01:43:43,323 --> 01:43:48,694
what kind of emotions the villagers hide
in their minds when they tell them.

761
01:43:49,994 --> 01:43:52,964
Even I don't know exactly...

762
01:43:56,503 --> 01:43:58,062
who started that story.

763
01:43:58,705 --> 01:44:01,174
Was it the train operator?

764
01:44:01,715 --> 01:44:03,980
Or perhaps a villager?

765
01:44:04,744 --> 01:44:06,713
We will never know.

766
01:44:09,182 --> 01:44:12,976
As the story moves
from one person to another,

767
01:44:13,268 --> 01:44:14,600
it changes.

768
01:44:16,910 --> 01:44:21,101
The emotion of each person
who delivers the story,

769
01:44:21,370 --> 01:44:23,464
changes it forever.

770
01:44:29,117 --> 01:44:31,364
And at some point,

771
01:44:31,552 --> 01:44:34,147
the subject becomes ambiguous,

772
01:44:34,626 --> 01:44:37,095
and the story
becomes everybody's story.

773
01:44:43,950 --> 01:44:48,752
Foxes, just like humans,
live around the mountains.

774
01:44:49,966 --> 01:44:53,562
They are the Gods
of Rice Farming too.

775
01:44:56,615 --> 01:44:59,460
Every rice farmer hopes
that today...

776
01:45:00,133 --> 01:45:02,159
will be a peaceful day

777
01:45:03,236 --> 01:45:05,797
just like yesterday.

778
01:45:10,969 --> 01:45:12,631
One wonders if they...

779
01:45:12,994 --> 01:45:19,195
really wanted modern-day civilization and
enlightenment forced down by the government.

780
01:45:22,800 --> 01:45:24,792
Come back safely.

781
01:45:34,996 --> 01:45:36,760
Don't die!

782
01:45:45,022 --> 01:45:46,046
Yes!

783
01:46:18,897 --> 01:46:21,075
We are living a crucial moment.

784
01:46:21,275 --> 01:46:24,404
Even if you go to the battlefield,

785
01:46:25,187 --> 01:46:28,167
nobody can guarantee your safety.

786
01:46:30,685 --> 01:46:33,519
The reason why
I brought you here today...

787
01:46:33,915 --> 01:46:36,441
is that I want to hold
the art exhibition...

788
01:46:36,917 --> 01:46:41,465
we've been looking forward to
despite the big battle approaching.

789
01:46:42,989 --> 01:46:48,360
First, look at the material in front
of you and think of an image.

790
01:47:49,469 --> 01:47:50,562
Master.

791
01:47:51,908 --> 01:47:53,376
Can you come?

792
01:49:43,842 --> 01:49:45,640
It's an intense shower.

793
01:49:48,105 --> 01:49:49,869
It is indeed.

794
01:49:51,375 --> 01:49:53,276
It's already been three days.

795
01:49:55,053 --> 01:49:56,919
Unlike in the cities,

796
01:49:57,692 --> 01:50:01,129
there is no place to go
when it rains in the countryside.

797
01:50:02,686 --> 01:50:04,552
Just like a small child,

798
01:50:04,807 --> 01:50:09,245
I really want to go outside as soon
as possible. That's what I thought.

799
01:50:14,725 --> 01:50:16,626
Since I came to the village,

800
01:50:17,110 --> 01:50:21,480
my hearing has improved a lot,
catching every single sound.

801
01:50:23,674 --> 01:50:28,374
I can even hear various kinds
of sounds from the roof,

802
01:50:30,316 --> 01:50:31,944
soft ones,

803
01:50:32,732 --> 01:50:34,124
loud ones.

804
01:50:36,403 --> 01:50:41,068
It is fun to guess which part
of the roof gets hit...

805
01:50:41,630 --> 01:50:44,897
when I hear a certain sound.

806
01:51:06,218 --> 01:51:07,652
They are impressive.

807
01:51:10,435 --> 01:51:12,084
Painters.

808
01:51:16,806 --> 01:51:18,297
What happened?

809
01:51:25,201 --> 01:51:30,270
I am just putting a flower like this.
That's all.

810
01:51:41,754 --> 01:51:43,848
I think this war painting...

811
01:51:45,485 --> 01:51:48,108
might be the last one.

812
01:52:16,355 --> 01:52:22,492
I saw a billow of smoke
in the mountain.

813
01:52:24,940 --> 01:52:29,002
Are there some people living
on the opposite side of the river?

814
01:52:33,742 --> 01:52:38,039
A charcoal maker entered
the mountain a long time ago...

815
01:52:38,830 --> 01:52:41,659
and has not come back ever since.

816
01:52:44,246 --> 01:52:46,078
With his family?

817
01:52:47,588 --> 01:52:50,305
No, alone.

818
01:52:54,632 --> 01:52:57,805
Can I cross the river?

819
01:53:02,137 --> 01:53:05,471
When you walk several miles
toward the west,

820
01:53:06,010 --> 01:53:08,360
the river gradually becomes
narrower.

821
01:53:08,870 --> 01:53:11,572
And you will find a big cut
at some point.

822
01:53:12,640 --> 01:53:16,294
You can reach the opposite side
right away using that cut.

823
01:54:57,099 --> 01:55:00,162
What is inside the basket?

824
01:55:01,123 --> 01:55:02,716
Salted fish.

825
01:55:05,704 --> 01:55:07,488
Are you selling them?

826
01:55:07,705 --> 01:55:10,943
Yes, since my father's generation.

827
01:55:12,195 --> 01:55:16,698
I am just doing
what my father used to do.

828
01:55:22,397 --> 01:55:24,696
<i>Since my father's generation.</i>

829
01:55:25,177 --> 01:55:29,919
<i>I am just doing
what my father used to do.</i>

00:00:27,543 --> 00:00:33,125
SMALL TOWN KILLERS

2
00:00:46,584 --> 00:00:47,708
Well...

3
00:00:47,834 --> 00:00:50,750
So, all you think about is sex?

4
00:00:50,876 --> 00:00:53,375
His head is bursting with sex thoughts.

5
00:00:53,501 --> 00:00:58,875
Gritt, let's let Ib answer for himself.
I think Ib is able to.

6
00:00:59,001 --> 00:01:03,708
Well, answer for yourself, Ib. Tell
Aniannani that your head is full of sex.

7
00:01:03,834 --> 00:01:08,375
No, no, I do sometimes have
other thoughts in my head.

8
00:01:08,501 --> 00:01:11,541
If I ask him to water the plants,
he gets a hard-on.

9
00:01:11,667 --> 00:01:15,125
- Oh?
- He can't even reach the window sill.

10
00:01:15,251 --> 00:01:17,541
Oh my.

11
00:01:17,667 --> 00:01:20,875
It's only because
I think she's so gorgeous.

12
00:01:21,001 --> 00:01:25,666
Well, that's great, Gritt.
Isn't it?

13
00:01:25,792 --> 00:01:30,708
You have a man who wants you.
I'm sure many women would envy you that.

14
00:01:30,834 --> 00:01:34,375
Sure, but does everything have
to be about sex all the time?

15
00:01:34,501 --> 00:01:37,375
The public domain is crammed with sex.

16
00:01:37,501 --> 00:01:40,208
- You can't even open a magazine.
- No...

17
00:01:40,334 --> 00:01:44,708
If I go online to find a good offer,
I get a picture of a wiener.

18
00:01:45,834 --> 00:01:46,916
Yuckie.

19
00:01:47,042 --> 00:01:50,291
And if you can't even
go to your own house -

20
00:01:50,417 --> 00:01:54,041
- and lie down in your own bed without
being confronted with sex there, too...

21
00:01:54,167 --> 00:01:57,791
Where the devil will it end?

22
00:01:58,501 --> 00:02:02,625
Hi there, you hot piece of ass.

23
00:02:02,751 --> 00:02:05,291
Hi.

24
00:02:05,417 --> 00:02:07,666
So, who are you then?

25
00:02:07,792 --> 00:02:10,666
Oh, I'm just Ingrid's ass.

26
00:02:10,792 --> 00:02:12,583
Oh, I see.

27
00:02:12,709 --> 00:02:16,791
How would you like me to grope you?

28
00:02:16,917 --> 00:02:18,458
Well, go ahead.

29
00:02:18,584 --> 00:02:23,916
Stop talking to my butt as if
it's a pet. You'll confuse Little Per.

30
00:02:24,042 --> 00:02:27,041
You're making me nervous.
It's sick, Edward.

31
00:02:27,167 --> 00:02:29,477
Why do you have to rehearse
that fancy-pants dance every night?

32
00:02:29,501 --> 00:02:33,083
Fancy-pants dance?
Salsa is an art form.

33
00:02:33,209 --> 00:02:37,458
But then again, your head isn't filled
with art but stone wool, more like it.

34
00:02:37,584 --> 00:02:41,791
When was the last time we fucked?
When was it?

35
00:02:41,917 --> 00:02:46,000
- Do you know your Danish history?
- Sure. I live with the Grauballe Man.

36
00:02:46,084 --> 00:02:49,916
- That bog body gets more sex than me.
- Call Ib.

37
00:02:50,042 --> 00:02:54,625
- I'm not in the mood for sex with Ib.
- Don't you have to go to work?

38
00:02:54,751 --> 00:02:58,125
You and Ib and your wieners.

39
00:02:58,251 --> 00:03:01,833
Maybe they'll let you
have a go after work.

40
00:04:20,251 --> 00:04:22,916
Don't be embarrassed about being a man.

41
00:04:23,042 --> 00:04:26,833
But I think about sex all the time.

42
00:04:29,042 --> 00:04:31,625
It's because you never get laid.

43
00:04:31,751 --> 00:04:35,250
If you did, you wouldn't
think about it all the time.

44
00:04:35,376 --> 00:04:36,500
It's like breathing.

45
00:04:36,626 --> 00:04:40,791
If you were sitting in a submarine
running out of oxygen -

46
00:04:40,917 --> 00:04:43,000
- you'd think about breathing
all the time.

47
00:04:43,126 --> 00:04:46,541
Women don't understand
that sex is our way of breathing.

48
00:04:46,667 --> 00:04:49,000
Our dick is kinda like our third lung.

49
00:04:50,417 --> 00:04:54,250
Gritt still wants to have kids,
but I'm not keen on it.

50
00:04:54,376 --> 00:04:58,500
Of course not. They climb into bed
and lie in the crack.

51
00:04:58,626 --> 00:05:04,333
Kids are crap.
There's no upside to it. None at all.

52
00:05:04,459 --> 00:05:07,458
There's nothing doing with Ingrid.
She doesn't want to have sex.

53
00:05:07,584 --> 00:05:10,416
Even if I promise
it'll only take 15 seconds.

54
00:05:10,542 --> 00:05:14,791
So, problems at home?

55
00:05:14,917 --> 00:05:18,500
The bricks are on back order,
Mrs. Hansen. It's a load of bull.

56
00:05:18,626 --> 00:05:21,250
But aren't bricks always available?

57
00:05:21,376 --> 00:05:25,416
Bricks aren't just bricks,
as I've told you once before.

58
00:05:25,542 --> 00:05:30,916
- I just need a new wall.
- Right, and Rome was built in a day.

59
00:05:31,042 --> 00:05:35,541
I clean forgot.
Thanks for reminding me, Mrs. Hansen.

60
00:05:35,667 --> 00:05:37,125
Thanks a lot.

61
00:05:37,251 --> 00:05:40,125
There are two kinds of customers.

62
00:05:40,251 --> 00:05:43,041
With one kind,
you're only in it for the cool cash.

63
00:05:43,167 --> 00:05:46,250
With the other kind, like you,
you put your heart into it.

64
00:05:46,376 --> 00:05:49,833
- And finish the job!
- Yes, absolutely.

65
00:05:50,001 --> 00:05:53,583
Van Gogh didn't paint for the money.
He painted with his heart.

66
00:05:53,709 --> 00:05:57,875
Are you quite sure
you've got time for this?

67
00:05:59,792 --> 00:06:02,000
Hey, there's our radio and stuff.

68
00:06:02,084 --> 00:06:05,916
We wouldn't leave our radio and stuff
here if we weren't working here.

69
00:06:06,042 --> 00:06:09,416
Ib has been on the phone all morning
about those bricks.

70
00:06:09,542 --> 00:06:13,000
We almost gave up on you,
but then, your radio and stuff are here.

71
00:06:13,834 --> 00:06:17,458
- Honestly, have you got time for this?
- No...

72
00:06:17,584 --> 00:06:20,041
- Look, Steen.
- Henrik.

73
00:06:20,167 --> 00:06:24,916
There are two kinds of customers. With
one kind, you're in it for the cash.

74
00:06:25,042 --> 00:06:27,875
- With the other, you put this into it.
- Your heart.

75
00:06:28,001 --> 00:06:30,250
That's what you said a month ago.

76
00:06:36,042 --> 00:06:40,625
I thought you wanted the bill dealt with
under the table.

77
00:06:44,001 --> 00:06:48,833
Didn't they want the bill dealt with
under the table? I thought so.

78
00:06:49,001 --> 00:06:55,125
But, Steen,
we'll do it by the book. No worries.

79
00:06:55,251 --> 00:06:59,166
It's gonna cost you, but if you want
to upgrade to Business Class -

80
00:06:59,292 --> 00:07:03,416
- we'll do it. We can upgrade Steen
and Pernille to Business Class, right?

81
00:07:03,542 --> 00:07:09,916
Sure. You get to sit up front with
champagne and silverware everywhere.

82
00:07:10,042 --> 00:07:13,500
No, no, that's not
what we want, right, Henrik?

83
00:07:13,626 --> 00:07:16,083
No, no.

84
00:07:16,209 --> 00:07:21,083
- We'll just wait.
- Or we can wait. Whatever you want.

85
00:07:22,834 --> 00:07:27,000
We've filled the book for the next six
months. How manyjobs are undeclared?

86
00:07:27,126 --> 00:07:29,541
Just about half a million kroner.

87
00:07:33,709 --> 00:07:37,583
Ingrid is faking it the other way round.

88
00:07:37,709 --> 00:07:41,000
- The few times I get to sneak it in.
- The other way round?

89
00:07:41,126 --> 00:07:46,208
She pretends not to come, but she does.
I can tell that she's coming, Ib.

90
00:07:46,334 --> 00:07:50,250
She stuffs her hand in her mouth
and thinks I don't notice.

91
00:07:53,042 --> 00:07:57,625
But she's coming alright.
She's coming hard.

92
00:07:57,751 --> 00:08:01,041
- But why does she do that?
- So I won't see I give her pleasure.

93
00:08:01,167 --> 00:08:03,750
Oh no, Heinz.

94
00:08:07,876 --> 00:08:11,041
Hey there, Laurel and Hardy.
Hans and Fritz.

95
00:08:11,167 --> 00:08:14,500
Or what are the names of
the two guys from Dumb and Dumber?

96
00:08:14,626 --> 00:08:19,000
- Harry and Lloyd.
- Exactly. How's life, Harry and Lloyd?

97
00:08:19,084 --> 00:08:23,708
Careful or you might shoot yourself
in the thigh with that thing.

98
00:08:23,834 --> 00:08:27,750
This thing...
is a Korth Combat. 357 Magnum.

99
00:08:27,876 --> 00:08:31,500
It goes by another name, too.
""Responsibility"".

100
00:08:31,626 --> 00:08:34,106
The responsibility for making sure
citizens can sleep at night.

101
00:08:34,209 --> 00:08:37,750
- Do you tuck in?
- Terrorists don't sleep at night.

102
00:08:37,876 --> 00:08:40,458
Some people have to be vigilant, 24-7.

103
00:08:40,584 --> 00:08:44,750
You may very well ask:
What's gonna happen in Nibe?

104
00:08:45,626 --> 00:08:50,458
We go to work, watch X Factor, drive
scummy cars and eat humid sandwiches.

105
00:08:50,584 --> 00:08:53,000
Peace and quiet everywhere.

106
00:08:53,126 --> 00:08:55,458
But that's just
what they want us to believe.

107
00:08:55,584 --> 00:08:58,916
Nibe doesn't even show up
on Google Earth.

108
00:08:59,042 --> 00:09:03,208
It's one big grey pixel. The little
yellow man can't move an inch.

109
00:09:04,084 --> 00:09:08,833
Anyway, what would the terrorists
blow up? The local bus stop?

110
00:09:12,126 --> 00:09:16,750
- What do you need all those radios for?
- You can learn a lot from the radio.

111
00:09:16,876 --> 00:09:20,083
I just checked up on your tax returns.

112
00:09:20,209 --> 00:09:25,000
Your little juggernaut of a company
sure rakes in money.

113
00:09:25,084 --> 00:09:28,000
- 125,000 kroner a year.
- That much?

114
00:09:28,126 --> 00:09:30,458
Not bad.

115
00:09:30,584 --> 00:09:33,083
You're frigging pathetic.

116
00:09:33,209 --> 00:09:37,000
Your wives drive Mercedes
and dance in high heels with Malte -

117
00:09:37,126 --> 00:09:41,041
- while you sit here looking like a
couple of early retirees from Bulgaria.

118
00:09:41,167 --> 00:09:45,125
Dumb and Dumber.
Don't make me laugh.

119
00:09:50,209 --> 00:09:53,791
Your right tail light is out.
Have a nice day.

120
00:09:55,751 --> 00:09:59,791
Come here, my angels.
Come.

121
00:10:00,709 --> 00:10:06,583
We may be in a small town,
but we don't think small -

122
00:10:06,709 --> 00:10:10,166
- because salsa is in-ter-na-tio-nal.

123
00:10:10,292 --> 00:10:14,583
Understand? When we shake
our booties to salsa in Nibe -

124
00:10:14,709 --> 00:10:18,666
- they shake their booties
to salsa in Cuba or Rio -

125
00:10:18,792 --> 00:10:21,000
- in exactly the same way.

126
00:10:21,126 --> 00:10:25,250
We're one big family.
One big pulse -

127
00:10:25,376 --> 00:10:29,083
- beating away inside of us -

128
00:10:29,209 --> 00:10:32,416
- men and women.

129
00:10:33,209 --> 00:10:37,916
We started this class
when fate brought me to Nibe.

130
00:10:38,042 --> 00:10:44,291
And I saw all these withered Danes
under the grey sky.

131
00:10:45,417 --> 00:10:47,208
Then something happened.

132
00:10:47,334 --> 00:10:52,208
Suddenly you grew
into goddamn towering tulips.

133
00:10:52,334 --> 00:10:56,166
Up through the frozen earth,
and you blossomed -

134
00:10:56,292 --> 00:11:00,791
- and tasted
the sweet pain of the salsa.

135
00:11:02,084 --> 00:11:05,708
Desire and sensuality.

136
00:11:07,001 --> 00:11:12,791
And now, dear friends,
it's time to ""haul ass"", as you say.

137
00:11:12,917 --> 00:11:16,000
- Are you ready to haul ass?
- Yes!

138
00:11:16,667 --> 00:11:19,375
Five, six, seven, eight.

139
00:11:28,751 --> 00:11:32,250
Come to Papa!

140
00:11:42,876 --> 00:11:45,166
Salsa for Papi!

141
00:11:54,292 --> 00:11:57,708
Malte is such a breath offresh air.

142
00:11:57,834 --> 00:12:01,500
It doesn't matter if you're from
Nibe or Hollywood.

143
00:12:01,626 --> 00:12:04,916
You grow with him.
I feel I've grown.

144
00:12:05,042 --> 00:12:07,791
Malte has helped us grow, hasn't he?

145
00:12:07,917 --> 00:12:12,291
If Malte wasn't gay,
I bet he'd be a fantastic lover.

146
00:12:12,417 --> 00:12:13,291
Hey!

147
00:12:13,417 --> 00:12:16,083
You can be a good lover
even though you're abnormal.

148
00:12:16,209 --> 00:12:19,875
- Got anything against gays?
- Edward's afraid of gays.

149
00:12:20,001 --> 00:12:24,500
I just don't get gay sex.
Two little bald men headbutting away.

150
00:12:24,626 --> 00:12:28,000
- Men have a hole too.
- Made for something else.

151
00:12:28,084 --> 00:12:31,125
Oh, I don't know.
Ib often circles around that hole.

152
00:12:31,251 --> 00:12:34,583
- Come on, Gritt!
- Like a hungry cat around a p�t�.

153
00:12:34,709 --> 00:12:37,625
But that's one way
to avoid having children.

154
00:12:37,751 --> 00:12:41,000
When Edward and I loved each other,
we talked about children, too -

155
00:12:41,084 --> 00:12:43,041
- but then we got Little Per.

156
00:12:43,167 --> 00:12:47,583
- Little Per is your surrogate child.
- Hell no!

157
00:12:47,709 --> 00:12:52,916
Is it wrong, if your husband's sperm
quality is okay, to look for a donor?

158
00:12:53,042 --> 00:12:58,583
Women should be free to use the sperm
they want. And Ib doesn't want kids.

159
00:12:58,709 --> 00:13:02,458
Try talking a bit louder.
Table 5 can't hear you.

160
00:13:02,584 --> 00:13:06,000
- It must be hard with a guy his size.
- For fuck's sake!

161
00:13:06,126 --> 00:13:11,625
I often think about it when I see you
side by side. He's huge and you're tiny.

162
00:13:11,751 --> 00:13:14,250
- How does he...
- Get it in?

163
00:13:14,376 --> 00:13:18,833
- Yes, technically.
- Well, he only manages to peek in.

164
00:13:19,001 --> 00:13:23,208
- Kinda like the Little Match Girl.
- ""Hullo!""

165
00:13:26,251 --> 00:13:29,125
In a little turtleneck.

166
00:13:30,626 --> 00:13:35,375
It's all down to position. No guy can
get in from all corners of the world.

167
00:13:35,501 --> 00:13:38,875
And it's down to how wide
the woman can spread her legs.

168
00:13:39,001 --> 00:13:42,333
- What do you mean, Edward?
- Is this wine sour?

169
00:13:42,459 --> 00:13:48,000
It's sour!
Bent, what kind of red wine is this?

170
00:13:50,167 --> 00:13:53,083
It is...

171
00:13:53,209 --> 00:13:56,500
It is...

172
00:13:58,334 --> 00:14:00,500
It is -

173
00:14:00,626 --> 00:14:03,208
- a red wine.

174
00:14:03,334 --> 00:14:07,583
- Well, I can see that. It's red.
- Leave Bent alone.

175
00:14:07,709 --> 00:14:11,250
- Fine, Bent. Thanks.
- You're welcome.

176
00:14:11,376 --> 00:14:15,333
Who the hell hires a spazz as a waiter?
How does he serve soup?

177
00:14:15,459 --> 00:14:20,250
- I'd like to announce to the table...
- Good thing he isn't a brain surgeon.

178
00:14:20,376 --> 00:14:25,583
I have no problem spreading my legs.
I could do the splits until recently.

179
00:14:25,709 --> 00:14:30,166
Gritt's parents thought for a long time
that Gritt would become a model -

180
00:14:30,292 --> 00:14:34,791
- but then she stopped growing
at the age of 12.

181
00:14:37,292 --> 00:14:39,333
Right!

182
00:14:39,459 --> 00:14:44,000
I guess five-foot tall models
aren't in huge demand -

183
00:14:44,084 --> 00:14:47,875
- unless it's for a hobbit movie.

184
00:14:49,459 --> 00:14:54,500
But hey, good for fairy Malte
that he makes you grow and grow -

185
00:14:54,626 --> 00:14:58,458
- and believe that Hollywood
is located in the church -

186
00:14:58,584 --> 00:15:02,083
- every day between 8 and 10 p. m.

187
00:15:13,709 --> 00:15:18,208
- Ib, we're done with this shit.
- What do you mean?

188
00:15:19,376 --> 00:15:23,666
Heinz is right.
We are Dumb and Dumber.

189
00:15:25,001 --> 00:15:29,375
But we're still young, Ib.
We've got money -

190
00:15:29,501 --> 00:15:34,333
- and we've worked our asses off
ever since we got kicked out of school.

191
00:15:34,459 --> 00:15:38,166
Let's go to Phuket.
We can live like kings there.

192
00:15:38,292 --> 00:15:40,500
We deserve better.

193
00:15:40,626 --> 00:15:45,666
I didn't like the atmosphere in there.
It got a little embarrassing.

194
00:15:45,792 --> 00:15:50,041
Yeah, just a little perhaps.
You're right, Ib.

195
00:15:50,167 --> 00:15:54,250
And we won't get any pussy tonight,
anyway.

196
00:15:57,501 --> 00:15:59,666
Precisely.

197
00:16:01,251 --> 00:16:05,000
We lead an empty and pussy-less life.

198
00:16:09,376 --> 00:16:12,250
- Let's get a divorce.
- You mean that?

199
00:16:12,376 --> 00:16:14,333
I sure as hell do!

200
00:16:19,167 --> 00:16:22,250
- Who recommended me to you?
- No one.

201
00:16:22,376 --> 00:16:25,083
You were the cheapest hit
on PriceRunner.

202
00:16:26,376 --> 00:16:31,041
- You want a divorce?
- Yes. It's gone all Bulgarian on us.

203
00:16:31,167 --> 00:16:34,750
- It's gotten boring.
- Any infidelity?

204
00:16:34,876 --> 00:16:39,000
Not unless dancing with a sissy Swede
qualifies as infidelity.

205
00:16:39,084 --> 00:16:42,375
- So is that you?
- Me?

206
00:16:42,501 --> 00:16:45,000
Who dances around
with a sissy Swede?

207
00:16:45,084 --> 00:16:48,000
We're not the ones getting a divorce.
Hell no.

208
00:16:48,126 --> 00:16:53,208
- No, we're married to our wife.
- To the same woman? But you can't!

209
00:16:53,334 --> 00:16:56,083
- No, we've got one each.
- I see.

210
00:16:56,209 --> 00:17:00,208
So you want to divorce your wives
so you two can get married?

211
00:17:00,334 --> 00:17:03,000
No, we just want to divorce them.

212
00:17:03,084 --> 00:17:06,666
We thought we'd save money
if we chipped in.

213
00:17:06,792 --> 00:17:10,833
- Chipped in?
- Yeah, for you.

214
00:17:12,001 --> 00:17:16,833
- Yes, well, the divorce rules...
- Let me just say one thing.

215
00:17:17,001 --> 00:17:21,375
We want to take good care of the girls.
They must never want for anything.

216
00:17:21,501 --> 00:17:24,500
They haven't lifted a finger
in ten years -

217
00:17:24,626 --> 00:17:28,625
- but we won't leave them in the ditch
without a penny.

218
00:17:28,751 --> 00:17:32,500
- I agree.
- The rules are simple.

219
00:17:32,626 --> 00:17:37,333
- You share everything.
- Sure. They should have their share.

220
00:17:37,459 --> 00:17:41,250
When I look at your assets -

221
00:17:41,376 --> 00:17:46,250
- it all looks pretty good.
Two cars...

222
00:17:46,376 --> 00:17:49,333
Houses...

223
00:17:50,459 --> 00:17:54,791
Property valuation, bills -

224
00:17:54,917 --> 00:17:59,833
- and all of that. You have
pretty large pension savings, huh?

225
00:18:00,792 --> 00:18:03,333
And... Oh, not bad.

226
00:18:03,459 --> 00:18:05,291
All in all...

227
00:18:06,334 --> 00:18:07,625
Yes!

228
00:18:08,917 --> 00:18:12,541
- 2.5 for each.
- Thousand?

229
00:18:12,667 --> 00:18:16,833
- But that's not a whole lot.
- Million.

230
00:18:17,001 --> 00:18:20,750
You have a large equity in your houses
seeing as you built them yourselves.

231
00:18:20,876 --> 00:18:27,333
Add to that alimony amounting
to 4-5,000 kroner a month, minimum.

232
00:18:28,792 --> 00:18:33,625
I hope you feel it was worth it.
On the other hand...

233
00:18:37,001 --> 00:18:40,416
...you got the lawyer cheaper.

234
00:18:42,334 --> 00:18:43,833
Well, I have a meeting now.

235
00:18:44,001 --> 00:18:48,875
Feel free to hang around
and recover from the blow.

236
00:18:49,001 --> 00:18:52,041
Kleenex.
Chipped in...!

237
00:18:52,751 --> 00:18:56,000
- Edward...
- I think I'm going to be sick, Ib.

238
00:18:56,084 --> 00:19:00,458
We've got the undeclared money.
Nobody knows about that.

239
00:19:04,001 --> 00:19:07,666
Of course!
Ib, we've got the undeclared money.

240
00:19:16,626 --> 00:19:18,916
What the hell is going on?

241
00:19:19,042 --> 00:19:22,041
Oh my lord!

242
00:19:24,001 --> 00:19:27,041
She's on her knees.

243
00:19:30,667 --> 00:19:33,916
That's fucking disgusting.
It's not fair.

244
00:19:34,042 --> 00:19:36,750
He's not even handsome.

245
00:19:36,876 --> 00:19:41,458
- Please repeat that.
- Well, that's the lie of the land.

246
00:19:41,584 --> 00:19:44,916
We've reached the end-station.
You'll get some hard cash -

247
00:19:45,042 --> 00:19:49,625
- and we'll skip the lawyer crap
that only serves to confuse you.

248
00:19:49,751 --> 00:19:54,791
- Please say it one more time.
- Well, we've reached the end-station.

249
00:19:54,917 --> 00:20:00,000
You'll get some hard cash and we'll skip
the lawyer crap that only confuses you.

250
00:20:00,126 --> 00:20:05,125
- It what?
- Confuses you. All that paperwork...

251
00:20:05,251 --> 00:20:08,125
Do I look like an idiot?
Huh?

252
00:20:08,251 --> 00:20:11,916
We have assets worth
five million kroner.

253
00:20:12,042 --> 00:20:16,291
Add to that maximum alimony,
not to mention all the undeclared money.

254
00:20:16,417 --> 00:20:19,833
- What undeclared money do you mean?
- What undeclared money?

255
00:20:20,001 --> 00:20:24,166
- There isn't any undeclared money.
- It's in the fridge in the cellar.

256
00:20:25,209 --> 00:20:27,708
What cellar?

257
00:20:30,709 --> 00:20:32,916
Well, that...

258
00:20:34,251 --> 00:20:38,083
That's the fridge in the cellar.
You're spying on us?

259
00:20:38,209 --> 00:20:41,791
As you said,
we've reached the end-station -

260
00:20:41,917 --> 00:20:45,250
- so one of us has to get off
and walk back -

261
00:20:45,376 --> 00:20:50,708
- and it's only fair that it's you.
You always wear sensible work shoes.

262
00:20:50,834 --> 00:20:53,250
I'm more of a stiletto girl.

263
00:20:56,751 --> 00:21:00,000
- Piglet.
- Yes?

264
00:21:10,417 --> 00:21:13,291
I know this may come as a shock.

265
00:21:13,417 --> 00:21:17,583
How odd!
Ingrid's getting divorced today, too.

266
00:21:20,376 --> 00:21:24,000
Our money. All our money!

267
00:21:26,292 --> 00:21:29,625
We had it all!

268
00:21:29,751 --> 00:21:35,291
Let's just drop the whole idea
and get a sex life online.

269
00:21:35,417 --> 00:21:36,625
- No!
- Yes!

270
00:21:36,751 --> 00:21:40,708
Sex involves both hands.

271
00:21:41,667 --> 00:21:43,750
Both hands!

272
00:21:46,709 --> 00:21:49,083
Both hands!

273
00:21:49,209 --> 00:21:53,250
If only they'd never existed.

274
00:21:53,376 --> 00:21:57,708
It would be so much easier to get
divorced if they weren't there.

275
00:21:57,834 --> 00:22:02,166
You don't have to give half
of everything to someone -

276
00:22:02,292 --> 00:22:07,208
- if they aren't there. If none of us
existed, we wouldn't have a problem.

277
00:22:11,001 --> 00:22:15,666
- Do you know what you're saying?
- Yes! No...

278
00:22:15,792 --> 00:22:18,375
If they weren't here...

279
00:22:18,501 --> 00:22:24,000
- How about we hire a hitman?
- Yes.

280
00:22:24,084 --> 00:22:27,250
- From the east. From Russia.
- Yes!

281
00:22:27,376 --> 00:22:31,833
They're sick in the head.
And they're broke.

282
00:22:32,001 --> 00:22:33,916
We'll send for one.

283
00:22:34,042 --> 00:22:36,291
Bang bang.

284
00:22:36,417 --> 00:22:40,666
Wham bang thank you ma'am.

285
00:22:49,292 --> 00:22:51,750
Edward...

286
00:23:12,876 --> 00:23:16,125
Yeah, a guy from the East.

287
00:25:33,751 --> 00:25:38,916
Hello.
Hi, Edward. So you're awake?

288
00:25:39,042 --> 00:25:44,125
No, he's been asleep for 48 hours.
Or maybe he's dead. I didn't check.

289
00:25:46,084 --> 00:25:48,625
Are you dead?

290
00:25:51,084 --> 00:25:54,541
- You hired a Russian hitman!
- I was drunk!

291
00:25:54,667 --> 00:25:59,041
So was I, but I didn't hire
a goddamn Russian hitman!

292
00:25:59,167 --> 00:26:01,916
A Russian hitman.
I'm going insane!

293
00:26:02,042 --> 00:26:04,083
Stupid, stupid Edward!

294
00:26:04,209 --> 00:26:06,000
Gritt, I'm sorry!

295
00:26:06,084 --> 00:26:08,000
Stupid, stupid Edward!

296
00:26:08,126 --> 00:26:12,541
Shit! You're gonna have
to call it off. It's as simple as that.

297
00:26:12,667 --> 00:26:15,000
Write and call the whole thing off.

298
00:26:15,084 --> 00:26:18,916
I told you already, I tried.
The link expired.

299
00:26:19,042 --> 00:26:24,000
You pay half, and the link expires.
That's the deal when you hire a hitman.

300
00:26:24,084 --> 00:26:28,000
All that's left is this.
Igor Lad... whatever.

301
00:26:28,126 --> 00:26:31,291
Arrival from Kiev 2:45 p. m.

302
00:26:31,417 --> 00:26:34,750
He's on his way?!

303
00:26:34,876 --> 00:26:39,000
Maybe he won't recognize us.
All he knows is that we live in Nibe -

304
00:26:39,084 --> 00:26:43,541
- and there are lots of people in Nibe.
A whole lot.

305
00:26:43,667 --> 00:26:46,833
There are people living in Nibe
in all kinds of houses.

306
00:26:47,001 --> 00:26:50,041
But he's got the email address
and the name.

307
00:26:50,167 --> 00:26:55,000
He knows exactly where to go.
He's a professional killer, Ib.

308
00:26:55,126 --> 00:26:58,583
I've got it. Let's go to the airport
and tell him it's a misunderstanding.

309
00:26:58,709 --> 00:27:03,708
Good idea. We'll give him a decent tip
and say it's all a misunderstanding.

310
00:27:04,459 --> 00:27:06,250
How hard can it be?

311
00:27:25,126 --> 00:27:30,041
- What if 100 dollars isn't enough?
- Hell, it's a year's income in Russia.

312
00:27:30,167 --> 00:27:34,000
- Got the return ticket?
- Yup. Moscow 6:45 p. m.

313
00:27:34,084 --> 00:27:38,666
- Good. And then this never happened.
- It already never happened.

314
00:27:38,792 --> 00:27:42,458
We'll treat him to a steak
and a couple of bottles of Rioja -

315
00:27:42,584 --> 00:27:45,250
- and there you have it.

316
00:27:59,042 --> 00:28:01,458
Oh my...

317
00:28:04,792 --> 00:28:07,375
He sure is drunk.

318
00:28:07,501 --> 00:28:11,166
I'll give him that.
Impressive.

319
00:28:34,459 --> 00:28:38,416
My friends...
My friends.

320
00:28:56,167 --> 00:28:57,167
Hi.

321
00:28:57,292 --> 00:29:01,583
- Is he a friend of yours?
- Nah, we don't really know him.

322
00:29:01,709 --> 00:29:05,083
- Then why are you holding his name?
- Well...

323
00:29:05,209 --> 00:29:08,625
- What's his business here?
- We're builders.

324
00:29:08,751 --> 00:29:14,250
- Igor's here to help us... build.
- Nothing illegal.

325
00:29:14,376 --> 00:29:19,208
But we don't need him after all,
so we've bought him a return ticket.

326
00:29:19,334 --> 00:29:22,750
No way.
He's not flying in that state.

327
00:29:22,876 --> 00:29:26,000
Get him out of here.
Immediately!

328
00:29:31,126 --> 00:29:36,833
We'll take a taxi to the Scandic.
We won't draw attention in a taxi.

329
00:29:37,001 --> 00:29:40,291
We'll get him a room, pour
some coffee on him to sober him up -

330
00:29:40,417 --> 00:29:43,291
- and then we go back here,
he flies back home -

331
00:29:43,417 --> 00:29:46,166
- we go home.
It never happened.

332
00:30:05,251 --> 00:30:09,583
Your friend is okay, right?
He can't puke in my taxi...

333
00:30:09,709 --> 00:30:11,916
I'm gonna get really mad.

334
00:30:12,042 --> 00:30:16,250
He's from Russia.
They hardly ever puke.

335
00:30:16,376 --> 00:30:18,208
Infidel Russian.

336
00:30:18,334 --> 00:30:21,750
Godless pig eater,
drunk, foolish dog!

337
00:30:21,876 --> 00:30:25,375
I curse you to hell -

338
00:30:25,501 --> 00:30:29,708
- and I'm going to take a long,
expensive detour to steal your money!

339
00:30:31,001 --> 00:30:33,791
You damn Taliban bastard.

340
00:30:33,917 --> 00:30:37,833
I curse you and your family
and hope you burn in hell.

341
00:30:38,001 --> 00:30:41,000
You talking to me,
you Russian son of a bitch?

342
00:30:41,126 --> 00:30:45,333
I'm going to pull out your intestines
through your filthy throat -

343
00:30:45,459 --> 00:30:48,208
- and hang you in the nearest tree!

344
00:30:48,334 --> 00:30:52,583
Damn you! I'm going to do that to you,
you filthy shit-for-brains!

345
00:30:52,709 --> 00:30:54,666
Stop... stop.

346
00:30:54,792 --> 00:30:57,875
You son of a bitch! I'm going
to kill you, you crazy bastard!

347
00:30:58,001 --> 00:31:01,666
- Stop the car!
- What stop?! Where stop?!

348
00:31:01,792 --> 00:31:04,125
You crazy Russian!

349
00:31:04,251 --> 00:31:08,666
I'll kill you good! We kicked
your entire family out of your country!

350
00:31:10,876 --> 00:31:12,208
Come here, you...!

351
00:31:21,876 --> 00:31:27,125
I can't deal with all that negative
energy in such a confined space.

352
00:31:27,251 --> 00:31:31,083
So much... hatred
between people, Edward.

353
00:31:31,209 --> 00:31:36,458
We're going to sober him up,
and then we're going home.

354
00:31:44,126 --> 00:31:47,250
Well, let's get... going.

355
00:31:48,209 --> 00:31:50,875
Taliban monkey not so loud anymore.

356
00:31:51,001 --> 00:31:53,791
But you don't worry, you my friends.
Igor kill for free.

357
00:31:53,917 --> 00:31:57,333
Besides, he don't care.
He wasn't happy.

358
00:31:57,459 --> 00:32:02,791
Now, I promise he's much happier now
with his 72 fucking virgins.

359
00:32:02,917 --> 00:32:07,208
Now he's happier.
Now he's with his virgins. I'm sorry.

360
00:32:13,251 --> 00:32:16,750
For fuck's sake.
Ib, this isn't happening, is it?

361
00:32:16,876 --> 00:32:20,625
We're going to jail on account of a
drunk Russian that we don't even know.

362
00:32:20,751 --> 00:32:25,791
Edward, we have to take him home with
us. And we can't just leave the body.

363
00:32:25,917 --> 00:32:29,250
- Someone's gonna find him.
- Someone?

364
00:32:29,376 --> 00:32:33,083
That poor immigrant guy and his
immigrant kids who are now fatherless.

365
00:32:33,209 --> 00:32:37,000
Maybe he's a fucking ISIS who whips
his family with the Quran every night.

366
00:32:37,084 --> 00:32:41,083
But you don't know that!
Prejudice... bah!

367
00:32:41,209 --> 00:32:44,500
Well, Igor, let's go.

368
00:33:11,542 --> 00:33:14,916
- Let's go get a beer at the inn.
- But what if the girls come home?

369
00:33:15,042 --> 00:33:18,000
Gritt said they were sleeping at your
place. It's just you and me tonight.

370
00:33:27,459 --> 00:33:30,750
Are there any real men left?

371
00:33:31,709 --> 00:33:34,916
I really want a child.

372
00:33:35,042 --> 00:33:38,375
I'm going on 40, and my ovaries
are beginning to look like prunes.

373
00:33:41,626 --> 00:33:44,500
Soon I can only have kids
with nuchal folds.

374
00:33:44,626 --> 00:33:45,791
Yuck!

375
00:33:54,042 --> 00:33:59,583
- I thought we were going to my place.
- You never have any wine.

376
00:34:02,042 --> 00:34:04,375
Will we be happy without them?

377
00:34:04,501 --> 00:34:07,875
Oh, come on.
We're gonna have a ball!

378
00:34:08,001 --> 00:34:11,291
You'll meet other men who look you
in the eye instead of ogling your ass.

379
00:34:11,417 --> 00:34:16,291
Who can dance, think and go
to the art museum and watch PBS -

380
00:34:16,417 --> 00:34:20,416
- and who talk about other stuff
than stone wool.

381
00:34:30,459 --> 00:34:33,625
- Is this the reception?
- Is he one of their Poles?

382
00:34:34,792 --> 00:34:38,208
- Where is the mini bar?
- How dare he prance in like that?

383
00:34:38,334 --> 00:34:42,875
They stay in the cellar from time
to time, but they never come upstairs.

384
00:34:48,084 --> 00:34:53,000
Life is nothing without beauty and love.
Love is what makes you happy -

385
00:34:53,084 --> 00:34:55,916
- and if you're not happy,
there is no reason to live.

386
00:34:56,042 --> 00:34:59,875
So when Igor meets two beautiful women,
he sees lots of love -

387
00:35:00,001 --> 00:35:03,750
- and that makes him very happy.

388
00:35:03,876 --> 00:35:07,000
And I do not say that because I'm drunk.

389
00:35:07,084 --> 00:35:10,791
Igor is always drunk
and sees ugly women all the time.

390
00:35:10,917 --> 00:35:16,041
But you are very, very,
very beautiful.

391
00:35:17,084 --> 00:35:20,083
Who says you can leave your cellar?

392
00:35:21,126 --> 00:35:24,458
Who says you can leave your cellar?

393
00:35:26,292 --> 00:35:28,541
You are so hungry woman.

394
00:35:28,667 --> 00:35:34,000
You are like a juicy wet oasis. An oasis
just waiting to feed a thirsty man -

395
00:35:34,126 --> 00:35:39,000
- but you, so beautiful, where is your
thirsty man? No one drinks from you.

396
00:35:39,084 --> 00:35:42,791
And you, beautiful.
Like a painting by Da Vinci.

397
00:35:42,917 --> 00:35:45,875
Please come. Please.

398
00:35:46,001 --> 00:35:48,000
Please!

399
00:35:48,084 --> 00:35:52,750
Where is your man to see
your secret smile, beautiful lips?

400
00:35:52,876 --> 00:35:56,583
I like it very much.
Beautiful.

401
00:35:57,251 --> 00:35:59,750
Thank you.

402
00:35:59,876 --> 00:36:03,541
- Well, Malte, our dance teacher...
- Dance teacher?

403
00:36:03,667 --> 00:36:08,000
He thinks we are very passionate.
He's a Swede.

404
00:36:08,084 --> 00:36:12,750
Gay, of course, and sometimes
he compares us to two tulips.

405
00:36:12,876 --> 00:36:17,875
You tulips? But tulip is nothing
but the stupid vegetable.

406
00:36:18,001 --> 00:36:24,125
You are not vegetables!
You are women made offlesh and blood!

407
00:36:27,209 --> 00:36:30,916
- This is for every virgin I ever loved.
- Oh my.

408
00:36:31,042 --> 00:36:35,125
She feels a little pain
and I see the tear in her eye.

409
00:36:35,251 --> 00:36:39,750
And Igor says:
If she feels a little pain -

410
00:36:39,876 --> 00:36:43,375
- so Igor shall feel a little pain, too.

411
00:36:43,501 --> 00:36:47,541
So I stab myself every time with knife,
very painful.

412
00:36:47,667 --> 00:36:53,583
You know, guys from the Eastern bloc
can be very romantic.

413
00:36:53,709 --> 00:36:58,208
- You can say that again.
- Very.

414
00:37:00,459 --> 00:37:02,208
Can I...

415
00:37:04,626 --> 00:37:07,000
What's this?

416
00:37:07,084 --> 00:37:10,916
- It's also women you...?
- No.

417
00:37:11,042 --> 00:37:15,041
This is all the men I killed.

418
00:37:15,167 --> 00:37:19,541
- What?
- So you really tried to kill somebody?

419
00:37:19,667 --> 00:37:22,000
- Okay.
- How is it?

420
00:37:22,084 --> 00:37:24,916
- To kill somebody?
- Yes.

421
00:37:26,459 --> 00:37:28,375
Oh, it's nothing.

422
00:37:28,501 --> 00:37:31,875
First they breathe,
then they don't breathe.

423
00:37:32,751 --> 00:37:37,333
So, you stay long here in Nibe?

424
00:37:39,001 --> 00:37:41,833
As long as it takes.

425
00:37:42,001 --> 00:37:46,166
- Do you know Ib and Edward?
- Yes.

426
00:37:46,292 --> 00:37:48,500
They are my new friends.

427
00:37:48,626 --> 00:37:52,250
- You keep secrets with me?
- Of course.

428
00:37:52,376 --> 00:37:56,750
Wives not make them happy anymore.

429
00:37:58,084 --> 00:38:00,458
What do you precisely mean by that?

430
00:38:00,584 --> 00:38:04,625
Igor help them
not to be unhappy anymore.

431
00:38:04,751 --> 00:38:06,583
How?

432
00:38:06,709 --> 00:38:08,041
I kill them.

433
00:38:30,876 --> 00:38:33,208
You know where I can find them?

434
00:38:47,626 --> 00:38:49,708
Igor?

435
00:38:50,584 --> 00:38:56,625
You need something
stronger than wine, yes.

436
00:38:58,001 --> 00:39:00,833
- You need whisky.
- Okay.

437
00:39:01,001 --> 00:39:04,000
Where am I, by the way?
Is this hotel lobby?

438
00:39:04,084 --> 00:39:07,041
We go and we buy...

439
00:39:08,001 --> 00:39:10,208
...whisky.
Lots ofwhisky.

440
00:39:10,334 --> 00:39:14,041
And you can stay here in hotel lobby.

441
00:39:16,917 --> 00:39:19,750
- What are we gonna do?
- Get in the car!

442
00:39:19,876 --> 00:39:22,541
You're too drunk to drive.

443
00:39:29,251 --> 00:39:33,333
- I think I've peed my pants.
- Shit, Gritt!

444
00:39:33,459 --> 00:39:35,750
We're married to a couple of killers!

445
00:39:35,876 --> 00:39:39,375
I don't remember
when I last peed my pants.

446
00:39:39,501 --> 00:39:42,083
Fuck!
Ever heard anything that wild?

447
00:39:42,209 --> 00:39:46,625
Maybe it was at camp in '92...

448
00:39:46,751 --> 00:39:50,458
You don't chip in for a hitman.
If anyone's gonna kill me -

449
00:39:50,584 --> 00:39:54,208
- I want my own personal killer.

450
00:39:54,334 --> 00:39:56,416
I peed on my shoes... everywhere.

451
00:40:01,709 --> 00:40:05,083
- And then I saw...
- Have you been drinking?

452
00:40:05,209 --> 00:40:09,583
What the fuck do you think?
Do I seem sober or shitfaced?

453
00:40:09,709 --> 00:40:13,708
Down my legs and into my shoes...

454
00:40:13,834 --> 00:40:17,625
""What is this?
Did you pee your pants?""

455
00:40:18,667 --> 00:40:20,583
I peed my pants.

456
00:40:20,709 --> 00:40:24,666
Damn! It burst.
That's a first.

457
00:40:24,792 --> 00:40:26,833
Get out of the car.

458
00:40:27,001 --> 00:40:31,916
And the bitches can sleep on the couch
in a studio apartment on loser street.

459
00:40:32,042 --> 00:40:33,541
Loser street.

460
00:40:33,667 --> 00:40:37,750
They go see a lawyer only to find out
they're married to two strong women.

461
00:40:37,876 --> 00:40:41,500
Strong women
who knows their rights, Gritt.

462
00:40:41,626 --> 00:40:44,875
- Free women like you and me, Gritt.
- Yeah, we're totally free.

463
00:40:46,626 --> 00:40:49,208
We may very well be from Nibe -

464
00:40:49,334 --> 00:40:53,250
- but Malte says
this might as well be Hollywood -

465
00:40:53,376 --> 00:40:58,041
- and those women over there know how
to squeeze the last cent out of a man.

466
00:40:58,167 --> 00:41:02,625
- The last cunt?
- No, the last cent out of a man.

467
00:41:02,751 --> 00:41:04,666
We'll show them!

468
00:41:04,792 --> 00:41:08,375
We have a future, Gritt.
We can dance our way through life.

469
00:41:08,501 --> 00:41:11,916
- They can only sit on their fat asses.
- Hell, we'll convert Malte.

470
00:41:12,042 --> 00:41:16,458
- Yeah, why not?
- With our gigantic big balls.

471
00:41:17,376 --> 00:41:19,333
We rock!

472
00:41:19,459 --> 00:41:24,750
We'll be lucky to find a drop of blood
in your alcohol. What were you thinking?

473
00:41:24,876 --> 00:41:28,041
- You're looking at a minimum of...
- Where?

474
00:41:28,167 --> 00:41:31,000
- Where are you going?
- Where's the cell, Heinz?

475
00:41:31,084 --> 00:41:33,291
Down the end of the hall, 9 o'clock.

476
00:41:36,292 --> 00:41:39,041
He's been awake.

477
00:41:39,167 --> 00:41:42,833
No man can drink that much.

478
00:41:58,209 --> 00:42:02,000
Why don't we just tell the police?

479
00:42:02,084 --> 00:42:05,541
- The police?
- Yes.

480
00:42:05,667 --> 00:42:08,666
""Why don't we just tell the police?""

481
00:42:08,792 --> 00:42:13,375
- What can the police do?
- They can fix it.

482
00:42:13,501 --> 00:42:16,333
- Fix it? The police?
- Yes.

483
00:42:17,376 --> 00:42:21,083
No, they'll put them away for a couple
of years, and when they're released -

484
00:42:21,209 --> 00:42:24,500
- they'll rob us of everything anyway.

485
00:42:25,584 --> 00:42:28,416
The police!

486
00:42:38,709 --> 00:42:41,583
If they can hire a killer...

487
00:42:46,834 --> 00:42:49,291
...why can't we?

488
00:42:51,001 --> 00:42:54,333
Well, because it's against the law.

489
00:42:54,459 --> 00:42:56,916
- Against the law?
- Yes.

490
00:42:57,042 --> 00:43:00,000
No, it's equality!

491
00:43:04,126 --> 00:43:06,833
It's equality, Gritt. Hey!

492
00:43:07,001 --> 00:43:11,500
We have just as much right
to be bastards as men.

493
00:43:11,626 --> 00:43:13,500
Sure.

494
00:43:15,042 --> 00:43:18,875
- Okay.
- I'll tell you what we're gonna do...

495
00:43:33,334 --> 00:43:36,250
- Sure this is a good idea?
- We have to defend ourselves.

496
00:43:36,376 --> 00:43:42,708
- And Igor? Think she's a match for him?
- Wait and see. This girl is special.

497
00:43:42,834 --> 00:43:48,333
The British have got style. Downton
Abbey, Midsomer Murders and so on.

498
00:43:48,459 --> 00:43:52,916
The British are posh.
Discreet and soundless.

499
00:43:53,042 --> 00:43:56,458
When something is really complicated -

500
00:43:56,584 --> 00:43:59,291
- they just sweep it under the rug.

501
00:43:59,417 --> 00:44:02,541
- I need to go pee again.
- And I'm thirsty.

502
00:44:02,667 --> 00:44:05,666
- Shouldn't she have landed by now?
- I need some wine.

503
00:44:25,792 --> 00:44:29,000
Excuse me.
Where do you come from?

504
00:44:29,126 --> 00:44:32,000
Oh, I'm sorry, young man.

505
00:44:32,084 --> 00:44:35,083
I didn't think that
you'd be taking any interest -

506
00:44:35,209 --> 00:44:39,166
- in a silly old woman like me.
I'm flattered, dear.

507
00:44:39,292 --> 00:44:42,125
It's check-up day today,
so pure routine.

508
00:44:42,251 --> 00:44:44,000
I understand, dear.

509
00:44:44,084 --> 00:44:48,583
Now, what am I smuggling into this
lovely little country of yours today?

510
00:44:48,709 --> 00:44:53,041
Hard drugs, endangered species
or lethal weapons?

511
00:44:53,167 --> 00:44:57,041
- Can I check your bag?
- You most certainly may.

512
00:45:08,459 --> 00:45:11,000
Good God!

513
00:45:15,584 --> 00:45:19,666
Ingrid, I don't like this.

514
00:45:19,792 --> 00:45:25,541
No, but let's go to the summerhouse
and get acquainted, okay?

515
00:45:25,667 --> 00:45:29,250
Sure she's not crazy? I think
she's straight out of a horror movie.

516
00:45:29,376 --> 00:45:32,333
No, she's just an oddball.

517
00:45:32,459 --> 00:45:37,416
You can't get enough of oddballs.
They're just barmy.

518
00:45:37,542 --> 00:45:42,000
Mrs. Nipplesworthy, we are going now
to a very nice and cozy place.

519
00:45:42,084 --> 00:45:45,083
- Is there anything you need?
- Liver.

520
00:45:46,084 --> 00:45:47,833
- Liver?
- Liver?

521
00:45:48,001 --> 00:45:49,625
Raw liver.

522
00:45:49,751 --> 00:45:53,666
With a nice bottle of Chianti.

523
00:45:59,876 --> 00:46:02,833
Ladies... ladies!

524
00:46:03,001 --> 00:46:07,291
I'm only messing with you.

525
00:46:14,084 --> 00:46:16,625
So you want me to erase his memory?

526
00:46:16,751 --> 00:46:21,125
Not all of it.
Just the last couple of days maybe.

527
00:46:22,376 --> 00:46:25,250
- What is this all about?
- We'll give you 5,000 kroner.

528
00:46:25,376 --> 00:46:29,791
It's purely business. We brought him in
from the East to help us -

529
00:46:29,917 --> 00:46:33,916
- but he drinks too much.
He's Russian and more or less useless.

530
00:46:34,042 --> 00:46:37,625
Still, we felt bad
having dragged him all the way here -

531
00:46:37,751 --> 00:46:41,250
- only to fire him on the spot.

532
00:46:41,376 --> 00:46:45,458
So we thought it would be better
if he'd never had that experience.

533
00:46:50,834 --> 00:46:53,791
You're so full of crap.

534
00:46:53,917 --> 00:46:56,916
- 20,000.
- Done deal!

535
00:46:57,042 --> 00:46:59,833
- Wait outside.
- Deal.

536
00:47:00,001 --> 00:47:03,083
Ib... Where are you going?

537
00:47:08,251 --> 00:47:10,041
Poul?

538
00:47:13,084 --> 00:47:15,291
Poul!

539
00:47:18,626 --> 00:47:20,791
What the hell are you doing?

540
00:47:25,751 --> 00:47:29,041
- Where did you find her again?
- She had a website.

541
00:47:29,167 --> 00:47:33,541
- Awebsite?
- Yeah, to do with euthanasia.

542
00:47:33,667 --> 00:47:36,250
- Euthanasia?
- Yeah.

543
00:47:36,376 --> 00:47:41,125
She worked at a home for many years -

544
00:47:41,251 --> 00:47:45,583
- and was unjustly convicted of having
helped a lot of miserable old -

545
00:47:45,709 --> 00:47:50,041
- really broken old people,
who were dying anyway.

546
00:47:50,167 --> 00:47:55,916
She's dedicated her life to helping
people, who need to die, to die.

547
00:47:57,001 --> 00:48:01,625
And she also helps out
if you need help -

548
00:48:01,751 --> 00:48:06,541
- to make other people,
who need to die, die.

549
00:48:06,667 --> 00:48:10,375
People, who want to die...
but perhaps don't know it yet.

550
00:48:11,292 --> 00:48:13,291
What home did she work at?

551
00:48:13,417 --> 00:48:19,000
- I think it was Broadmoor Home...
- Home for what?

552
00:48:19,084 --> 00:48:22,458
Broadmoor Mental Institution is -

553
00:48:22,584 --> 00:48:26,708
- a well-reputed home
for psychopaths, sweethearts.

554
00:48:26,834 --> 00:48:29,541
Okay.

555
00:48:29,667 --> 00:48:34,041
- You worked there as a nurse, or...?
- Yes, of course.

556
00:48:34,167 --> 00:48:37,666
Yes, of course I was a nurse.

557
00:48:42,501 --> 00:48:46,541
""Now you travel back in your life, Igor.
Now you let yourself fall -

558
00:48:46,667 --> 00:48:48,833
- and see the job you should do.""

559
00:48:49,001 --> 00:48:52,583
Igor says this is nuts,
but stupid woman says:

560
00:48:52,709 --> 00:48:56,041
""Yes, you see the job
you should do for Ib and Edward.""

561
00:48:56,167 --> 00:48:58,833
""No, no,"" I say. ""I don't see anyjob.""

562
00:48:59,001 --> 00:49:01,916
""Oh yes,"" she says. ""You will.""

563
00:49:02,042 --> 00:49:04,916
And then she hypnotize.

564
00:49:05,042 --> 00:49:10,833
And then Igor sees all Igor's jobs!
They come to me, everyone of them!

565
00:49:11,001 --> 00:49:15,250
The Taliban swine, the three
horny midgets, the six Chinamen -

566
00:49:15,376 --> 00:49:18,166
- the stupid journalist,
who didn't like my friend Putin -

567
00:49:18,292 --> 00:49:22,208
- the woman with the big dick etc. etc.
So now she starts screaming.

568
00:49:22,334 --> 00:49:25,333
So Igor wake up.
""Why do you scream, stupid woman?""

569
00:49:25,459 --> 00:49:30,625
- So she screams: ""Police! Police!""
- Yes, we heard. We heard.

570
00:49:31,542 --> 00:49:35,083
- She never should have locked the door.
- I asked her: ""Why do you scream?""

571
00:49:35,209 --> 00:49:40,000
""Please stop screaming, you ugly woman
with ugly glasses. Please stop...!""

572
00:49:40,126 --> 00:49:43,083
Did you really have to...

573
00:49:44,417 --> 00:49:50,125
You know, Igor help.
Igor put her out of her misery.

574
00:49:50,251 --> 00:49:53,541
I could see she was not happy.

575
00:50:00,917 --> 00:50:05,125
Always look for the positive,
my mom always said.

576
00:50:05,251 --> 00:50:07,916
Like when my budgie died.

577
00:50:08,042 --> 00:50:12,125
""See, Ib. The good thing
about the budgie dying is -

578
00:50:12,251 --> 00:50:17,500
- that you can get a stuffed budgie now.
Not many people have that.""

579
00:50:18,542 --> 00:50:21,916
Maybe all these horrific experiences
are good for us.

580
00:50:22,042 --> 00:50:26,541
I mean, right now we're parked right
in the middle of nature.

581
00:50:26,667 --> 00:50:30,916
Look! A live lark.
It gives you food for thought -

582
00:50:31,042 --> 00:50:35,166
- that in the middle of all this mess
there's still stuffto rejoice in.

583
00:50:35,292 --> 00:50:39,916
Hell, Ib, you're going crazy.
Pull yourself together, Ib.

584
00:50:41,417 --> 00:50:45,291
No... I didn't mean it like that.

585
00:50:48,042 --> 00:50:51,416
I miss my budgie.

586
00:50:55,167 --> 00:50:58,041
And here comes Heinz.

587
00:51:04,501 --> 00:51:06,625
Well...

588
00:51:15,042 --> 00:51:18,750
So, what's up, Dumb and Dumber?

589
00:51:18,876 --> 00:51:21,875
- Yeah, what's up, Heinz?
- Drunk bitches.

590
00:51:22,001 --> 00:51:25,916
Moonlighting.
What's next?

591
00:51:26,042 --> 00:51:30,125
Now that your missus
has lost her license -

592
00:51:30,251 --> 00:51:33,166
- her Mercedes is just collecting dust
in the garage.

593
00:51:33,292 --> 00:51:37,916
- What do you want, Heinz?
- Why, I want a Mercedes.

594
00:51:38,042 --> 00:51:41,666
- If you can moonlight, so can I.
- Why?

595
00:51:41,792 --> 00:51:43,625
Why?

596
00:51:43,751 --> 00:51:46,666
It's up to you whether I should drive
toward you with the tax man -

597
00:51:46,792 --> 00:51:50,250
- or drive off in a Mercedes.

598
00:51:54,292 --> 00:51:57,833
- Who's that guy?
- Just a friend of ours.

599
00:51:58,001 --> 00:52:01,541
- Yeah, he's just a friend.
- Oh. Does he have a work permit?

600
00:52:02,376 --> 00:52:05,333
Hey there.

601
00:52:05,459 --> 00:52:08,541
I'd like to see your passport,
papers and work permit.

602
00:52:08,667 --> 00:52:10,875
Right away.

603
00:52:11,001 --> 00:52:14,125
- Hello.
- Heinz, he doesn't speak Danish.

604
00:52:14,251 --> 00:52:17,916
- Heinz, you'd better not.
- Frigging Poles.

605
00:52:18,042 --> 00:52:22,333
Don't piss him off.
Igor's from Russia, not Poland.

606
00:52:22,459 --> 00:52:25,083
So what's he gonna do?
Blow on me?

607
00:52:26,876 --> 00:52:29,333
Hey, buster.

608
00:52:29,459 --> 00:52:32,750
Let me see your papers,
passport and work permit.

609
00:52:32,876 --> 00:52:37,000
It's a bad idea, Heinz.
You are a human being after all.

610
00:52:37,126 --> 00:52:39,625
- What?
- You've got a heart, too.

611
00:52:39,751 --> 00:52:43,375
- Haven't you got a wife and kids?
- Not on your life!

612
00:52:43,501 --> 00:52:47,000
- A dad or a mom?
- What the fuck are you talking about?

613
00:52:47,126 --> 00:52:51,750
All the people who love you
and who you love and go on picnics with.

614
00:52:51,876 --> 00:52:54,458
No, all that family crap just isn't me.

615
00:52:54,584 --> 00:52:59,041
So the day you pass away,
no one will mourn you -

616
00:52:59,167 --> 00:53:03,333
- with a cake buffet
and cousins singing country songs?

617
00:53:04,459 --> 00:53:09,083
You're losing it big time.
What the hell are you guys up to?

618
00:53:09,209 --> 00:53:11,583
- Is this your friend?
- No.

619
00:53:11,709 --> 00:53:16,916
I actually feel a bit sad for him,
because you know -

620
00:53:17,042 --> 00:53:20,041
- Heinz is not very happy.

621
00:53:20,167 --> 00:53:22,916
- Ib!
- Not happy?

622
00:53:23,042 --> 00:53:25,916
Not happy at all, Igor.

623
00:53:27,001 --> 00:53:29,708
No love, no family -

624
00:53:29,834 --> 00:53:32,416
- and not very happy.

625
00:53:32,542 --> 00:53:34,750
Ib, what the fuck are you up to?

626
00:53:34,876 --> 00:53:37,833
- You bet your ass I'm not very happy.
- Damn.

627
00:53:38,001 --> 00:53:41,708
Look, tell me what's going on.
Out of the way, buddy.

628
00:53:41,834 --> 00:53:46,416
You're digging a hole in the middle
of nowhere. What's going on?

629
00:53:46,542 --> 00:53:48,208
What is this?

630
00:53:48,334 --> 00:53:49,625
No!

631
00:53:52,834 --> 00:53:55,666
It's... No, never mind the time!

632
00:53:57,709 --> 00:54:00,000
You're under arrest
and you have the right to one...

633
00:54:00,126 --> 00:54:02,541
He doesn't speak Danish, Heinz.

634
00:54:02,667 --> 00:54:07,083
You have the right to maintain silence,
and according to law you can just...

635
00:54:07,209 --> 00:54:09,208
Okay.

636
00:54:21,042 --> 00:54:22,708
We have more drink?

637
00:54:24,917 --> 00:54:30,125
Well, Ib.
This is the end of the road.

638
00:54:30,251 --> 00:54:33,625
Heinz is going to get help.
It's all over -

639
00:54:33,751 --> 00:54:35,916
- and I will accept my punishment.

640
00:54:36,042 --> 00:54:39,125
- It'll ease my gut and my mind...
- Car keys... where are the keys?

641
00:54:39,251 --> 00:54:43,791
We'll get everything out in the open.
Don't worry, I'll take the rap.

642
00:54:43,917 --> 00:54:48,833
No need for both of us to spend 12 years
in the can getting buggered by goons.

643
00:54:49,001 --> 00:54:52,041
Don't get all worked up.
Igor's got a handle on it.

644
00:54:52,167 --> 00:54:57,458
Let's just be happy
that it can't possibly get any worse.

645
00:55:04,751 --> 00:55:07,916
- He missed.
- You're way too negative.

646
00:55:15,834 --> 00:55:20,625
No, we won't get away with this.
I've seen it too many times on TV, Ib.

647
00:55:20,751 --> 00:55:25,916
A man walks his dog, and the dog comes
back with a big bone wearing a sock.

648
00:55:26,834 --> 00:55:30,000
Next thing you know,
you're the star of a lame crime doc...

649
00:55:30,126 --> 00:55:34,416
We have to find a better place
where they won't be found.

650
00:55:39,917 --> 00:55:43,625
How slowly would you like it to happen?

651
00:55:43,751 --> 00:55:46,000
How slow?

652
00:56:03,459 --> 00:56:08,916
Now, this will leave them bleeding
for several hours -

653
00:56:09,042 --> 00:56:12,458
- before their eyes pop out
of their heads.

654
00:56:13,667 --> 00:56:16,416
It's quite painful, it must be said.

655
00:56:16,542 --> 00:56:20,250
Meanwhile, now this one...

656
00:56:21,667 --> 00:56:26,416
I call this Autumn Leaves.

657
00:56:27,584 --> 00:56:31,000
This will prolong the process
even further still -

658
00:56:31,126 --> 00:56:35,291
- causing to lose their hair and teeth
over a period of several weeks -

659
00:56:35,417 --> 00:56:42,125
- before finally their skin peels off
like leaves in autumn.

660
00:56:42,251 --> 00:56:45,666
Yes... yes.

661
00:56:45,792 --> 00:56:49,666
Anything tickle your fancy, ladies?

662
00:56:51,084 --> 00:56:53,458
First and foremost -

663
00:56:53,584 --> 00:56:58,291
- I personally don't think
their eyes should pop out.

664
00:56:58,417 --> 00:57:02,500
I think this eye-popping-out thing
sounds a little too much.

665
00:57:02,626 --> 00:57:07,541
What do you think, Ingrid?
Do you think their eyes should...

666
00:57:07,667 --> 00:57:09,416
No, no.

667
00:57:09,542 --> 00:57:13,583
No, personally,
I don't like the eye thing -

668
00:57:13,709 --> 00:57:17,791
- and also I don't know
about the Autumn Leaves.

669
00:57:17,917 --> 00:57:22,666
So difficult to decide.
Right, Gritt?

670
00:57:22,792 --> 00:57:28,375
Yes, it's very difficult.
So many things to choose among.

671
00:57:28,501 --> 00:57:34,125
Maybe it's all a little bit
too dramatic.

672
00:57:34,251 --> 00:57:38,791
Perhaps we could find something
a little more simple.

673
00:57:38,917 --> 00:57:42,375
- More Scandinavian style?
- Yes, more Scandinavian maybe.

674
00:57:42,501 --> 00:57:45,208
You mean dull and dark?

675
00:57:47,834 --> 00:57:52,291
Perhaps we could concentrate on Igor.

676
00:57:52,417 --> 00:57:57,375
And perhaps just give Ib and Edward -

677
00:57:57,501 --> 00:57:59,583
- perhaps just a little warning?

678
00:57:59,709 --> 00:58:03,041
A little warning?

679
00:58:03,167 --> 00:58:06,333
Maybe just... I dunno...

680
00:58:07,417 --> 00:58:10,458
Maybe just a little
unexpected diarrhea maybe.

681
00:58:10,584 --> 00:58:14,791
- Diarrhea?
- Just a little pooh-pooh in the pants.

682
00:58:19,876 --> 00:58:24,625
Pooh-pooh!
That would be hysterical.

683
00:58:25,417 --> 00:58:28,000
You asked me to come here.

684
00:58:28,084 --> 00:58:34,250
I packed my things. I put a great deal
of effort into my preparations.

685
00:58:34,376 --> 00:58:39,583
Because that is what we British
stand for. Discipline. Honor.

686
00:58:39,709 --> 00:58:44,833
And last, but not least, the renouncing
of the revolting human body.

687
00:58:45,001 --> 00:58:50,125
And what do I mean by that? Well,
the British do not like the human body.

688
00:58:50,251 --> 00:58:55,000
We live with it, it's true. Because we
have no option. We are forced to do so.

689
00:58:55,084 --> 00:59:01,708
And that is precisely why
I am skilled at what I do.

690
00:59:01,834 --> 00:59:07,625
I am an expert at helping people
vacate their bodies.

691
00:59:07,751 --> 00:59:12,166
That is my calling.
That is my life's work.

692
00:59:12,292 --> 00:59:18,291
I am here to save us all
from our human bodies!

693
00:59:27,542 --> 00:59:31,875
- She's utterly crazy.
- No, we're utterly nuts.

694
00:59:32,001 --> 00:59:35,708
- What the hell are we doing?
- Let's keep a cool head now.

695
00:59:38,001 --> 00:59:41,125
Why the hell didn't we buy more?

696
00:59:41,251 --> 00:59:44,833
I can't think without Chardonnay.
I'm going out for more.

697
00:59:45,001 --> 00:59:48,666
- Are you leaving me alone with that?
- Everything's going to be okay.

698
00:59:48,792 --> 00:59:51,000
I just need some wine.

699
00:59:55,417 --> 00:59:59,125
What a surprise.

700
00:59:59,251 --> 01:00:04,000
- When do you expect to finish it?
- We found a pile of bricks.

701
01:00:04,126 --> 01:00:07,291
And more are on the way from...

702
01:00:07,417 --> 01:00:09,625
From Krakow.

703
01:00:09,751 --> 01:00:15,333
- Isn't it quite wide?
- What do you mean, Mrs. Hansen?

704
01:00:16,501 --> 01:00:19,666
It's almost a meter wide.

705
01:00:21,292 --> 01:00:25,541
Yes, it's a solid wall
that no one can ever tear down again -

706
01:00:25,667 --> 01:00:30,791
- so that they'd find something
or someone inside it.

707
01:00:30,917 --> 01:00:34,375
- Not that there'd be that in a wall.
- Mrs. Hansen.

708
01:00:34,501 --> 01:00:36,666
Thanks, Ib.

709
01:00:36,792 --> 01:00:41,250
- Can we have a cup of coffee?
- You bet.

710
01:00:45,084 --> 01:00:46,084
There!

711
01:00:47,126 --> 01:00:48,916
Well, well...

712
01:00:51,417 --> 01:00:53,708
Maybe we should wall him up, too?

713
01:00:53,834 --> 01:00:56,791
I don't think Igor's very happy.

714
01:00:56,917 --> 01:01:01,125
No, it must be hard to sleep with
so many dead people on your conscience.

715
01:01:02,126 --> 01:01:05,416
Tell you what, Ib.

716
01:01:05,542 --> 01:01:08,375
- I'm going to tell it to him straight.
- No. Are you crazy?

717
01:01:08,501 --> 01:01:12,541
- I'll keep a civil tone.
- He's gonna kill us. You can't!

718
01:01:12,667 --> 01:01:15,166
Igor... Igor.

719
01:01:15,292 --> 01:01:20,000
It's all a big misunderstanding.
You don't need to kill our wives.

720
01:01:20,126 --> 01:01:25,125
It was just me and Ib...
a little crazy one night.

721
01:01:25,251 --> 01:01:29,291
- It's not because we don't like you.
- No, absolutely not.

722
01:01:29,417 --> 01:01:34,125
We like you a lot.
You have a great charisma and...

723
01:01:34,251 --> 01:01:40,083
We also want you to know that we
think you are a very, very good killer.

724
01:01:40,209 --> 01:01:42,583
Oh, absolutely.

725
01:01:42,709 --> 01:01:47,583
Truth is, Igor, we don't want you
to kill anyone anymore.

726
01:01:47,709 --> 01:01:51,541
- You are getting soft.
- Look, Igor.

727
01:01:51,667 --> 01:01:56,000
You don't have to kill your wife
or your husband -

728
01:01:56,126 --> 01:01:58,166
- because you don't make love anymore.

729
01:01:58,292 --> 01:02:01,875
Actually, it's very normal in this
country that you stop having sex -

730
01:02:02,001 --> 01:02:04,208
- when you get married.

731
01:02:04,334 --> 01:02:06,000
Then what do they do?

732
01:02:06,084 --> 01:02:10,125
They... they take care of the dog -

733
01:02:10,251 --> 01:02:12,500
- or the kids.

734
01:02:12,626 --> 01:02:16,416
You know, jog together and go
to Silvan Saturday morning -

735
01:02:16,542 --> 01:02:19,875
- and buy a have grill, for example.

736
01:02:20,001 --> 01:02:24,875
- Have grill?
- You know, cozy time with have grill.

737
01:02:25,917 --> 01:02:27,916
- No.
- No?

738
01:02:28,042 --> 01:02:32,500
You are my friends. I don't want you
to live unhappy lousy lives -

739
01:02:32,626 --> 01:02:35,000
- with your frigid wives.

740
01:02:35,126 --> 01:02:39,583
But wives love us again.
They're not frigid anymore, nope.

741
01:02:41,042 --> 01:02:45,291
Okay.
If they really love you again -

742
01:02:45,417 --> 01:02:49,000
- I want to hear it
from their own mouths.

743
01:02:49,084 --> 01:02:51,708
Not from you two soft chicken.

744
01:02:53,417 --> 01:02:55,458
Of course, Igor.
You're absolutely right.

745
01:02:55,584 --> 01:02:59,666
Of course you should hear it from their
mouths, and you should meet them -

746
01:02:59,792 --> 01:03:03,583
- and you should talk to them. Then they
will tell you how much they love us.

747
01:03:03,709 --> 01:03:06,708
And then you can go home.

748
01:03:06,834 --> 01:03:09,791
- Okay.
- But we'll never talk them into that!

749
01:03:11,667 --> 01:03:14,083
Ib, I've got a plan.

750
01:03:15,917 --> 01:03:19,291
How terrible.
The girls haven't said a word.

751
01:03:19,417 --> 01:03:22,916
Both of you at the same time?

752
01:03:23,042 --> 01:03:26,291
Where is God in all this?
Is it work-related?

753
01:03:26,417 --> 01:03:29,625
- I'm sure it is.
- All the stuff you inhale.

754
01:03:29,751 --> 01:03:33,875
I haven't got any wigs for men,
but I can cut these in shape.

755
01:03:34,001 --> 01:03:36,208
You haven't lost your hair yet.

756
01:03:36,334 --> 01:03:39,291
The chemo will make it
come off in giant tufts.

757
01:03:39,417 --> 01:03:41,750
Try them on.

758
01:03:43,542 --> 01:03:46,416
- Hi, Ib.
- Bent.

759
01:03:46,542 --> 01:03:48,416
Hi, Edward.

760
01:03:48,542 --> 01:03:53,875
What's up?
How come you look like that?

761
01:03:54,001 --> 01:03:59,541
- Ib and Edward have got cancer.
- Yeah, we're gonna be bald as eggs.

762
01:03:59,667 --> 01:04:02,000
Skinheads.

763
01:04:02,126 --> 01:04:04,375
You... you...

764
01:04:04,501 --> 01:04:08,625
You just ought to...

765
01:04:08,751 --> 01:04:11,583
...ought to go to...

766
01:04:11,709 --> 01:04:14,333
Bent thinks you should take up salsa.

767
01:04:15,251 --> 01:04:18,375
Salsa, Bent.
Hell, that's just what we need -

768
01:04:18,501 --> 01:04:21,541
- with a body full of cancer.
For fuck's sake!

769
01:04:21,667 --> 01:04:26,000
- Thank you, Bent.
- You're welcome, my friend.

770
01:04:38,792 --> 01:04:42,875
- Why do we always make fun of Bent?
- Because we always have.

771
01:04:43,001 --> 01:04:47,583
Not before the accident.
We used to look up to him.

772
01:04:47,709 --> 01:04:51,458
He was the best footballer on the team.

773
01:04:51,584 --> 01:04:56,708
And then the ball rolled out in front
of the car on the highway.

774
01:04:56,834 --> 01:05:00,875
He was gone for six months and when
he returned, he'd turned into a spazz.

775
01:05:01,001 --> 01:05:04,666
- I told you, kids are a load of crap.
- But why do we make fun of him?

776
01:05:04,792 --> 01:05:09,583
He never should have chased
that ball on to the goddamn highway.

777
01:05:11,292 --> 01:05:14,750
Because we're afraid
of Spazzy Bent, Edward.

778
01:05:14,876 --> 01:05:19,458
We're afraid of kids. We're afraid
they'll run out in front of the cars.

779
01:05:19,584 --> 01:05:23,083
- Yeah right.
- But he's happy.

780
01:05:23,209 --> 01:05:27,791
- He dances and he's got a sex life.
- And that's strange.

781
01:05:27,917 --> 01:05:30,250
And what have we got?

782
01:05:30,376 --> 01:05:33,916
You want me to throw myself in front
of a car to get laid? That's stupid.

783
01:05:34,042 --> 01:05:37,208
You're not making any goddamn sense.

784
01:05:53,667 --> 01:05:56,875
Gritt, what are you doing?

785
01:05:58,292 --> 01:06:00,750
I can't take it anymore.

786
01:06:00,876 --> 01:06:05,833
I've had it!
No more perverted psychos.

787
01:06:06,001 --> 01:06:09,000
Are you going to dump her in there?

788
01:06:09,084 --> 01:06:14,041
We're going to do like the British.
Sweep it under the rug. Gone!

789
01:06:16,834 --> 01:06:19,541
I want to be normal, Ingrid.

790
01:06:19,667 --> 01:06:22,541
I miss Ib and his potbelly.

791
01:06:22,667 --> 01:06:26,166
I don't want to go looking for men
who watch PBS -

792
01:06:26,292 --> 01:06:30,000
- because I know that Ib loves me -

793
01:06:30,084 --> 01:06:36,583
- and you're crazy if you can't see
that we've just got our lines crossed.

794
01:06:38,251 --> 01:06:43,375
We used to be happy.
Why can't we be happy again?

795
01:06:45,751 --> 01:06:50,583
I can't take you seriously
if I have to look down on you.

796
01:06:53,584 --> 01:06:56,583
Give me the shovel, quick!

797
01:06:56,709 --> 01:07:00,375
You fucking bitches!

798
01:07:12,126 --> 01:07:15,083
<i>- Hello.
- Igor, this is Edward.</i>

799
01:07:15,209 --> 01:07:17,458
<i>Can you see the house behind you?</i>

800
01:07:17,584 --> 01:07:22,041
<i>It's my house. Gritt and Ingrid are
both waiting for you inside, okay?</i>

801
01:07:22,167 --> 01:07:24,875
<i>- Okay, I kill them?
- No, no!</i>

802
01:07:25,001 --> 01:07:28,583
No, no, Igor. No kill.
They're happy now, very much.

803
01:07:28,709 --> 01:07:31,333
<i>You wanted to hear it
from themselves, right?</i>

804
01:07:33,876 --> 01:07:36,625
Hi, you must be Igor.
I'm Ingrid.

805
01:07:36,751 --> 01:07:39,708
I'm very happy I'm not frigid.
Come in.

806
01:07:44,167 --> 01:07:48,208
Igor, please sit down and have a drink.

807
01:07:48,334 --> 01:07:52,625
I'm Gritt, and I'm very happy
and not frigid.

808
01:07:52,751 --> 01:07:55,750
We are sorry that it's so dark -

809
01:07:55,876 --> 01:08:00,208
- but we forgot
to pay the electricity bill.

810
01:08:00,334 --> 01:08:03,791
Ib and Edward told us
about the little mistake.

811
01:08:03,917 --> 01:08:09,583
If you ask me, I don't think
you should kill us. Right, Ingrid?

812
01:08:12,084 --> 01:08:18,000
You see, Igor, we love our husbands
very, very, very much -

813
01:08:18,084 --> 01:08:22,625
- but sometimes marriage gets
a little bit tired, you know?

814
01:08:22,751 --> 01:08:27,583
It's a bit like tide water.
Sometimes the water is high -

815
01:08:27,709 --> 01:08:30,541
- and sometimes it's low.

816
01:08:30,667 --> 01:08:35,625
And for the last day,
the water has been very, very, very low.

817
01:08:35,751 --> 01:08:40,458
- I hate water.
- Yes, of course you hate water.

818
01:08:40,584 --> 01:08:43,458
Who doesn't?
Don't you hate water, Ingrid?

819
01:08:43,584 --> 01:08:46,833
Hate water! I hate water.

820
01:08:47,001 --> 01:08:50,250
But you see, Igor...

821
01:08:50,376 --> 01:08:54,666
Women have so many feelings.
Their heart is so big -

822
01:08:54,792 --> 01:08:57,666
- and sometimes it's like
there's a storm inside. A storm, Igor.

823
01:08:57,792 --> 01:09:01,750
- Shit, Ib!
- I remember my first date.

824
01:09:01,876 --> 01:09:06,166
I was only 15,
and Sofus his name was.

825
01:09:06,292 --> 01:09:10,375
I had a good eye to him.
He was in my parallel class.

826
01:09:10,501 --> 01:09:12,583
And after many, many, many months -

827
01:09:12,709 --> 01:09:16,541
- finally he asked if I would walk out
and eat pizza with him.

828
01:09:16,667 --> 01:09:18,166
Ib, what the hell are you doing?

829
01:09:18,292 --> 01:09:24,166
I was so nervous and also hungry,
so of course I said yes.

830
01:09:25,209 --> 01:09:28,833
When he kissed me outside
Pizzeria Milano...

831
01:09:29,001 --> 01:09:34,708
...I swear my knees were like rubber
and my heart missed a slag.

832
01:09:35,917 --> 01:09:41,500
You probably are the two ugliest
trannies I have ever laid my eyes on.

833
01:09:41,626 --> 01:09:45,333
I think I am gonna be sick.

834
01:09:45,459 --> 01:09:50,041
- I agree.
- What are you saying?

835
01:09:52,042 --> 01:09:57,750
I am saying you both look like retired
Ukrainian hookers in a car crash.

836
01:09:57,876 --> 01:10:00,208
I'm glad the lights are out.

837
01:10:00,334 --> 01:10:05,333
- How dare you talk to women like that?
- How dare I?

838
01:10:05,459 --> 01:10:08,083
- Ib, goddammit.
- You are very ugly.

839
01:10:08,209 --> 01:10:11,166
- Fuck you!
- Please don't.

840
01:10:15,834 --> 01:10:17,500
No!

841
01:10:18,292 --> 01:10:24,458
What the hell got into you, Ib?
What the hell got into you, man?!

842
01:10:24,584 --> 01:10:27,375
I won't have him talk
to Gritt like that.

843
01:10:27,501 --> 01:10:31,541
- You're not Gritt, you're Ib!
- Where am I? Is my hair okay?

844
01:10:31,667 --> 01:10:34,208
You're not Gritt, you're Ib.
You're a man!

845
01:10:34,334 --> 01:10:38,625
It was the woman inside me, Edward.
She came thundering out.

846
01:10:38,751 --> 01:10:42,583
Suddenly I felt breasts,
ovaries and everything.

847
01:10:42,709 --> 01:10:47,000
Suddenly I'd like to have kids.

848
01:10:49,584 --> 01:10:53,833
Give it to me. Give it to me.
Give it to me!

849
01:10:56,501 --> 01:11:00,041
Ib, stop looking at me like that.

850
01:11:00,167 --> 01:11:03,416
We have to get outta here!
We must find the girls.

851
01:11:03,542 --> 01:11:05,416
We have to put an end to this!

852
01:11:25,001 --> 01:11:28,625
- Pick up the goddamn phone, Ingrid.
- Ingrid speaking.

853
01:11:28,751 --> 01:11:32,666
<i>- Hi, Ingrid, it's me.
- Hi, Edward.</i>

854
01:11:32,792 --> 01:11:36,333
Look, we have to meet right away!

855
01:11:36,459 --> 01:11:41,541
- Don't you boss me around.
- Oh, I didn't mean to boss you around.

856
01:11:41,667 --> 01:11:45,000
You bet you didn't.
You sound so grumpy.

857
01:11:45,126 --> 01:11:49,625
- No, I'm just a bit stressed out.
- You sound grumpy.

858
01:11:49,751 --> 01:11:53,708
I know I'm grumpy.
We've been over it like 4,000 times.

859
01:11:53,834 --> 01:11:57,083
<i>- But it doesn't sink in, does it?
- We have to meet right away.</i>

860
01:11:57,209 --> 01:11:59,625
Let's meet at the inn, then.

861
01:11:59,751 --> 01:12:04,166
No, we can't meet there.

862
01:12:04,292 --> 01:12:06,083
- What's up?
- Be there.

863
01:12:06,209 --> 01:12:09,333
<i>- We'll meet there. No problem.
- Just be there.</i>

864
01:12:09,459 --> 01:12:12,625
Goddamn it, Ib,
We're meeting at the inn.

865
01:12:12,751 --> 01:12:15,166
I couldn't... shit.

866
01:12:15,292 --> 01:12:20,583
Let me out! Fucking bitches!

867
01:12:24,626 --> 01:12:27,875
- What the hell...?
- What the hell happened to you?

868
01:12:31,167 --> 01:12:36,750
- Look, we can't talk here.
- This is a fine place to talk.

869
01:12:36,876 --> 01:12:39,666
You can't hurt us here, you see.

870
01:12:39,792 --> 01:12:42,916
Well, what happened to your killer?

871
01:12:44,417 --> 01:12:47,000
Yes...

872
01:12:47,084 --> 01:12:51,250
- You know?
- We know everything.

873
01:12:51,376 --> 01:12:56,250
As a matter offact,
we've got Heinz on the phone.

874
01:12:56,376 --> 01:12:59,375
We told him we felt threatened -

875
01:12:59,501 --> 01:13:02,375
- so he's ready to move out
if you try anything.

876
01:13:02,501 --> 01:13:06,041
- Oh, Heinz?
- Right, Gritt?

877
01:13:22,334 --> 01:13:24,750
Why are you looking like that?

878
01:13:24,876 --> 01:13:28,375
Maybe you'd like to explain -

879
01:13:28,501 --> 01:13:34,291
- what the hell is going on
in your sick heads. A hitman?!

880
01:13:34,417 --> 01:13:39,458
This whole mess with the divorce
and the moneyjust really got to us -

881
01:13:39,584 --> 01:13:42,375
- and then we did a stupid thing.

882
01:13:42,501 --> 01:13:44,833
It's very human -

883
01:13:45,001 --> 01:13:50,291
- to mess up and live to regret it.

884
01:13:50,417 --> 01:13:55,458
Maybe it's subconscious.
You do something against your will.

885
01:13:55,584 --> 01:13:58,166
You want to do something -

886
01:13:58,292 --> 01:14:00,541
- but you don't want to after all.

887
01:14:00,667 --> 01:14:03,000
We know what subconscious means.

888
01:14:03,126 --> 01:14:07,833
We'd never kill you
on account of alimony.

889
01:14:08,001 --> 01:14:10,166
Nobody deserves to die. Not you either.

890
01:14:10,292 --> 01:14:14,250
- Do you want me to call the police?
- Mind your own business, will you?

891
01:14:14,376 --> 01:14:19,416
- Aren't they threatening to kill you?
- Do we look dead? No, right?

892
01:14:19,542 --> 01:14:24,333
- Ingrid, you'd better keep it down.
- You don't discuss killing your wife.

893
01:14:24,459 --> 01:14:28,250
- We're discussing them considering it.
- Well, you don't consider it either.

894
01:14:28,376 --> 01:14:33,000
So none of you have ever had
forbidden thoughts?

895
01:14:33,126 --> 01:14:36,625
If only you could blow the head off the
guy who cuts you off at the crossing -

896
01:14:36,751 --> 01:14:39,333
- or the guy blocking the escalator.

897
01:14:39,459 --> 01:14:43,833
Or your husband who always forgets your
anniversary and gives you a blender.

898
01:14:44,001 --> 01:14:49,458
Or when you're busy and stuck
in the line at the supermarket -

899
01:14:49,584 --> 01:14:52,875
- I'm just saying, that makes
some of us think certain thoughts.

900
01:14:53,001 --> 01:14:56,833
- But not you.
- That blender works like a dream.

901
01:14:57,001 --> 01:15:00,541
No, you're so polite and you've
got your head so far up your ass -

902
01:15:00,667 --> 01:15:03,000
- you can look out through your throat.

903
01:15:10,834 --> 01:15:13,500
Don't drink any more!

904
01:15:17,292 --> 01:15:19,166
- She's here.
- Get out!

905
01:15:24,876 --> 01:15:28,666
- It's flat! They're all flat!
- Run!

906
01:15:28,792 --> 01:15:33,166
- They're all flat.
- Taxi! Taxi!

907
01:15:39,251 --> 01:15:40,416
Go!

908
01:15:46,042 --> 01:15:49,208
I don't think
you look very happy tonight.

909
01:15:56,001 --> 01:15:58,041
What is wrong with you people?

910
01:16:00,334 --> 01:16:04,375
You have no problems.
You have no problems.

911
01:16:04,501 --> 01:16:08,625
My mother and father in Murmansk
far away, they have problems.

912
01:16:08,751 --> 01:16:12,291
They live together for 50 years.
They are married for 50 years -

913
01:16:12,417 --> 01:16:15,541
- but they still kiss.

914
01:16:15,667 --> 01:16:21,125
They have problems, they fight.
She hit him, he fall, she pick him up.

915
01:16:21,251 --> 01:16:26,708
But they love each other, they kiss
each other, they fuck each other.

916
01:16:26,834 --> 01:16:31,833
She's very, very big woman,
and he has a very, very small dick.

917
01:16:32,001 --> 01:16:37,416
But you know, a little tiny fuck
is always better than no fuck.

918
01:16:37,542 --> 01:16:43,375
And you have everything. You have
woman, man, car, house, money.

919
01:16:43,501 --> 01:16:46,500
You have everything,
but you have no fuck!

920
01:16:46,626 --> 01:16:51,000
Edward... Edward?
What are you doing, Edward?

921
01:16:51,751 --> 01:16:55,000
Sit.
Sit down, Edward.

922
01:17:01,292 --> 01:17:07,000
I really like you guys, but it just
makes me so sad when I see sad people.

923
01:17:07,126 --> 01:17:10,666
Hello, Igor?
You're alright, you're okay.

924
01:17:10,792 --> 01:17:15,875
You talk about being happy
all the time -

925
01:17:16,001 --> 01:17:20,000
- but are you happy, Igor?
Where is love in your life?

926
01:17:20,126 --> 01:17:25,708
I think you just kill people
because they're like you. Unhappy.

927
01:17:27,001 --> 01:17:30,791
You really think this is some kind
of stupid movie moment?

928
01:17:30,917 --> 01:17:36,041
Yes, Igor. This is where
the good guy talks to the bad guy -

929
01:17:36,167 --> 01:17:41,333
- and he makes him realize
that he's totally wrong.

930
01:17:41,459 --> 01:17:44,000
I haven't seen that work in a movie.

931
01:17:44,084 --> 01:17:47,541
Then you haven't seen many, many movies.

932
01:17:47,667 --> 01:17:51,041
- There's many, many, many movies...
- Name one.

933
01:17:54,584 --> 01:17:58,458
Okay, Igor, then try this one.

934
01:17:58,584 --> 01:18:03,041
Have you ever given it a thought
that maybe people are unhappy -

935
01:18:03,167 --> 01:18:07,708
- just before you're going to kill them,
because you are going to kill them?

936
01:18:08,584 --> 01:18:11,916
Maybe that makes them
just a tiny little bit unhappy.

937
01:18:12,042 --> 01:18:17,458
Think that might just play a tiny little
fucking role, huh, you stupid Russian?

938
01:18:18,876 --> 01:18:22,458
Okay, Edward, now you tell me -

939
01:18:22,584 --> 01:18:24,666
- or I will kill you.

940
01:18:24,792 --> 01:18:27,791
When was the last time
you made your woman happy?

941
01:18:27,917 --> 01:18:31,458
There's never any time! She's going to
her goddamn salsa lessons all the time.

942
01:18:31,584 --> 01:18:33,333
Oh, cut it out!

943
01:18:39,542 --> 01:18:42,041
- Now we have a little time.
- What?

944
01:18:42,167 --> 01:18:45,708
So try to make her happy, Edward.

945
01:18:49,876 --> 01:18:54,000
- Well, what do you want me to say?
- Christ, you're romantic!

946
01:18:54,126 --> 01:18:58,291
- Say something to her.
- Sure.

947
01:18:58,417 --> 01:19:00,458
Sure...

948
01:19:00,584 --> 01:19:03,250
Ingrid, I think you're hot.

949
01:19:03,376 --> 01:19:07,208
And I think
it's a waste of tits and ass...

950
01:19:07,334 --> 01:19:11,458
- Holy crap!
- At least pretend I'm making you happy!

951
01:19:11,584 --> 01:19:15,458
He doesn't understand Danish.
Or would you rather die?

952
01:19:15,584 --> 01:19:19,291
Edward, try to talk about her eyes.

953
01:19:22,126 --> 01:19:26,833
Yes, well... Your eyes are so...

954
01:19:27,001 --> 01:19:30,500
Sure, your eyes are...

955
01:19:31,251 --> 01:19:33,791
...round and blue.

956
01:19:33,917 --> 01:19:37,083
Grey, green, no, brown.

957
01:19:37,209 --> 01:19:39,583
- They're blue-grey, you idiot!
- Shit!

958
01:19:39,709 --> 01:19:44,625
Ingrid, you're always on my mind.
You're with me all the time.

959
01:19:46,834 --> 01:19:52,250
And it's not your ass I see, but your
eyes, because they're really special -

960
01:19:52,376 --> 01:19:57,791
- your eyes are.
Both deep and... naughty.

961
01:19:57,917 --> 01:20:00,791
You have very intense eyes.

962
01:20:00,917 --> 01:20:05,875
I don't understand
why you're with a grump like me.

963
01:20:06,001 --> 01:20:09,875
But then you aren't anymore.

964
01:20:11,167 --> 01:20:16,000
All I know is
that for the rest of my life -

965
01:20:16,126 --> 01:20:19,416
- I'll remember those eyes.

966
01:20:22,584 --> 01:20:26,291
But then that's only
a couple of minutes.

967
01:20:26,417 --> 01:20:29,375
I'm sorry, darling.

968
01:20:29,501 --> 01:20:33,916
Oh, Edward,
I don't want anybody else than you.

969
01:20:34,042 --> 01:20:37,541
If only you were someone else.

970
01:20:45,584 --> 01:20:47,875
That was beautiful.

971
01:20:48,001 --> 01:20:52,000
Edward, you make us happy.

972
01:20:59,042 --> 01:21:01,166
Igor?

973
01:21:04,209 --> 01:21:08,875
<i>Cyanide... 30 seconds.
And nothing...</i>

974
01:21:09,001 --> 01:21:12,416
Haven't tasted such shitty vodka
since I was eight.

975
01:21:40,542 --> 01:21:41,750
No!

976
01:21:55,376 --> 01:21:57,000
No!

977
01:22:16,751 --> 01:22:19,583
The word salsa!

978
01:22:19,709 --> 01:22:25,375
Some say it comes from the sound
the Cuban musicians made -

979
01:22:25,501 --> 01:22:28,583
- while they played.

980
01:22:28,709 --> 01:22:35,250
Others claim it's because
salsa is a blend of many styles.

981
01:22:35,376 --> 01:22:40,541
Like the salsa sauce.
A little bit of everything.

982
01:22:40,667 --> 01:22:46,083
A little soft, a little sweet,
a little spicy.

983
01:22:46,209 --> 01:22:51,458
Like life itself.
We love, we hate.

984
01:22:51,584 --> 01:22:54,875
We fight -

985
01:22:55,001 --> 01:22:56,500
- and we kiss.

986
01:23:56,126 --> 01:23:59,708
Shit, I hate this.
It just isn't me at all.

987
01:23:59,834 --> 01:24:03,208
It's a load of bull.
These clothes are too tight.

988
01:24:03,334 --> 01:24:07,041
They're not intended to be worn.
They make you look stupid.

989
01:24:07,167 --> 01:24:09,541
It's not me at all.

990
01:24:09,667 --> 01:24:13,458
- Well, Gritt and I are off now.
- Already?

991
01:24:13,584 --> 01:24:16,041
Gritt's ovaries hurt.

992
01:24:16,167 --> 01:24:19,041
You're brave.
What about nuchal folds?

993
01:24:19,167 --> 01:24:23,541
With or without nuchal folds.
Ovulation in an hour.

994
01:25:14,501 --> 01:25:19,041
So, you finally finished
the Great Wall of China, huh?

995
01:25:19,167 --> 01:25:21,458
No need for sarcasm.

996
01:25:21,584 --> 01:25:26,416
- How are things with the girls at home?
- Just fine, Mrs. Hansen.

997
01:25:26,542 --> 01:25:30,875
It sure sounds like
you're boring in bed.

998
01:25:31,001 --> 01:25:36,000
- But, Mrs. Hansen...
- Time for a screwdriver!

999
01:25:37,501 --> 01:25:41,708
Oh dear.
Give me a hand, will you?

1000
01:25:41,834 --> 01:25:44,666
As for your women...

1001
01:25:44,792 --> 01:25:49,041
Men don't understand
it's all about the clitoris.

1002
01:25:49,167 --> 01:25:51,416
Most can't even find it.

1003
01:25:51,542 --> 01:25:55,416
And not only my late Poul,
but all my lovers.

1004
01:25:55,542 --> 01:25:57,666
Couldn't find it.

1005
01:25:57,792 --> 01:26:03,041
Searched for it like
it was the Higgs Boson in Switzerland.

1006
01:26:03,167 --> 01:26:06,708
They kept licking away
in all the wrong places.

1007
01:26:06,834 --> 01:26:13,458
No, I won't climax
if you put my big toe in your mouth!

1008
01:26:13,584 --> 01:26:17,041
How about I show you how it's done?

1009
01:26:17,167 --> 01:26:20,458
We could all go lie on the sofa.

1010
01:26:20,584 --> 01:26:24,000
My crawl space could do
with a nice makeover.

1011
01:26:24,876 --> 01:26:28,166
Let's just settle the bill later,
Mrs. Hansen.

1012

00:01:09,667 --> 00:01:10,792
Where are the boys?

2
00:01:12,958 --> 00:01:14,083
Come here, you!

3
00:01:14,250 --> 00:01:16,833
You whore! Come with me!

4
00:01:28,208 --> 00:01:29,625
Don't touch my brother!

5
00:01:30,167 --> 00:01:33,250
- Let him go!
- Where's your mother?

6
00:01:33,833 --> 00:01:34,958
Let them go!

7
00:01:35,167 --> 00:01:36,917
They're just kids!
Let them go.

8
00:01:44,250 --> 00:01:46,750
Let's fucking castrate him now,

9
00:01:46,917 --> 00:01:49,125
it's no fun when they're dead.

10
00:01:49,292 --> 00:01:51,958
Damn it! Let's just finish this!

11
00:01:52,125 --> 00:01:55,083
You can kill every priest
and landlord in Spain,

12
00:01:55,250 --> 00:01:56,958
but you'll never win!

13
00:01:57,125 --> 00:01:58,208
You're scum!

14
00:02:07,458 --> 00:02:10,167
Now bring out his wife and kids.

15
00:02:10,333 --> 00:02:12,667
No!
You can't kill two innocent boys.

16
00:02:12,833 --> 00:02:13,500
No!

17
00:02:13,667 --> 00:02:15,625
I'm not even his wife.

18
00:02:16,750 --> 00:02:17,875
Josico.

19
00:02:18,042 --> 00:02:19,292
Josico, tell him.

20
00:02:19,875 --> 00:02:22,958
I'm Cagorcio's daughter.
We were never married.

21
00:02:23,167 --> 00:02:26,542
These poor boys
won't even inherit his name!

22
00:02:26,708 --> 00:02:28,042
Is that true?

23
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:30,917
Yes, she was his mistress.

24
00:02:31,292 --> 00:02:33,667
But he wouldn't marry a maid.

25
00:02:34,417 --> 00:02:36,292
So the boys were born bastards.

26
00:02:36,583 --> 00:02:38,667
Typical bloody toff.

27
00:02:39,667 --> 00:02:40,667
Don't touch me.

28
00:02:40,833 --> 00:02:43,500
- Don't fucking touch me!
- Please!

29
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:47,583
We'll let them go.

30
00:02:48,417 --> 00:02:50,333
Should we torch the castle?

31
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:52,833
No, no.
It'll make a nice HQ.

32
00:02:52,958 --> 00:02:56,792
I'm sure our maid here
will keep it tidy, right?

33
00:02:56,958 --> 00:02:58,042
Right?

34
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:04,958
Now throw this sack of shit
to the vultures!

35
00:03:13,667 --> 00:03:17,667
UNCERTAIN GLORY

36
00:03:42,375 --> 00:03:44,042
Long live the Republic!

37
00:05:29,667 --> 00:05:32,958
ARAGON FRONT
SPANISH CIVIL WAR, JUNE 1937

38
00:05:42,292 --> 00:05:43,750
I'm Lieutenant Sales.

39
00:05:44,083 --> 00:05:46,208
- Forgive me, lieutenant.
- At ease.

40
00:05:46,750 --> 00:05:48,750
I'm to report to Captain Picó.

41
00:05:49,458 --> 00:05:50,875
He's been expecting you.

42
00:05:51,250 --> 00:05:52,292
He's at the river.

43
00:05:52,875 --> 00:05:54,583
Suau, go with the Lieutenant.

44
00:05:58,708 --> 00:06:02,208
We have two great enemies:
lice and pornography.

45
00:06:02,625 --> 00:06:05,625
Plagues of war,
as Napoleon called them.

46
00:06:06,042 --> 00:06:08,125
Lice and pornography!

47
00:06:09,208 --> 00:06:11,708
We will only defeat our enemies

48
00:06:11,875 --> 00:06:16,792
if we scrub ourselves clean,
both physically and morally.

49
00:06:17,917 --> 00:06:19,583
OK, hand it out.

50
00:06:19,750 --> 00:06:22,250
- Yes, sir!
- Make good use of this soap.

51
00:06:22,875 --> 00:06:24,375
And make it last.

52
00:06:24,750 --> 00:06:25,875
Is that clear?

53
00:06:26,042 --> 00:06:26,875
Is that clear?

54
00:06:27,042 --> 00:06:28,500
Yes, sir!

55
00:06:28,667 --> 00:06:31,333
Now get undressed.
Fall out!

56
00:06:38,875 --> 00:06:41,375
You too, lieutenant.
Don't be shy.

57
00:06:43,750 --> 00:06:46,208
Don't be ashamed
of your shameful parts!

58
00:06:46,375 --> 00:06:47,542
We've all got one.

59
00:06:47,708 --> 00:06:51,250
I want the cleanest regiment
in the Republican army.

60
00:06:51,417 --> 00:06:53,125
Then, and only then,

61
00:06:53,292 --> 00:06:57,292
will we dirty our hands
with the blood of those fascists.

62
00:06:57,458 --> 00:07:01,125
Hygiene is the first step to glory!

63
00:07:03,458 --> 00:07:05,917
This whole battalion is disgusting.

64
00:07:06,417 --> 00:07:07,708
No hygiene or culture.

65
00:07:07,875 --> 00:07:10,333
As long as they will fight
for their ideals...

66
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:11,958
Nobody here has ideals.

67
00:07:12,792 --> 00:07:14,750
Or principles... Hey!

68
00:07:14,917 --> 00:07:16,542
We need them, if we want to win.

69
00:07:16,708 --> 00:07:19,167
This front has been dead for months.

70
00:07:19,333 --> 00:07:21,667
Franco is concentrating on Madrid,

71
00:07:21,833 --> 00:07:24,875
and we're here,
like cast-off old whores.

72
00:07:25,042 --> 00:07:26,417
We have to do something.

73
00:07:26,583 --> 00:07:28,375
You want to kill fascists.

74
00:07:28,542 --> 00:07:30,458
I don't want to kill anyone.

75
00:07:30,625 --> 00:07:33,167
But we need to defend
the rights of the Republic.

76
00:07:36,167 --> 00:07:39,167
I hear there's an officer here
called Soleràs.

77
00:07:39,333 --> 00:07:41,208
- Juli Soleràs?
- Juli, yes.

78
00:07:41,375 --> 00:07:42,542
What about him?

79
00:07:42,708 --> 00:07:44,667
We're mates.
We studied together.

80
00:07:44,833 --> 00:07:47,958
That surprises me.
A cultured man like yourself...

81
00:07:48,125 --> 00:07:50,958
What?
Juli is educated and clever...

82
00:07:51,167 --> 00:07:52,792
He has no morals or principles.

83
00:07:52,958 --> 00:07:54,625
Take the last battle we had.

84
00:07:54,792 --> 00:07:57,458
He took out 20 fascists
with a machine gun,

85
00:07:57,625 --> 00:07:59,750
then he just buggered off

86
00:07:59,917 --> 00:08:02,292
and left,
in the middle of the battle.

87
00:08:02,458 --> 00:08:03,625
Don't laugh.

88
00:08:03,792 --> 00:08:05,875
We should've shot him for it.

89
00:08:06,750 --> 00:08:08,958
This is it.
You'll be all right here.

90
00:08:11,458 --> 00:08:12,458
Olegaria!

91
00:08:13,833 --> 00:08:15,333
Yes, Captain.

92
00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:18,083
You'll eat well in this house.

93
00:08:18,583 --> 00:08:20,875
Look, some tasty haggis.

94
00:08:23,083 --> 00:08:24,750
I'll show you around.

95
00:08:25,542 --> 00:08:26,958
My nephew.

96
00:08:27,417 --> 00:08:28,417
Handsome.

97
00:08:29,250 --> 00:08:31,042
Joined up at 16.

98
00:08:31,208 --> 00:08:34,208
I don't know which regiment,
he's on the other side.

99
00:08:34,375 --> 00:08:35,958
This way, Master Lluís.

100
00:08:36,833 --> 00:08:39,167
You'll have the boy's room.

101
00:08:39,667 --> 00:08:41,958
The war caught him
on the other side.

102
00:08:42,125 --> 00:08:43,917
That's how it is here.

103
00:08:44,083 --> 00:08:46,042
You enlist or you get shot.

104
00:08:46,208 --> 00:08:48,583
At least it wasn't the anarchists.

105
00:08:48,750 --> 00:08:51,625
They killed all the friars
from the monastery.

106
00:08:52,667 --> 00:08:54,375
Master Lluís,

107
00:08:54,542 --> 00:08:55,917
don't take this badly,

108
00:08:56,083 --> 00:08:58,292
but I don't care
who wins the war.

109
00:08:58,458 --> 00:09:00,208
I just want it to end.

110
00:09:20,417 --> 00:09:24,083
DEAR TRINI

111
00:09:40,042 --> 00:09:42,750
In my village,
we have ploughs for this.

112
00:09:42,917 --> 00:09:44,792
But they don't give you soap.

113
00:09:45,958 --> 00:09:48,292
Why do they need a trench anyway?

114
00:09:48,458 --> 00:09:51,542
To bury us in when we're killed.
Saves time.

115
00:09:51,958 --> 00:09:53,125
Listen up!

116
00:09:54,125 --> 00:09:57,583
That trench is to protect us
from the enemy.

117
00:09:57,750 --> 00:10:00,292
From here,
we can spot any movement.

118
00:10:00,458 --> 00:10:03,167
It protects us
from bullets and bombs.

119
00:10:03,625 --> 00:10:06,333
Some of us might die in this trench,

120
00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:09,583
but we will beat them from here.
Got it?

121
00:10:09,750 --> 00:10:10,750
Yes, sir!

122
00:10:42,958 --> 00:10:45,417
We bring our dying animals here.

123
00:10:46,125 --> 00:10:49,292
While they can still walk.
Then we throw them down.

124
00:10:50,208 --> 00:10:52,375
The vultures do the rest.

125
00:10:53,167 --> 00:10:55,083
Some people end up here too.

126
00:10:55,708 --> 00:10:57,333
My husband is down there.

127
00:11:07,875 --> 00:11:10,167
- You're new here.
- Yes.

128
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:11,833
I'm training the soldiers.

129
00:11:11,958 --> 00:11:14,458
Really?
What does that involve?

130
00:11:15,083 --> 00:11:16,583
Teaching them to kill.

131
00:11:16,958 --> 00:11:18,833
I thought that came naturally.

132
00:11:20,667 --> 00:11:23,167
I almost killed my mother
when I was born.

133
00:11:23,917 --> 00:11:26,417
That little one there
almost killed me.

134
00:11:27,333 --> 00:11:28,625
I'm glad he didn't.

135
00:11:30,958 --> 00:11:32,458
How come you speak Catalan?

136
00:11:34,125 --> 00:11:36,167
My husband was from Barcelona.

137
00:11:36,333 --> 00:11:37,708
I lived there for years.

138
00:11:37,875 --> 00:11:40,333
- Are you from Barcelona?
- Yes.

139
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:42,542
And when you're not
giving killing lessons?

140
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:46,625
I studied law.
I wanted to be a lawyer.

141
00:11:47,417 --> 00:11:49,750
I see you're from a good family.

142
00:11:49,917 --> 00:11:52,000
This desert is bigger than it looks.

143
00:11:52,917 --> 00:11:55,958
In those boots,
you won't even reach the enemy.

144
00:12:42,542 --> 00:12:44,542
- What?
- Don't you ever knock?

145
00:12:44,708 --> 00:12:46,958
Too risky.
People wouldn't let me in.

146
00:12:49,958 --> 00:12:51,542
Let's not get carried away.

147
00:12:51,708 --> 00:12:54,083
You have a great view from here.

148
00:12:54,417 --> 00:12:56,375
How do you always get what I want?

149
00:12:56,750 --> 00:12:58,500
By being friendly and polite.

150
00:13:00,083 --> 00:13:01,333
You still have it?

151
00:13:01,750 --> 00:13:03,958
This?
I'll take it to my grave.

152
00:13:04,292 --> 00:13:07,125
- Anything interesting up there?
- More than here.

153
00:13:07,292 --> 00:13:08,958
I bet. This place is dead.

154
00:13:09,167 --> 00:13:11,667
The Fascists
could be in Barcelona by now,

155
00:13:11,833 --> 00:13:14,875
but they use the ARAGON front
to make the war drag on.

156
00:13:15,042 --> 00:13:18,083
The longer it takes,
the greater the triumph.

157
00:13:18,375 --> 00:13:19,792
And we get to die of boredom.

158
00:13:19,958 --> 00:13:22,083
But smelling of soap!

159
00:13:22,792 --> 00:13:25,917
Not you!
You stink like a pig.

160
00:13:26,083 --> 00:13:27,833
Follow my scent, then shoot me.

161
00:13:27,958 --> 00:13:29,375
Sounds good.

162
00:13:30,875 --> 00:13:34,167
Let's celebrate this reunion
with some fascist brandy.

163
00:13:34,333 --> 00:13:36,625
- Are you crazy?
- I know where to get some.

164
00:13:39,167 --> 00:13:41,750
You achieved glory
by killing a load of fascists,

165
00:13:41,917 --> 00:13:43,250
then just walked away.

166
00:13:43,417 --> 00:13:45,083
I left when it was over.

167
00:13:45,250 --> 00:13:47,792
Glory only lasts a second.

168
00:13:47,958 --> 00:13:50,500
I experienced it and then I split.

169
00:13:50,792 --> 00:13:53,167
I must admit,
it felt like an eternity.

170
00:13:55,625 --> 00:13:57,458
Now I'm counting chickpeas.

171
00:13:57,625 --> 00:14:01,208
Apparently, someone
who leaves their post like that

172
00:14:01,375 --> 00:14:02,708
can't be trusted.

173
00:14:04,750 --> 00:14:06,417
Am I a bad example to the men?

174
00:14:06,958 --> 00:14:07,958
Yes.

175
00:14:13,292 --> 00:14:13,958
Juli?

176
00:14:14,125 --> 00:14:16,542
Watch your back!
Always watch your back.

177
00:14:16,708 --> 00:14:18,792
You can't trust your mates.

178
00:14:20,292 --> 00:14:22,125
Dinner's ready!

179
00:14:25,958 --> 00:14:27,333
Look.

180
00:14:29,750 --> 00:14:31,250
Look, a piano.

181
00:15:10,042 --> 00:15:11,042
Juli!

182
00:15:12,250 --> 00:15:13,625
Juli, get down.

183
00:15:13,792 --> 00:15:14,792
Juli!

184
00:15:43,417 --> 00:15:44,667
It's somebody's house!

185
00:15:44,833 --> 00:15:48,625
You don't abandon a house
and expect to find it the same.

186
00:15:48,792 --> 00:15:50,583
- Juli, you're an officer.
- Yes.

187
00:15:50,750 --> 00:15:54,083
You shouldn't be stealing,
or counting chickpeas.

188
00:15:54,250 --> 00:15:57,750
My subordinate does that.
You know I'm no good at numbers.

189
00:15:59,125 --> 00:15:59,875
<i>Et Voilà.</i>

190
00:16:00,042 --> 00:16:02,042
So what are you good at?

191
00:16:02,958 --> 00:16:04,250
Escapism.

192
00:16:05,042 --> 00:16:07,958
I could do it for a living
when I grow up.

193
00:16:08,125 --> 00:16:09,708
But you're good at it too.

194
00:16:09,875 --> 00:16:11,708
What do you mean?

195
00:16:11,875 --> 00:16:15,208
Ask Trini.
You don't even open her letters.

196
00:16:15,667 --> 00:16:17,458
Spying on your best friend now?

197
00:16:17,625 --> 00:16:19,667
Don't you care about anything?

198
00:16:19,833 --> 00:16:22,708
The man of great principles
is wrong again.

199
00:16:23,250 --> 00:16:26,125
You know what I care about?
The stars.

200
00:16:26,583 --> 00:16:28,250
And one in particular.

201
00:16:29,208 --> 00:16:32,708
It's getting fainter every day,
and is about to go out.

202
00:16:32,875 --> 00:16:34,542
There are millions of stars.

203
00:16:34,792 --> 00:16:36,375
Be careful, Lluís.

204
00:16:36,833 --> 00:16:39,167
Trini is like
these abandoned houses.

205
00:16:39,667 --> 00:16:41,833
A stranger
could start poking around.

206
00:16:43,417 --> 00:16:45,250
Don't talk to me about Trini.

207
00:16:58,542 --> 00:17:00,875
Juli! Come!

208
00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:05,417
- What is it?
- There are some fascists over there.

209
00:17:09,083 --> 00:17:12,208
- See?
- Yes. So what? That's their side.

210
00:17:12,750 --> 00:17:13,750
What do you mean?

211
00:17:13,833 --> 00:17:17,417
Abandoned villages are the store
where both sides go shopping.

212
00:17:17,583 --> 00:17:19,833
If nobody crosses the line, it's fine.

213
00:17:20,167 --> 00:17:21,458
Put your gun away.

214
00:17:42,208 --> 00:17:44,667
- Reporting for duty, Captain.
- At ease.

215
00:17:44,833 --> 00:17:47,917
I'm making a contraption
to scare away the flies.

216
00:17:48,083 --> 00:17:50,458
This says
I'm to requisition a horse.

217
00:17:50,625 --> 00:17:54,208
This is a large area,
and we're short of cavalry.

218
00:17:54,375 --> 00:17:56,417
You'll need to get closer
to the other side.

219
00:17:56,583 --> 00:17:59,875
So where can I find one?
The locals only have donkeys.

220
00:18:00,042 --> 00:18:02,500
You can use the<i> Carlán's</i> mare.

221
00:18:02,667 --> 00:18:05,125
His widow has kindly offered
to let you ride her.

222
00:18:06,125 --> 00:18:06,875
Me?

223
00:18:07,042 --> 00:18:08,875
You made a good impression.

224
00:18:34,750 --> 00:18:35,792
Shut up!

225
00:18:35,958 --> 00:18:36,958
Is Mrs Olivella home?

226
00:19:06,208 --> 00:19:07,208
Leave us, Fermín.

227
00:19:08,625 --> 00:19:11,042
And put the axe away,
we're not at war here.

228
00:19:12,458 --> 00:19:13,458
Are we?

229
00:19:13,625 --> 00:19:14,708
No.

230
00:19:15,083 --> 00:19:16,583
I don't have servants.

231
00:19:16,750 --> 00:19:19,750
Just him, and a maid
who is out with the boys.

232
00:19:19,917 --> 00:19:21,333
Mrs Olivella.

233
00:19:27,208 --> 00:19:29,167
Forgive my boldness.

234
00:19:29,333 --> 00:19:31,792
The Captain sent me
about the horse.

235
00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:35,042
- The horse...
- My late husband's horse.

236
00:19:36,333 --> 00:19:37,917
She is yours to use.

237
00:19:38,083 --> 00:19:41,750
But you won't get far
with those boots. Follow me.

238
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:47,167
You be rough
and gentle at the same time.

239
00:19:48,625 --> 00:19:50,958
My husband did it every night.

240
00:19:52,625 --> 00:19:55,083
He loved Bellota
more than anything.

241
00:19:57,583 --> 00:19:59,458
Only he could ride her.

242
00:20:02,125 --> 00:20:03,917
I'm sorry to deprive you of her.

243
00:20:04,083 --> 00:20:07,208
We're at war.
We must help however we can.

244
00:20:07,833 --> 00:20:09,583
We can't hang on
to what we have.

245
00:20:11,042 --> 00:20:13,875
We could lose everything
in an instant.

246
00:20:14,750 --> 00:20:17,958
And since she's had
nobody to ride her,

247
00:20:19,250 --> 00:20:20,958
she's been very sad.

248
00:20:21,875 --> 00:20:25,125
She's getting old,
she thinks nobody loves her.

249
00:20:27,583 --> 00:20:28,625
Get on.

250
00:20:57,875 --> 00:20:58,875
Easy.

251
00:21:01,792 --> 00:21:02,875
Good, Bellota.

252
00:21:03,875 --> 00:21:06,375
I think she likes you.

253
00:21:07,250 --> 00:21:09,167
You must have work to do.

254
00:21:09,333 --> 00:21:11,208
Yes, inspecting the troops.

255
00:21:11,583 --> 00:21:13,833
Don't forget to teach them
staying alive.

256
00:21:13,958 --> 00:21:15,500
It's harder than killing,

257
00:21:16,208 --> 00:21:18,333
although sometimes,
the two go together.

258
00:22:04,292 --> 00:22:06,542
What a fine companion, Master Lluís.

259
00:22:06,708 --> 00:22:08,542
- Where can I put her?
- Under shelter.

260
00:22:08,708 --> 00:22:12,333
They say it's going to rain,
and this place floods easily.

261
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:15,083
Look at the horse.

262
00:22:15,250 --> 00:22:16,583
What are they whispering?

263
00:22:17,792 --> 00:22:19,625
Mind your own business!

264
00:22:20,375 --> 00:22:23,375
That's the<i> Carlana's</i> horse, isn't it?

265
00:22:23,542 --> 00:22:24,917
Yes. The Lady of the Manor.

266
00:22:28,375 --> 00:22:29,208
What's so funny?

267
00:22:29,375 --> 00:22:33,333
The<i> Carlana</i> is anything but a lady.

268
00:22:33,500 --> 00:22:34,583
What do you mean?

269
00:22:34,917 --> 00:22:36,542
If only you knew.

270
00:22:36,708 --> 00:22:38,833
Her own father, Cagorcio,

271
00:22:38,958 --> 00:22:41,417
called her ""the dirty pig"" because

272
00:22:41,583 --> 00:22:43,458
she would bathe
naked in a trough,

273
00:22:43,625 --> 00:22:45,250
and it shocked people here.

274
00:22:45,417 --> 00:22:47,083
She seemed a very nice lady.

275
00:22:47,250 --> 00:22:48,958
If you say so, but the<i> Carlana</i>

276
00:22:49,167 --> 00:22:52,875
is not a lady,
she's not even the<i> Carlán's</i> widow.

277
00:22:53,042 --> 00:22:55,292
He just gave her two bastard sons.

278
00:23:27,875 --> 00:23:28,875
Good morning.

279
00:23:29,042 --> 00:23:30,958
I'm with the Republicans here,

280
00:23:31,167 --> 00:23:33,458
but my wife is sick in Barcelona.

281
00:23:33,625 --> 00:23:35,375
If you were going that way...

282
00:23:38,875 --> 00:23:42,375
I can drop you at Plaza Palau,
where I'm going.

283
00:23:42,750 --> 00:23:44,625
Don't ask me to go any further.

284
00:23:46,625 --> 00:23:48,792
No, no.
In the back with the sheep.

285
00:23:49,958 --> 00:23:51,917
Fine.
I like them more than people.

286
00:24:03,333 --> 00:24:07,333
BARCELONA

287
00:24:16,792 --> 00:24:17,875
Hurry up.

288
00:24:22,417 --> 00:24:23,417
Here.

289
00:24:24,292 --> 00:24:25,542
At your service.

290
00:24:25,958 --> 00:24:27,125
Comrade!

291
00:25:27,417 --> 00:25:29,333
Eat your onion.

292
00:26:38,708 --> 00:26:39,708
Trini!

293
00:26:44,708 --> 00:26:46,375
Juli!

294
00:26:46,625 --> 00:26:47,792
Always playing!

295
00:26:48,750 --> 00:26:49,833
You smell great.

296
00:26:49,958 --> 00:26:51,083
You stink of sheep.

297
00:26:51,250 --> 00:26:54,625
No, it's dung.
The latest perfume from Paris.

298
00:26:55,958 --> 00:26:57,292
How is Lluís?

299
00:26:57,458 --> 00:26:59,958
Fine.
Getting on with the new regiment.

300
00:27:00,125 --> 00:27:03,083
- He hasn't written for months.
- That place is a mess.

301
00:27:03,250 --> 00:27:05,958
But don't worry,
the front itself is quiet.

302
00:27:06,167 --> 00:27:07,250
Not like here then.

303
00:27:07,417 --> 00:27:10,083
People don't realise
how hellish life is in Barcelona.

304
00:27:10,292 --> 00:27:11,500
Ramonet!

305
00:27:11,875 --> 00:27:14,292
- Uncle Juli!
- Hello!

306
00:27:15,250 --> 00:27:16,750
- What did you bring me?
- Ramonet!

307
00:27:16,917 --> 00:27:18,417
- You'll see.
- Always want more.

308
00:27:18,583 --> 00:27:19,917
He's like me.

309
00:27:20,375 --> 00:27:23,333
- Look!
- Uncle Juli brought you a doll.

310
00:27:23,500 --> 00:27:25,292
Dolls are for girls.

311
00:27:25,458 --> 00:27:29,542
Not a doll, a soldier,
like your daddy and me.

312
00:27:30,083 --> 00:27:33,583
We'll make him a rifle
and a uniform. Here.

313
00:27:35,625 --> 00:27:37,375
Put these greens on to boil.

314
00:27:37,542 --> 00:27:40,083
- And the potatoes?
- No, there aren't any.

315
00:27:40,250 --> 00:27:42,458
I have something for you too.

316
00:27:44,958 --> 00:27:46,167
Is that a Christmas tree?

317
00:27:46,333 --> 00:27:49,042
I keep them.
They're like treasure.

318
00:27:49,208 --> 00:27:50,667
If it wasn't for you...

319
00:27:51,500 --> 00:27:53,083
I'd like to do more.

320
00:27:53,250 --> 00:27:54,708
You do plenty.

321
00:27:57,917 --> 00:27:59,917
Did you know we got baptized?

322
00:28:00,458 --> 00:28:01,958
No, that is a miracle.

323
00:28:02,125 --> 00:28:04,625
Trini, the atheist anarchist
gets baptized.

324
00:28:04,792 --> 00:28:07,458
- I daren't tell Lluís.
- He'd kill you.

325
00:28:07,625 --> 00:28:09,167
I know,

326
00:28:09,792 --> 00:28:11,708
but it makes me feel less alone.

327
00:28:13,292 --> 00:28:14,458
Hold out your hand.

328
00:28:20,542 --> 00:28:22,167
It's beautiful.

329
00:28:26,667 --> 00:28:27,708
Where did you find it?

330
00:28:28,167 --> 00:28:32,167
In a church with no roof.
It's really dark.

331
00:28:32,333 --> 00:28:34,708
I go there to look at the stars.

332
00:28:35,542 --> 00:28:38,167
- Is it a meteorite?
- I don't know.

333
00:28:38,333 --> 00:28:40,167
You're the geologist.

334
00:28:42,125 --> 00:28:43,625
I'll study it.

335
00:28:44,250 --> 00:28:46,833
Wherever it came from,

336
00:28:46,958 --> 00:28:49,458
it's the best gift I've ever had.

337
00:29:16,417 --> 00:29:17,417
Hurry up!

338
00:29:18,042 --> 00:29:20,375
It's going to pour down any minute.

339
00:29:20,875 --> 00:29:23,625
Fasten it down,
or it'll get washed away.

340
00:29:32,792 --> 00:29:34,750
You rascal!

341
00:29:34,917 --> 00:29:36,500
You rascal!

342
00:29:36,667 --> 00:29:39,167
You've blinded me!

343
00:29:39,458 --> 00:29:42,667
You've blinded me!

344
00:29:43,083 --> 00:29:46,583
The little girl
saw her chance to escape.

345
00:29:46,750 --> 00:29:49,042
When she reached the door,

346
00:29:49,208 --> 00:29:51,667
she couldn't believe her eyes.

347
00:29:51,833 --> 00:29:55,958
The stepmother was holding
a huge stick to beat her with.

348
00:29:56,542 --> 00:30:00,458
Why doesn't my dad
go and bash the stepmother?

349
00:30:00,625 --> 00:30:02,625
He can't.
He's away at the war.

350
00:30:02,792 --> 00:30:04,542
Then I want to go too.

351
00:30:04,875 --> 00:30:08,375
Really?
But then who will look after me?

352
00:30:08,542 --> 00:30:10,375
I will, Mummy.

353
00:30:20,292 --> 00:30:21,292
How are you?

354
00:30:23,458 --> 00:30:25,208
Tired, Trini.

355
00:30:26,167 --> 00:30:27,583
I want to leave this world,

356
00:30:27,750 --> 00:30:30,583
or get married,
and read fairy tales.

357
00:30:30,750 --> 00:30:34,042
- Why don't you then?
- No woman could love me.

358
00:30:34,208 --> 00:30:36,667
You? You're made
to make some woman happy.

359
00:30:36,833 --> 00:30:38,083
Then marry me.

360
00:30:38,250 --> 00:30:39,958
- Don't be an animal.
- An animal? Me?

361
00:30:40,125 --> 00:30:42,292
Yes, you! Animal!

362
00:30:43,792 --> 00:30:45,708
I can talk to you like a brother.

363
00:30:47,125 --> 00:30:49,250
Lluís is completely ignoring me.

364
00:30:49,625 --> 00:30:53,417
I know you're trying
to get him to come back to me,

365
00:30:54,458 --> 00:30:56,750
but I don't think
it'll ever be the same.

366
00:31:14,833 --> 00:31:17,250
This country
has been poisoned forever.

367
00:31:18,583 --> 00:31:20,833
Don't let the mud cover your eyes.

368
00:31:21,667 --> 00:31:23,333
You have to see the stars.

369
00:31:24,458 --> 00:31:26,750
Our ideals were so good,

370
00:31:27,167 --> 00:31:29,250
so beautiful to live by,

371
00:31:30,083 --> 00:31:32,208
really believing in something.

372
00:31:32,375 --> 00:31:33,708
That's over, Trini.

373
00:31:34,917 --> 00:31:38,000
One year, the spring won't return.

374
00:31:39,083 --> 00:31:43,417
April, that month of uncertain glory,
is slipping through our fingers.

375
00:31:44,833 --> 00:31:47,458
Uncertain or not, it's the only glory.

376
00:31:48,833 --> 00:31:51,500
What comes after will be nausea.

377
00:32:29,417 --> 00:32:30,417
Lieutenant!

378
00:32:30,458 --> 00:32:33,458
Come inside!
Don't stand there in the rain.

379
00:32:34,375 --> 00:32:35,792
Oh, there she is.

380
00:32:36,208 --> 00:32:39,083
We'd have offered you shelter
in our mill,

381
00:32:39,250 --> 00:32:41,167
but you saw what happened to it.

382
00:32:41,625 --> 00:32:42,750
It's bad luck.

383
00:32:42,917 --> 00:32:44,667
It's a catastrophe.

384
00:32:45,208 --> 00:32:48,458
Our daughter-in-law
died in childbirth.

385
00:32:49,083 --> 00:32:51,292
The war took away our sons.

386
00:32:52,583 --> 00:32:54,083
And now, with no mill,

387
00:32:54,875 --> 00:32:57,417
we're all going to starve.

388
00:32:57,708 --> 00:33:02,208
If you keep crying like that,
you'll flood the shack as well.

389
00:33:02,375 --> 00:33:03,875
Oh, dear Lord!

390
00:33:04,208 --> 00:33:08,375
Don't worry,
I'll go and see the<i> Carlana</i>

391
00:33:08,542 --> 00:33:10,833
and ask her to rent us her mill.

392
00:33:10,958 --> 00:33:13,667
She'll slam the door in your face.

393
00:33:14,167 --> 00:33:16,292
She lent me the<i> Carlán's</i> mare,

394
00:33:16,458 --> 00:33:18,333
to help our cause.

395
00:33:18,500 --> 00:33:21,333
Because you're a gentleman.

396
00:33:22,208 --> 00:33:24,958
And you are her neighbours.

397
00:33:25,542 --> 00:33:28,250
Ever since
she moved into that castle,

398
00:33:29,292 --> 00:33:31,917
she hasn't spoken
to us in the village.

399
00:33:32,083 --> 00:33:34,083
My wife's right.

400
00:33:35,042 --> 00:33:39,500
I'm ashamed to ask you this,
but...

401
00:33:39,958 --> 00:33:44,167
being as she seems to like you,

402
00:33:44,542 --> 00:33:46,708
maybe you could ask her for us.

403
00:33:47,208 --> 00:33:49,792
Well, she only lent me the horse.

404
00:33:49,958 --> 00:33:52,667
She never let anyone else ride it.

405
00:33:57,167 --> 00:33:58,500
All right.

406
00:33:59,083 --> 00:34:00,458
I'll talk to her.

407
00:34:06,708 --> 00:34:07,750
Bellota!

408
00:34:12,125 --> 00:34:14,875
Where were you?

409
00:34:19,458 --> 00:34:20,792
What are you doing?

410
00:34:22,625 --> 00:34:24,292
Go on, sit down.

411
00:34:24,708 --> 00:34:26,708
Leave your boots in the corner.

412
00:34:32,167 --> 00:34:34,792
Let me help, I'm used to this.

413
00:34:35,750 --> 00:34:36,917
Pull.

414
00:34:37,917 --> 00:34:40,500
I'm glad to see Bellota came back.

415
00:34:40,792 --> 00:34:42,042
I was worried.

416
00:34:42,292 --> 00:34:44,958
Don't worry so much,
you'll get wrinkles.

417
00:34:45,500 --> 00:34:46,958
Now pull!

418
00:34:54,083 --> 00:34:55,583
You told me to pull.

419
00:34:58,667 --> 00:34:59,667
Put these on.

420
00:35:00,708 --> 00:35:02,292
They were my husband's.

421
00:35:02,708 --> 00:35:04,583
So, what can I do for you?

422
00:35:04,833 --> 00:35:07,250
You're not only here for the horse.

423
00:35:07,417 --> 00:35:11,167
I wouldn't want
to abuse your kindness, but...

424
00:35:11,333 --> 00:35:14,583
the miller and his wife
would like to rent...

425
00:35:14,750 --> 00:35:16,958
- My mill?
- Yes.

426
00:35:17,125 --> 00:35:18,125
How did you know?

427
00:35:18,500 --> 00:35:22,500
I saw the river flood theirs.
I see everything from up here.

428
00:35:23,167 --> 00:35:25,458
They've been left with nothing...

429
00:35:25,625 --> 00:35:27,833
They can come and discuss terms
when they like.

430
00:35:27,958 --> 00:35:28,792
Thank you.

431
00:35:28,958 --> 00:35:30,375
I'll tell them.

432
00:35:31,083 --> 00:35:32,292
Sit down, please.

433
00:35:32,458 --> 00:35:34,083
Don't be shy.

434
00:35:35,958 --> 00:35:38,333
You like helping people, don't you?

435
00:35:38,542 --> 00:35:40,083
Yes, when I can.

436
00:35:41,917 --> 00:35:43,917
Could you help me?

437
00:35:44,917 --> 00:35:45,917
You?

438
00:35:47,333 --> 00:35:49,083
You said you were a lawyer.

439
00:35:49,833 --> 00:35:51,917
I studied to become a lawyer.

440
00:35:52,708 --> 00:35:55,125
I need help with a legal matter.

441
00:35:55,458 --> 00:35:56,958
I'll help, if I can.

442
00:35:58,333 --> 00:35:59,333
Tell me more.

443
00:35:59,625 --> 00:36:01,833
I'm sure you've heard by now

444
00:36:01,958 --> 00:36:04,958
that I was the<i> Carlán's</i> maid,
and he never married me.

445
00:36:08,583 --> 00:36:09,792
Yes, you've heard.

446
00:36:12,750 --> 00:36:15,417
What people don't know
is that my husband,

447
00:36:15,583 --> 00:36:18,250
suspecting the anarchists
would kill him,

448
00:36:18,417 --> 00:36:21,542
married me
so our children would be his heirs.

449
00:36:22,333 --> 00:36:23,958
We did it at the monastery.

450
00:36:24,417 --> 00:36:26,667
But the anarchists
destroyed everything,

451
00:36:26,833 --> 00:36:29,292
leaving no witnesses
of the marriage alive.

452
00:36:29,458 --> 00:36:30,542
Now nobody believes me.

453
00:36:31,417 --> 00:36:33,458
But you must have
a marriage certificate.

454
00:36:33,958 --> 00:36:34,958
No.

455
00:36:37,833 --> 00:36:39,958
Come and sit here.

456
00:36:50,375 --> 00:36:51,375
Give me your foot.

457
00:36:54,958 --> 00:36:58,333
The problem is
that without that certificate,

458
00:37:00,292 --> 00:37:01,667
my husband's family

459
00:37:02,917 --> 00:37:04,958
will claim this estate
when the war ends.

460
00:37:06,750 --> 00:37:09,917
And my sons and I
will be homeless.

461
00:37:11,458 --> 00:37:13,583
But that certificate must exist.

462
00:37:13,958 --> 00:37:15,625
It's in the monastery.

463
00:37:16,375 --> 00:37:19,708
But I wouldn't know
where to look for it.

464
00:37:20,708 --> 00:37:23,708
And the place
makes my skin crawl.

465
00:37:26,583 --> 00:37:28,625
Why don't you look for it?

466
00:39:38,333 --> 00:39:39,458
MARRIAGES

467
00:40:03,625 --> 00:40:04,792
Fuck Juli!

468
00:40:05,625 --> 00:40:07,542
You always appear unexpectedly!

469
00:40:07,708 --> 00:40:09,958
- Ditto.
- What are you doing here?

470
00:40:10,125 --> 00:40:12,208
This is my favourite place.

471
00:40:12,792 --> 00:40:15,958
Silent corpses,
the stench of betrayal...

472
00:40:16,667 --> 00:40:18,625
It's grotesque and macabre.

473
00:40:18,792 --> 00:40:20,083
As if it were my home.

474
00:40:20,250 --> 00:40:23,917
Juli, I'm not in the mood
for an absurd speech.

475
00:40:24,083 --> 00:40:27,083
All that riding
seems to have upset you.

476
00:40:27,333 --> 00:40:28,167
What did you say?

477
00:40:28,333 --> 00:40:30,083
Isn't that the<i> Carlana's</i> mare?

478
00:40:30,250 --> 00:40:32,375
She loaned it to the regiment.

479
00:40:32,542 --> 00:40:34,333
Stop being modest.

480
00:40:34,500 --> 00:40:36,542
You got it.
I was left frustrated.

481
00:40:36,708 --> 00:40:37,875
What?

482
00:40:38,042 --> 00:40:40,333
She never let me ride her.

483
00:40:40,500 --> 00:40:43,458
- What are you insinuating?
- Nothing, except...

484
00:40:43,625 --> 00:40:46,500
I imagine you have
returned the favour.

485
00:40:48,417 --> 00:40:50,792
Don't get caught in her web, Lluís.

486
00:40:50,958 --> 00:40:52,625
Why should I listen to you?

487
00:40:53,417 --> 00:40:55,958
I'm your best friend, remember?

488
00:40:58,208 --> 00:41:01,583
Trust me, and look after
those who really need you.

489
00:41:08,542 --> 00:41:09,542
It's an air raid!

490
00:41:10,250 --> 00:41:11,958
Everybody out!

491
00:41:12,958 --> 00:41:15,958
- Give me a loaf.
- Outside, Trini. Hurry.

492
00:41:16,167 --> 00:41:18,375
You have a child to protect.

493
00:41:18,875 --> 00:41:20,417
Outside!

494
00:41:38,667 --> 00:41:40,417
Help me!

495
00:41:49,708 --> 00:41:52,208
Hurry, come inside!

496
00:42:18,833 --> 00:42:21,833
If it's impossible
to find that document,

497
00:42:23,042 --> 00:42:24,375
why not make a new one?

498
00:42:24,958 --> 00:42:25,958
What do you mean?

499
00:42:26,083 --> 00:42:27,542
You know the law.

500
00:42:27,708 --> 00:42:30,500
You could get a judge
to write something...

501
00:42:30,667 --> 00:42:33,500
Are you asking me
to forge a document?

502
00:42:33,667 --> 00:42:36,000
I'm asking you to help us.

503
00:42:38,208 --> 00:42:39,500
I'm sorry.

504
00:42:39,958 --> 00:42:42,792
I understand your situation,

505
00:42:42,958 --> 00:42:46,250
but what you're asking
is against the law.

506
00:42:46,417 --> 00:42:49,542
Don't tell me about the law.
It's never helped me.

507
00:42:49,958 --> 00:42:52,792
That's why I'm asking you
to help me get justice.

508
00:42:54,042 --> 00:42:55,042
Look,

509
00:42:56,292 --> 00:42:58,625
I was born poor,
I know how that is.

510
00:42:59,167 --> 00:43:01,750
I'm Cagorcio's daughter.
You must've heard.

511
00:43:02,125 --> 00:43:06,292
I watched as they daubed shit on
this castle and called me a whore.

512
00:43:06,958 --> 00:43:08,667
I can take all that,

513
00:43:09,708 --> 00:43:13,500
but I won't see my two boys
pay for this senseless war.

514
00:43:19,292 --> 00:43:21,958
If I could find a witness,

515
00:43:22,167 --> 00:43:23,583
I could make them testify.

516
00:43:23,750 --> 00:43:25,583
I told you, they're all dead.

517
00:43:51,833 --> 00:43:54,833
Don't come back,
unless you can help.

518
00:44:46,917 --> 00:44:47,958
Good morning.

519
00:44:48,667 --> 00:44:49,833
Look who it is!

520
00:44:49,958 --> 00:44:51,958
Welcome, Master Lluís.

521
00:44:52,542 --> 00:44:53,958
Come and see.

522
00:44:54,125 --> 00:44:57,417
Try one of the loaves,
they're still warm.

523
00:44:57,583 --> 00:45:00,208
You lot keep working.

524
00:45:01,417 --> 00:45:02,542
What did I tell you?

525
00:45:03,208 --> 00:45:06,708
I told you she'd make us pay
for the favour.

526
00:45:06,917 --> 00:45:10,542
Be quiet,
and let the lieutenant explain.

527
00:45:10,708 --> 00:45:14,208
You just need to swear
that you witnessed the wedding.

528
00:45:14,667 --> 00:45:18,250
I'm sure that if you do,
you'll be rewarded.

529
00:45:18,792 --> 00:45:22,500
Do you think
she might lower the rent?

530
00:45:22,792 --> 00:45:25,042
She might even give you the mill.

531
00:45:25,375 --> 00:45:27,208
- Really?
- Yes.

532
00:45:27,542 --> 00:45:30,750
What you're asking us to do...
Is it legal?

533
00:45:31,708 --> 00:45:34,958
Is it legal to kill someone?
And yet it happens every day.

534
00:45:35,292 --> 00:45:38,167
- Because we're at war.
- Exactly.

535
00:45:38,333 --> 00:45:41,375
If they hadn't murdered the friars...

536
00:45:41,542 --> 00:45:43,708
Hold on a minute.

537
00:45:43,875 --> 00:45:46,708
What you're asking us to do...

538
00:45:47,167 --> 00:45:49,792
Could we get into trouble for it?

539
00:45:49,958 --> 00:45:52,250
The<i> Carlana</i> and I won't tell a soul.

540
00:45:52,417 --> 00:45:55,083
Why are you doing all this?

541
00:45:55,583 --> 00:45:58,625
Those boys could end up
on the streets.

542
00:45:58,792 --> 00:46:01,292
- Where they belong.
- Shut up!

543
00:46:01,458 --> 00:46:03,542
Don't you see he's right?

544
00:46:03,708 --> 00:46:07,667
Children shouldn't have to pay
for their parents' sins.

545
00:46:07,833 --> 00:46:08,917
That's right.

546
00:46:10,625 --> 00:46:12,958
You're doing the right thing.

547
00:46:14,833 --> 00:46:16,458
What the hell.

548
00:46:18,625 --> 00:46:19,833
Sign here.

549
00:46:22,250 --> 00:46:23,250
Put a cross.

550
00:46:30,250 --> 00:46:32,250
You too, come on.

551
00:46:36,208 --> 00:46:38,417
We'll all go to hell.

552
00:46:48,458 --> 00:46:50,458
María, take the boys outside.

553
00:47:09,167 --> 00:47:10,792
Is this what I think it is?

554
00:47:14,250 --> 00:47:15,667
I'm eternally grateful.

555
00:47:16,458 --> 00:47:18,208
I don't want gratitude.

556
00:47:20,958 --> 00:47:21,958
What do you want?

557
00:47:23,042 --> 00:47:24,375
You know.

558
00:47:27,958 --> 00:47:30,833
I think the situation
has affected us all.

559
00:47:32,583 --> 00:47:34,417
You can't be serious.

560
00:47:34,583 --> 00:47:36,750
I've never been more serious.

561
00:47:36,917 --> 00:47:37,958
You don't know me.

562
00:47:38,125 --> 00:47:40,042
Nobody's ever really loved you.

563
00:47:40,208 --> 00:47:41,500
But I'm ready to.

564
00:47:41,958 --> 00:47:43,125
Don't you see?

565
00:47:43,292 --> 00:47:46,542
I'm getting old,
and you're just starting to live.

566
00:47:46,708 --> 00:47:47,708
I don't care.

567
00:47:47,750 --> 00:47:48,917
But I do.

568
00:47:49,667 --> 00:47:51,417
You won't let yourself be loved.

569
00:47:53,792 --> 00:47:55,292
Why not?

570
00:48:16,917 --> 00:48:20,583
Don't tell me you did all this
just to have me as a reward.

571
00:48:24,667 --> 00:48:26,292
You're a good man.

572
00:48:27,958 --> 00:48:29,125
I wish you well.

573
00:48:30,333 --> 00:48:33,667
Perhaps one day, I'll be able
to help you or your son,

574
00:48:33,833 --> 00:48:35,167
like you helped mine.

575
00:48:35,333 --> 00:48:36,583
How do you know I have a son?

576
00:48:36,750 --> 00:48:40,792
I know you have a son with a woman,
but you're not married.

577
00:48:41,167 --> 00:48:43,333
I know you're a man of your word,

578
00:48:43,500 --> 00:48:47,042
weak, innocent
and high-minded.

579
00:48:48,292 --> 00:48:51,125
Although apparently
not as moral as I thought.

580
00:48:51,833 --> 00:48:55,083
Now go back to the village
and forget this ever happened.

581
00:48:55,250 --> 00:48:58,375
And marry that woman.
For the sake of your son.

582
00:48:58,542 --> 00:49:02,208
I didn't marry, on principle.
But I recognised my son.

583
00:49:02,375 --> 00:49:03,125
Look at me!

584
00:49:03,292 --> 00:49:06,208
Not like that sod
who turned his back on you.

585
00:49:06,708 --> 00:49:10,375
And thanks to you,
that sod is now my husband.

586
00:49:11,750 --> 00:49:15,125
You should show me some respect.
Now I really am the<i> Carlana.</i>

587
00:49:16,625 --> 00:49:17,625
Get out.

588
00:49:50,458 --> 00:49:52,042
Welcome, everyone.

589
00:49:52,292 --> 00:49:55,375
We thought we wouldn't
be able to celebrate this year,

590
00:49:56,042 --> 00:50:00,042
but thanks to the generosity
of the Lady of the Manor,

591
00:50:00,208 --> 00:50:04,208
we can honour our patron saint
the Virgin of Olivel.

592
00:50:06,042 --> 00:50:10,375
The war has brought hunger,
fear and hate,

593
00:50:10,792 --> 00:50:13,083
but it will never
destroy our faith

594
00:50:13,250 --> 00:50:15,667
in the Holy Virgin of our village.

595
00:50:28,292 --> 00:50:30,542
Who'd have thought it, eh, Picó?

596
00:50:30,708 --> 00:50:34,542
I know, Doc, but now everyone
thinks they were married.

597
00:50:34,708 --> 00:50:38,333
This shift in collective memory
is suspicious.

598
00:50:38,500 --> 00:50:40,875
It might start an epidemic.

599
00:50:41,042 --> 00:50:42,958
They're not stupid.

600
00:50:43,167 --> 00:50:45,125
They know
when to drop their trousers.

601
00:50:45,292 --> 00:50:47,583
I hope no one screws them.

602
00:50:48,708 --> 00:50:52,042
Lluís said
right from the beginning

603
00:50:52,208 --> 00:50:56,125
that the<i> Carlana</i> was a real lady.

604
00:50:56,292 --> 00:50:57,750
What do you say now?

605
00:50:57,917 --> 00:50:59,042
Right, Lluís?

606
00:51:00,125 --> 00:51:03,458
Does our lieutenant
have inside information?

607
00:51:04,708 --> 00:51:06,708
Gentlemen, excuse me.

608
00:51:07,417 --> 00:51:10,708
Anyone would think
he had a broom up his arse.

609
00:51:26,375 --> 00:51:29,167
She's pleased with
the favour you did her.

610
00:51:29,333 --> 00:51:30,333
What favour?

611
00:51:30,417 --> 00:51:33,542
You got her a certificate
that makes her a noble!

612
00:51:33,708 --> 00:51:36,375
- What makes you think that?
- She asked me too.

613
00:51:37,083 --> 00:51:38,625
I was tempted, I must admit.

614
00:51:38,792 --> 00:51:40,542
She's very persuasive.

615
00:51:40,708 --> 00:51:43,875
But if I wanted to buy sex,
I'd go to a whore.

616
00:51:44,042 --> 00:51:48,083
I never imagined you, of all people,
caught in her web.

617
00:51:48,250 --> 00:51:50,833
I thought you had strict morals.

618
00:51:50,958 --> 00:51:53,458
- You can talk!
- Yes, I can.

619
00:51:53,625 --> 00:51:56,667
While you were riding
horses and landed ladies,

620
00:51:56,833 --> 00:51:59,833
I was taking food
to Trini and Ramonet.

621
00:51:59,958 --> 00:52:01,500
You never miss a chance.

622
00:52:01,667 --> 00:52:05,208
I didn't tell her.
I love her too much to hurt her.

623
00:52:05,375 --> 00:52:06,708
That's so romantic.

624
00:52:06,875 --> 00:52:10,417
- Write to her and invite her here.
- I don't take orders from you.

625
00:52:10,583 --> 00:52:12,333
Invite her, or I will.

626
00:52:14,625 --> 00:52:16,583
- What for?
- You know what for.

627
00:52:16,750 --> 00:52:18,958
Picó's inviting
the wives for Christmas.

628
00:52:19,125 --> 00:52:22,417
- We're not married.
- Then ask her to marry you, Lluís.

629
00:52:23,875 --> 00:52:27,000
OK. But when they get here,
you have to disappear.

630
00:52:46,583 --> 00:52:48,167
Open the front door.

631
00:52:48,792 --> 00:52:50,375
We have a visitor.

632
00:53:05,833 --> 00:53:07,083
Olivella?

633
00:53:10,875 --> 00:53:12,042
Come in, Father.

634
00:53:12,542 --> 00:53:13,958
It's good to see you.

635
00:53:15,208 --> 00:53:16,208
Not for me.

636
00:53:16,375 --> 00:53:19,333
The<i> Carlán</i> treated you
like a whore,

637
00:53:19,500 --> 00:53:22,833
but you've managed
to live like a lady.

638
00:53:22,958 --> 00:53:24,125
What do you want?

639
00:53:26,417 --> 00:53:28,750
Your good news
has reached the front.

640
00:53:31,958 --> 00:53:33,083
My girl,

641
00:53:34,250 --> 00:53:38,292
give me two thousand
and I'll never say a word.

642
00:53:39,583 --> 00:53:41,958
Sundown.
I'll bring it to the sheep hut.

643
00:53:42,708 --> 00:53:45,292
You're making this easy,<i> Carlana.</i>

644
00:53:45,458 --> 00:53:47,375
Would you prefer it complicated?

645
00:53:54,083 --> 00:53:55,083
Fucking hell!

646
00:53:55,458 --> 00:53:56,708
- I never...
- Now go.

647
00:54:06,083 --> 00:54:07,792
Don't let the villagers see you.

648
00:54:20,042 --> 00:54:21,792
Fermín, do we have petrol?

649
00:54:21,958 --> 00:54:24,167
Yes, one of those large cans.

650
00:54:24,333 --> 00:54:26,458
Take the cover off the car.

651
00:54:30,167 --> 00:54:31,167
Bandido.

652
00:54:31,500 --> 00:54:32,750
Bandido.

653
00:55:44,667 --> 00:55:47,958
Still bad-tempered.
Just like your dead mother.

654
00:55:48,125 --> 00:55:51,708
If you hadn't beaten her to death,
I might've known her.

655
00:55:51,875 --> 00:55:55,125
We're not here to argue.
Give me the money.

656
00:55:55,292 --> 00:55:56,542
You've got your castle now.

657
00:55:56,708 --> 00:55:59,542
Yes, but I'm still
Cagorcio's daughter.

658
00:56:00,375 --> 00:56:01,875
What are you saying?

659
00:56:02,042 --> 00:56:05,417
Even though I own all this,
I'm still the daughter of a pig.

660
00:56:06,167 --> 00:56:10,125
I won't let you shame me.
You're Cagorcio's girl!

661
00:56:10,292 --> 00:56:12,625
You never had any shame, Father.

662
00:56:12,792 --> 00:56:14,833
Or you wouldn't have
done those things.

663
00:56:14,958 --> 00:56:19,417
You fucked his lordship
and bore him two bastards.

664
00:56:19,750 --> 00:56:21,375
Remember this trough, Father?

665
00:56:22,208 --> 00:56:27,667
This is where my girl washed
her cunt like a dirty whore.

666
00:56:29,375 --> 00:56:30,375
Get off me!

667
00:57:04,750 --> 00:57:06,083
Do it.

668
00:58:24,792 --> 00:58:27,542
Look, there's Daddy!

669
00:58:42,333 --> 00:58:43,417
Lluís.

670
00:58:43,667 --> 00:58:44,708
Lluís.

671
00:58:49,875 --> 00:58:51,958
I thought
I'd never hold you again.

672
00:58:55,792 --> 00:58:58,125
I'm sorry I didn't write more.

673
00:58:58,333 --> 00:58:59,958
But you wrote that last letter.

674
00:59:00,167 --> 00:59:02,125
Look how much he's grown.

675
00:59:07,292 --> 00:59:08,375
Well?

676
00:59:08,875 --> 00:59:11,958
- Don't you like me anymore?
- Ramonet, give Daddy a kiss.

677
00:59:17,875 --> 00:59:19,375
You're so big!

678
00:59:20,583 --> 00:59:22,208
I've missed you so much.

679
00:59:35,167 --> 00:59:36,667
He's asleep.

680
00:59:37,917 --> 00:59:40,708
I'm surprised Juli hasn't come.

681
00:59:40,875 --> 00:59:42,875
Nothing Juli does surprises me now.

682
00:59:43,333 --> 00:59:44,750
We can see him tomorrow.

683
00:59:44,917 --> 00:59:46,792
Forget about Juli.

684
01:01:01,542 --> 01:01:02,875
Sorry.

685
01:01:10,500 --> 01:01:11,917
Don't worry.

686
01:01:14,458 --> 01:01:18,042
A year without a woman
is too long.

687
01:03:22,250 --> 01:03:24,958
- Tell her how beautiful she is.
- She's beautiful.

688
01:03:25,125 --> 01:03:27,875
So beautiful, right?

689
01:03:29,708 --> 01:03:32,792
That's it, get up there.

690
01:03:32,958 --> 01:03:34,042
Good.

691
01:03:34,208 --> 01:03:35,875
Give her a stroke.

692
01:03:37,042 --> 01:03:39,625
Now like a soldier.
Chest out.

693
01:03:39,792 --> 01:03:42,042
And give a salute, like this.

694
01:03:42,208 --> 01:03:44,125
Now you can gallop.

695
01:03:51,208 --> 01:03:53,375
Sit down, dear.
I'll fetch your husband.

696
01:03:53,542 --> 01:03:55,875
It's fine. I'll do it.

697
01:03:56,667 --> 01:03:57,792
Good morning!

698
01:03:58,333 --> 01:03:59,875
Mummy, look at me.

699
01:04:00,042 --> 01:04:01,542
Come and try this.

700
01:04:01,708 --> 01:04:02,958
Breakfast!

701
01:04:03,583 --> 01:04:05,542
- Go and see.
- Run, like a solider!

702
01:04:06,792 --> 01:04:08,542
A breakfast fit for a king.

703
01:04:20,542 --> 01:04:21,875
There you go!

704
01:04:23,750 --> 01:04:25,292
Why are you all dressed up?

705
01:04:25,792 --> 01:04:28,167
There's a funeral
for the<i> Carlana's</i> father.

706
01:04:29,125 --> 01:04:30,125
He's dead?

707
01:04:30,292 --> 01:04:31,625
Yes.

708
01:04:32,042 --> 01:04:34,083
A terrible accident.

709
01:04:34,375 --> 01:04:35,375
At the front?

710
01:04:35,417 --> 01:04:36,417
No!

711
01:04:36,458 --> 01:04:40,125
He was on leave and his hut
burnt down with him inside.

712
01:04:41,542 --> 01:04:43,458
Don't let your milk get cold.

713
01:05:19,417 --> 01:05:20,500
- Hello.
- Good morning.

714
01:05:38,625 --> 01:05:40,917
Mummy, look,
it's uncle Juli milk.

715
01:05:41,083 --> 01:05:42,667
Put that back.

716
01:05:43,792 --> 01:05:45,292
What are you doing here?

717
01:05:45,792 --> 01:05:48,125
- Looking for Juli.
- Me too.

718
01:05:48,292 --> 01:05:49,583
He's meant to be on duty.

719
01:05:49,750 --> 01:05:51,792
This soldier
had to stand in for him.

720
01:05:51,958 --> 01:05:54,125
He's not here.
Tell the captain.

721
01:05:54,292 --> 01:05:56,625
- He already knows.
- Tell him again!

722
01:05:57,208 --> 01:05:59,500
Does he often disappear like this?

723
01:05:59,667 --> 01:06:02,333
No. You know Juli,
he gets restless.

724
01:06:02,500 --> 01:06:04,333
But I told him we were coming.

725
01:06:04,500 --> 01:06:06,042
Seems he doesn't care.

726
01:06:06,208 --> 01:06:09,125
Lluís, did he steal
that food he brought us?

727
01:06:09,292 --> 01:06:12,625
Of course.
He has no respect for anything.

728
01:06:12,792 --> 01:06:16,250
If it wasn't for him...
Where do you think he is?

729
01:06:16,417 --> 01:06:17,542
I don't care.

730
01:06:18,250 --> 01:06:20,292
You don't care
if he's dead or alive?

731
01:06:20,458 --> 01:06:21,667
No, I don't.

732
01:06:22,042 --> 01:06:24,125
And neither should you.

733
01:06:47,958 --> 01:06:49,208
Who's that?

734
01:06:49,875 --> 01:06:50,958
The<i> Carlana.</i>

735
01:06:51,167 --> 01:06:52,958
The Lady of the Manor.

736
01:06:53,125 --> 01:06:54,625
Go inside the chapel.

737
01:07:08,375 --> 01:07:10,542
- My condolences.
- Thank you.

738
01:07:10,708 --> 01:07:13,458
It's nice to see you
with your family.

739
01:07:13,625 --> 01:07:15,458
My wife and my son.

740
01:07:15,833 --> 01:07:17,625
Hello. My name's Trini.

741
01:07:19,292 --> 01:07:20,792
I'm Olivella.

742
01:07:20,958 --> 01:07:23,042
And this is our son Ramonet.

743
01:07:24,958 --> 01:07:26,333
What a beautiful boy.

744
01:07:27,125 --> 01:07:28,792
You have lovely hair.

745
01:07:28,958 --> 01:07:30,542
Thank you, ma'am.

746
01:07:34,958 --> 01:07:37,083
I can't keep them waiting.

747
01:07:37,250 --> 01:07:40,417
Nice to meet you.
Let's get this over with.

748
01:07:42,792 --> 01:07:45,875
Such an elegant woman.
Don't you think, Lluís?

749
01:07:48,750 --> 01:07:51,250
And such sadness in her eyes.

750
01:09:00,667 --> 01:09:03,167
María, put my mourning clothes away

751
01:09:03,333 --> 01:09:05,875
- and starch my coloured suits.
- Yes, ma'am.

752
01:09:06,042 --> 01:09:08,125
And send in Fermín. Hurry.

753
01:09:19,583 --> 01:09:20,583
Olivella.

754
01:09:27,958 --> 01:09:30,292
Take this
to the mayor of Olivel.

755
01:09:30,458 --> 01:09:32,208
It's a safe-conduct
for Christmas Eve.

756
01:09:32,375 --> 01:09:35,167
How do I get to the other side?

757
01:09:35,750 --> 01:09:39,583
Tell the soldiers
you have a message for the mayor.

758
01:09:39,750 --> 01:09:42,375
They'll recognise my car.

759
01:09:59,667 --> 01:10:01,542
Do you mind if I pray with you?

760
01:10:01,708 --> 01:10:05,208
Of course not.
We can keep each other company.

761
01:10:43,208 --> 01:10:47,250
All the women here feel
those daggers in their hearts.

762
01:10:47,417 --> 01:10:49,500
Women here and women everywhere.

763
01:10:49,667 --> 01:10:51,042
It's no kind of life.

764
01:10:58,750 --> 01:11:00,042
Praying for your nephew?

765
01:11:01,375 --> 01:11:04,542
Every day, I pray
for the Virgin to protect him.

766
01:11:05,333 --> 01:11:07,875
Who are you praying for?

767
01:11:08,792 --> 01:11:10,708
For someone I love very much.

768
01:11:10,875 --> 01:11:12,458
Did he give you that stone?

769
01:11:12,625 --> 01:11:16,792
It's not a stone, it's a jewel.

770
01:11:19,042 --> 01:11:21,292
From Master Lluís?

771
01:11:25,167 --> 01:11:27,583
Let's have a little drink.

772
01:11:30,208 --> 01:11:31,750
We all pray to that virgin.

773
01:11:31,917 --> 01:11:34,875
Patron saint of marital
and family strife.

774
01:11:35,042 --> 01:11:36,042
Have a seat.

775
01:11:36,375 --> 01:11:38,667
The real one
is in the<i> Carlana's</i> castle,

776
01:11:38,833 --> 01:11:40,750
but she keeps it locked away.

777
01:11:41,333 --> 01:11:43,250
People don't seem to like her.

778
01:11:43,417 --> 01:11:45,250
She doesn't get on with anyone.

779
01:11:45,417 --> 01:11:47,625
She was very polite
with my husband.

780
01:11:47,792 --> 01:11:50,792
Because Master Lluís
looks after her horse.

781
01:11:52,917 --> 01:11:53,917
The horse is hers?

782
01:11:54,083 --> 01:11:56,542
Of course,
like everything around here.

783
01:11:56,708 --> 01:11:58,375
Why did she give it to my husband?

784
01:11:58,542 --> 01:12:02,292
I don't know.
You'll have to ask him.

785
01:12:15,375 --> 01:12:16,375
At ease!

786
01:12:18,625 --> 01:12:19,333
At ease.

787
01:12:19,500 --> 01:12:21,500
And lose this queer scarf!

788
01:12:21,667 --> 01:12:23,417
Honour your uniform.

789
01:12:23,583 --> 01:12:25,708
Our blood will build
a new fatherland.

790
01:12:26,042 --> 01:12:27,208
Yes, sir!

791
01:12:28,833 --> 01:12:30,958
- You see all that snow?
- Yes.

792
01:12:31,125 --> 01:12:33,125
Look.
Where are they going?

793
01:12:33,333 --> 01:12:34,167
I don't know.

794
01:12:34,333 --> 01:12:35,958
To Africa, because they're cold.

795
01:12:36,167 --> 01:12:37,417
Is it cold?

796
01:12:37,583 --> 01:12:39,792
So cold it burns.

797
01:12:40,208 --> 01:12:42,458
Shut that
before we catch pneumonia.

798
01:12:42,625 --> 01:12:45,042
Come on,
or Mum will tell us off.

799
01:12:45,458 --> 01:12:46,750
Good lad!

800
01:12:48,875 --> 01:12:50,208
Just like a soldier.

801
01:12:50,375 --> 01:12:51,583
I need a poo.

802
01:12:52,167 --> 01:12:54,917
Go on then.
You're a big boy now.

803
01:12:58,292 --> 01:13:00,583
You suddenly seem much older.

804
01:13:02,792 --> 01:13:05,542
I'm so happy
to have you both here.

805
01:13:07,458 --> 01:13:09,917
- Guess what he wants for Christmas.
- What?

806
01:13:10,083 --> 01:13:12,083
A horse, like yours.

807
01:13:12,250 --> 01:13:14,083
We'll buy him three.

808
01:13:14,250 --> 01:13:17,292
Yeah, right!
We can't even afford a toy one.

809
01:13:17,792 --> 01:13:19,167
I know how to get one.

810
01:13:23,833 --> 01:13:27,292
By the way, how did you get
such a nice horse?

811
01:13:28,792 --> 01:13:30,333
Picó gave it to me.

812
01:13:30,500 --> 01:13:33,167
The last one in the regiment.

813
01:13:33,333 --> 01:13:35,083
You were lucky to get it.

814
01:13:36,750 --> 01:13:38,083
Yes, very lucky.

815
01:13:38,250 --> 01:13:40,917
- Mummy, I've finished.
- I'll go.

816
01:15:06,125 --> 01:15:07,208
Merry Christmas.

817
01:15:07,833 --> 01:15:09,667
Come in!

818
01:16:00,958 --> 01:16:02,542
I propose a toast.

819
01:16:02,708 --> 01:16:04,750
Here's to our wives,

820
01:16:04,917 --> 01:16:09,083
who, thanks to the Captain,
are with us for this special night.

821
01:16:09,250 --> 01:16:11,083
Yes. To our wives!

822
01:16:11,958 --> 01:16:15,708
I don't know how we've survived
without them.

823
01:16:15,875 --> 01:16:18,958
But don't think
the women here have forgotten us.

824
01:16:19,333 --> 01:16:24,625
Cigars from the Lady of the Manor.
For the officers.

825
01:16:25,583 --> 01:16:27,958
And this is especially for you.

826
01:16:28,167 --> 01:16:30,417
I don't know what it is.

827
01:16:31,042 --> 01:16:33,042
A sack of spuds.

828
01:16:34,583 --> 01:16:36,583
What nice boots.

829
01:16:36,958 --> 01:16:40,458
First the horse,
and now the boots.

830
01:16:40,625 --> 01:16:44,583
She must think our lieutenant
has delicate feet.

831
01:16:44,958 --> 01:16:48,750
And I have a gift for you.

832
01:16:48,917 --> 01:16:51,042
Doctor! Is it a book?

833
01:16:51,208 --> 01:16:54,375
The guy is
cuckolded by the third page!

834
01:16:55,375 --> 01:16:56,875
""The Horns of Roland.""

835
01:16:57,042 --> 01:17:01,125
No long descriptions of scenery,
just women who are always ready.

836
01:17:01,292 --> 01:17:02,958
Who did you get this from?

837
01:17:03,167 --> 01:17:06,333
- Who do you think? Soleràs.
- That bastard?

838
01:17:06,500 --> 01:17:09,708
He might be a bastard,
but he's still funny.

839
01:17:09,875 --> 01:17:11,458
Yes, he is.

840
01:17:11,625 --> 01:17:15,625
An officer deserting
in the middle of the night.

841
01:17:15,792 --> 01:17:17,833
Do you think your friend is funny?

842
01:17:18,542 --> 01:17:19,708
He's not my friend.

843
01:17:20,083 --> 01:17:22,625
I'm glad you've finally realised.

844
01:17:22,792 --> 01:17:24,375
He's a coward.

845
01:17:24,542 --> 01:17:27,042
He should be court-martialled.

846
01:17:27,208 --> 01:17:29,542
But I can't deny he was clever.

847
01:17:29,708 --> 01:17:34,208
I remember the day that
English politician came up here

848
01:17:34,375 --> 01:17:38,083
and started criticizing everything...

849
01:17:38,250 --> 01:17:41,208
- What's the matter?
- I've got a sore throat.

850
01:17:44,250 --> 01:17:45,917
Is something wrong?

851
01:17:46,458 --> 01:17:48,625
I think the boy has a chill.

852
01:17:50,500 --> 01:17:54,208
- You're not taking him home.
- No? Then you take him!

853
01:17:55,958 --> 01:17:57,583
Sorry, I don't feel well.

854
01:17:57,750 --> 01:17:59,042
What have you done now?

855
01:18:00,417 --> 01:18:01,833
Go easy on her.

856
01:18:03,208 --> 01:18:04,042
What's got into you?

857
01:18:04,208 --> 01:18:07,292
They're all talking about Juli.
He could be dead!

858
01:18:07,458 --> 01:18:08,958
That's enough!

859
01:18:09,750 --> 01:18:12,500
He's alive.
And doing as he pleases.

860
01:18:12,667 --> 01:18:14,292
- You've seen him?
- Yes.

861
01:18:14,708 --> 01:18:16,458
- Where?
- On the other side.

862
01:18:16,625 --> 01:18:17,625
Prisoner?

863
01:18:19,083 --> 01:18:20,083
No.

864
01:18:20,250 --> 01:18:23,792
In a Fascist uniform
and aiming at us, Trini.

865
01:18:23,958 --> 01:18:26,167
That irresponsible liar
is now a traitor.

866
01:18:26,333 --> 01:18:28,250
I don't believe you.

867
01:18:28,417 --> 01:18:30,333
It's the truth about your friend.

868
01:18:30,500 --> 01:18:33,542
Why should I believe you,
when you've lied to me?

869
01:18:33,708 --> 01:18:35,292
- You know all about lying.
- What?

870
01:18:35,458 --> 01:18:36,625
You've betrayed me.

871
01:18:36,792 --> 01:18:39,125
It's the<i> Carlana's</i> horse.
You're her lover.

872
01:18:39,292 --> 01:18:41,875
- What?
- The whole village knows!

873
01:18:42,042 --> 01:18:43,208
It's so humiliating.

874
01:18:43,375 --> 01:18:45,917
Don't touch me!
Never touch me again!

875
01:18:46,083 --> 01:18:46,750
Trini.

876
01:18:46,917 --> 01:18:50,250
I knew you couldn't love me
like I loved you,

877
01:18:50,417 --> 01:18:53,958
but I never thought
you'd become a fraud and a cynic.

878
01:18:54,125 --> 01:18:56,500
Nothing happened.
She rejected me.

879
01:18:56,667 --> 01:18:58,458
So you couldn't even enjoy it?

880
01:18:58,625 --> 01:19:00,417
That's not what I meant.

881
01:19:00,583 --> 01:19:02,542
Please, let me fix this.

882
01:19:03,500 --> 01:19:06,083
Let's get married
and forget all this.

883
01:19:06,750 --> 01:19:08,083
You're asking me now?

884
01:19:08,750 --> 01:19:10,750
Just to clear your conscience?

885
01:19:10,917 --> 01:19:14,500
No, I want to start over.
Like a real family, Trini.

886
01:19:14,667 --> 01:19:18,292
You're Ramonet's father,
and you always will be,

887
01:19:18,458 --> 01:19:20,958
but don't expect us to be a family.

888
01:19:21,333 --> 01:19:23,708
- Trini, I know...
- You don't know anything!

889
01:19:23,875 --> 01:19:25,292
You know what hurts most?

890
01:19:25,458 --> 01:19:27,667
How you've treated your friend.

891
01:19:27,833 --> 01:19:30,417
The only person who really loved me,

892
01:19:30,583 --> 01:19:35,500
the only one who wanted to know me
and who cared about what I needed.

893
01:19:36,042 --> 01:19:38,583
Go and have fun
with that bunch of drunks.

894
01:19:38,750 --> 01:19:40,833
Ramonet and I won't bother you.

895
01:19:40,958 --> 01:19:43,167
I'm taking him
back to Barcelona tomorrow.

896
01:20:00,708 --> 01:20:01,958
Dear Lord,

897
01:20:02,250 --> 01:20:05,917
thank you for allowing us
to celebrate another Christmas

898
01:20:06,917 --> 01:20:09,292
and for protecting us
from so much death.

899
01:20:10,083 --> 01:20:11,750
And thank you

900
01:20:11,917 --> 01:20:14,958
for allowing us friendships
and alliances

901
01:20:15,125 --> 01:20:17,667
in the middle of this cruel war.

902
01:20:17,833 --> 01:20:21,458
And we ask you to protect
these children, who are our future.

903
01:20:21,833 --> 01:20:22,833
Amen.

904
01:20:28,292 --> 01:20:30,125
I hope you like the dinner.

905
01:20:30,292 --> 01:20:33,250
Fascist crockery
and a Republican menu.

906
01:20:33,417 --> 01:20:35,167
Very appropriate, My Lady.

907
01:20:35,625 --> 01:20:39,625
I'm glad you could be with us
on such a special night.

908
01:20:40,417 --> 01:20:43,208
It's a sad time for me,
as a widow.

909
01:20:43,375 --> 01:20:46,250
And trapped inside enemy territory.

910
01:20:46,417 --> 01:20:50,083
We must stick together in hard times.
Right, Federico?

911
01:20:50,250 --> 01:20:51,250
But of course.

912
01:20:51,625 --> 01:20:54,625
Despite all we have suffered,
our strength

913
01:20:54,792 --> 01:20:57,833
- will bring us victory.
- God willing, Mr Mayor.

914
01:20:57,958 --> 01:21:00,125
He's on our side too.

915
01:21:00,292 --> 01:21:02,708
And that's good enough for me.

916
01:21:02,875 --> 01:21:06,667
I hope order is restored soon
so our villages can be reunited.

917
01:21:06,833 --> 01:21:10,458
We can't divide that which
was united by God and nature.

918
01:21:10,875 --> 01:21:12,958
I couldn't agree more.

919
01:21:13,333 --> 01:21:14,958
When this awful war is over,

920
01:21:15,167 --> 01:21:17,958
I'll do all I can
to share my wealth.

921
01:21:18,500 --> 01:21:20,583
My lands are on both sides,

922
01:21:20,750 --> 01:21:22,917
and although there's a river
in between,

923
01:21:23,083 --> 01:21:26,833
there is no need
to turn our backs on each other.

924
01:21:30,417 --> 01:21:33,500
Here's to a bright future, My Lady.

925
01:22:18,125 --> 01:22:19,333
Juli!

926
01:22:22,417 --> 01:22:24,042
I missed you so much.

927
01:22:24,208 --> 01:22:25,250
Get on.

928
01:22:49,333 --> 01:22:50,333
Get off.

929
01:23:02,792 --> 01:23:04,125
What's this?

930
01:23:04,583 --> 01:23:05,583
I don't understand.

931
01:23:06,042 --> 01:23:07,417
Don't judge me.

932
01:23:07,583 --> 01:23:10,667
Right now, I can't judge you.
But why?

933
01:23:11,958 --> 01:23:14,250
I thought I was already dead,

934
01:23:14,875 --> 01:23:17,458
but I wasn't brave enough to die.

935
01:23:18,417 --> 01:23:19,500
I feel I failed you.

936
01:23:19,667 --> 01:23:21,625
You've never failed me.

937
01:23:21,958 --> 01:23:25,792
- An advantage of being fickle.
- You never were with me.

938
01:23:26,458 --> 01:23:30,875
When I look at you,
I see myself reflected in your eyes.

939
01:23:31,167 --> 01:23:34,625
The Trini I want to be,
not the one other people want.

940
01:23:43,417 --> 01:23:44,500
What are you doing?

941
01:23:45,833 --> 01:23:46,958
Come.

942
01:23:47,333 --> 01:23:49,583
I want to show you the sky.

943
01:23:51,708 --> 01:23:54,208
The stars teach us a lot.

944
01:23:58,833 --> 01:24:00,167
It's beautiful.

945
01:24:01,417 --> 01:24:03,917
You see those two masses?

946
01:24:04,917 --> 01:24:07,167
Some stars shining

947
01:24:07,833 --> 01:24:10,708
and dark shadows around them.

948
01:24:10,875 --> 01:24:13,083
That's like thirst and water.

949
01:24:16,667 --> 01:24:18,167
Right next to each other,

950
01:24:18,792 --> 01:24:20,875
without ever becoming one.

951
01:24:24,167 --> 01:24:27,667
If they did it would make
the most glorious planet.

952
01:24:28,875 --> 01:24:31,333
Do you know
what it would be called?

953
01:24:32,417 --> 01:24:33,083
No.

954
01:24:33,250 --> 01:24:35,250
Planet Solerasus.

955
01:24:37,083 --> 01:24:39,542
Waiting thousands of years

956
01:24:39,708 --> 01:24:43,292
for its moment of glory,
and then dying.

957
01:24:43,458 --> 01:24:45,583
In geology, a century
is like the blink of an eye.

958
01:24:45,750 --> 01:24:48,250
But we have just one instant,

959
01:24:48,792 --> 01:24:50,542
a single flash

960
01:24:51,458 --> 01:24:53,083
of such uncertain glory.

961
01:24:55,875 --> 01:24:57,125
I came to get you.

962
01:24:59,875 --> 01:25:01,375
I can't.

963
01:25:03,125 --> 01:25:04,958
I've nothing left.

964
01:25:05,417 --> 01:25:07,958
You'd hate me
for what I can't give you,

965
01:25:08,167 --> 01:25:10,583
like I hate Lluís now.

966
01:25:10,750 --> 01:25:12,958
- Don't talk about Lluís.
- I can't.

967
01:25:13,417 --> 01:25:14,833
He humiliated me.

968
01:25:15,125 --> 01:25:19,375
He stopped respecting me,
but I can't stop loving him.

969
01:25:20,833 --> 01:25:23,167
Lluís might be weak,

970
01:25:23,417 --> 01:25:26,750
but he'll always take care
of you and Ramonet.

971
01:25:27,958 --> 01:25:29,958
So what do I do now?

972
01:25:31,167 --> 01:25:34,167
Remember this moment.
It's perfect.

973
01:25:35,708 --> 01:25:36,833
The moon,

974
01:25:37,958 --> 01:25:39,417
the stars,

975
01:25:41,250 --> 01:25:42,625
and your smile.

976
01:25:52,708 --> 01:25:54,292
Your smile.

977
01:26:01,208 --> 01:26:02,792
I'll never take it off.

978
01:26:10,292 --> 01:26:11,292
Juli.

979
01:26:12,917 --> 01:26:14,625
I had it analyzed.

980
01:26:15,458 --> 01:26:16,458
And?

981
01:26:17,958 --> 01:26:19,375
It's like you.

982
01:26:19,875 --> 01:26:21,542
From another planet.

983
01:26:27,792 --> 01:26:28,625
Where were you?

984
01:26:28,792 --> 01:26:30,875
I don't have to
explain myself to you.

985
01:26:31,042 --> 01:26:33,500
Trini, not now.
Our son is sick.

986
01:26:35,417 --> 01:26:36,667
What's wrong with him?

987
01:26:37,583 --> 01:26:38,750
I don't know.

988
01:26:41,625 --> 01:26:43,792
He's boiling. Call the doctor.

989
01:26:43,958 --> 01:26:46,542
- He'll be drunk.
- Give him coffee!

990
01:26:59,375 --> 01:27:02,208
Thank you for a wonderful dinner.

991
01:27:02,958 --> 01:27:05,500
- Thank you for coming.
- Goodnight.

992
01:27:17,250 --> 01:27:20,167
- Thank you.
- Thanks for coming. Goodnight.

993
01:27:31,750 --> 01:27:33,750
Fermín, close the gates.

994
01:28:02,958 --> 01:28:06,958
I figure you don't mind guests,
whichever side they come from.

995
01:28:07,125 --> 01:28:08,875
I've always had foresight.

996
01:28:09,375 --> 01:28:11,750
We can't leave
our destiny to chance.

997
01:28:11,917 --> 01:28:13,708
I totally agree.

998
01:28:15,750 --> 01:28:16,833
More rum?

999
01:28:16,958 --> 01:28:18,458
Yes, thank you.

1000
01:28:19,042 --> 01:28:21,542
I didn't expect this warm welcome.

1001
01:28:22,875 --> 01:28:24,708
You caught me in a good mood.

1002
01:28:27,333 --> 01:28:29,625
That uniform suits you better.

1003
01:28:31,417 --> 01:28:34,417
It seems these colours
also suit you.

1004
01:28:35,958 --> 01:28:38,417
The sun always rises
in the same place.

1005
01:28:38,583 --> 01:28:41,208
And we must turn towards it

1006
01:28:41,375 --> 01:28:43,292
if we want to stay alive.

1007
01:28:43,667 --> 01:28:45,417
Just like sunflowers.

1008
01:28:49,583 --> 01:28:51,417
We've always got on.

1009
01:28:52,333 --> 01:28:55,958
That's what I thought.
Until I realised you were using me.

1010
01:28:56,125 --> 01:28:59,083
- Juli, we all use people.
- No, not all of us.

1011
01:29:00,458 --> 01:29:03,417
Anyway,
you didn't do what I asked,

1012
01:29:03,583 --> 01:29:05,958
- so we're even.
- You're wrong.

1013
01:29:06,167 --> 01:29:07,583
You owe me.

1014
01:29:07,875 --> 01:29:08,958
What do I owe you?

1015
01:29:10,500 --> 01:29:11,958
Some compensation.

1016
01:29:13,083 --> 01:29:14,083
For what?

1017
01:29:16,042 --> 01:29:19,458
For having destroyed the honour
of the most decent man I know,

1018
01:29:20,333 --> 01:29:24,000
and for condemning a woman
to the worst humiliation of all.

1019
01:29:25,583 --> 01:29:26,667
What are you talking about?

1020
01:29:26,833 --> 01:29:29,167
A false marriage certificate.

1021
01:29:29,333 --> 01:29:30,333
Is it money you want?

1022
01:29:31,958 --> 01:29:34,458
No, I don't want your money.

1023
01:29:35,208 --> 01:29:36,958
Then why are you here?

1024
01:29:39,750 --> 01:29:40,917
I want you to undress.

1025
01:29:43,208 --> 01:29:45,625
- You must be joking.
- Not at all.

1026
01:29:47,958 --> 01:29:51,667
I want to see
what a spider woman looks like.

1027
01:29:52,542 --> 01:29:55,625
You think I'm going to
undress for you?

1028
01:29:56,333 --> 01:29:58,167
We're on the same side now.

1029
01:29:58,958 --> 01:30:00,250
I could talk.

1030
01:30:00,750 --> 01:30:01,958
You know I'm good at it.

1031
01:30:02,125 --> 01:30:03,708
Or you could be shot.

1032
01:30:04,250 --> 01:30:05,958
Yes, maybe.

1033
01:30:06,625 --> 01:30:10,292
Nobody would believe
a deserter and a drunk.

1034
01:30:10,625 --> 01:30:14,708
I could spread the rumour
and sow the doubt.

1035
01:30:15,083 --> 01:30:18,333
We both know that
to destroy a woman's reputation,

1036
01:30:18,500 --> 01:30:22,250
it doesn't matter
if it's gossip or gospel truth.

1037
01:30:22,958 --> 01:30:26,625
- I'll destroy you first.
- Please try.

1038
01:30:28,167 --> 01:30:30,000
I'm prepared to take the risk.

1039
01:30:31,958 --> 01:30:33,125
I've nothing to lose.

1040
01:30:34,792 --> 01:30:37,750
But you can't really say the same.

1041
01:30:39,750 --> 01:30:43,292
So you want to humiliate me

1042
01:30:43,667 --> 01:30:46,500
to make up for
another woman's humiliation

1043
01:30:46,750 --> 01:30:49,125
and to restore
your friend's honour?

1044
01:30:49,625 --> 01:30:53,500
- You think this will make it better?
- Not for them.

1045
01:30:53,708 --> 01:30:54,792
But for me.

1046
01:30:56,708 --> 01:30:57,958
What do you want?

1047
01:30:58,167 --> 01:30:59,417
I told you.

1048
01:30:59,583 --> 01:31:01,667
I want to see
what I imagine is there.

1049
01:31:02,667 --> 01:31:04,750
The saggy tits

1050
01:31:04,917 --> 01:31:08,833
of a woman who seems young,
but whose flesh is old.

1051
01:31:09,250 --> 01:31:12,792
Cagorcio's daughter,
""the dirty pig"".

1052
01:31:15,083 --> 01:31:17,375
That's what I want to see.

1053
01:31:20,458 --> 01:31:21,958
I'd rather die.

1054
01:31:33,375 --> 01:31:34,708
You won't do it.

1055
01:31:34,875 --> 01:31:36,333
Try me.

1056
01:32:11,917 --> 01:32:12,917
And the rest.

1057
01:32:34,958 --> 01:32:37,458
How old was I
when my father did this?

1058
01:32:41,250 --> 01:32:42,417
Four.

1059
01:32:44,625 --> 01:32:45,875
And this?

1060
01:32:46,708 --> 01:32:47,708
Seventeen.

1061
01:32:47,875 --> 01:32:50,292
I stopped counting
all the ones in between.

1062
01:32:50,667 --> 01:32:55,333
You're not the first to treat me
like I wasn't a person.

1063
01:33:00,833 --> 01:33:04,083
Now you know
what a spider woman looks like.

1064
01:33:04,625 --> 01:33:06,875
Does it make you feel better?

1065
01:33:17,125 --> 01:33:20,125
Open wide.
Stick your tongue out.

1066
01:33:20,750 --> 01:33:21,958
Say ""aah""...

1067
01:33:23,583 --> 01:33:25,250
The boy will be fine.

1068
01:33:25,417 --> 01:33:27,917
It's an infection of the tonsils.

1069
01:33:28,083 --> 01:33:28,792
It can't be.

1070
01:33:28,958 --> 01:33:30,667
It causes a high fever.

1071
01:33:30,833 --> 01:33:32,625
He had them out last year.

1072
01:33:32,792 --> 01:33:36,292
- Are you sure?
- Of course I am. I'm his mother.

1073
01:33:43,167 --> 01:33:45,292
Then it's not good news.

1074
01:33:45,458 --> 01:33:46,458
What do you mean?

1075
01:33:46,542 --> 01:33:49,167
It must be diphtheria.

1076
01:33:49,333 --> 01:33:50,958
But children die from that.

1077
01:33:51,167 --> 01:33:55,833
Not normally. With an antiserum,
he'd recover in a few days.

1078
01:33:55,958 --> 01:33:58,708
But we don't have any
in our pharmacy.

1079
01:33:58,875 --> 01:34:00,083
Are you sure?

1080
01:34:00,250 --> 01:34:04,042
I might be drunk,
but I know what's in our pharmacy.

1081
01:34:04,208 --> 01:34:05,625
So what can we do?

1082
01:34:08,083 --> 01:34:11,375
The Saint Paul hospital
in Barcelona might have some.

1083
01:34:11,542 --> 01:34:13,625
I'll ask the Captain to let me go.

1084
01:34:17,417 --> 01:34:18,625
Listen.

1085
01:34:18,792 --> 01:34:22,042
Go now.
The boy only has a few days.

1086
01:34:22,208 --> 01:34:25,708
Ask for Dr. Vega.
Tell him I sent you.

1087
01:34:25,875 --> 01:34:26,917
Thank you.

1088
01:34:49,750 --> 01:34:51,917
I'm looking for Dr. Vega.

1089
01:34:52,083 --> 01:34:54,583
Paediatrics is the third floor.

1090
01:35:43,250 --> 01:35:44,417
Doctor Vega?

1091
01:35:44,583 --> 01:35:46,250
Yes, that's me.

1092
01:35:46,750 --> 01:35:48,792
Doctor Puig sent me,
from the front.

1093
01:35:48,958 --> 01:35:52,958
My son has diphtheria
and we have no antiserum.

1094
01:35:53,125 --> 01:35:54,958
Could you give me some?

1095
01:35:55,125 --> 01:35:56,917
I wish I could,

1096
01:35:57,083 --> 01:35:59,542
but we ran out a week ago.

1097
01:36:00,250 --> 01:36:03,708
Every day, I lose
half a dozen like this.

1098
01:36:03,875 --> 01:36:06,667
What about the other hospitals?

1099
01:36:06,833 --> 01:36:08,667
Unfortunately not.

1100
01:36:08,833 --> 01:36:12,042
The Fascists
aren't letting anything through.

1101
01:36:12,208 --> 01:36:13,708
I'm sorry.

1102
01:36:21,958 --> 01:36:23,833
Open your mouth.

1103
01:36:23,958 --> 01:36:24,958
That's it.

1104
01:36:25,125 --> 01:36:26,417
Swallow.

1105
01:36:28,708 --> 01:36:30,292
He can't even drink.

1106
01:36:30,583 --> 01:36:32,667
The fever isn't going down.

1107
01:36:32,958 --> 01:36:34,375
He's dying.

1108
01:36:34,917 --> 01:36:36,833
My boy is dying.

1109
01:36:44,750 --> 01:36:47,583
Trini, we've had a telegram
from Lluís.

1110
01:36:47,750 --> 01:36:49,917
There's no antiserum
in the Republican zone.

1111
01:36:50,083 --> 01:36:51,708
The Fascists have it all.

1112
01:36:51,875 --> 01:36:55,083
He says not to worry,
he'll find it somehow.

1113
01:36:56,708 --> 01:36:58,542
He won't find any.

1114
01:37:00,792 --> 01:37:02,542
He won't find any.

1115
01:37:02,917 --> 01:37:06,167
Please, God, don't take my boy.

1116
01:37:07,958 --> 01:37:10,833
Don't take him from me.

1117
01:37:14,208 --> 01:37:16,875
Please, God.

1118
01:37:20,750 --> 01:37:23,917
Listen, Trini.
Why don't you ask the<i> Carlana?</i>

1119
01:37:26,083 --> 01:37:27,417
The<i> Carlana?</i>

1120
01:37:27,583 --> 01:37:28,250
Why?

1121
01:37:28,417 --> 01:37:31,542
Because she gets on well
with both sides.

1122
01:37:32,792 --> 01:37:34,292
And what could she do?

1123
01:37:34,458 --> 01:37:37,500
She knows all the landlords
on the other side.

1124
01:37:38,667 --> 01:37:41,542
Will you go?
I can't see that woman.

1125
01:37:42,958 --> 01:37:44,583
Of course you can.

1126
01:37:45,583 --> 01:37:46,958
And you will.

1127
01:38:15,458 --> 01:38:17,333
I'd like to see her ladyship.

1128
01:38:17,500 --> 01:38:19,417
Let her in, María.

1129
01:38:23,958 --> 01:38:25,500
Is something wrong?

1130
01:38:26,042 --> 01:38:29,292
I need to ask a favour.
It's for my son.

1131
01:38:29,625 --> 01:38:31,292
What's wrong with him?

1132
01:38:31,458 --> 01:38:32,625
He has diphtheria.

1133
01:38:32,792 --> 01:38:35,583
Without an antiserum,
he'll die in a few days.

1134
01:38:35,750 --> 01:38:37,167
I'm so sorry.

1135
01:38:40,500 --> 01:38:44,250
I know you don't want to talk
to me, but I want to help.

1136
01:38:46,458 --> 01:38:47,542
What can I do?

1137
01:38:48,208 --> 01:38:50,375
There's no antiserum
on this side,

1138
01:38:50,542 --> 01:38:52,500
but you know people
on the other side.

1139
01:38:53,708 --> 01:38:55,375
Does your husband
know you're here?

1140
01:38:55,542 --> 01:38:57,792
No, I came on my own.

1141
01:38:59,250 --> 01:39:00,625
Tell him to come and see me.

1142
01:39:07,375 --> 01:39:09,458
Wait here.
Switch off the lights.

1143
01:39:18,750 --> 01:39:19,417
Halt!

1144
01:39:19,583 --> 01:39:21,333
Please, don't shoot.

1145
01:39:21,500 --> 01:39:24,833
Call Soleràs, he's with you lot.

1146
01:39:25,625 --> 01:39:27,833
- Say his friend Lluís is here.
- Why should I?

1147
01:39:36,042 --> 01:39:37,042
Wait here.

1148
01:39:51,792 --> 01:39:52,792
What do you want?

1149
01:39:55,042 --> 01:39:57,292
- It's Ramonet.
- What about Ramonet?

1150
01:39:58,042 --> 01:39:59,083
He has diphtheria.

1151
01:39:59,250 --> 01:40:00,250
What?

1152
01:40:00,333 --> 01:40:02,167
He doesn't have long.

1153
01:40:02,625 --> 01:40:04,833
We don't have any antiserum.

1154
01:40:05,250 --> 01:40:07,875
- I thought maybe you...
- Me?

1155
01:40:08,375 --> 01:40:11,042
What can I do?
We have nothing either.

1156
01:40:15,917 --> 01:40:18,750
But I'll check
with the other regiments.

1157
01:40:19,500 --> 01:40:21,958
Don't worry, Lluís. I'll find it.

1158
01:40:23,083 --> 01:40:24,542
I hope so.

1159
01:40:26,917 --> 01:40:30,375
Meet me tomorrow night
at the old convent.

1160
01:40:31,750 --> 01:40:32,958
Thank you.

1161
01:40:35,083 --> 01:40:36,167
And Trini?

1162
01:40:38,125 --> 01:40:39,125
How is she?

1163
01:40:39,833 --> 01:40:41,667
You can imagine.

1164
01:40:45,708 --> 01:40:47,042
Thanks.

1165
01:40:55,167 --> 01:40:56,167
Trini.

1166
01:40:56,875 --> 01:40:59,042
- How is he?
- Lluís,

1167
01:40:59,208 --> 01:41:00,542
thank God you're back.

1168
01:41:02,458 --> 01:41:03,583
How did it go?

1169
01:41:04,250 --> 01:41:05,750
I'll find out tonight.

1170
01:41:05,917 --> 01:41:07,083
Is it certain?

1171
01:41:07,250 --> 01:41:08,625
No, Trini.

1172
01:41:08,792 --> 01:41:10,750
Then go to see the<i> Carlana.</i>

1173
01:41:11,375 --> 01:41:13,875
The<i> Carlana?</i> Why?

1174
01:41:14,042 --> 01:41:16,208
She'll get it, if you ask her.

1175
01:41:16,750 --> 01:41:17,750
Did you go to her?

1176
01:41:17,833 --> 01:41:20,583
Go, Lluís.
Don't waste more time.

1177
01:41:34,250 --> 01:41:36,667
María, take the boys to their room.

1178
01:41:38,375 --> 01:41:40,125
Have them wash their faces.

1179
01:41:40,750 --> 01:41:41,833
You stay, Fermín.

1180
01:41:44,250 --> 01:41:45,958
My wife told me to come.

1181
01:41:47,250 --> 01:41:48,333
Hello, Lluís.

1182
01:41:51,625 --> 01:41:53,208
Come close to the fire.

1183
01:41:55,542 --> 01:41:56,542
Have a seat.

1184
01:42:05,083 --> 01:42:09,042
I once told you I would
be prepared to help your son.

1185
01:42:09,583 --> 01:42:11,958
I stand by what I said.

1186
01:42:13,583 --> 01:42:16,958
I'll get you the antiserum,
on one condition.

1187
01:42:18,458 --> 01:42:19,458
What's that?

1188
01:42:21,208 --> 01:42:22,583
That you kill Soleràs.

1189
01:42:23,625 --> 01:42:24,750
What?

1190
01:42:26,292 --> 01:42:27,292
You heard me.

1191
01:42:28,250 --> 01:42:29,250
Why?

1192
01:42:30,542 --> 01:42:31,958
Because he's dangerous.

1193
01:42:32,958 --> 01:42:34,750
Don't ask me to do that.

1194
01:42:34,958 --> 01:42:37,083
Soleràs is like a brother to me.

1195
01:42:37,250 --> 01:42:39,792
Soleràs is just a soldier
for the other side.

1196
01:42:40,333 --> 01:42:42,667
- We're at war.
- Give me the bloody antiserum!

1197
01:42:42,833 --> 01:42:44,833
My son is dying!

1198
01:42:47,667 --> 01:42:50,500
That's the deal.

1199
01:42:51,708 --> 01:42:55,375
If you want to save your son,
you know what to do.

1200
01:43:01,250 --> 01:43:02,667
I've never killed anyone.

1201
01:43:03,583 --> 01:43:04,917
It's never too late.

1202
01:43:09,042 --> 01:43:10,458
Don't I get an answer?

1203
01:43:32,208 --> 01:43:34,125
I'm sorry, Lluís.

1204
01:43:34,542 --> 01:43:36,042
I couldn't get anything.

1205
01:43:44,667 --> 01:43:45,750
What will you do?

1206
01:43:47,833 --> 01:43:51,250
- I've taken steps to get some.
- What steps?

1207
01:43:57,292 --> 01:43:58,792
The<i> Carlana</i> will give it to me.

1208
01:43:59,375 --> 01:44:00,875
The<i> Carlana?</i>

1209
01:44:01,625 --> 01:44:03,542
In exchange for what?

1210
01:44:04,083 --> 01:44:06,667
She doesn't give anything
away for free.

1211
01:44:09,625 --> 01:44:10,875
Lluís.

1212
01:44:31,458 --> 01:44:34,958
The important thing
is that Ramonet will live.

1213
01:44:35,583 --> 01:44:37,833
- He has to live.
- And he will.

1214
01:44:38,167 --> 01:44:40,292
His life is worth more
than either of ours.

1215
01:44:40,458 --> 01:44:41,625
Much more.

1216
01:44:42,875 --> 01:44:47,042
Juli, I want you to know
that despite our differences,

1217
01:44:47,208 --> 01:44:49,542
I've always thought of you
as family.

1218
01:44:50,417 --> 01:44:53,250
All families have a black sheep.

1219
01:44:56,917 --> 01:44:58,417
No, it's OK.

1220
01:45:03,042 --> 01:45:04,292
Relax.

1221
01:45:12,333 --> 01:45:14,125
Stain it with my blood.

1222
01:45:16,500 --> 01:45:18,125
Go, Juli.

1223
01:45:19,125 --> 01:45:20,125
Go.

1224
01:45:21,417 --> 01:45:23,667
Don't feel guilty, Lluís.

1225
01:45:24,125 --> 01:45:26,083
You're doing me a favour.

1226
01:45:27,083 --> 01:45:30,417
It's what I've always wanted:
To die.

1227
01:45:31,125 --> 01:45:32,917
And this way, at least,

1228
01:45:33,083 --> 01:45:35,500
my death will achieve something.

1229
01:45:35,750 --> 01:45:39,833
Just promise you'll look after them,
and never leave them.

1230
01:45:40,458 --> 01:45:41,458
I promise.

1231
01:45:43,875 --> 01:45:46,958
I don't want to be buried
with the winners.

1232
01:45:48,625 --> 01:45:52,458
A war can only end well if it's lost.

1233
01:46:01,042 --> 01:46:02,125
Go on.

1234
01:46:02,792 --> 01:46:03,792
I'm ready.

1235
01:46:49,833 --> 01:46:52,333
Let's kill each other
like good brothers.

1236
01:47:49,167 --> 01:47:50,167
Where's the antiserum?

1237
01:47:50,250 --> 01:47:52,583
I just gave it to your wife.

1238
01:47:53,167 --> 01:47:54,750
I knew you'd do it.

1239
01:48:34,375 --> 01:48:36,333
He seems to be getting better.

1240
01:48:45,833 --> 01:48:47,917
When the<i> Carlana</i> came here,

1241
01:48:48,208 --> 01:48:50,958
it felt like
the world made no sense.

1242
01:48:52,083 --> 01:48:55,458
It's absurd that the same woman
who hurt us so much

1243
01:48:55,625 --> 01:48:58,125
could have saved our son's life.

1244
01:49:00,083 --> 01:49:02,583
The main thing is Ramonet is alive.

1245
01:49:03,958 --> 01:49:05,167
He is.

1246
01:49:06,667 --> 01:49:08,417
What about us, Lluís?

1247
01:49:32,875 --> 01:49:34,042
They're shooting.

1248
01:49:34,792 --> 01:49:36,625
Quickly, AGUSTÍN.

1249
01:49:37,250 --> 01:49:39,083
It's all right.

1250
01:49:51,583 --> 01:49:52,875
Get into bed.

1251
01:49:56,542 --> 01:49:58,292
Go on, AGUSTÍN.

1252
01:50:15,500 --> 01:50:17,250
Everything's all right.

1253
01:50:17,417 --> 01:50:18,833
Go to sleep.

1254
01:50:19,958 --> 01:50:21,167
Go to sleep.

1255
01:50:28,792 --> 01:50:33,500
<i>They say that when the moon</i>

1256
01:50:35,250 --> 01:50:39,958
<i>shines in the sky,</i>

1257
01:50:41,500 --> 01:50:46,833
<i>the sun has gone away,</i>

1258
01:50:48,250 --> 01:50:53,417
<i>because it's very sleepy.</i>

1259
01:50:54,917 --> 01:50:59,500
<i>Slowly, slowly,</i>

1260
01:51:01,250 --> 01:51:06,208
<i>close your eyes,</i>

1261
01:51:06,708 --> 01:51:10,958
<i>because you, my little girl,
are the sun</i>

1262
01:51:12,958 --> 01:51:17,917
<i>that I love the most.</i>

1263
01:51:18,875 --> 01:51:24,833
<i>And the moon peeps through</i>

1264
01:51:26,333 --> 01:51:32,708
<i>into the bedroom</i>

1265
01:51:33,958 --> 01:51:41,167
<i>and tells you to go to sleep</i>

1266
01:51:41,792 --> 01:51:47,750
<i>and not to be afraid.</i>

1267
01:51:47,917 --> 01:51:50,958
<i>And in your sleep you play,</i>

1268
01:51:51,167 --> 01:51:55,542
<i>you play with the stars</i>

1269
01:51:55,708 --> 01:52:03,500
<i>and fill the sky with joy.</i>

1270
01:52:03,667 --> 01:52:07,125
<i>Sleep, my child.</i>

1271
01:52:07,292 --> 01:52:11,208
<i>Sleep, my child.</i>

1272
01:52:11,375 --> 01:52:15,125
<i>Your mother tenderly</i>

1273
01:52:15,292 --> 01:52:18,750
<i>rocks and caress you.</i>

1274
01:52:18,917 --> 01:52:22,875
<i>Your mother tenderly</i>

1275
01:52:23,042 --> 01:52:26,583
<i>rocks you</i>

1276
01:52:34,125 --> 01:52:40,125
<i>in the bedroom.</i>

1277
01:52:49,542 --> 01:52:55,750
<i>Don't be afraid.</i>

The Neighbors' Window,https://yts-subs.com/movie-imdb/tt8163822,https://yts-subs.com/subtitles/the-neighbors-window-2019-english-yify-489651,"1
00:00:27,906 --> 00:00:29,444
Ow! Oh my god…

2
00:00:37,359 --> 00:00:38,997
Wow, are they down?

3
00:00:40,669 --> 00:00:43,369
Nice job. That was fast.

4
00:00:43,776 --> 00:00:45,598
Yeah, they’re whooped.

5
00:00:46,474 --> 00:00:50,638
I thought I was gonna lose it when they wouldn’t quit with that Captain Underpants thing.

6
00:00:51,239 --> 00:00:53,365
They have no idea what it was like to grow up

7
00:00:53,366 --> 00:00:55,539
back when kids got spanked.

8
00:00:57,012 --> 00:00:58,312
Oh, god...

9
00:00:59,569 --> 00:01:00,917
That looks good.

10
00:01:02,612 --> 00:01:05,135
- Have a little. - No, I shouldn't.

11
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:09,075
What the…?

12
00:01:09,512 --> 00:01:10,812
What?

13
00:01:12,810 --> 00:01:13,810
JACOB: Wow.

14
00:01:15,176 --> 00:01:16,488
ALLI: Oh my god!

15
00:01:17,063 --> 00:01:18,563
Oh, I can't watch.

16
00:01:19,870 --> 00:01:21,300
As she keeps watching.

17
00:01:22,309 --> 00:01:24,705
But seriously, they need to order some drapes.

18
00:01:25,129 --> 00:01:26,547
It’s disgraceful.

19
00:01:27,510 --> 00:01:29,492
Alright, stop drooling.

20
00:01:36,391 --> 00:01:38,805
They’re christening the new apartment.

21
00:01:39,767 --> 00:01:42,667
Do you think they really don’t think that people can see them?

22
00:01:43,312 --> 00:01:46,112
Or are they getting off on it?

23
00:01:47,502 --> 00:01:50,005
I just think they really don’t care.

24
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
- Woah! - Woah.

25
00:01:53,460 --> 00:01:54,782
That’s a new one.

26
00:01:57,730 --> 00:01:59,827
She’s very flexible.

27
00:02:03,223 --> 00:02:04,957
You know, he’s really hot too.

28
00:02:06,860 --> 00:02:09,010
I didn’t say hot. I said flexible.

29
00:02:12,142 --> 00:02:14,178
Do you think we should turn out the lights?

30
00:02:17,779 --> 00:02:20,427
Why should we turn out the lights? We’re not doing anything.

31
00:02:20,428 --> 00:02:21,928
They’re the ones who are…

32
00:02:59,417 --> 00:03:00,787
ALLI: Just one more second!

33
00:03:01,743 --> 00:03:03,343
We’re almost there.

34
00:03:03,866 --> 00:03:05,439
- JACOB: No! (Laughs) - ALLI: Alright.

35
00:03:05,950 --> 00:03:07,400
OK, just keep holding it.

36
00:03:07,401 --> 00:03:10,151
JACOB: No, he thinks that’s what a producer does.

37
00:03:10,152 --> 00:03:11,752
Quick, quick, quick!

38
00:03:13,353 --> 00:03:14,720
Quick, quick, quick!

39
00:03:14,721 --> 00:03:19,071
JACOB: Well, that's because he doesn’t know exactly what happens in a studio session.

40
00:03:19,072 --> 00:03:20,672
ALLI: How are you doing, Tanner?

41
00:03:20,673 --> 00:03:22,473
ALLI: No, no, no! Into the toilet!

42
00:03:22,674 --> 00:03:25,513
JACOB: It’s like the label’s being run by freakin’ teenagers.

43
00:03:27,565 --> 00:03:28,865
JACOB: I know.

44
00:03:29,166 --> 00:03:30,503
You’re still in here.

45
00:03:30,804 --> 00:03:32,226
What did he do?

46
00:03:32,427 --> 00:03:34,127
What? He missed the toilet.

47
00:03:34,128 --> 00:03:35,928
- Again? - Yes, again.

48
00:03:35,929 --> 00:03:37,229
It's okay.

49
00:03:38,119 --> 00:03:39,485
ALLI: Here, I need to...

50
00:03:41,476 --> 00:03:44,228
JACOB: Look, no, I love the song and I will send it.

51
00:03:44,617 --> 00:03:48,145
But honestly, I don’t think they give two shits about what I think anymore.

52
00:03:50,499 --> 00:03:51,799
Okay.

53
00:03:52,029 --> 00:03:53,597
Alright. Break a leg tonight.

54
00:03:54,222 --> 00:03:55,522
Laters!

55
00:03:57,214 --> 00:03:58,514
Sorry.

56
00:04:01,770 --> 00:04:03,070
(Mockingly) Laters!

57
00:04:03,971 --> 00:04:05,591
What is that supposed to mean?

58
00:04:07,359 --> 00:04:09,541
I just spent my whole Saturday

59
00:04:10,115 --> 00:04:13,319
haggling about contracts and recoupment schedules

60
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:15,320
while you guys were out having fun.

61
00:04:15,521 --> 00:04:18,821
I would give anything to haggle about a recoupment schedule.

62
00:04:22,414 --> 00:04:24,142
Why are you working out here?

63
00:04:27,344 --> 00:04:30,054
Just the... Skype signal's better.

64
00:04:30,903 --> 00:04:32,410
Are your friends home?

65
00:04:33,346 --> 00:04:35,370
- My friends? - Yeah.

66
00:04:35,668 --> 00:04:37,113
Across the street?

67
00:04:37,408 --> 00:04:40,352
Or are you working too hard to notice them?

68
00:04:41,318 --> 00:04:42,618
Oh, shit.

69
00:04:44,847 --> 00:04:46,147
Alright.

70
00:04:46,566 --> 00:04:48,761
Fine, alright - I got it, thank you!

71
00:04:49,784 --> 00:04:51,934
- Woah, what happened to you today? - What happened to me?

72
00:04:51,935 --> 00:04:54,035
I was juggling three kids all day by myself

73
00:04:54,036 --> 00:04:56,336
at the zoo in the snow. And one of them was

74
00:04:56,337 --> 00:04:59,037
snotty or poopy or hungry or had a scraped

75
00:04:59,038 --> 00:05:00,638
knee every 'effing second.

76
00:05:00,639 --> 00:05:02,839
I had four hours of sleep last night!

77
00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:05,707
Because I was up nursing or getting spit up on.

78
00:05:05,708 --> 00:05:08,408
And then I got home and my husband is just chilling

79
00:05:08,409 --> 00:05:10,309
with his music bros and

80
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:12,630
gawking at the neighbors with his dick hanging out.

81
00:05:12,630 --> 00:05:14,293
Woah!

82
00:05:14,293 --> 00:05:18,027
Hey guys, why don’t you go into your room for a little bit?

83
00:05:20,206 --> 00:05:21,506
Here you go.

84
00:05:21,769 --> 00:05:25,179
I’ll come in and hang out in a minute, okay?

85
00:05:27,180 --> 00:05:29,380
I thought after three months they’d figure out

86
00:05:29,381 --> 00:05:31,381
there’s a whole building of people who live over here.

87
00:05:31,382 --> 00:05:33,632
I swear to God, it’s like they live with us.

88
00:05:33,833 --> 00:05:35,833
I think you might be overreacting a little.

89
00:05:35,834 --> 00:05:37,134
Oh, do you?

90
00:05:37,135 --> 00:05:39,635
Are you enjoying the binoculars you wanted for your birthday present

91
00:05:39,636 --> 00:05:41,236
to use in the Catskills?

92
00:05:44,852 --> 00:05:47,520
Look, I know I’m not 22

93
00:05:47,819 --> 00:05:50,437
and I’m tired all the time

94
00:05:50,829 --> 00:05:54,338
and my nipples feel like a piranha has been fucking gnawing at them.

95
00:05:54,733 --> 00:05:56,365
But it’s just a little dispiriting

96
00:05:56,366 --> 00:05:58,840
the way you’re captivated by them.

97
00:05:59,907 --> 00:06:03,460
Wait a minute. I don’t think I’m the only one who's captivated.

98
00:06:05,872 --> 00:06:08,786
They’re like a car crash that you can’t look away from.

99
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:13,405
Okay, a beautiful sexy young car crash.

100
00:06:13,406 --> 00:06:14,706
I didn’t say that!

101
00:06:15,396 --> 00:06:17,771
I mean for real, do they have jobs?

102
00:06:17,772 --> 00:06:20,772
Or clothes? All they do is host dance parties

103
00:06:20,773 --> 00:06:22,673
and sleep till noon and screw.

104
00:06:23,030 --> 00:06:26,080
You have no idea what it feels like to have your face constantly rubbed --

105
00:06:26,081 --> 00:06:27,781
Yes, I do!

106
00:06:28,065 --> 00:06:29,865
What, you think I like talking about

107
00:06:29,866 --> 00:06:33,006
how many times Luther pooped or who’s doing drop off?

108
00:06:33,945 --> 00:06:36,618
And I’m becoming the old geezer at work.

109
00:06:37,630 --> 00:06:39,951
I’ve ever started getting grey pubic hairs.

110
00:06:40,630 --> 00:06:43,620
Which I assume you haven’t noticed because when would you?

111
00:06:45,217 --> 00:06:47,217
You’re not the only one who misses being 20.

112
00:06:48,395 --> 00:06:50,017
Staying up all night.

113
00:06:50,250 --> 00:06:51,718
Getting jiggy with it.

114
00:06:53,269 --> 00:06:54,769
Getting jiggy with it?

115
00:06:55,996 --> 00:06:58,517
You know that song came out before your friends were born.

116
00:06:58,517 --> 00:06:59,353
Ow.

117
00:06:59,353 --> 00:07:01,484
- Well, it did! - Let’s stop talking.

118
00:07:01,485 --> 00:07:02,785
Come here.

119
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:16,320
(Music starts: ""Nobody Else Will Be There"" by The National)

120
00:07:22,321 --> 00:07:26,367
You said we’re not so tied together.

121
00:07:28,999 --> 00:07:31,194
What did you mean?

122
00:07:34,740 --> 00:07:38,779
Meet me in the stairwell in a second

123
00:07:40,694 --> 00:07:43,432
For a glass of gin.

124
00:07:46,236 --> 00:07:50,244
Nobody else will be there then.

125
00:07:51,079 --> 00:07:54,066
Nobody else will be there.

126
00:07:54,067 --> 00:07:55,467
Oh, no! Oh yuck yuck yuck!

127
00:08:01,396 --> 00:08:05,999
Can you remind me the building you live in?

128
00:08:07,780 --> 00:08:10,747
I’m on my way.

129
00:08:13,300 --> 00:08:18,295
It’s getting cold again but New York’s gorgeous.

130
00:08:19,534 --> 00:08:22,934
It’s a subway day.

131
00:08:24,965 --> 00:08:29,059
Nobody else will be there then.

132
00:08:29,810 --> 00:08:33,102
Nobody else will be there.

133
00:08:34,666 --> 00:08:38,766
Nobody else will be there then.

134
00:08:39,510 --> 00:08:42,612
Nobody else will be there.

135
00:08:49,420 --> 00:08:51,100
KID: Look it, look it!

136
00:08:52,764 --> 00:08:54,146
ALLI: Well, can you get on standby?

137
00:08:59,225 --> 00:09:01,503
Jesus, well what time does that get you in?

138
00:09:02,300 --> 00:09:04,300
KID: That's a lot of tape.

139
00:09:05,227 --> 00:09:07,315
Have you tried just ripping into them?

140
00:09:09,709 --> 00:09:13,061
Okay, alright. Call me if you get on.

141
00:09:21,356 --> 00:09:24,506
Goodbyes always take us

142
00:09:25,207 --> 00:09:27,207
Half an hour.

143
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,800
Can’t we just go home?

144
00:09:32,841 --> 00:09:36,866
Nobody else will be there then.

145
00:09:37,675 --> 00:09:40,975
Nobody else will be there.

146
00:09:42,506 --> 00:09:46,587
Nobody else will be there then.

147
00:09:47,350 --> 00:09:50,650
Nobody else will be there.

148
00:10:17,350 --> 00:10:22,350
(Music ends.)

149
00:10:53,741 --> 00:10:55,041
Hey.

150
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:02,020
Is that the guy?

151
00:11:02,770 --> 00:11:04,070
Yeah.

152
00:11:05,460 --> 00:11:07,227
Did he shave his head?

153
00:11:07,862 --> 00:11:09,162
I guess so.

154
00:11:10,100 --> 00:11:11,711
I guess I haven’t seen him in a while.

155
00:11:13,520 --> 00:11:15,181
He doesn’t look so good.

156
00:11:16,299 --> 00:11:17,599
No.

157
00:11:18,824 --> 00:11:20,424
Do you think he’s hungover?

158
00:11:21,923 --> 00:11:23,223
I don’t know.

159
00:11:24,314 --> 00:11:27,182
KID: Daddy, Tanner bit my leg!

160
00:11:28,820 --> 00:11:32,395
Why would you even have your leg near his mouth?

161
00:11:43,243 --> 00:11:45,943
Okay, be good!

162
00:11:47,928 --> 00:11:49,811
Can you give the phone to daddy?

163
00:11:52,803 --> 00:11:56,108
Yeah, if you need to, just go to the blue whale room

164
00:11:56,109 --> 00:11:58,049
and let the kids run around.

165
00:11:58,271 --> 00:12:01,068
It’s so dark in there, Luther will probably just fall asleep.

166
00:12:02,984 --> 00:12:05,928
I know, I’m going to get in the tub with my book right now.

167
00:12:07,864 --> 00:12:09,177
Okay.

168
00:12:09,178 --> 00:12:10,478
See you then.

169
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,780
(Doorbell rings.)

170
00:13:07,780 --> 00:13:09,789
(Door opens.)

171
00:13:09,789 --> 00:13:11,476
- Hi. Thank you!

172
00:13:12,342 --> 00:13:13,642
- Take care.

173
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:40,380
Are you okay?

174
00:16:40,740 --> 00:16:42,040
Yeah.

175
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:47,700
What?

176
00:16:51,134 --> 00:16:54,098
Do you live in that building right over there?

177
00:16:58,342 --> 00:16:59,642
Yes.

178
00:17:00,467 --> 00:17:01,889
I think...

179
00:17:02,568 --> 00:17:05,758
I think our apartments might face each other.

180
00:17:07,386 --> 00:17:08,686
Really?

181
00:17:09,730 --> 00:17:11,238
You have a little girl

182
00:17:12,189 --> 00:17:14,642
and a boy and a baby.

183
00:17:17,144 --> 00:17:18,849
I hope that doesn't seem creepy.

184
00:17:19,050 --> 00:17:20,350
No.

185
00:17:20,551 --> 00:17:22,051
Your children are...

186
00:17:22,728 --> 00:17:24,387
Really adorable.

187
00:17:26,156 --> 00:17:27,860
And hilarious.

188
00:17:30,005 --> 00:17:31,465
My husband and I.

189
00:17:40,401 --> 00:17:42,261
My husband...

190
00:17:44,188 --> 00:17:46,863
Has been really sick.

191
00:17:47,186 --> 00:17:48,486
And...

192
00:17:48,731 --> 00:17:50,031
We would

193
00:17:50,463 --> 00:17:53,469
look over and see your kids

194
00:17:54,425 --> 00:17:57,723
and you or your husband, I guess.

195
00:17:58,568 --> 00:18:01,146
Sitting up at night to feed the new baby.

196
00:18:01,147 --> 00:18:02,447
It was...

197
00:18:05,841 --> 00:18:07,141
It was...

198
00:18:26,790 --> 00:18:28,090
JACOB: Hello?

199
00:18:29,596 --> 00:18:30,896
Hi!

200
00:18:34,018 --> 00:18:36,094
- Hi mommy. - Hi sweetie pie.

201
00:18:36,860 --> 00:18:38,789
- How was it? - Good.

202
00:18:40,131 --> 00:18:41,530
What did you do?

203
00:18:41,993 --> 00:18:44,185
We saw a Tyrannosaurus Rex!

204
00:18:44,805 --> 00:18:46,105
ALLI: You did?

205
00:18:46,106 --> 00:18:47,406
Did Luther like it?

206
00:18:47,407 --> 00:18:48,707
No, he cried.

207
00:18:48,708 --> 00:18:51,642
And Daddy let us stop for milkshakes.

208
00:18:51,643 --> 00:18:54,043
Oh, Daddy let you stop for milkshakes?

209
00:18:54,446 --> 00:18:57,703
- We gave Luther some milkshake. - You gave Luther some milkshake?

210
00:18:57,704 --> 00:19:00,184
JACOB: Just a little bit! And he fell asleep.

211
00:19:05,320 --> 00:19:07,441
How are you? How was your day off?"
Meet Me in the Bathroom,https://yts-subs.com/movie-imdb/tt16378298,https://yts-subs.com/subtitles/meet-me-in-the-bathroom-2022-english-yify-481518,"﻿1
00:02:57,866 --> 00:03:00,115
Day upon day,

2
00:03:00,116 --> 00:03:02,991
and year upon year, O city,

3
00:03:03,033 --> 00:03:05,074
walking your streets.

4
00:03:08,074 --> 00:03:10,657
Give me faces and streets!

5
00:03:10,658 --> 00:03:13,741
Give me comrades
and lovers by the thousands!

6
00:03:13,782 --> 00:03:16,324
Let me see new ones every day!

7
00:03:16,325 --> 00:03:19,199
Let me hold new ones
by the hand every day!

8
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:20,240
Give me such shows!

9
00:03:20,241 --> 00:03:23,700
Give me the streets
of Manhattan!

10
00:03:25,658 --> 00:03:29,656
People, endless, streaming,
with strong voices,

11
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:31,324
passions, pageants.

12
00:03:31,325 --> 00:03:34,324
Manhattan streets,
with their powerful throbs,

13
00:03:34,325 --> 00:03:37,283
with the beating drums, as now,

14
00:03:37,325 --> 00:03:39,741
the endless and noisy chorus.

15
00:03:43,408 --> 00:03:47,949
Manhattan crowds with
their turbulent musical chorus.

16
00:03:47,991 --> 00:03:53,782
Manhattan faces and eyes
forever for me.

17
00:04:14,366 --> 00:04:16,366
Welcome to New York City.

18
00:04:26,949 --> 00:04:29,949
Sleeping in a van
Between A and B

19
00:04:32,158 --> 00:04:35,533
Sucking dick for ecstasy

20
00:04:37,116 --> 00:04:40,700
Paid a 70 year old hooker
To make out with me

21
00:04:42,617 --> 00:04:46,074
Now the get-high shack
is just a memory

22
00:04:48,491 --> 00:04:50,990
Downloading porn with Davo

23
00:04:50,991 --> 00:04:53,199
Downloading porn with Davo

24
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:55,658
Put a latch on the door
So Mama don't know

25
00:04:55,700 --> 00:04:58,866
That I'm downloading porn
With Davo

26
00:04:58,908 --> 00:05:00,533
- Perfect!
- Perfect!

27
00:05:05,866 --> 00:05:08,408
You guys wanna be
in a documentary?

28
00:05:08,450 --> 00:05:09,509
We're making a documentary.

29
00:05:09,533 --> 00:05:11,865
- Documentary that's... All right.
- Cool.

30
00:05:11,866 --> 00:05:13,157
It's a documentary
of the hallway.

31
00:05:13,158 --> 00:05:15,032
- Yeah.
- Great.

32
00:05:15,033 --> 00:05:16,115
How you doing?

33
00:05:16,116 --> 00:05:17,700
Hello. I'm your new neighbor.

34
00:05:17,741 --> 00:05:20,282
- You guys be our audience.
- We're singing songs.

35
00:05:20,283 --> 00:05:21,241
All right. Cool.

36
00:05:21,242 --> 00:05:22,616
- We're singing songs.
- Cool guys!

37
00:05:22,617 --> 00:05:26,200
- Who left you people alone tonight?
- That's what I wanna know.

38
00:05:27,366 --> 00:05:30,200
My parents thought of us
as a delusional experiment

39
00:05:30,241 --> 00:05:34,158
where we didn't know
how to play our instruments.

40
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:37,100
We came to New
York to try to prove

41
00:05:37,124 --> 00:05:38,824
we were a real band,

42
00:05:38,866 --> 00:05:40,908
The Moldy Peaches.

43
00:05:40,949 --> 00:05:43,116
Tonight, we're going
to a birthday party

44
00:05:43,158 --> 00:05:45,282
for the Queen
of fucking France.

45
00:05:45,283 --> 00:05:49,033
We just wanted to find
a place to play music.

46
00:05:49,074 --> 00:05:50,408
Hi!

47
00:05:50,908 --> 00:05:52,033
Hi.

48
00:05:52,658 --> 00:05:54,908
- Hi. Hi.
- Hi.

49
00:05:57,366 --> 00:05:59,948
The Lower East side
was more or less barren,

50
00:05:59,949 --> 00:06:02,325
delis and boarded up places.

51
00:06:02,366 --> 00:06:05,535
Most places we
found were sort of

52
00:06:05,559 --> 00:06:08,033
a more bougie club scene.

53
00:06:09,741 --> 00:06:13,450
We'd walk into these rooms
and be like, ""Oh, oops.""

54
00:06:14,158 --> 00:06:17,200
It felt like
all of that wild,

55
00:06:17,241 --> 00:06:21,490
weird eclecticness had
drained out of the city.

56
00:06:21,491 --> 00:06:23,604
I remember thinking maybe
New York isn't the kind

57
00:06:23,628 --> 00:06:24,324
of city anymore

58
00:06:24,325 --> 00:06:26,741
that produces iconic bands.

59
00:06:28,283 --> 00:06:32,575
Even MTV was filled
with super dry pop-rock.

60
00:06:33,949 --> 00:06:36,609
And the winner for best rock is

61
00:06:36,633 --> 00:06:37,741
The Offspring!

62
00:06:38,866 --> 00:06:41,199
Blink 182.-

63
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:42,617
Limp Bizkit, Rollin.

64
00:06:44,908 --> 00:06:47,866
Friday, 2:12 p.m.

65
00:06:48,866 --> 00:06:50,324
- Hey, Adam, what's up?
- It's...

66
00:06:50,325 --> 00:06:52,920
Somebody told me,
""You should check out""

67
00:06:52,944 --> 00:06:54,990
the open mic at Sidewalk Cafe,

68
00:06:54,991 --> 00:06:56,949
and that's where we found
the anti-folk scene.

69
00:06:56,991 --> 00:06:59,033
Yeah.

70
00:06:59,074 --> 00:07:00,824
This community
of musicians

71
00:07:00,866 --> 00:07:03,157
that didn't have
a place to play.

72
00:07:03,158 --> 00:07:04,240
Oh, yeah.

73
00:07:04,241 --> 00:07:10,575
There's a car traveling down
a lone Texas highway

74
00:07:11,949 --> 00:07:14,283
Rams into a giant back

75
00:07:16,408 --> 00:07:21,366
Spirit of the bat fills your
fragile eggshell mind

76
00:07:23,617 --> 00:07:24,866
Yeah

77
00:07:24,908 --> 00:07:27,283
Maybe we could fit in here.

78
00:07:33,575 --> 00:07:36,116
When the worlds
got you down

79
00:07:36,158 --> 00:07:38,657
Rainy Sundays, sunny town

80
00:07:38,658 --> 00:07:41,240
Tropicana, canned foods

81
00:07:41,241 --> 00:07:44,074
Botulism, damaged goods

82
00:07:44,116 --> 00:07:46,240
See the hipsters in the park

83
00:07:46,241 --> 00:07:48,949
Hair so styled,
clothes so dark

84
00:07:48,991 --> 00:07:51,200
Prefab molded hamburgers

85
00:07:51,241 --> 00:07:53,449
I don't want
a bite of yours

86
00:07:53,450 --> 00:07:58,158
These burgers are crazy

87
00:07:58,200 --> 00:08:02,700
These burgers are crazy

88
00:08:02,741 --> 00:08:06,074
Let's hear it
for The Moldy Peaches!

89
00:08:06,116 --> 00:08:09,116
We were
immediately embraced.

90
00:08:12,283 --> 00:08:14,116
Send the tip jar around.

91
00:08:14,158 --> 00:08:16,283
It became our home.

92
00:08:18,408 --> 00:08:20,325
This shy girl
called Karen

93
00:08:20,366 --> 00:08:23,199
lived across the street
from the Sidewalk Cafe.

94
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:25,970
She'd come down
to play these quiet

95
00:08:25,994 --> 00:08:27,781
acoustic guitar songs.

96
00:08:27,782 --> 00:08:30,159
I was grateful
playing at any venue

97
00:08:30,183 --> 00:08:31,365
in New York City,

98
00:08:31,366 --> 00:08:35,449
but it just wasn't
exciting me.

99
00:08:35,450 --> 00:08:38,662
I was skulking around
the music scene

100
00:08:38,686 --> 00:08:41,450
trying to sniff out some blood.

101
00:08:44,366 --> 00:08:47,112
The last big wave
of New York bands

102
00:08:47,136 --> 00:08:48,990
was a long time passed.

103
00:08:48,991 --> 00:08:51,074
I wanted something
explosive to happen

104
00:08:51,116 --> 00:08:53,617
without understanding
what that was.

105
00:08:59,366 --> 00:09:01,290
One day, me and Kimya were

106
00:09:01,314 --> 00:09:02,866
at our friend's party.

107
00:09:04,866 --> 00:09:07,949
This drunk guy called Julian
comes over...

108
00:09:08,782 --> 00:09:12,575
and he's in the bathroom doing
drugs with this young lady,

109
00:09:12,617 --> 00:09:14,366
he breaks the shower.

110
00:09:14,408 --> 00:09:17,007
Somebody said he
was a singer in a band

111
00:09:17,031 --> 00:09:18,325
called The Strokes.

112
00:09:18,366 --> 00:09:21,158
- This guy's crazy.
- I've gotta see this band.

113
00:10:04,949 --> 00:10:07,141
We're sitting here
with The Strokes live

114
00:10:07,165 --> 00:10:08,283
in WF Music Studios.

115
00:10:08,325 --> 00:10:10,200
You guys were hot last night.

116
00:10:10,241 --> 00:10:12,116
Scorching!-

117
00:10:13,617 --> 00:10:14,617
Yeah.

118
00:10:14,658 --> 00:10:17,032
Hey, Jules,
when did you guys start up?

119
00:10:17,033 --> 00:10:19,200
We started playing
New York a year ago.

120
00:10:19,241 --> 00:10:22,741
The last few months
we've been tearing stuff up.

121
00:10:25,074 --> 00:10:26,948
You're looking
pretty serious.

122
00:10:26,949 --> 00:10:29,741
I am serious, man,
I'm always serious.

123
00:10:30,533 --> 00:10:33,033
- Am I ever not serious?
- You're more serious...

124
00:10:33,074 --> 00:10:34,491
I don't know what's fuck...

125
00:10:35,824 --> 00:10:36,824
That felt good.

126
00:10:36,825 --> 00:10:38,741
Now it's my turn
to break the camera.

127
00:10:43,617 --> 00:10:45,200
The way I met this band,

128
00:10:45,241 --> 00:10:47,533
too many things
happened exactly right,

129
00:10:47,575 --> 00:10:50,908
that it seems so hard
for it to be just luck.

130
00:10:50,949 --> 00:10:54,781
Four, three, two! Oh, shit.

131
00:10:54,782 --> 00:10:56,782
- Hey, Julian.
- Oh, man.

132
00:10:59,575 --> 00:11:01,283
I ran into Julian
on the street

133
00:11:01,325 --> 00:11:03,292
seven years after I'd met him

134
00:11:03,316 --> 00:11:04,533
in boarding school.

135
00:11:07,241 --> 00:11:09,575
Then I met everyone.

136
00:11:10,033 --> 00:11:11,575
I just felt it.

137
00:11:12,158 --> 00:11:13,741
The closeness.

138
00:11:17,908 --> 00:11:19,741
We were like brothers.

139
00:11:22,782 --> 00:11:24,665
They were so tight and together,

140
00:11:24,689 --> 00:11:26,157
and are such good friends.

141
00:11:26,158 --> 00:11:28,765
It just feels like
the five of them

142
00:11:28,789 --> 00:11:30,240
make up one person.

143
00:11:30,241 --> 00:11:32,908
Just one solid person on stage.

144
00:11:35,575 --> 00:11:37,657
By now, most people
have heard of Y2K,

145
00:11:37,658 --> 00:11:40,582
the anagram shorthand
for the year 2000

146
00:11:40,606 --> 00:11:41,907
computer problem.

147
00:11:41,908 --> 00:11:43,301
Americans have proven
they can handle

148
00:11:43,325 --> 00:11:46,365
even the most devastating
natural disaster.

149
00:11:46,366 --> 00:11:49,948
But can we survive a man-made
technological meltdown?

150
00:11:49,949 --> 00:11:52,473
It's now time to
begin stockpiling

151
00:11:52,497 --> 00:11:54,407
essential survival items.

152
00:11:54,408 --> 00:11:56,948
Military meals,
gas masks to knives.

153
00:11:56,949 --> 00:11:58,468
When your kids are standing
there cold and hungry,

154
00:11:58,492 --> 00:11:58,990
and they come up

155
00:11:58,991 --> 00:12:01,248
to you and say,""Mommy,
Daddy, why didn't you get ready?

156
00:12:01,260 --> 00:12:02,551
""What are you gonna tell them?""

157
00:12:02,575 --> 00:12:04,575
With every tick
of the clock toward midnight

158
00:12:04,617 --> 00:12:07,605
in Times Square,
emergency officials are

159
00:12:07,629 --> 00:12:09,617
watching for Y2K problems.

160
00:12:11,116 --> 00:12:16,366
The dawning of a new millennium
now just minutes away.

161
00:12:16,949 --> 00:12:19,365
We celebrate the future.

162
00:12:19,366 --> 00:12:23,908
What will the story
of the 21st century be?

163
00:12:24,866 --> 00:12:31,033
Ten, nine, eight,
seven, six, five,

164
00:12:31,074 --> 00:12:35,241
four, three, two, one...

165
00:12:46,991 --> 00:12:49,782
From the City Command Center
at the World Trade Center,

166
00:12:49,824 --> 00:12:53,152
the Deputy Mayor Joseph
Lhota said computer systems

167
00:12:53,176 --> 00:12:54,366
have been checked.

168
00:12:54,408 --> 00:12:56,866
The city
is functioning normally.

169
00:13:03,533 --> 00:13:05,632
A friend of mine had a big crush

170
00:13:05,656 --> 00:13:06,700
on this guy Nick.

171
00:13:08,450 --> 00:13:10,964
She dragged me to the Mars Bar

172
00:13:10,988 --> 00:13:12,408
where he hung out.

173
00:13:13,241 --> 00:13:17,241
I felt this very visceral
reaction towards him.

174
00:13:17,283 --> 00:13:21,575
I needed to be connected
to this person.

175
00:13:21,617 --> 00:13:23,365
She talked
like a valley girl

176
00:13:23,366 --> 00:13:25,324
but said that
she was from Jersey.

177
00:13:25,325 --> 00:13:27,617
Every other word was ""dude"".

178
00:13:29,033 --> 00:13:31,575
I'd never met
anybody like that.

179
00:13:34,408 --> 00:13:35,866
When you're young
and in New York

180
00:13:35,908 --> 00:13:37,532
and you find
like-minded people,

181
00:13:37,533 --> 00:13:41,283
you just end up doing
things together every night.

182
00:13:42,074 --> 00:13:45,408
Karen played me songs
that she had written.

183
00:13:46,908 --> 00:13:50,617
I was just completely
blown away.

184
00:13:50,658 --> 00:13:54,990
I may be dead, honey

185
00:13:54,991 --> 00:13:59,741
But I was left with my eyes

186
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:06,699
And underneath, sugar

187
00:14:06,700 --> 00:14:11,157
Well, I've been sunk
by your lies...

188
00:14:11,158 --> 00:14:12,908
One night, Karen said,

189
00:14:12,949 --> 00:14:16,366
- ""- Trust me.
- We should start a rock band.""

190
00:14:18,241 --> 00:14:21,949
We're the Yeah Yeah Yeahs,
and, um...

191
00:14:21,991 --> 00:14:27,741
we're from New York City,
Brooklyn, and, um...

192
00:14:29,241 --> 00:14:30,575
We, uh...

193
00:14:33,283 --> 00:14:34,407
We've, um...

194
00:14:34,408 --> 00:14:36,949
Do you wanna continue?-

195
00:14:36,991 --> 00:14:39,157
In one night,
we wrote six songs.

196
00:14:39,158 --> 00:14:41,615
We were bragging about
how amazing we were

197
00:14:41,639 --> 00:14:42,450
to our friend

198
00:14:42,491 --> 00:14:45,033
who was The White Stripes
booking agent.

199
00:14:45,074 --> 00:14:49,700
He called our bluff
and offered us the opening slot

200
00:14:49,741 --> 00:14:52,866
for The White Stripes show
in the Mercury Lounge.

201
00:14:53,949 --> 00:14:55,490
Karen was really insistent

202
00:14:55,491 --> 00:14:58,908
that we get her friend
Brian to play drums.

203
00:15:01,782 --> 00:15:03,366
I was really nervous,

204
00:15:03,408 --> 00:15:05,657
and I had
four margaritas lined up.

205
00:15:05,658 --> 00:15:07,991
Knocking one back
after the other.

206
00:15:51,241 --> 00:15:53,575
Something was
completely unleashed,

207
00:15:54,658 --> 00:15:55,908
I was shocked.

208
00:16:02,116 --> 00:16:06,158
I grew up in New Jersey,
very shy,

209
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:08,449
half Korean, half white.

210
00:16:08,450 --> 00:16:10,699
And when you're a halfie,
you don't feel like the whites,

211
00:16:10,700 --> 00:16:13,074
you don't fit in
with the Koreans.

212
00:16:14,116 --> 00:16:16,908
I was just used
to being on the outside.

213
00:16:19,158 --> 00:16:22,533
But on stage,
I was free of that feeling.

214
00:16:23,617 --> 00:16:26,615
Once I'd had tasted that,
I just wanted

215
00:16:26,639 --> 00:16:28,450
to lose myself in that.

216
00:16:32,366 --> 00:16:35,365
- You guys should get a manager, you know.
- Do you guys have a manager?

217
00:16:35,366 --> 00:16:36,821
He's over there,
you should point the camera...

218
00:16:36,845 --> 00:16:37,407
It's Ryan Gentles.

219
00:16:37,408 --> 00:16:41,449
That's not a manager,
that's, like, a cute little kid.

220
00:16:41,450 --> 00:16:44,074
The first time
I saw The Strokes,

221
00:16:44,116 --> 00:16:48,283
I was watching a band
that just was born a band.

222
00:16:49,741 --> 00:16:52,200
I was the booker
at the Mercury Lounge,

223
00:16:52,241 --> 00:16:55,741
the best club for local bands
in New York City.

224
00:16:55,782 --> 00:16:58,158
I booked them immediately.

225
00:16:58,200 --> 00:17:00,450
We're live here
with The Strokes.

226
00:17:00,491 --> 00:17:03,115
I know you guys
are really hot.

227
00:17:03,116 --> 00:17:05,407
They've been playing
every Wednesday night

228
00:17:05,408 --> 00:17:07,407
in December
at the Mercury Lounge.

229
00:17:07,408 --> 00:17:09,479
Hello, yeah, we're The Strokes

230
00:17:09,503 --> 00:17:11,575
and we're from New York City.

231
00:17:13,074 --> 00:17:14,241
You just felt it.

232
00:17:14,283 --> 00:17:17,700
The audience was excited
that we existed.

233
00:17:19,658 --> 00:17:21,700
Me and Kimya
opened for The Strokes.

234
00:17:21,741 --> 00:17:23,539
The first week,
we also played with

235
00:17:23,563 --> 00:17:24,616
the Yeah Yeah Yeahs.

236
00:17:24,617 --> 00:17:28,260
So, it was The Moldy Peaches,
the Yeah Yeah Yeahs

237
00:17:28,284 --> 00:17:29,491
and The Strokes.

238
00:17:29,533 --> 00:17:33,450
More people
crammed in each week.

239
00:17:33,491 --> 00:17:36,074
There was a hysteria
in the audience.

240
00:17:36,116 --> 00:17:39,450
These guys were like sex gods.

241
00:17:39,491 --> 00:17:43,658
Suddenly, there were
bands everywhere in New York.-

242
00:17:48,116 --> 00:17:50,408
The Strokes
launched a fireball.

243
00:17:50,949 --> 00:17:55,283
New York City
is like a graveyard

244
00:17:55,325 --> 00:17:58,033
It all happened so fast.

245
00:17:58,074 --> 00:18:02,408
All the corpses like
the way I play my guitar

246
00:18:03,241 --> 00:18:05,158
Totally DIY.

247
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:08,490
You gotta be cute
if you wanna get far...

248
00:18:08,491 --> 00:18:11,691
Zero interest from record labels

249
00:18:11,715 --> 00:18:12,908
or magazines.

250
00:18:12,949 --> 00:18:16,782
New York City
is like a graveyard

251
00:18:20,575 --> 00:18:24,283
All the tombstones
sky scrapin'

252
00:18:27,949 --> 00:18:31,575
All the rock stars
double dating

253
00:18:40,908 --> 00:18:42,575
We got it

254
00:18:52,782 --> 00:18:57,408
Blue eyes last forever

255
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:03,908
Real light it never fades

256
00:19:06,033 --> 00:19:11,617
Real life is a gamble

257
00:19:12,908 --> 00:19:14,033
Pardon me?

258
00:19:15,824 --> 00:19:18,407
So don't give your ace

259
00:19:18,408 --> 00:19:20,825
I desperately
wanted to participate

260
00:19:20,849 --> 00:19:21,908
in the scene...

261
00:19:24,617 --> 00:19:27,200
But I'm working
at Yeshiva University

262
00:19:27,241 --> 00:19:30,699
in the admissions office
stuffing envelopes...

263
00:19:30,700 --> 00:19:32,888
Knowing there's
five dudes out there

264
00:19:32,912 --> 00:19:34,283
that are cool as fuck,

265
00:19:34,325 --> 00:19:36,490
writing insanely awesome music

266
00:19:36,491 --> 00:19:39,700
and they are cooler
and better than you are.

267
00:19:40,575 --> 00:19:44,908
I was also the singer
in a band called Interpol.

268
00:19:47,325 --> 00:19:51,183
We sent our demos to
every single record label

269
00:19:51,207 --> 00:19:52,657
I could think of.

270
00:19:52,658 --> 00:19:55,741
No record label
showed any interest at all.

271
00:19:57,158 --> 00:20:00,157
It was like all of those
guidance counselor meetings

272
00:20:00,158 --> 00:20:02,073
where they're, like,
""What do you wanna do?""

273
00:20:02,074 --> 00:20:04,033
And I said,
""I wanna be a rock star,""

274
00:20:04,074 --> 00:20:06,575
and they said,
""Don't be a jackass.""

275
00:20:10,283 --> 00:20:13,741
I was experiencing
very deep depression.

276
00:20:14,450 --> 00:20:16,475
I felt like I was slipping

277
00:20:16,499 --> 00:20:17,741
out of existence.

278
00:20:26,366 --> 00:20:31,074
Surprise sometime

279
00:20:31,741 --> 00:20:34,074
Will come around

280
00:20:37,491 --> 00:20:42,741
I will surprise you sometime

281
00:20:43,700 --> 00:20:46,074
I'll come around

282
00:20:49,491 --> 00:20:54,949
I will surprise you sometime

283
00:20:55,617 --> 00:20:58,366
I'll come around

284
00:20:58,408 --> 00:21:01,575
When you're down

285
00:21:23,741 --> 00:21:25,074
Get in the fucking van!

286
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:28,241
Hello, The Strokes!

287
00:21:29,366 --> 00:21:30,948
I sent The Strokes' demo

288
00:21:30,949 --> 00:21:33,283
to everyone I could think of
in the industry saying,

289
00:21:33,325 --> 00:21:35,250
""This is the best unsigned band

290
00:21:35,274 --> 00:21:36,324
in New York City.""

291
00:21:36,325 --> 00:21:40,490
Geoff Travis at Rough Trade
called the day he received it.

292
00:21:40,491 --> 00:21:43,697
He said, ""I wanna sign this
and fly the band to England

293
00:21:43,721 --> 00:21:44,782
for a tour.""

294
00:21:44,824 --> 00:21:46,658
It was insane!

295
00:21:46,700 --> 00:21:51,658
- It seems so weird.
- We're going to England to play music.

296
00:21:51,700 --> 00:21:52,865
Let's go to England!

297
00:21:52,866 --> 00:21:54,365
Oh...

298
00:21:54,366 --> 00:21:55,717
You don't wanna
get too carried away.

299
00:21:55,741 --> 00:21:58,908
I'm, like, I'm trying
to like just hang with it.

300
00:22:11,283 --> 00:22:12,575
Pretty exciting.

301
00:22:28,782 --> 00:22:30,741
American tourist in England.

302
00:22:33,741 --> 00:22:34,908
Fuck.

303
00:22:35,700 --> 00:22:39,908
Me and Kimya went on tour
opening for The Strokes.

304
00:22:39,949 --> 00:22:42,590
We would always
joke around and be like,

305
00:22:42,614 --> 00:22:44,575
""We're The Strokes fluffers.""

306
00:22:50,074 --> 00:22:52,283
Take your passion

307
00:22:53,617 --> 00:22:56,700
And make it happen

308
00:22:57,700 --> 00:23:02,116
You can come alive
you can dance right through...

309
00:23:02,158 --> 00:23:04,700
I was quite
a bit older and sober.

310
00:23:04,741 --> 00:23:07,166
I would say to those guys,
""Are you sure""

311
00:23:07,190 --> 00:23:08,491
you wanna get wasted?

312
00:23:08,533 --> 00:23:12,700
""You don't wanna remember
how cool this is?""

313
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:16,115
- We're ready, right team?
- Go team.

314
00:23:16,116 --> 00:23:19,741
- Go team. All right.
- Yay.

315
00:23:19,782 --> 00:23:21,116
Strokes, hello.

316
00:23:21,158 --> 00:23:22,283
- Hello.
- Hi.

317
00:23:22,325 --> 00:23:23,700
- Hello.
- - I think, first off,

318
00:23:23,741 --> 00:23:26,114
because you're
unknown in the U.K.,

319
00:23:26,138 --> 00:23:27,949
just introduce yourselves.

320
00:23:31,116 --> 00:23:33,700
Julian.-

321
00:23:34,617 --> 00:23:38,740
Julian was dealing
with a lot of nervousness.

322
00:23:38,741 --> 00:23:43,199
- I was, like, ""How is he scared?
- He's so good.""

323
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:46,283
But he wrote
all of the songs.

324
00:23:46,325 --> 00:23:50,658
His nervousness came out
of that perfectionism.

325
00:24:20,617 --> 00:24:27,366
Last night she said
Oh, baby, don't feel so down

326
00:24:27,408 --> 00:24:32,617
Oh, it turns me off
when I feel left out

327
00:24:32,658 --> 00:24:34,699
So I

328
00:24:34,700 --> 00:24:36,200
I turn around

329
00:24:36,241 --> 00:24:39,617
Oh, baby
gonna be all right

330
00:24:39,658 --> 00:24:41,740
It was a great big lie

331
00:24:41,741 --> 00:24:44,741
'Cause I left
that night, yeah

332
00:25:02,617 --> 00:25:06,658
Oh, people
They don't understand

333
00:25:06,700 --> 00:25:11,116
No, girlfriends
They don't understand

334
00:25:18,408 --> 00:25:20,866
Not before coming here. No.

335
00:25:20,908 --> 00:25:22,325
Oh, it's just so weird.

336
00:25:22,366 --> 00:25:24,176
I don't even know what's
going on right now, man.

337
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:25,700
I'm just, you know,
it's all...

338
00:25:25,741 --> 00:25:31,074
It's all crazy and cool
and bizarre and... you know.

339
00:25:49,700 --> 00:25:52,033
- What's going on?
- - You gotta get off here, please.

340
00:25:52,074 --> 00:25:54,200
Keep going. Keep going.

341
00:25:58,116 --> 00:25:59,700
Holy shit.

342
00:26:04,074 --> 00:26:05,575
Holy shit.

343
00:26:07,033 --> 00:26:08,533
Please, please.

344
00:26:14,116 --> 00:26:15,866
Holy shit!

345
00:26:21,325 --> 00:26:24,074
- Get up! Get up!
- Get up! Get up! Get up!

346
00:26:35,033 --> 00:26:37,700
- Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
- What?

347
00:26:44,450 --> 00:26:47,200
Mayor Giuliani, I wonder
if you could give us an update?

348
00:26:47,241 --> 00:26:48,823
Well,
the first thing I'd like to do

349
00:26:48,824 --> 00:26:50,896
is take this opportunity
to tell everyone

350
00:26:50,920 --> 00:26:52,366
to evacuate Lower Manhattan.

351
00:26:53,533 --> 00:26:56,074
Mayor Giuliani,
do you have any sense

352
00:26:56,116 --> 00:26:59,575
of the order of magnitude
of injuries and deaths?

353
00:26:59,617 --> 00:27:02,700
I do not, except to say
that it's horrendous.

354
00:27:36,700 --> 00:27:38,200
When the buildings fell,

355
00:27:38,241 --> 00:27:41,816
my impression was clearly
there won't have been

356
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:43,700
people in that building.

357
00:27:45,408 --> 00:27:49,866
We walked in the ashy streets
picking up papers.

358
00:27:56,200 --> 00:27:58,259
Once they said on the radio,
""You should go to the hospitals

359
00:27:58,283 --> 00:28:01,948
""and try and give blood,""
it started to dawn on me.

360
00:28:01,949 --> 00:28:03,866
Thousands have lost their life.

361
00:28:04,283 --> 00:28:06,408
It's 1-800-GIVE-LIFE.

362
00:28:07,575 --> 00:28:08,700
For blood.

363
00:28:10,408 --> 00:28:11,575
You can call up to give...

364
00:28:11,617 --> 00:28:16,700
I remember feeling
how fragile life actually is.

365
00:28:21,074 --> 00:28:24,741
There's anthrax
in the envelope

366
00:28:24,782 --> 00:28:27,241
I opened in my dream

367
00:28:27,283 --> 00:28:29,616
Dream the sky is red

368
00:28:29,617 --> 00:28:34,282
And little kids are running
screaming in the street

369
00:28:34,283 --> 00:28:37,658
I try to run and save them

370
00:28:37,700 --> 00:28:40,824
But I have molasses feet

371
00:28:40,866 --> 00:28:46,283
I keep having nightmares
and I'm scared to go to sleep

372
00:28:46,325 --> 00:28:50,115
In Montreal I got so mad

373
00:28:50,116 --> 00:28:53,073
Someone broke into the van

374
00:28:53,074 --> 00:28:57,866
Stole my guitar
and Aaron's bag

375
00:28:59,325 --> 00:29:05,324
Then we turned on CNN
watched the towers fall again

376
00:29:05,325 --> 00:29:10,074
Realized that our lives
aren't so bad

377
00:29:11,408 --> 00:29:18,200
The air is filled
with computers and carpets

378
00:29:18,241 --> 00:29:24,408
Skin and bones and telephones
and file cabinets

379
00:29:24,450 --> 00:29:30,325
Coke machines, firemen
Landing here and cement

380
00:29:30,366 --> 00:29:36,908
They say that it's okay
but I say don't breathe in

381
00:29:43,908 --> 00:29:46,408
I was grieving for my city.

382
00:29:48,366 --> 00:29:50,408
I felt deep trauma.

383
00:29:51,366 --> 00:29:55,491
But when I perform,
I could be somewhere else.

384
00:29:55,533 --> 00:29:58,365
Almost, you know,
like a split personality.

385
00:29:58,366 --> 00:30:01,991
You're pretty
You're pretty

386
00:30:02,033 --> 00:30:05,325
You make we wanna
ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh

387
00:30:05,366 --> 00:30:08,491
You make we wanna
ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh

388
00:30:08,533 --> 00:30:11,991
You make we wanna
ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh

389
00:30:12,033 --> 00:30:15,949
You make we wanna
ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh

390
00:30:15,991 --> 00:30:17,575
Hey, hey

391
00:30:19,700 --> 00:30:22,218
Fear and anxiety have
become a very real

392
00:30:22,242 --> 00:30:23,658
part of American life.

393
00:30:23,700 --> 00:30:26,946
This, of course is Halloween,
a day when fright

394
00:30:26,970 --> 00:30:28,658
is manufactured for fun.

395
00:30:28,700 --> 00:30:31,866
You make we wanna
ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh

396
00:30:31,908 --> 00:30:35,407
You make we wanna
ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh

397
00:30:35,408 --> 00:30:36,866
You look like shit

398
00:30:38,366 --> 00:30:42,157
You take your time
You take your time

399
00:30:42,158 --> 00:30:44,074
You take it

400
00:30:45,866 --> 00:30:47,074
T-T-T-Time

401
00:31:01,658 --> 00:31:05,032
You take your time
You take your time

402
00:31:05,033 --> 00:31:06,450
You take it

403
00:31:12,074 --> 00:31:13,491
At Fort Campbell,
Kentucky, today,

404
00:31:13,533 --> 00:31:16,449
President Bush rallied
the army's 101st Airborne

405
00:31:16,450 --> 00:31:18,085
heading off to support the war

406
00:31:18,109 --> 00:31:18,866
in Afghanistan,

407
00:31:18,908 --> 00:31:22,928
and carved up a turkey,
right along with Osama Bin Laden

408
00:31:22,952 --> 00:31:24,700
and his Al-Qaeda forces.

409
00:31:24,741 --> 00:31:28,617
We will never tire,
and we will hunt them down!

410
00:31:29,617 --> 00:31:32,824
A grim task of trying to find
remains of those killed.

411
00:31:32,866 --> 00:31:33,990
Anxiety and fear...

412
00:31:33,991 --> 00:31:35,240
Terrorist training camp...

413
00:31:35,241 --> 00:31:36,490
Cruise missiles...

414
00:31:36,491 --> 00:31:38,032
- Holy war...
- Mass murder...

415
00:31:38,033 --> 00:31:39,658
Casualties-
MALE REPORTER 5: Taliban-

416
00:31:39,700 --> 00:31:40,908
- Airstrike...
- Terrorists...

417
00:31:40,949 --> 00:31:41,949
Destroyed.

418
00:31:47,366 --> 00:31:50,741
New York felt
really claustrophobic.

419
00:31:51,575 --> 00:31:53,450
So much paranoia.

420
00:31:54,074 --> 00:31:56,908
Everyone's confused and scared.

421
00:32:05,533 --> 00:32:08,241
The artists and musicians
moved in droves

422
00:32:08,283 --> 00:32:11,617
out of Manhattan
across to Williamsburg.

423
00:32:13,450 --> 00:32:15,408
A lot of people
quit their jobs,

424
00:32:15,450 --> 00:32:17,945
and just were like,
""Fuck it, I'm gonna

425
00:32:17,969 --> 00:32:19,408
play music full-time.""

426
00:32:19,450 --> 00:32:22,563
The rent was so cheap
that you could afford

427
00:32:22,587 --> 00:32:23,617
to take risks.

428
00:32:24,450 --> 00:32:27,074
You could fail
and it didn't matter.

429
00:32:28,782 --> 00:32:31,195
There is a big
difference between

430
00:32:31,219 --> 00:32:32,949
Brooklyn and Manhattan.

431
00:32:32,991 --> 00:32:36,575
Brooklyn was about
potential and freedom.

432
00:32:38,241 --> 00:32:40,659
Abandoned buildings
and warehouses

433
00:32:40,683 --> 00:32:42,365
became practice spaces.

434
00:32:42,366 --> 00:32:46,074
Outside of public attention
and expectation.

435
00:32:47,366 --> 00:32:49,449
That's what nurtured us.

436
00:32:49,450 --> 00:32:52,866
We could all be weirdos
in the best way possible.

437
00:32:54,033 --> 00:32:56,282
The main bands were
the Yeah Yeah Yeahs, Onida,

438
00:32:56,283 --> 00:32:59,575
and Sightings,
Liars, and TV On The Radio.

439
00:32:59,617 --> 00:33:02,386
This is an excuse for us
to hang out with our friends

440
00:33:02,410 --> 00:33:03,325
and...

441
00:33:03,366 --> 00:33:06,491
- Blah, blah, blah, blah.
- Blah, blah, blah, blah.

442
00:33:06,533 --> 00:33:07,658
Yeah, this guy.

443
00:33:07,700 --> 00:33:09,908
Come and bust our balls
during an interview, man.

444
00:33:09,949 --> 00:33:12,532
He said, ""Can you play drums?""
""Yeah, maybe.""

445
00:33:12,533 --> 00:33:13,866
Whatever drummer...

446
00:33:13,908 --> 00:33:15,408
Whatever, drummer.

447
00:33:17,033 --> 00:33:18,824
What brought
TV On The Radio together

448
00:33:18,866 --> 00:33:20,782
is the fact that
we're all nerds.

449
00:33:22,658 --> 00:33:26,533
I'm not a very social person,
I don't go out.

450
00:33:27,283 --> 00:33:28,876
When I became
friends with Tunde,

451
00:33:28,900 --> 00:33:29,490
he was like,

452
00:33:29,491 --> 00:33:32,073
""You have no clothes
and no furniture,""

453
00:33:32,074 --> 00:33:33,574
""but you have pain
and drum machines.""

454
00:33:33,575 --> 00:33:36,074
I was, like, ""Yeah,
that's kind of the vibe.""

455
00:33:37,116 --> 00:33:39,990
I always
wanted to make music.

456
00:33:39,991 --> 00:33:43,158
When you're the offspring
of immigrants, and you say,

457
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:45,781
""I wanna be an artist,""
you might as well say,

458
00:33:45,782 --> 00:33:48,376
""Thanks for all of this
but I'm gonna put on

459
00:33:48,400 --> 00:33:49,782
a pair of clown shoes.""

460
00:33:51,575 --> 00:33:55,617
But I've gotta get whatever
energy that's in me out.

461
00:33:59,575 --> 00:34:03,074
Writing music
felt like a prayer.

462
00:34:13,824 --> 00:34:18,033
Your ooh

463
00:34:18,991 --> 00:34:21,700
Slim frame

464
00:34:23,824 --> 00:34:28,617
Your eager eyes

465
00:34:29,033 --> 00:34:31,908
Your wild mane

466
00:34:34,366 --> 00:34:38,575
So they keep me

467
00:34:39,366 --> 00:34:41,908
Where I belong

468
00:34:48,283 --> 00:34:52,283
I'm strung out in song

469
00:34:54,866 --> 00:34:59,823
Oh, I will be your accident

470
00:34:59,824 --> 00:35:04,450
If you will be my ambulance

471
00:35:04,491 --> 00:35:09,908
So I will be
your screech and crash

472
00:35:09,949 --> 00:35:15,073
If you will be
my crutch and cast

473
00:35:15,074 --> 00:35:20,074
And I will be
your one more time

474
00:35:20,116 --> 00:35:25,365
If you will be
my one last chance

475
00:35:25,366 --> 00:35:31,908
Oh, sweet tree fall for me

476
00:35:40,366 --> 00:35:41,658
Julian of The Strokes,

477
00:35:41,700 --> 00:35:43,170
there is an element
of make believe,

478
00:35:43,194 --> 00:35:44,325
isn't there, in the band...

479
00:35:44,366 --> 00:35:46,533
There's an element of
make believe, isn't there?

480
00:35:46,575 --> 00:35:50,074
Swiss schools,
elite modeling agency?

481
00:35:50,866 --> 00:35:52,325
- Yes.
- Lee? What...

482
00:35:52,366 --> 00:35:54,103
There's an element of
make believe in the band.

483
00:35:54,115 --> 00:35:54,884
That's pretty cool.

484
00:35:54,908 --> 00:35:56,408
Meeting at Swiss schools,
that's cool.

485
00:35:56,450 --> 00:35:58,949
That's like realistic,
it's not make believe,

486
00:35:58,991 --> 00:36:01,157
it's not pretend,
it's not fiction.

487
00:36:01,158 --> 00:36:03,157
It's true to life.

488
00:36:03,158 --> 00:36:04,800
I think that's really cool
though, like Swiss.

489
00:36:04,824 --> 00:36:07,366
I've never been to a place
they call Swiss,

490
00:36:07,408 --> 00:36:09,073
but you guys have,
and you met there,

491
00:36:09,074 --> 00:36:10,699
and your dad is, like,
John Casablancas.

492
00:36:10,700 --> 00:36:13,108
That's pretty cool and
I think he's in some

493
00:36:13,132 --> 00:36:14,157
hot water now, eh?

494
00:36:14,158 --> 00:36:17,033
I don't know. I think...

495
00:36:17,074 --> 00:36:18,365
I don't know, it's weird.

496
00:36:18,366 --> 00:36:21,048
I live with my mom,
you know, they divorced

497
00:36:21,072 --> 00:36:22,408
when I was young, so.

498
00:36:22,450 --> 00:36:25,408
I think just... I think life felt
a little more normal.

499
00:36:25,450 --> 00:36:28,157
- That was the weirdest part.
- That was the weirdest stage of my life.

500
00:36:28,158 --> 00:36:29,991
And it's my great pleasure
to introduce to you

501
00:36:30,033 --> 00:36:32,365
the President
of the Elite Modeling Agency,

502
00:36:32,366 --> 00:36:34,908
Mr. John Casablancas.-

503
00:36:52,658 --> 00:36:56,282
Julian wasn't really
comfortable with fame.

504
00:36:56,283 --> 00:36:59,276
He was always talking
about how he wanted

505
00:36:59,300 --> 00:37:01,241
to make underground music.

506
00:37:01,283 --> 00:37:03,782
But he also wanted
the music to be popular.

507
00:37:05,908 --> 00:37:08,575
He had this tension
inside of him.

508
00:38:56,949 --> 00:39:01,283
So, we're in the U.K.

509
00:39:02,991 --> 00:39:04,741
I have to say...

510
00:39:05,533 --> 00:39:10,116
It's a party in the U.K.,
I have to say.

511
00:39:10,158 --> 00:39:11,575
You rock.

512
00:39:12,617 --> 00:39:16,700
What's more important, Dave,
a good sound or a good time?

513
00:39:19,658 --> 00:39:22,532
- A good time.
- Yeah, I agree, do you agree?

514
00:39:22,533 --> 00:39:24,866
Sounding good
having a good time.

515
00:39:24,908 --> 00:39:26,491
Every woman fronting a band

516
00:39:26,533 --> 00:39:30,904
in, like,
the 30 years before me were pioneers

517
00:39:30,928 --> 00:39:33,449
and I felt like a pioneer.

518
00:39:33,450 --> 00:39:36,299
For men in rock,
there's a fucking code,

519
00:39:36,323 --> 00:39:38,365
there's a way you do things.

520
00:39:38,366 --> 00:39:41,157
I just realized for me,
there's no code.

521
00:39:41,158 --> 00:39:44,033
I could do whatever
I wanted to do up there.

522
00:39:44,074 --> 00:39:45,866
I didn't give a fuck.

523
00:39:48,658 --> 00:39:50,408
Oh, I'm rich

524
00:39:52,200 --> 00:39:54,366
Like a hot noise

525
00:39:55,241 --> 00:39:58,033
Rich, rich, rich

526
00:39:58,908 --> 00:40:01,408
I'll take you out, boy

527
00:40:02,158 --> 00:40:04,074
So stuck up

528
00:40:05,991 --> 00:40:08,575
I wish you'd stick it to me

529
00:40:09,408 --> 00:40:11,908
Flesh ripped off

530
00:40:24,033 --> 00:40:25,366
Ha

531
00:40:30,074 --> 00:40:31,700
Ah

532
00:40:39,741 --> 00:40:42,823
Turn it beating no beat

533
00:40:42,824 --> 00:40:45,157
The walls are
always speaking

534
00:40:45,158 --> 00:40:49,949
No want, no want
No want no speaking at all

535
00:40:53,033 --> 00:40:56,032
On the very
first night in the U.K...

536
00:40:56,033 --> 00:40:58,533
it was pandemonium.

537
00:40:58,575 --> 00:41:00,584
Every club that we would play

538
00:41:00,608 --> 00:41:01,781
would be sold out.

539
00:41:01,782 --> 00:41:04,533
People knew
our songs word-for-word.

540
00:41:04,866 --> 00:41:06,575
It was super crazy.

541
00:41:06,617 --> 00:41:09,158
- $5...
- - Which shirt do you want?

542
00:41:09,200 --> 00:41:13,407
- This one is the last one.
- Let me, uh, sign it for you.

543
00:41:13,408 --> 00:41:16,325
- Hope you had a good time tonight?
- - It was fandabidozi.

544
00:41:16,366 --> 00:41:18,650
All the magazines are saying you

545
00:41:18,674 --> 00:41:20,241
are the best band ever.

546
00:41:23,908 --> 00:41:27,199
Right. You are fantastic.

547
00:41:27,200 --> 00:41:29,865
Those are, uh,
those are big words.

548
00:41:29,866 --> 00:41:31,741
They're fucking right though.

549
00:41:32,866 --> 00:41:34,365
It was extremely exciting,

550
00:41:34,366 --> 00:41:38,782
and we were all so drunk
on that ravenous fanaticism.

551
00:41:40,241 --> 00:41:41,491
- Funny.
- What's that?

552
00:41:41,533 --> 00:41:43,708
- Where's Brian?
We need Brian to sign it.

553
00:41:43,732 --> 00:41:44,732
Oh, oh, oh.

554
00:41:45,283 --> 00:41:48,199
- Brian, you wanna sign this?
- Is Brian back there?

555
00:41:48,200 --> 00:41:52,908
- Write an essay on my shirt.
- I am girl.

556
00:41:54,325 --> 00:41:57,949
I know this band's the future.

557
00:42:07,074 --> 00:42:10,990
My name's Carlos, uh,
Carlos D. Uh...

558
00:42:10,991 --> 00:42:12,741
I play bass in Interpol.

559
00:42:23,658 --> 00:42:27,677
So, we pooled all of our money
together and forced this tour of the U.

560
00:42:27,689 --> 00:42:29,033
K.

561
00:42:32,658 --> 00:42:34,781
I'd never been to England.

562
00:42:34,782 --> 00:42:36,450
This is where
The Smiths are from.

563
00:42:36,491 --> 00:42:39,408
This is where New Order
is from.

564
00:42:40,158 --> 00:42:42,033
I was on fire.

565
00:42:48,325 --> 00:42:50,824
Somehow,
we got booked to play this,

566
00:42:50,866 --> 00:42:54,074
like, little festival
called Crucifest.

567
00:43:05,782 --> 00:43:08,818
Next, we're booked in Manchester

568
00:43:08,842 --> 00:43:10,450
on fucking Easter.

569
00:43:10,491 --> 00:43:14,366
You don't play at Uni town
on a holiday.

570
00:43:14,408 --> 00:43:17,074
There was, like,
five people there.

571
00:43:19,991 --> 00:43:23,575
Oh, you know what,
it's not on.

572
00:43:25,575 --> 00:43:27,021
Every person that we met said,

573
00:43:27,045 --> 00:43:28,200
""Do you know The Strokes?""

574
00:43:28,241 --> 00:43:29,908
""Are you friends
with The Strokes?""

575
00:43:32,866 --> 00:43:39,408
She says it helps
with the lights out

576
00:43:41,158 --> 00:43:47,700
Her rabid glow
is like braille to the night

577
00:43:49,991 --> 00:43:56,866
She swears
I'm a slave to the details

578
00:43:57,741 --> 00:44:01,823
But if your life
is such a big fuckin' joke

579
00:44:01,824 --> 00:44:04,283
Why should I care?

580
00:44:05,617 --> 00:44:09,033
- No one knew who we were.
- We shouldn't have been there.

581
00:44:14,116 --> 00:44:15,908
Where do we go from here?

582
00:45:07,741 --> 00:45:10,450
The year after 9/11,

583
00:45:10,491 --> 00:45:13,066
the Parking Lot Show
was a manifestation

584
00:45:13,090 --> 00:45:14,073
of appreciation

585
00:45:14,074 --> 00:45:17,490
and love
for the Brooklyn Community.

586
00:45:17,491 --> 00:45:19,800
A real assembly of the best

587
00:45:19,824 --> 00:45:21,617
of the Brooklyn bands.

588
00:45:22,241 --> 00:45:24,908
Liars played just before us.

589
00:45:30,116 --> 00:45:36,533
That child...

590
00:45:40,074 --> 00:45:43,657
Oh

591
00:45:43,658 --> 00:45:47,074
That child...

592
00:45:47,116 --> 00:45:50,116
That child throws...

593
00:45:50,158 --> 00:45:52,948
Just throw it out
Just throw it out

594
00:45:52,949 --> 00:45:55,700
Just throw it out

595
00:46:07,158 --> 00:46:08,450
There he is!

596
00:46:09,158 --> 00:46:10,907
There he is!

597
00:46:10,908 --> 00:46:12,575
And next!-

598
00:46:16,450 --> 00:46:17,740
There have been
times in my life

599
00:46:17,741 --> 00:46:20,366
where I really wanted
to fit in and I just didn't.

600
00:46:25,533 --> 00:46:30,575
But you could feel
the love from the community.

601
00:46:37,450 --> 00:46:40,408
It was just like
a current flowing through me.

602
00:46:44,408 --> 00:46:49,240
It's our time
Our time, our time

603
00:46:49,241 --> 00:46:53,074
It's our time
Our time, it's our time

604
00:46:53,116 --> 00:46:56,490
To be hated, all right

605
00:46:56,491 --> 00:47:01,033
Well, it's the year
to be hated, all right

606
00:47:01,074 --> 00:47:05,449
You know it's the year
to be hated, all right

607
00:47:05,450 --> 00:47:10,700
It's the year
to be hated, all right

608
00:47:11,200 --> 00:47:14,617
It's the year to be hated

609
00:47:29,617 --> 00:47:31,291
All the stuff we
were hearing about

610
00:47:31,315 --> 00:47:32,741
what was going on in Brooklyn

611
00:47:32,782 --> 00:47:34,741
and we were in Manhattan.

612
00:47:35,450 --> 00:47:39,074
I was never really
part of any scene.

613
00:47:39,116 --> 00:47:42,283
I'd been recording bands
for years.

614
00:47:42,325 --> 00:47:45,575
I had engineered some
perfectly engineered records,

615
00:47:46,283 --> 00:47:48,866
but people
didn't really hire me.

616
00:47:58,457 --> 00:47:59,624
Loads of crap.

617
00:48:01,116 --> 00:48:04,282
Suddenly this big named
Irish techno DJ

618
00:48:04,283 --> 00:48:07,366
- shows up in New York to make a record.
- And that's David Holmes.

619
00:48:12,366 --> 00:48:16,283
When I was DJ,
I was Iggy Pop.

620
00:48:16,325 --> 00:48:18,074
Just living it.

621
00:48:20,719 --> 00:48:22,121
David didn't seem
to know how to play

622
00:48:22,145 --> 00:48:23,366
any musical instruments.

623
00:48:23,408 --> 00:48:26,575
James didn't understand
dance music.

624
00:48:26,823 --> 00:48:29,240
And I'm super
uptight about this.

625
00:48:29,295 --> 00:48:31,711
Oh, yo, yo...

626
00:48:32,106 --> 00:48:38,273
James had been in a few
second-tier Indie Rock bands.

627
00:48:38,908 --> 00:48:40,116
He lived in the office.

628
00:48:40,158 --> 00:48:44,658
He had a small stereo system
and an inflatable mattress.

629
00:48:44,700 --> 00:48:47,908
That decade had defeated him.

630
00:48:49,949 --> 00:48:51,116
The first thing
I wanted to do

631
00:48:51,158 --> 00:48:53,658
was make a record
that sounded like Can.

632
00:49:01,200 --> 00:49:02,491
Wait a second.

633
00:49:02,533 --> 00:49:05,990
Can were people
that worked at the Mozartian.

634
00:49:05,991 --> 00:49:08,616
The most prestigious
classical music school.

635
00:49:08,617 --> 00:49:10,990
Herman Smidt won
the young conductors award,

636
00:49:10,991 --> 00:49:14,491
traveled to New York,
seized The Velvet Underground,

637
00:49:14,533 --> 00:49:15,782
blew his mind,

638
00:49:15,824 --> 00:49:18,844
went back and formed a band
with the best free jazz drummer

639
00:49:18,868 --> 00:49:19,868
in Europe.

640
00:49:19,908 --> 00:49:21,616
They live
in a weird old castle.

641
00:49:21,617 --> 00:49:23,658
They played together
eight hours a day.

642
00:49:25,741 --> 00:49:29,366
You're gonna sit there
and sample your way into Can?

643
00:49:29,408 --> 00:49:32,823
At this point,
I'm going insane.

644
00:49:32,824 --> 00:49:35,450
But the truth is,
without David Holmes

645
00:49:35,491 --> 00:49:38,448
DFA, LCD,
none of that happens, none of it.

646
00:49:38,460 --> 00:49:39,460
None of it.

647
00:49:44,533 --> 00:49:46,533
New York,
how's the scene happening.

648
00:49:46,575 --> 00:49:49,532
Are you conscious of being
a part of something right now?

649
00:49:49,533 --> 00:49:51,774
Well,
everyone says that there's the scenes,

650
00:49:51,798 --> 00:49:52,991
so that's kind of cool,

651
00:49:53,033 --> 00:49:55,734
you know,
and I feel very proud to be put into

652
00:49:55,746 --> 00:49:58,575
the same sentence or
whatever with those bands.

653
00:49:59,408 --> 00:50:02,700
Out of the blue,
we got given a record deal.

654
00:50:03,408 --> 00:50:04,948
I just couldn't believe it.

655
00:50:04,949 --> 00:50:06,949
This was actually happening.

656
00:50:07,741 --> 00:50:09,575
Finally making a record.

657
00:50:12,283 --> 00:50:14,658
The only studio we could afford

658
00:50:14,682 --> 00:50:15,824
was in the attic

659
00:50:15,866 --> 00:50:18,575
of someone's house
in Connecticut.

660
00:50:20,533 --> 00:50:22,870
It really was great
to get out of the city

661
00:50:22,894 --> 00:50:24,658
and get away from distractions.

662
00:50:24,700 --> 00:50:29,073
Be it alcohol or cocaine
or girls, or whatever

663
00:50:29,074 --> 00:50:31,575
and just focus on the music.

664
00:50:34,366 --> 00:50:37,617
But social life
was very important to Carlos.

665
00:50:37,658 --> 00:50:39,866
He didn't wanna miss out.

666
00:50:39,908 --> 00:50:42,157
Which is why
I'm very, very obsessed

667
00:50:42,158 --> 00:50:44,990
with the movie
Leaving Las Vegas.

668
00:50:44,991 --> 00:50:48,824
Because to me,
Nicholas Cage in that movie

669
00:50:48,866 --> 00:50:50,991
almost embodies me.

670
00:50:51,033 --> 00:50:52,241
I wanted to be
in New York City

671
00:50:52,283 --> 00:50:54,073
where, like, everything
was happening.

672
00:50:54,074 --> 00:50:55,865
Everybody's name is on it?

673
00:50:55,866 --> 00:50:58,074
Don't you have...

674
00:51:00,200 --> 00:51:02,533
There was a lot
of tension in the studio.

675
00:51:02,575 --> 00:51:04,021
We couldn't have a conversation

676
00:51:04,045 --> 00:51:05,115
for more than 10 minutes

677
00:51:05,116 --> 00:51:08,324
without telling each other
to fuck off.

678
00:51:08,325 --> 00:51:10,351
The fact that this
was a collaboration,

679
00:51:10,375 --> 00:51:11,490
I really didn't care.

680
00:51:11,491 --> 00:51:14,846
The most important thing
was the song writing dynamic

681
00:51:14,870 --> 00:51:16,283
between me and Daniel.

682
00:51:17,408 --> 00:51:19,618
The best moment really were when

683
00:51:19,642 --> 00:51:20,949
we just didn't talk.

684
00:51:27,033 --> 00:51:32,575
And when Carlos played,
it just negated anything else.

685
00:51:49,575 --> 00:51:52,741
I remember being
in the studio the last morning

686
00:51:52,782 --> 00:51:54,575
listening to what we had done.

687
00:51:55,074 --> 00:51:55,949
Wow.

688
00:51:55,991 --> 00:51:57,908
I just couldn't believe
how good it was.

689
00:52:01,241 --> 00:52:04,200
Driving home from
Connecticut to Manhattan,

690
00:52:04,241 --> 00:52:06,408
everything felt
totally different.

691
00:52:09,116 --> 00:52:13,949
When I was 17

692
00:52:15,283 --> 00:52:19,408
It was a very good year

693
00:52:21,116 --> 00:52:24,617
It was a very good year

694
00:52:24,658 --> 00:52:28,200
For small town girls

695
00:52:28,241 --> 00:52:31,866
And soft summer nights

696
00:52:33,991 --> 00:52:39,074
We'd hide from the lights

697
00:52:40,450 --> 00:52:44,949
On the village green

698
00:52:47,700 --> 00:52:51,074
When I was 17

699
00:53:02,949 --> 00:53:05,687
New York is
bracing itself tonight

700
00:53:05,711 --> 00:53:07,781
for one massive blizzard.

701
00:53:07,782 --> 00:53:11,408
When I was 21

702
00:53:13,824 --> 00:53:17,824
It was a very good year...

703
00:53:20,158 --> 00:53:26,741
It was a very good year
for city girls

704
00:53:26,782 --> 00:53:31,408
Who lived up the stair

705
00:53:32,782 --> 00:53:38,408
With all that perfumed hair

706
00:53:39,408 --> 00:53:45,949
And it came undone

707
00:53:46,741 --> 00:53:51,408
When I was 21

708
00:54:26,658 --> 00:54:28,408
- Whoo!
- Yeah!

709
00:54:29,949 --> 00:54:32,408
- Hallelujah!
- All right!

710
00:54:34,700 --> 00:54:36,658
Halle-fucking-lujah, man!

711
00:55:28,949 --> 00:55:30,241
The way
we've been portrayed.

712
00:55:30,283 --> 00:55:32,990
New York City
good looking dude.

713
00:55:32,991 --> 00:55:36,782
- A bunch of rich kids...
- - Who think they're really cool.

714
00:55:38,033 --> 00:55:41,575
If I heard of a band like that,
I'd think they were assholes.

715
00:55:44,116 --> 00:55:47,283
Excuse me. Excuse me.

716
00:55:52,533 --> 00:55:55,001
In New York,
I was like a wild animal

717
00:55:55,025 --> 00:55:56,115
out of its cage.

718
00:55:56,116 --> 00:56:01,116
My gang was just getting up
to no good five nights a week.

719
00:56:20,074 --> 00:56:22,866
I don't dance,
I barely drink.

720
00:56:22,908 --> 00:56:25,074
I don't wanna
embarrass myself.

721
00:56:35,241 --> 00:56:37,283
I remember
talking him into it.

722
00:56:37,325 --> 00:56:40,949
- ""- You gotta try it.
- This is gonna change everything.""

723
00:57:13,741 --> 00:57:17,782
People were touching me,
chanting my name.

724
00:57:20,074 --> 00:57:23,700
I'm experiencing this music
in this totally new way.

725
00:57:26,949 --> 00:57:30,866
I really enjoyed dancing.

726
00:57:33,658 --> 00:57:35,741
It is not the drug.

727
00:57:36,241 --> 00:57:37,866
This is actually me...

728
00:57:39,200 --> 00:57:41,408
and my life
is forever changed.

729
00:57:49,741 --> 00:57:54,200
- Tim was the producer and programmer.
- For David Holmes.

730
00:57:54,241 --> 00:57:56,073
He and I would be the ones
stuck in the room

731
00:57:56,074 --> 00:57:59,407
having to sort through the shit
after everyone's left.

732
00:57:59,408 --> 00:58:02,908
He taught me how to use
the computer to experiment.

733
00:58:18,575 --> 00:58:21,575
Working with him
was perfect.

734
00:58:25,824 --> 00:58:29,908
After watching what Holmes
could wind up doing,

735
00:58:29,949 --> 00:58:31,240
it just seemed obvious to us.

736
00:58:31,241 --> 00:58:33,990
What if we did something
of our own?

737
00:58:33,991 --> 00:58:35,115
Something that
makes people

738
00:58:35,116 --> 00:58:37,908
who didn't normally
dance, dance?

739
00:58:44,617 --> 00:58:46,437
But if we were
going to be a label,

740
00:58:46,461 --> 00:58:48,282
we really needed to find a band.

741
00:58:48,283 --> 00:58:50,408
A band that we believed in.

742
00:58:52,033 --> 00:58:53,284
So, the name of our band

743
00:58:53,308 --> 00:58:54,033
is The Rapture.

744
00:58:54,074 --> 00:58:55,990
The name of our band
is The Rapture.

745
00:58:55,991 --> 00:58:58,199
- What's your name?
- Matt.

746
00:58:58,200 --> 00:59:00,408
- And your name?
- Gabriel.

747
00:59:03,074 --> 00:59:05,116
The band
started on the west coast.

748
00:59:05,158 --> 00:59:07,324
We lived in this suburb
of San Diego,

749
00:59:07,325 --> 00:59:09,700
where there's nothing
going on.

750
00:59:11,283 --> 00:59:14,032
We just decided
to pack up the band,

751
00:59:14,033 --> 00:59:16,866
book a tour
to get out to New York.

752
00:59:20,450 --> 00:59:22,807
I mean,
I was legitimately, like,

753
00:59:22,831 --> 00:59:23,781
19 years old.

754
00:59:23,782 --> 00:59:25,575
Very green.

755
00:59:26,617 --> 00:59:29,866
- We were broke.
- We had no money at all.

756
00:59:33,366 --> 00:59:37,408
I came to New York
as a complete leap of faith.

757
00:59:39,116 --> 00:59:41,575
New York, it's almost like
this white chalk outline,

758
00:59:41,617 --> 00:59:43,050
it's like,
""Do whatever you want in here,""

759
00:59:43,074 --> 00:59:46,408
""be as, like, as free
and as angry as you want.""

760
00:59:50,700 --> 00:59:53,283
I would go on Avenue A
to this magazine store

761
00:59:53,325 --> 00:59:55,157
and buy copies of ""NME""
and I'd be like,

762
00:59:55,158 --> 00:59:56,800
""Dude, like, this is all
happening around me""

763
00:59:56,824 --> 00:59:58,365
""and eventually
they're gonna find me.""

764
00:59:58,366 --> 01:00:00,033
One, two, three, four

765
01:00:00,074 --> 01:00:01,325
Five, six, seven

766
01:00:19,283 --> 01:00:22,616
Come dance with me...

767
01:00:22,617 --> 01:00:25,037
The first time I
saw The Rapture,

768
01:00:25,061 --> 01:00:26,949
I was completely smitten.

769
01:00:30,116 --> 01:00:33,573
Luke looked insane
and had this amazing,

770
01:00:33,597 --> 01:00:34,741
weird voice.

771
01:00:34,782 --> 01:00:36,575
He was super charismatic.

772
01:00:48,700 --> 01:00:51,700
James Murphy and Tim
were just fuckin' nuts.

773
01:00:52,575 --> 01:00:54,408
And I loved that.

774
01:00:57,283 --> 01:01:00,157
We were a punk
band that was trying

775
01:01:00,181 --> 01:01:01,866
to make dance music.

776
01:01:01,908 --> 01:01:04,074
We had similar goals,

777
01:01:04,116 --> 01:01:07,240
just coming at it
from different angles.

778
01:01:07,241 --> 01:01:10,033
James and Tim felt
like the only other people

779
01:01:10,074 --> 01:01:13,866
on the planet
who had the same ideas.

780
01:01:14,991 --> 01:01:17,658
And DFA was like
a clubhouse.

781
01:01:17,700 --> 01:01:19,948
Euphoric party nights.

782
01:01:19,949 --> 01:01:24,408
We'd listen to records,
wrote songs, drank too much.

783
01:01:26,491 --> 01:01:29,575
We felt like we were
gonna take over the world.

784
01:01:39,241 --> 01:01:42,366
MTV wanted The Strokes
to play a concert.

785
01:01:42,408 --> 01:01:45,533
A 30-minute live
broadcast special.

786
01:01:46,033 --> 01:01:47,491
It was a big deal.

787
01:01:47,533 --> 01:01:49,782
It was exposure.

788
01:01:49,824 --> 01:01:51,365
But a lot of those things
come with,

789
01:01:51,366 --> 01:01:54,247
""Well, if you don't do this,
you're never gonna get

790
01:01:54,271 --> 01:01:55,533
played on here again.""

791
01:02:09,325 --> 01:02:10,741
It's not working.

792
01:02:12,241 --> 01:02:13,407
Just...

793
01:02:13,408 --> 01:02:14,958
I would just remember
there will be people

794
01:02:14,982 --> 01:02:15,491
behind you,

795
01:02:15,533 --> 01:02:18,949
so just don't forget
to address the back, too.

796
01:02:21,116 --> 01:02:24,741
Ten, nine, eight, seven,

797
01:02:24,782 --> 01:02:28,533
six, five, four, rolling.

798
01:02:28,575 --> 01:02:31,575
Ladies and gentlemen,
here they are.

799
01:02:32,241 --> 01:02:33,241
The Strokes.

800
01:02:43,366 --> 01:02:49,908
No choice now
It's too late

801
01:02:52,824 --> 01:02:58,074
Lisa said take time for me

802
01:02:59,617 --> 01:03:04,908
Dropping him
down to his knees

803
01:03:10,074 --> 01:03:13,282
He knows it's justified
to kill to survive

804
01:03:13,283 --> 01:03:16,948
He then in dollars
makes more dead than alive

805
01:03:16,949 --> 01:03:18,115
Let's suck more blood

806
01:03:18,116 --> 01:03:20,158
Let's run three hours a day

807
01:03:20,200 --> 01:03:24,074
The world is over
but I don't care 'cause

808
01:03:26,074 --> 01:03:27,325
Take two.

809
01:03:27,366 --> 01:03:28,823
Rally forward!

810
01:03:28,824 --> 01:03:30,948
- Guys, take three.
- Rally forward.

811
01:03:30,949 --> 01:03:32,408
Rally forward.

812
01:03:35,116 --> 01:03:36,990
- Take five.
- Four. Two.

813
01:03:36,991 --> 01:03:40,948
The first time
it happened too fast

814
01:03:40,949 --> 01:03:44,324
The second time
I thought it would last

815
01:03:44,325 --> 01:03:48,450
We all like it
a little different

816
01:04:05,866 --> 01:04:07,574
The first
""NME"" cover that we did,

817
01:04:07,575 --> 01:04:10,575
the caption was
""Cool! Sexy! Drunk!""

818
01:04:10,617 --> 01:04:13,369
Three words that
don't just make much

819
01:04:13,393 --> 01:04:14,533
sense together.

820
01:04:15,366 --> 01:04:17,366
And one of the things
that started to surface

821
01:04:17,408 --> 01:04:22,200
with the press
was a sort of predatory gaze.

822
01:04:22,241 --> 01:04:24,822
Photographers were
boys being in the front row

823
01:04:24,846 --> 01:04:25,699
at our shows.

824
01:04:25,700 --> 01:04:29,365
Arm outstretched,
weird expression on their face,

825
01:04:29,366 --> 01:04:31,449
trying to get like crotch shots

826
01:04:31,473 --> 01:04:32,473
under my skirt.

827
01:04:33,491 --> 01:04:37,700
I just remember feeling
very protective about Karen.

828
01:04:41,366 --> 01:04:44,700
Being a woman
fronting a rock band,

829
01:04:44,741 --> 01:04:46,575
I was sensationalized.

830
01:04:47,782 --> 01:04:50,989
But I was also struggling
to be taken seriously

831
01:04:51,013 --> 01:04:52,074
as an artist.

832
01:04:53,283 --> 01:04:54,616
That costume
that you were wearing,

833
01:04:54,617 --> 01:04:55,900
the yellow, it's almost like

834
01:04:55,924 --> 01:04:56,699
an Elvis jumpsuit.

835
01:04:56,700 --> 01:04:57,418
That was sort of...

836
01:04:57,430 --> 01:04:59,134
Have you ever had the
same sex experience...

837
01:04:59,158 --> 01:05:01,866
- Do you have any thoughts on chastity?
- - Chastity?

838
01:05:01,908 --> 01:05:03,574
Karen, have you ever experienced
Madonna syndrome?

839
01:05:03,575 --> 01:05:05,158
Do you
remember your first kiss?

840
01:05:05,200 --> 01:05:08,073
Is it a tough
kind of thing to be so cool?

841
01:05:08,074 --> 01:05:09,781
Have you
received any death threats?

842
01:05:09,782 --> 01:05:11,782
- What's your favorite meal?
- My favorite meal?

843
01:05:14,325 --> 01:05:17,782
So, let me, uh, let me hear all
the ladies out there tonight.

844
01:05:22,533 --> 01:05:23,365
All right.

845
01:05:23,377 --> 01:05:25,908
Let me hear all the
boys out there tonight.

846
01:05:29,949 --> 01:05:31,991
Okay, let me hear
all the men out there tonight.

847
01:05:34,033 --> 01:05:36,617
I'm here to represent
for the ladies.

848
01:05:37,700 --> 01:05:38,908
It's all or nothing.

849
01:05:52,200 --> 01:05:54,908
I wanna date with the night

850
01:07:28,283 --> 01:07:30,366
When we made
House Of Jealous Lovers

851
01:07:30,408 --> 01:07:34,450
it wasn't necessarily
like fun in the studio.

852
01:07:46,408 --> 01:07:50,533
House of jealous lovers

853
01:07:52,325 --> 01:07:54,658
First,
we recorded everything live.

854
01:07:54,700 --> 01:07:58,325
And then Tim and I
started ripping it apart.

855
01:08:04,283 --> 01:08:06,720
I can get really
anxious if I feel like

856
01:08:06,744 --> 01:08:08,408
I'm compromising my music.

857
01:08:09,074 --> 01:08:12,200
I feel compulsion
to make the music

858
01:08:12,241 --> 01:08:15,283
exactly the way
I think it should be.

859
01:08:15,325 --> 01:08:17,175
James was the first person I met

860
01:08:17,199 --> 01:08:18,700
who was more alpha than me.

861
01:08:18,741 --> 01:08:21,294
I had all these
ideas in the studio,

862
01:08:21,318 --> 01:08:22,991
he had all these ideas.

863
01:08:23,033 --> 01:08:24,741
I couldn't bulldoze him.

864
01:08:28,200 --> 01:08:30,575
I was
never good at friends.

865
01:08:31,575 --> 01:08:35,575
I was so lonely
and so self-conscious.

866
01:08:36,241 --> 01:08:39,200
I wanted connection
and friends,

867
01:08:39,241 --> 01:08:41,533
but I'd always
end up in fights.

868
01:08:43,283 --> 01:08:46,074
There was just
something wrong with me

869
01:08:46,116 --> 01:08:48,575
that wasn't wrong
with other people.

870
01:08:49,866 --> 01:08:51,908
So, I made music
fucking alone.

871
01:08:57,158 --> 01:09:01,491
- He was really pushing me.
- I was in a lot of pain.

872
01:09:01,533 --> 01:09:07,033
Get rid of the drum,
face the bass...

873
01:09:07,074 --> 01:09:09,450
Get rid of
the guitar completely.

874
01:09:10,283 --> 01:09:11,426
Me and Tim
just kept telling him

875
01:09:11,450 --> 01:09:12,949
and everyone around him
was just like,

876
01:09:12,991 --> 01:09:15,287
""You're domineering,
and you need to make

877
01:09:15,311 --> 01:09:16,741
your own fucking record!""

878
01:09:19,200 --> 01:09:23,908
There was a part of James
that wanted to be in the band.

879
01:09:23,949 --> 01:09:25,782
Wanted it to be his band.

880
01:09:26,408 --> 01:09:29,449
He didn't have his own outlet.

881
01:09:29,450 --> 01:09:31,740
They really freaked out
about the production.

882
01:09:31,741 --> 01:09:33,358
They thought everyone
was gonna hate

883
01:09:33,382 --> 01:09:34,533
that it was a house song.

884
01:09:34,575 --> 01:09:39,074
- He was really just like, ""No.
- It's perfect, we're not fixing it.""

885
01:09:50,283 --> 01:09:53,449
House of jealous lovers

886
01:09:53,450 --> 01:09:55,283
House of jealous lovers

887
01:09:55,325 --> 01:09:57,741
People went
fucking crazy for it.

888
01:09:59,491 --> 01:10:02,158
People just called us
the disco Strokes.

889
01:10:02,200 --> 01:10:06,908
House of jealous
lovers shakedown

890
01:10:09,325 --> 01:10:11,324
Goldsworthy
and engineer James Murphy

891
01:10:11,325 --> 01:10:14,408
are the production team whose
fusion of minimal electronic

892
01:10:14,450 --> 01:10:17,033
and post-punk rock
continue to thrill

893
01:10:17,074 --> 01:10:19,782
critics and listeners
worldwide.

894
01:10:19,824 --> 01:10:21,854
You know,
half the people, you know,

895
01:10:21,878 --> 01:10:23,616
someone told them it was cool.

896
01:10:23,617 --> 01:10:27,323
You know what I mean?
""Cause theoretically,""

897
01:10:27,347 --> 01:10:28,575
we're... cool.

898
01:10:36,200 --> 01:10:37,575
Nobody else was
playing the records

899
01:10:37,599 --> 01:10:38,158
I was playing.

900
01:10:38,200 --> 01:10:39,740
That was like my thing.

901
01:10:39,741 --> 01:10:43,157
One hand ties the other

902
01:10:43,158 --> 01:10:45,033
House of jealous lovers...

903
01:10:45,074 --> 01:10:48,450
Pure idolism,
ridiculous mess.

904
01:10:50,325 --> 01:10:54,086
I had my first E,
and lost my virginity

905
01:10:54,110 --> 01:10:56,283
at the same DFA party.

906
01:11:03,533 --> 01:11:06,991
We weren't downtown
New York cool kids,

907
01:11:07,033 --> 01:11:10,781
and we weren't Brooklyn
Art School kids either,

908
01:11:10,782 --> 01:11:13,283
but somehow,
we had a scene.

909
01:11:16,617 --> 01:11:18,990
How do you guy
sit down and write a song?

910
01:11:18,991 --> 01:11:21,116
Because I know you write
the lyrics, but do you-

911
01:11:21,158 --> 01:11:22,657
No, Julian does the lyrics.

912
01:11:22,658 --> 01:11:24,115
- Yeah.
- He writes the song.

913
01:11:24,116 --> 01:11:25,365
- Oh, and the songs?
- Oh, yeah.

914
01:11:25,366 --> 01:11:27,014
- Okay...
- And the guitar solos,

915
01:11:27,038 --> 01:11:28,038
everything, dude.

916
01:11:28,366 --> 01:11:31,074
- Really?
- Sure. Yeah.

917
01:11:31,491 --> 01:11:32,741
That's... Yeah.

918
01:11:33,325 --> 01:11:36,074
I always
wanted to write songs.

919
01:11:38,782 --> 01:11:40,450
The most frustrated
I ever got,

920
01:11:40,491 --> 01:11:43,122
I had a song and
thought it could

921
01:11:43,146 --> 01:11:45,116
really work in the band.

922
01:11:45,158 --> 01:11:47,533
I was super-excited about it.

923
01:11:48,450 --> 01:11:51,533
But Julian had
a very precise vision.

924
01:11:56,241 --> 01:11:58,895
The only thing I have control on

925
01:11:58,919 --> 01:12:00,574
is having good songs.

926
01:12:00,575 --> 01:12:03,572
Even if everyone loves it,
I always go home thinking,

927
01:12:03,596 --> 01:12:04,741
""Is it good enough?""

928
01:12:05,782 --> 01:12:07,283
It's a struggle.

929
01:12:08,491 --> 01:12:10,032
It was a lot
of pressure on Julian

930
01:12:10,033 --> 01:12:13,450
to get another album
out there as soon as possible.

931
01:12:13,491 --> 01:12:17,574
We had been praised
as ""Rock's Saviors"",

932
01:12:17,575 --> 01:12:20,908
but all we had ever recorded
was a half hour record.

933
01:12:23,491 --> 01:12:24,907
Ready?

934
01:12:24,908 --> 01:12:27,303
We got back from
touring and spent a month

935
01:12:27,327 --> 01:12:28,782
in our rehearsal space...

936
01:12:29,533 --> 01:12:30,908
and just worked.

937
01:12:32,033 --> 01:12:33,741
Why were we rushing?

938
01:13:32,241 --> 01:13:34,574
What is the ideal place

939
01:13:34,575 --> 01:13:37,048
for somebody to listen
to your new record

940
01:13:37,072 --> 01:13:38,241
for the first time?

941
01:13:38,283 --> 01:13:39,866
I hadn't thought of that.

942
01:13:39,908 --> 01:13:41,283
Read their last rights.

943
01:13:41,325 --> 01:13:42,908
No, I don't know.

944
01:13:45,074 --> 01:13:47,700
Nikolai, man, help me out.

945
01:13:47,741 --> 01:13:49,385
I don't know, man,
we just finished it today,

946
01:13:49,409 --> 01:13:49,948
you know.

947
01:13:49,949 --> 01:13:51,741
How do you guys
feel about it?

948
01:13:53,325 --> 01:13:56,199
- I...
- Tense but confident.

949
01:13:56,200 --> 01:13:58,575
You sound
incredibly down on yourself.

950
01:13:58,617 --> 01:14:02,740
It's odd to hear
you guys feel intimidated.

951
01:14:02,741 --> 01:14:06,449
Feel like you guys aren't
gonna end up sizing up and...

952
01:14:06,450 --> 01:14:08,342
think that you
guys are ultimately

953
01:14:08,366 --> 01:14:09,450
gonna be forgotten.

954
01:14:10,033 --> 01:14:12,033
I don't wanna
let people down.

955
01:14:16,283 --> 01:14:17,490
- Karen rules...
- She's very good.

956
01:14:17,491 --> 01:14:19,197
- She's the coolest
person on earth-

957
01:14:19,221 --> 01:14:19,782
-And Nick.

958
01:14:19,824 --> 01:14:21,157
- And she's a God.
- Nicks amazing.

959
01:14:21,158 --> 01:14:22,365
She just does
what she wants,

960
01:14:22,366 --> 01:14:24,575
- and she doesn't care about anyone else.
- -Yeah.

961
01:14:24,617 --> 01:14:25,450
She's sexy!

962
01:14:25,451 --> 01:14:28,199
- Her hair, her face, everything.
- Her voice.

963
01:14:28,200 --> 01:14:29,240
I'd do her.

964
01:14:29,241 --> 01:14:30,533
I'd do her.

965
01:14:30,575 --> 01:14:34,905
She seems shy, like,
offstage, but she puts on this

966
01:14:34,929 --> 01:14:36,365
crazy character.

967
01:14:36,366 --> 01:14:39,055
The Yeah Yeah Yeahs
are going on in five minutes.

968
01:14:39,067 --> 01:14:40,366
Can you please return?

969
01:14:43,200 --> 01:14:45,407
I had set myself up
as being a pretty

970
01:14:45,408 --> 01:14:48,741
spectacular
self-destructive persona.

971
01:14:50,241 --> 01:14:52,074
I was needing
to live up to that,

972
01:14:52,116 --> 01:14:55,741
and I was beating myself up
out there night after night.

973
01:15:00,200 --> 01:15:04,700
I was seeing
the fanaticism around Karen.

974
01:15:05,408 --> 01:15:08,490
The press, freaky fans.

975
01:15:08,491 --> 01:15:12,450
And just seeing
how fragile she was off-stage...

976
01:15:13,033 --> 01:15:14,866
I was worried.

977
01:15:14,908 --> 01:15:17,617
Ah, this fuckin' hurts.

978
01:15:18,658 --> 01:15:19,908
Do you know what I'm saying?

979
01:15:20,408 --> 01:15:22,325
It's like fucking shit!

980
01:15:22,366 --> 01:15:24,408
- Who the fuck cares?
- Do you know what I'm saying.

981
01:15:24,450 --> 01:15:26,657
Do not fucking tread on me!

982
01:15:26,658 --> 01:15:28,241
I really did want
to speak to someone

983
01:15:28,283 --> 01:15:30,283
who could relate
to how I was feeling.

984
01:15:30,325 --> 01:15:32,326
But my experience
was so different

985
01:15:32,350 --> 01:15:33,741
from the men around me.

986
01:15:34,158 --> 01:15:36,074
It was incredibly lonely.

987
01:15:41,158 --> 01:15:44,158
It's just wearing me down,
the lifestyle,

988
01:15:44,200 --> 01:15:47,533
the physical aspect of it,
the repetition of it.

989
01:15:49,991 --> 01:15:52,949
The business of it
and the bullshit of it

990
01:15:52,991 --> 01:15:55,575
and the press
and the attention.

991
01:16:01,200 --> 01:16:03,782
- Can we have sound, speed?
- Roll cameras, please.

992
01:16:05,991 --> 01:16:07,908
- Roll joints.
- Do speed.

993
01:16:08,866 --> 01:16:10,200
Ready.

994
01:16:10,241 --> 01:16:13,741
We're still waiting
for the...

995
01:16:14,949 --> 01:16:17,824
It's a rehearsal
so let's just do it, right?

996
01:16:17,866 --> 01:16:19,408
Do you need to play?

997
01:16:19,450 --> 01:16:21,741
- It's just a rehearsal.
- Can we just start?

998
01:16:24,824 --> 01:16:26,408
Okay, we are rolling.

999
01:16:27,575 --> 01:16:30,726
Julian had dreams that
he just maybe assumed

1000
01:16:30,750 --> 01:16:32,283
we'd all just follow.

1001
01:16:36,200 --> 01:16:38,574
Room on Fire
sold, like, 650,000 records

1002
01:16:38,575 --> 01:16:40,356
and everybody
wants to write about

1003
01:16:40,380 --> 01:16:41,781
what a big failure it was.

1004
01:16:41,782 --> 01:16:44,765
By what it was built up to be,
it was supposed

1005
01:16:44,789 --> 01:16:45,908
to sell millions.

1006
01:16:52,450 --> 01:16:57,240
That's when
friends, girlfriends,

1007
01:16:57,241 --> 01:17:00,200
strangers started coming in.

1008
01:17:00,241 --> 01:17:02,491
""Julian's slowing
everyone down.""

1009
01:17:02,533 --> 01:17:04,366
""You should be
a bigger band.""

1010
01:17:08,241 --> 01:17:11,741
I felt that distance
between me and Julian.

1011
01:17:16,158 --> 01:17:17,958
- Well, its Ryan Adams.
Look at you.

1012
01:17:17,982 --> 01:17:18,574
-Hey, man.

1013
01:17:18,575 --> 01:17:22,407
- The most difficult man in rock and roll.
- -Oh, geez.

1014
01:17:22,408 --> 01:17:26,824
Ryan Adams was really,
really into The Strokes.

1015
01:17:26,866 --> 01:17:28,157
Enamored by them.

1016
01:17:28,158 --> 01:17:30,584
We're gonna play a
song by The Strokes

1017
01:17:30,608 --> 01:17:31,782
called Last Night.

1018
01:17:34,949 --> 01:17:36,617
Yeah, it's our best song.

1019
01:18:03,991 --> 01:18:05,926
He'd always come and
like wake me up at two

1020
01:18:05,950 --> 01:18:07,282
in the morning to have drugs.

1021
01:18:07,283 --> 01:18:10,098
So, I would just kind of,
like, do the drugs

1022
01:18:10,122 --> 01:18:11,491
and kind of numb out.

1023
01:18:11,533 --> 01:18:14,154
I remember Julian
threatening to beat him up

1024
01:18:14,178 --> 01:18:15,575
if he hung out with me.

1025
01:18:17,491 --> 01:18:22,199
I knew I would shoot up drugs
from a very young age.

1026
01:18:22,200 --> 01:18:24,533
When it came, it wasn't, like,
""What am I doing here?

1027
01:18:24,575 --> 01:18:26,366
It was kind of like,
""I made it.""

1028
01:18:27,575 --> 01:18:28,741
I was home.

1029
01:18:34,949 --> 01:18:35,990
Number one.

1030
01:18:35,991 --> 01:18:39,949
The win immunity,
we're number one, watch this.

1031
01:18:44,533 --> 01:18:47,741
After House Of Jealous Lovers
blew up,

1032
01:18:47,782 --> 01:18:49,324
we had all this attention.

1033
01:18:49,325 --> 01:18:52,116
But we were touring
the world on a single.

1034
01:18:54,700 --> 01:18:56,907
It was so fun.

1035
01:18:56,908 --> 01:19:00,365
The Rapture,
me and Tim were a gang.

1036
01:19:00,366 --> 01:19:02,450
We felt invincible.

1037
01:19:05,575 --> 01:19:11,032
We had just finished Echoes,
this album that we really loved.

1038
01:19:11,033 --> 01:19:14,171
And then compound that
with the music industry

1039
01:19:14,195 --> 01:19:16,073
feeding frenzy in New York,

1040
01:19:16,074 --> 01:19:18,074
and it was just
this perfect timing.

1041
01:19:18,116 --> 01:19:21,241
But in the beginning,
DFA was more about concept

1042
01:19:21,283 --> 01:19:24,200
than an actual
functioning label.

1043
01:19:24,241 --> 01:19:28,365
DFA spent a year
trying to find a distributor

1044
01:19:28,366 --> 01:19:30,948
and failed to do so.

1045
01:19:30,949 --> 01:19:32,782
The clock was ticking.

1046
01:19:33,575 --> 01:19:36,948
I wish we had just put
fucking Echoes out.

1047
01:19:36,949 --> 01:19:38,575
That was a fucking mistake.

1048
01:19:39,241 --> 01:19:40,575
The songs
that are on the record,

1049
01:19:40,617 --> 01:19:42,727
we've been playing
them out for like a year

1050
01:19:42,751 --> 01:19:43,699
and a half, like...

1051
01:19:43,700 --> 01:19:45,449
So, it's just like...

1052
01:19:45,450 --> 01:19:48,408
It's just time
for it to come out, like...

1053
01:19:50,908 --> 01:19:53,868
I was more scared
than I'd ever been

1054
01:19:53,892 --> 01:19:55,408
in my entire life.

1055
01:19:56,366 --> 01:19:59,366
It's gonna fucking disappear,
it's gonna be over.

1056
01:20:00,241 --> 01:20:03,306
I know they had to,
but when they left,

1057
01:20:03,330 --> 01:20:04,533
the crushed me.

1058
01:20:05,575 --> 01:20:06,700
I cried.

1059
01:20:07,533 --> 01:20:08,741
I just cried.

1060
01:20:09,408 --> 01:20:11,408
We were Rapture Records.

1061
01:20:11,866 --> 01:20:13,283
That's what DFA was.

1062
01:20:13,782 --> 01:20:14,908
But they left.

1063
01:20:16,408 --> 01:20:19,366
We didn't want to leave DFA.

1064
01:20:20,116 --> 01:20:23,408
Those were, like,
our closest friends.

1065
01:20:24,116 --> 01:20:26,450
But we needed
to get our record out.

1066
01:20:36,408 --> 01:20:39,366
We hit 40,000 records sold.

1067
01:20:39,949 --> 01:20:43,532
Our record company
was, like, ""Whoa!""

1068
01:20:43,533 --> 01:20:46,243
We had this incredible
energy between us,

1069
01:20:46,267 --> 01:20:47,616
this kinetic energy.

1070
01:20:47,617 --> 01:20:50,056
We nailed the second record

1071
01:20:50,080 --> 01:20:51,157
straightaway.

1072
01:20:51,158 --> 01:20:54,033
This is the record
that we've been waiting for.

1073
01:21:02,700 --> 01:21:04,544
Three months
before release date,

1074
01:21:04,568 --> 01:21:05,948
we were out at some bar.

1075
01:21:05,949 --> 01:21:09,660
A complete stranger
comes along singing lyrics

1076
01:21:09,684 --> 01:21:11,575
from the second record.

1077
01:21:13,241 --> 01:21:14,782
What the hell's going on?

1078
01:21:19,741 --> 01:21:21,574
The record had leaked.

1079
01:21:21,575 --> 01:21:24,617
I couldn't believe that
this was actually happening.

1080
01:21:38,074 --> 01:21:40,200
I went
to this club, Brownies,

1081
01:21:40,241 --> 01:21:42,907
which I used to play at
all the time.

1082
01:21:42,908 --> 01:21:45,282
There was a kid DJ-ing,
playing ESG,

1083
01:21:45,283 --> 01:21:47,741
and he plays
a Liquid Liquid song.

1084
01:21:48,533 --> 01:21:49,408
What the fuck?

1085
01:21:49,450 --> 01:21:51,908
These records
took me years to find,

1086
01:21:51,949 --> 01:21:54,617
and now some kid
can just download it?

1087
01:21:56,283 --> 01:21:57,574
Wait a second.

1088
01:21:57,575 --> 01:21:58,923
You didn't write them,
you just play them,

1089
01:21:58,947 --> 01:21:59,532
you just own them,

1090
01:21:59,533 --> 01:22:01,062
you can't be proud of yourself

1091
01:22:01,086 --> 01:22:01,741
for owning it.

1092
01:22:01,782 --> 01:22:03,699
But I know that kid
was at one of my parties.

1093
01:22:03,700 --> 01:22:05,745
Even if this person
went to one of our parties,

1094
01:22:05,769 --> 01:22:06,741
I have no rights here.

1095
01:22:06,782 --> 01:22:08,298
It's the fucking
closest I've ever been

1096
01:22:08,322 --> 01:22:09,033
to cool in my life

1097
01:22:09,074 --> 01:22:10,259
and this fucking kid
can take it?

1098
01:22:10,283 --> 01:22:11,741
I was playing
that six months ago.

1099
01:22:11,782 --> 01:22:12,718
First of all,
it's not your record,

1100
01:22:12,742 --> 01:22:13,259
you didn't make it.

1101
01:22:13,283 --> 01:22:15,408
What's worse
than that guy?

1102
01:22:16,074 --> 01:22:17,616
I'm disappointed
with myself.

1103
01:22:17,617 --> 01:22:19,073
- Its stupid and embarrassing.
- - I'm a total hipster

1104
01:22:19,074 --> 01:22:21,700
jackass,
I have been my entire life.

1105
01:22:25,325 --> 01:22:28,617
I'd really wasted
30 years of my life.

1106
01:22:33,200 --> 01:22:35,033
And I would
lock the studio...

1107
01:22:36,782 --> 01:22:38,907
sing a song
about losing my edge.

1108
01:22:38,908 --> 01:22:40,240
I'm losing my edge...

1109
01:22:40,241 --> 01:22:41,491
How humiliating it is to be me.

1110
01:22:41,533 --> 01:22:46,781
To the kids
From France and from London

1111
01:22:46,782 --> 01:22:49,240
I'm losing my edge

1112
01:22:49,241 --> 01:22:50,449
It was the first time
I made music

1113
01:22:50,450 --> 01:22:54,115
where I wasn't trying
to be another thing

1114
01:22:54,116 --> 01:22:56,074
that I thought
I'm supposed to be.

1115
01:23:04,991 --> 01:23:07,408
Yeah, I'm losing my edge

1116
01:23:09,074 --> 01:23:11,741
I'm losing my edge

1117
01:23:13,617 --> 01:23:14,866
To kids

1118
01:23:16,824 --> 01:23:19,408
I'm coming up from behind

1119
01:23:23,158 --> 01:23:24,741
But I was there

1120
01:23:26,908 --> 01:23:29,408
I was there in 1968

1121
01:23:31,033 --> 01:23:35,533
I was there at the first
Can show in Cologne

1122
01:23:39,908 --> 01:23:41,450
But I was there

1123
01:23:45,158 --> 01:23:49,699
I was the first guy playing
Daft Punk to the rock kids

1124
01:23:49,700 --> 01:23:51,781
I played it at CBGB's

1125
01:23:51,782 --> 01:23:53,741
Everybody thought
it was crazy

1126
01:23:54,200 --> 01:23:55,866
We all know

1127
01:23:55,908 --> 01:23:58,616
I hear everybody
that you know

1128
01:23:58,617 --> 01:24:03,575
Is more relevant
than everybody that I know

1129
01:24:05,283 --> 01:24:07,741
I came upstairs
and played it for Tim.

1130
01:24:18,617 --> 01:24:21,136
He said, ""You don't wanna put""

1131
01:24:21,160 --> 01:24:22,283
this out, man.

1132
01:24:23,033 --> 01:24:25,700
""You really don't want people
to hear this.""

1133
01:24:26,949 --> 01:24:29,533
But I've lived in fear
my whole life...

1134
01:24:30,074 --> 01:24:31,949
and I had nothing to lose.

1135
01:24:42,991 --> 01:24:45,575
Julian always wanted
the whole band together.

1136
01:24:46,908 --> 01:24:49,366
I'd show up late
in the studio.

1137
01:24:49,408 --> 01:24:51,074
And smoke too much crack
before coming in

1138
01:24:51,116 --> 01:24:53,716
and had to take a bunch of pills

1139
01:24:53,740 --> 01:24:55,115
just to calm down.

1140
01:24:55,116 --> 01:24:57,782
I wasn't playing that well.

1141
01:24:57,824 --> 01:24:59,908
I've tried everything
to get fired.

1142
01:25:01,283 --> 01:25:03,073
Remember that girl
that was downstairs,

1143
01:25:03,074 --> 01:25:05,282
that said she didn't care
about The Hives and The Strokes,

1144
01:25:05,283 --> 01:25:08,033
and she just wanted
like a big rock riff?

1145
01:25:09,074 --> 01:25:11,408
- I think that ought to do it.
- We are, um, we're back.

1146
01:25:11,450 --> 01:25:14,393
We had a little nap,
and we are really staying up

1147
01:25:14,417 --> 01:25:15,575
for 24 hours and...

1148
01:25:16,366 --> 01:25:18,450
not many people
in this room do drugs.

1149
01:25:18,491 --> 01:25:19,907
We're in a corporate
environment.

1150
01:25:19,908 --> 01:25:21,282
Come here, come here.

1151
01:25:21,283 --> 01:25:22,923
Courtney Love was
doing a take over

1152
01:25:22,947 --> 01:25:23,907
of MTV for 24 hours.

1153
01:25:23,908 --> 01:25:25,866
- Show us your.
- Come on!

1154
01:25:25,908 --> 01:25:27,657
- Yes!
- I'll do it if you do it!

1155
01:25:27,658 --> 01:25:30,736
She texted me,
""Do any of The Strokes

1156
01:25:30,760 --> 01:25:31,949
wanna pop up?""

1157
01:25:31,991 --> 01:25:33,491
I called Albert.

1158
01:25:33,533 --> 01:25:35,617
You're fucked up
and the idea's funny.

1159
01:25:35,658 --> 01:25:39,575
Oh, yeah, I'll go up there
and, like, see Courtney Love.

1160
01:25:42,533 --> 01:25:45,533
- Wait, what are we doing?
- Why are we?

1161
01:25:46,074 --> 01:25:47,782
I was so fucked.

1162
01:25:49,575 --> 01:25:51,774
Her and Ryan were
just doing their thing

1163
01:25:51,798 --> 01:25:53,033
what Ryan always does.

1164
01:26:07,283 --> 01:26:10,949
When things go bad,
you just want it to get worse.

1165
01:26:12,366 --> 01:26:14,575
When the band catch you
out of it.

1166
01:26:15,908 --> 01:26:19,801
I can be sitting here with
my eyes open and just...

1167
01:26:19,813 --> 01:26:21,115
gone.

1168
01:26:21,116 --> 01:26:24,408
There's so many times
where I was just so close to...

1169
01:26:24,782 --> 01:26:25,824
to dying.

1170
01:27:03,949 --> 01:27:05,449
It could be over.

1171
01:27:05,450 --> 01:27:07,408
We could be over, you know.

1172
01:27:25,450 --> 01:27:27,303
Out of nowhere I got an offer

1173
01:27:27,327 --> 01:27:28,408
from Arthur Baker.

1174
01:27:28,450 --> 01:27:30,872
He'd heard our record
and he wanted us to come

1175
01:27:30,896 --> 01:27:32,074
play a show in London.

1176
01:27:32,991 --> 01:27:34,908
There's no way I can do this.

1177
01:27:35,325 --> 01:27:37,157
I can't do it.

1178
01:27:37,158 --> 01:27:40,741
- I don't have a band.
- It's just me and a toy boom box.

1179
01:27:43,283 --> 01:27:45,327
I did the only thing I could do,

1180
01:27:45,351 --> 01:27:47,073
call the people that I knew.

1181
01:27:47,074 --> 01:27:50,033
Tyler, the base player
in Out Hud,

1182
01:27:50,074 --> 01:27:52,283
Pat, the drummer
in Les Savvy Fav,

1183
01:27:52,325 --> 01:27:54,363
Phil Mossman,
guitar player, who had done

1184
01:27:54,387 --> 01:27:55,657
the David Holmes' record,

1185
01:27:55,658 --> 01:27:59,145
and Nancy, my drinking buddy,

1186
01:27:59,169 --> 01:28:01,450
took piano as a kid.

1187
01:28:02,782 --> 01:28:05,324
Deciding to start a band

1188
01:28:05,325 --> 01:28:09,074
in your 30's
seemed absurd.

1189
01:28:11,366 --> 01:28:14,366
We only had
10 days to rehearse.

1190
01:28:15,617 --> 01:28:18,712
This was his first
time as a front man

1191
01:28:18,736 --> 01:28:20,991
singing in front of people.

1192
01:28:31,741 --> 01:28:36,325
Nothing terrified me like
watching footage of John Lydon.

1193
01:28:36,366 --> 01:28:39,241
It made me feel
so uncomfortable.

1194
01:28:39,283 --> 01:28:41,095
I realized this would be

1195
01:28:41,119 --> 01:28:42,119
my problem.

1196
01:28:44,116 --> 01:28:46,740
The people that are dancing...

1197
01:28:46,741 --> 01:28:48,824
and he just
doesn't exude himself.

1198
01:28:52,991 --> 01:28:54,408
Oh, my God.

1199
01:29:02,908 --> 01:29:04,908
I don't know
what to do with myself.

1200
01:29:09,782 --> 01:29:12,938
James wanted to set up very,
very close

1201
01:29:12,962 --> 01:29:14,450
together on stage.

1202
01:29:15,533 --> 01:29:17,908
So, he was
totally surrounded.

1203
01:29:18,949 --> 01:29:19,991
Protected.

1204
01:29:24,200 --> 01:29:25,200
Go ahead...

1205
01:29:44,283 --> 01:29:48,033
Well, Daft Punk is playing
at my house, my house

1206
01:29:50,074 --> 01:29:54,741
I'll show you the ropes kid,
show you the ropes

1207
01:29:56,283 --> 01:30:00,908
I got a bus and a trailer
at my house, my house

1208
01:30:02,617 --> 01:30:07,575
I'll show you the ropes kid,
show you the ropes

1209
01:30:08,491 --> 01:30:12,575
'Cause Daft Punk is playing
at my house, my house

1210
01:30:14,325 --> 01:30:19,074
You've got to set them up,
set them up

1211
01:30:20,782 --> 01:30:22,575
My house

1212
01:30:23,949 --> 01:30:25,741
My house

1213
01:30:26,700 --> 01:30:31,366
You've got to set them up,
set them up

1214
01:30:55,408 --> 01:30:56,700
The song ""This is it,""

1215
01:30:56,741 --> 01:30:58,414
is that a sarcastic reference

1216
01:30:58,438 --> 01:30:59,240
to The Strokes?

1217
01:30:59,241 --> 01:31:00,491
No, no, no, no, no!

1218
01:31:00,533 --> 01:31:01,718
I've heard that from many people

1219
01:31:01,742 --> 01:31:02,217
and it's like,

1220
01:31:02,241 --> 01:31:04,115
""Damn, if I were gonna write
a song about The Strokes,""

1221
01:31:04,116 --> 01:31:07,033
""I would probably go
a little further.""

1222
01:31:07,074 --> 01:31:09,200
That's just the name
of the song.

1223
01:31:09,241 --> 01:31:10,657
But I can see
why people think that.

1224
01:31:10,658 --> 01:31:13,015
It goes to show
you how influential

1225
01:31:13,039 --> 01:31:14,491
The Strokes guys are.

1226
01:31:14,533 --> 01:31:17,866
That these guys
are just great.

1227
01:31:20,033 --> 01:31:21,408
Hello.

1228
01:32:19,658 --> 01:32:23,699
I wanted to ask you
about this before we left.

1229
01:32:23,700 --> 01:32:24,823
I think it's awesome.

1230
01:32:24,824 --> 01:32:26,866
- What?
- Yes... The holster.

1231
01:32:26,908 --> 01:32:28,199
Well, thanks, thanks a lot.

1232
01:32:28,200 --> 01:32:29,907
And I don't know if anyone's
ever done that before.

1233
01:32:29,908 --> 01:32:32,033
Um, to my knowledge,
they haven't.

1234
01:32:32,074 --> 01:32:34,617
But it wasn't, you know,
me trying to be an innovator.

1235
01:32:36,241 --> 01:32:38,645
It wasn't me trying
to be an innovator to...

1236
01:32:38,669 --> 01:32:39,781
to wear the holster.

1237
01:32:39,782 --> 01:32:40,907
If I get followers, so be it.

1238
01:32:40,908 --> 01:32:43,866
- Yeah, so be it, exactly.
- I'm not gonna, like, stop them.

1239
01:32:47,908 --> 01:32:50,240
We're Interpol,
and you're watching MTV2.

1240
01:32:50,241 --> 01:32:51,948
You've had stuff's
thrown at you, like,

1241
01:32:51,949 --> 01:32:53,823
there's been panties
thrown at you, Carlos?

1242
01:32:53,824 --> 01:32:56,044
Uh,
there was an occasion where panties

1243
01:32:56,068 --> 01:32:57,407
were thrown at me, yes.

1244
01:32:57,408 --> 01:32:59,366
It seems like
you've been touring constantly.

1245
01:32:59,408 --> 01:33:01,199
It seems like you've hardly
really had a break.

1246
01:33:01,200 --> 01:33:03,282
What's fans reactions been
to this new album?

1247
01:33:03,283 --> 01:33:05,325
Wherever we've gone,
it's been just kind of, like,

1248
01:33:05,366 --> 01:33:07,575
a similar sort of
excitement and enthusiasm.

1249
01:33:09,325 --> 01:33:11,986
Before Napster,
we would have made

1250
01:33:12,010 --> 01:33:13,700
a shit load of money.

1251
01:33:15,617 --> 01:33:17,200
But actually...

1252
01:33:17,241 --> 01:33:18,741
I didn't really care.

1253
01:33:19,991 --> 01:33:22,829
Because people from
all around the world

1254
01:33:22,853 --> 01:33:24,741
found out about our music.

1255
01:33:27,782 --> 01:33:30,408
I remember thinking
back to all of those

1256
01:33:30,432 --> 01:33:32,450
guidance counselor meetings...

1257
01:33:34,116 --> 01:33:36,408
when I said,
""I wanna be a rock star.""

1258
01:33:49,200 --> 01:33:53,158
Yeah, but nobody searches

1259
01:33:53,200 --> 01:33:56,115
And nobody cares somehow

1260
01:33:56,116 --> 01:33:59,449
When the loving
that you've wasted

1261
01:33:59,450 --> 01:34:03,033
Comes raining from
a hapless cloud

1262
01:34:03,074 --> 01:34:06,283
And I might stop
and look upon your face

1263
01:34:06,325 --> 01:34:09,408
Disappear
in the sweet, sweet gaze

1264
01:34:09,450 --> 01:34:12,990
See the living
that surrounds me

1265
01:34:12,991 --> 01:34:16,617
Dissipate in a violet place

1266
01:34:18,533 --> 01:34:22,322
Can't you see what you've done

1267
01:34:22,346 --> 01:34:24,741
to my heart and soul

1268
01:34:25,450 --> 01:34:28,866
This is a wasteland now

1269
01:34:29,991 --> 01:34:33,199
We spies, we slow hands

1270
01:34:33,200 --> 01:34:36,616
Put the weights
around yourself

1271
01:34:36,617 --> 01:34:40,490
We spies, oh, yeah
We slow hands

1272
01:34:40,491 --> 01:34:43,407
We retire like nobody else

1273
01:34:43,408 --> 01:34:46,325
We spies
intimate slow hands

1274
01:34:46,366 --> 01:34:50,283
Killer for hire
you know not yourself

1275
01:34:55,782 --> 01:34:57,818
After falling from
the stage in a show

1276
01:34:57,842 --> 01:34:59,158
in Australia last month,

1277
01:34:59,200 --> 01:35:02,074
Karen O, the tough front woman
of the Yeah Yeah Yeahs

1278
01:35:02,116 --> 01:35:04,801
still managed to
compose herself enough

1279
01:35:04,825 --> 01:35:05,949
to perform Maps.

1280
01:36:00,158 --> 01:36:01,866
Pack up

1281
01:36:02,241 --> 01:36:04,074
I'm straight

1282
01:36:04,491 --> 01:36:06,200
Enough

1283
01:36:06,241 --> 01:36:08,200
Oh, say, say, say

1284
01:36:08,241 --> 01:36:10,200
Oh, say, say, say

1285
01:36:10,241 --> 01:36:12,241
Oh, say, say, say

1286
01:36:12,283 --> 01:36:14,241
Oh, say, say, say

1287
01:36:14,283 --> 01:36:16,366
Oh, say, say, say

1288
01:36:16,408 --> 01:36:20,366
Wait, they don't love you
like I love you

1289
01:36:20,408 --> 01:36:24,823
Wait, they don't love you
like I love you

1290
01:36:24,824 --> 01:36:28,824
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah

1291
01:36:28,866 --> 01:36:30,115
Just wait

1292
01:36:30,116 --> 01:36:33,074
They don't love you
like I love you

1293
01:37:04,241 --> 01:37:08,325
Wait, they don't love you
like I love you

1294
01:37:08,366 --> 01:37:12,699
Wait, they don't love you
like I love you

1295
01:37:12,700 --> 01:37:16,658
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah

1296
01:37:16,700 --> 01:37:17,658
Just wait

1297
01:37:17,659 --> 01:37:20,366
For they don't love you
like I love you

1298
01:37:20,408 --> 01:37:24,781
Wait, they don't love you
like I love you

1299
01:37:24,782 --> 01:37:28,617
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah

1300
01:37:28,658 --> 01:37:29,991
Just wait

1301
01:37:30,033 --> 01:37:32,782
They don't love you
like I love you

1302
01:38:18,450 --> 01:38:20,991
- I'm so annoyed with this dude.
- - What dude?

1303
01:38:21,033 --> 01:38:23,116
So, here it's just things like,

1304
01:38:23,158 --> 01:38:25,990
""I'm sad because
I had a show booked with LCD.""

1305
01:38:25,991 --> 01:38:28,782
""The date, like, all U.S. dates
got canceled.""

1306
01:38:28,824 --> 01:38:30,366
There was no fucking U.S. tour.

1307
01:38:30,408 --> 01:38:31,866
We never had a U.S. tour.

1308
01:38:31,908 --> 01:38:33,200
Are you responding to it?

1309
01:38:33,241 --> 01:38:35,282
- Yeah.
- What are you gonna say?

1310
01:38:35,283 --> 01:38:37,866
I have to say this
shit sounds a lot like

1311
01:38:37,890 --> 01:38:39,240
a fucking guilt trip.

1312
01:38:39,241 --> 01:38:40,741
What are you, my mother?

1313
01:38:40,782 --> 01:38:41,908
Eat it.

1314
01:38:42,782 --> 01:38:43,907
Fucking baby.

1315
01:38:43,908 --> 01:38:45,282
Why are you
getting so angry?

1316
01:38:45,283 --> 01:38:48,080
I...
Just the concept of emailing somebody

1317
01:38:48,104 --> 01:38:49,325
is so alien to me.

1318
01:39:07,866 --> 01:39:08,990
So, you're tied up?

1319
01:39:08,991 --> 01:39:11,948
- Oh, I don't wanna do this.
- I hate this so much.

1320
01:39:11,949 --> 01:39:14,357
James, I'm serious,
lip sync to a different song.

1321
01:39:14,369 --> 01:39:15,533
Sing a different song.

1322
01:39:15,575 --> 01:39:18,824
- I'm doing that now.
- It's called talking.

1323
01:39:18,866 --> 01:39:20,575
I can talk all day.

1324
01:39:28,741 --> 01:39:32,908
Those years
were the big bang of my life.

1325
01:39:41,241 --> 01:39:43,866
I finally found my friends.

1326
01:39:46,824 --> 01:39:48,575
Can we do claps again?

1327
01:39:53,533 --> 01:39:54,658
Yes!

1328
01:39:57,741 --> 01:39:59,408
I felt safe.

1329
01:40:08,033 --> 01:40:10,427
The Brooklyn Waterfront
will likely be getting

1330
01:40:10,451 --> 01:40:11,241
a makeover.

1331
01:40:11,283 --> 01:40:13,990
Mayor Bloomberg wants
to rezone part of the area...

1332
01:40:13,991 --> 01:40:15,282
The neighborhood
has had a rebirth

1333
01:40:15,283 --> 01:40:18,074
and now it's a choice location
for commerce and for living.

1334
01:40:18,116 --> 01:40:20,366
It is no longer
a well-kept secret.

1335
01:40:20,408 --> 01:40:22,479
What began with a
trickle has turned into

1336
01:40:22,503 --> 01:40:23,741
a flood of Manhattanites

1337
01:40:23,782 --> 01:40:25,626
crossing the East
River into Brooklyn's

1338
01:40:25,650 --> 01:40:26,908
Williamsburg neighborhood.

1339
01:40:26,949 --> 01:40:31,283
- Many of them drawn...
- - Our rent had tripled in three years.

1340
01:40:32,074 --> 01:40:35,074
The landlords cleared out
whole fucking buildings.

1341
01:40:36,241 --> 01:40:38,074
Pushing families out.

1342
01:40:43,325 --> 01:40:48,157
I was grieving
the dissipation of the scene.

1343
01:40:48,158 --> 01:40:51,866
I don't want to stick around
and just watch it go away.

1344
01:40:53,200 --> 01:40:54,908
I left New York City.

1345
01:40:56,782 --> 01:40:59,991
I felt too nostalgic for it
when everything happened.

1346
01:41:01,366 --> 01:41:02,570
See now,
everybody was just playing music,

1347
01:41:02,594 --> 01:41:03,324
you know what I'm saying.

1348
01:41:03,325 --> 01:41:06,281
- It's nuts, yeah, good music.
Everywhere.

1349
01:41:06,305 --> 01:41:07,283
- Yeah, yeah.

1350
01:41:07,325 --> 01:41:09,115
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

1351
01:41:09,116 --> 01:41:10,617
It was like a flash.

1352
01:41:56,491 --> 01:41:59,448
When we first met,
that's what we bonded over,

1353
01:41:59,472 --> 01:42:00,450
It was...

1354
01:42:00,491 --> 01:42:02,882
the belief that we
could accomplish

1355
01:42:02,906 --> 01:42:04,450
anything we wanted to.

1356
01:42:08,241 --> 01:42:09,948
Everything was so innocent,

1357
01:42:09,949 --> 01:42:13,199
and somehow
you lose it through time

1358
01:42:13,200 --> 01:42:14,973
and then you spend a lot of time

1359
01:42:14,997 --> 01:42:16,491
chasing that same innocence,

1360
01:42:16,533 --> 01:42:19,741
that feeling of
just being young.

1361
01:42:48,241 --> 01:42:50,948
Day upon day,

1362
01:42:50,949 --> 01:42:53,575
and year upon year, O city,

1363
01:42:53,949 --> 01:42:55,741
walking your streets,

1364
01:43:01,116 --> 01:43:03,908
Keep your splendid silent sun.

1365
01:43:05,074 --> 01:43:07,199
Keep your woods, O Nature,

1366
01:43:07,200 --> 01:43:09,866
and your corn-fields
and orchards.

1367
01:43:14,908 --> 01:43:17,575
Give me faces and streets!

1368
01:43:19,325 --> 01:43:22,032
Give me comrades
and lovers by the thousand!

1369
01:43:22,033 --> 01:43:24,199
Let me see
new ones every day!

1370
01:43:24,200 --> 01:43:26,533
Let me hold new ones
by the hand every day!

1371
01:43:26,575 --> 01:43:30,908
- Give me such shows!
- Give me the streets of Manhattan!

1372
01:43:33,658 --> 01:43:37,302
People, endless, streaming,
with strong voices,

1373
01:43:37,326 --> 01:43:38,824
passions, pageants.

1374
01:43:38,866 --> 01:43:42,357
Manhattan streets,
with their powerful throbs,

1375
01:43:42,381 --> 01:43:44,782
with the beating drums, as now.

1376
01:43:45,325 --> 01:43:48,116
The endless and noisy chorus.

1377
01:43:52,074 --> 01:43:57,366
Manhattan crowds with
their turbulent musical chorus.

1378
01:43:58,033 --> 01:44:03,741
Manhattan faces
and the eyes forever for me.

1379
01:44:26,158 --> 01:44:29,283
Many years since I was here

1380
01:44:31,116 --> 01:44:35,617
On the street
I was passing my time away

1381
01:44:36,241 --> 01:44:38,949
To the left
and to the right

1382
01:44:38,991 --> 01:44:41,658
Towers tumble to the sky

1383
01:44:41,700 --> 01:44:43,741
It's out of sight

1384
01:44:43,782 --> 01:44:45,908
In the dead of night

1385
01:44:47,366 --> 01:44:50,366
Here I am again in the city

1386
01:44:52,116 --> 01:44:53,991
With a fistful of dollars

1387
01:44:54,033 --> 01:44:58,199
And, baby,
you better believe I'm back

1388
01:44:58,200 --> 01:45:00,700
Back in the New York groove

1389
01:45:01,866 --> 01:45:03,282
I'm back

1390
01:45:03,283 --> 01:45:05,617

In the back of my Cadillac

1397
01:45:27,241 --> 01:45:29,781
A wicked lady
sittin' by my side

1398
01:45:29,782 --> 01:45:31,575
Sayin', ""Where are we?""

Stopped at Third

1400
01:45:35,033 --> 01:45:36,616
Exit to the night

1401
01:45:36,617 --> 01:45:39,115
It's gonna be ecstasy

1402
01:45:39,116 --> 01:45:41,741
This place was meant for me

1403
01:45:43,741 --> 01:45:48,158
I feel so good tonight

1404
01:45:48,200 --> 01:45:51,074
Who cares about tomorrow

1405

00:01:44,563 --> 00:01:48,859
Are those red leaves under
the summer sunshine...

2
00:01:49,484 --> 00:01:52,904
The same that hung
weakly on the day I left?

3
00:01:55,365 --> 00:01:58,577
At that time it seemed that every leaf
the Autumn took away...

4
00:02:00,037 --> 00:02:01,747
Took away a piece of my life.

5
00:02:16,303 --> 00:02:19,890
I don't know if it's been a long time
or not since I left this house.

6
00:02:20,682 --> 00:02:23,185
Or what I've been doing. Or where.

7
00:02:24,645 --> 00:02:26,897
Or why my husband
decided that I had to leave.

8
00:02:39,451 --> 00:02:40,911
Be strong.

9
00:02:44,039 --> 00:02:46,667
You have to look normal for your husband.

10
00:02:49,044 --> 00:02:50,962
It was me who insisted on your return.

11
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:55,300
And I know it's not gonna be easy, martine.

12
00:02:58,178 --> 00:03:01,181
But you have to fight so everything
can be as you and I planned.

13
00:03:05,268 --> 00:03:07,896
So everything can be as you and I planned.

14
00:03:09,189 --> 00:03:11,775
That everything goes as wished.

15
00:03:12,317 --> 00:03:13,985
Good fortune be with us.

16
00:03:14,736 --> 00:03:18,615
To be good and honest,

17
00:03:19,408 --> 00:03:20,826
worship god.

18
00:03:21,368 --> 00:03:22,494
Paradise is waiting for us.

19
00:03:23,787 --> 00:03:25,787
Paradise.

20
00:03:25,914 --> 00:03:27,749
Which one is your cardinal point?

21
00:03:28,917 --> 00:03:30,917
Earth?

22
00:03:30,711 --> 00:03:32,003
Which is your hell?

23
00:03:33,296 --> 00:03:35,132
Who made the lists of the forbidden?

24
00:03:36,675 --> 00:03:38,802
Who took the role of judgment?

25
00:03:39,970 --> 00:03:43,056
At what moment does the
day end and the night begin?

26
00:03:43,932 --> 00:03:47,519
At what moment do
pride, ambition and desire

27
00:03:48,103 --> 00:03:50,439
begin to be flowers of sin?

28
00:03:53,024 --> 00:03:54,151
We're almost there.

29
00:03:55,444 --> 00:03:58,113
Keep taking your
medication like at the clinic.

30
00:04:04,369 --> 00:04:08,582
If you need me, tell Wanda to call me.

31
00:04:16,673 --> 00:04:19,342
Miss, miss martine!

32
00:04:22,846 --> 00:04:24,765
Miss martine has arrived.

33
00:04:32,606 --> 00:04:35,650
Good morning, miss.
Did you have a good journey?

34
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:39,988
We're so happy to see you.

35
00:05:03,595 --> 00:05:07,265
This is your house. This is where we'll
live happily ever after.

36
00:05:08,391 --> 00:05:10,578
My father carried my mother
and they lived happy together

37
00:05:10,602 --> 00:05:13,063
until death took them apart.

38
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:15,480
I love you, Armando.

39
00:05:15,190 --> 00:05:17,150
I pray to god you'll never stop loving me.

40
00:05:17,692 --> 00:05:18,985
Never, ever.

41
00:05:20,195 --> 00:05:22,195
What are you doing there?

42
00:05:21,404 --> 00:05:23,404
I was waiting for you.

43
00:05:22,572 --> 00:05:24,783
- Where have you been?
- That's none of your business.

44
00:05:25,075 --> 00:05:26,355
Dear god! What's wrong with you?

45
00:05:26,660 --> 00:05:28,340
I barely see you, and even
when you're home

46
00:05:28,537 --> 00:05:30,872
I feel you're so distant.

47
00:05:32,999 --> 00:05:35,085
Miss martine, I'm so
happy to see you again.

48
00:05:35,377 --> 00:05:38,713
Miss martine. We've missed you
so much all these months.

49
00:05:43,677 --> 00:05:44,803
Goodbye, doctor.

50
00:05:45,679 --> 00:05:47,848
You're coming to visit next week, right?

51
00:05:53,854 --> 00:05:55,772
I didn't allow anyone to enter your room.

52
00:05:56,648 --> 00:05:58,900
Everything is still like the day you left.

53
00:05:59,192 --> 00:06:01,236
Hydrangeas. Thank you, Wanda.

54
00:06:21,882 --> 00:06:23,508
Is the Marquis at home?

55
00:06:25,719 --> 00:06:30,974
No, ma'am, he's out with that
young man he's been seeing lately.

56
00:06:33,977 --> 00:06:35,977
Who is he?

57
00:06:36,062 --> 00:06:37,814
I don't really know, ma'am.

58
00:06:38,148 --> 00:06:39,983
I only know his name is flor.

59
00:06:40,525 --> 00:06:43,987
He's undoubtedly a distinguished young man,

60
00:06:44,362 --> 00:06:46,382
although neither his character
or manners are those of a good person.

61
00:06:46,406 --> 00:06:48,450
I don't know what's wrong with the Marquis.

62
00:06:55,707 --> 00:07:03,707
Since you left, he's been seeing
some people of questionable morality.

63
00:08:00,271 --> 00:08:04,859
So what! You've seen me, so what? It's
not the first time you've seen me naked.

64
00:08:05,485 --> 00:08:08,405
Or are you disturbed to see
my young friend naked?

65
00:08:09,155 --> 00:08:11,157
He has a beautiful body, don't you think?

66
00:08:12,033 --> 00:08:14,285
Wouldn't you like to touch it?

67
00:08:15,412 --> 00:08:20,625
I like his mouth wide open like a pussy.
Inviting me to unknown pleasures.

68
00:08:21,084 --> 00:08:23,545
Martine! Martine!

69
00:08:25,547 --> 00:08:28,341
I like your mouth wide open like a pussy.

70
00:08:28,675 --> 00:08:30,885
Inviting me to unknown pleasures.

71
00:08:31,219 --> 00:08:33,722
Martine! Martine!

72
00:08:43,606 --> 00:08:47,318
Wait! Wait!

73
00:08:48,695 --> 00:08:54,701
Don't make me run. Don't make me run
anymore, darling. Wait!

74
00:08:56,453 --> 00:08:59,205
Flor! Flor!

75
00:09:01,875 --> 00:09:03,875
Wait, flor!

76
00:09:04,461 --> 00:09:08,631
Darling! Flor, darling. Wait.

77
00:09:10,341 --> 00:09:16,431
Don't run away again, my darling.

78
00:09:17,098 --> 00:09:19,434
Flor! Wait, wait.

79
00:09:20,727 --> 00:09:22,937
Wait. Flor, wait for me.

80
00:09:24,189 --> 00:09:26,189
Flor.

81
00:09:27,192 --> 00:09:29,192
Flor.

82
00:09:29,027 --> 00:09:30,361
Wait for me. Wait for me.

83
00:09:33,740 --> 00:09:36,117
Don't run so fast.

84
00:09:37,202 --> 00:09:38,995
- You can't get me!
- Wait.

85
00:09:41,039 --> 00:09:42,290
You can't get me.

86
00:09:44,292 --> 00:09:45,332
I will get you in the end.

87
00:09:46,336 --> 00:09:49,005
No, you won't.

88
00:09:49,380 --> 00:09:51,299
You rascal! Rascal!

89
00:09:55,595 --> 00:09:56,846
You won't get me.

90
00:09:58,598 --> 00:10:00,598
I'll get you! I promise.

91
00:09:59,891 --> 00:10:02,769
You cannot get me!

92
00:10:03,061 --> 00:10:04,854
Rascal! You're killing me!

93
00:10:07,190 --> 00:10:08,191
You cannot get me!

94
00:10:18,368 --> 00:10:21,079
Wait a second! Stop for a moment!

95
00:10:21,371 --> 00:10:24,040
- Don't be a rascal.
- You can't get me! No!

96
00:10:24,916 --> 00:10:27,752
Got you! Got you! Almost got you!
Come here, rascal.

97
00:10:28,336 --> 00:10:32,382
Come here flor, wait. I can't keep
going, wait. Wait, flor!

98
00:10:33,091 --> 00:10:34,592
Armando! Armando!

99
00:10:35,677 --> 00:10:37,053
There's a woman lying on the road.

100
00:10:49,983 --> 00:10:51,109
It's a nun.

101
00:10:51,943 --> 00:10:53,945
What bad taste to come here
and die on my land.

102
00:10:55,488 --> 00:10:57,488
She isn't dead.

103
00:10:57,157 --> 00:10:59,617
- Just passed out.
- What happened to her?

104
00:11:01,452 --> 00:11:04,330
I don't know.
It's just a kid, a novice.

105
00:11:05,623 --> 00:11:07,125
George! George!

106
00:11:21,598 --> 00:11:22,891
She's hurt.

107
00:11:29,272 --> 00:11:31,691
Maybe she's been raped, she's bleeding.

108
00:11:35,486 --> 00:11:37,486
What do we do with her?

109
00:11:40,575 --> 00:11:41,576
We'll take her home.

110
00:11:42,535 --> 00:11:44,579
Let's do it. Let's do it.

111
00:13:01,823 --> 00:13:03,700
How long has that young man been here?

112
00:13:08,788 --> 00:13:11,124
Afew months, and god forgive me...

113
00:13:15,378 --> 00:13:17,005
But I think that young man flor...

114
00:13:21,050 --> 00:13:22,427
Has been sent from hell.

115
00:13:24,304 --> 00:13:28,057
He is very young, pale, and attractive.
His beauty is so feminine.

116
00:13:28,766 --> 00:13:30,059
I don't know where he came from.

117
00:13:30,351 --> 00:13:32,312
One morning, I found
him in your husband's bed.

118
00:13:32,645 --> 00:13:35,325
He was completely naked. I asked him
who he was and what did he say?

119
00:13:35,398 --> 00:13:37,398
Tell me, Wanda.

120
00:13:38,568 --> 00:13:39,986
What did he say?

121
00:13:42,363 --> 00:13:43,990
That he was the lover of the Marquis.

122
00:13:45,199 --> 00:13:48,202
His lover? My husband never
had a sex drive.

123
00:13:51,122 --> 00:13:55,501
Then he laughed without
even covering himself.

124
00:15:17,542 --> 00:15:18,584
Do you like her, flor?

125
00:15:29,303 --> 00:15:32,807
She has soft and smooth skin.
This little nun is a temptation.

126
00:15:36,227 --> 00:15:38,521
My lady, I think it's true what flor said.

127
00:15:38,813 --> 00:15:40,773
That young man and your husband are lovers.

128
00:15:41,524 --> 00:15:45,403
I'm sorry to tell you,
I'm sorry to cause you sorrow.

129
00:15:45,695 --> 00:15:47,905
That perverted young man has possessed...

130
00:15:48,489 --> 00:15:50,366
Mr. Armando's will.

131
00:15:59,584 --> 00:16:01,127
Who are you? Where am I?

132
00:16:01,419 --> 00:16:05,298
You are at seteais palace.
Property of the Marquis of bressac.

133
00:16:05,590 --> 00:16:10,636
And I am the Marquis, a great fanatic of
hunting young slaves with smooth skin.

134
00:16:10,928 --> 00:16:11,929
Let me go! Let me go!

135
00:16:12,221 --> 00:16:14,301
- What were you doing on my property?
- I don't know.

136
00:16:14,474 --> 00:16:15,914
You escaped from the convent, right?

137
00:16:16,142 --> 00:16:18,745
With a young boy that dumped
you after having a good time with you?

138
00:16:18,769 --> 00:16:21,331
- Do you want me to get you back to the convent?
- No, please, no!

139
00:16:21,355 --> 00:16:23,357
Or do you prefer to stay with us?

140
00:16:24,275 --> 00:16:26,110
I prefer to stay with you.

141
00:16:26,402 --> 00:16:27,602
The little nun has good taste.

142
00:16:27,695 --> 00:16:28,905
Let's try her.

143
00:16:34,577 --> 00:16:38,122
A little rough tasting.
A peasant, without a doubt.

144
00:16:52,136 --> 00:16:55,306
C'mon Armando, it seems you like her.

145
00:17:00,186 --> 00:17:04,815
That young man has dragged the Marquis to the most
spiteful scandals and most sinful indulgences.

146
00:17:05,733 --> 00:17:07,733
Give me some!

147
00:17:11,989 --> 00:17:13,032
You must talk to him.

148
00:17:13,491 --> 00:17:15,326
This cannot be, ma'am.

149
00:17:20,081 --> 00:17:22,083
What can I do?

150
00:17:23,459 --> 00:17:25,711
He has not even greeted
me since my arrival.

151
00:17:38,808 --> 00:17:41,102
- Enough!
- My turn.

152
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:49,902
You have to stop those scandals
in your own house.

153
00:17:50,236 --> 00:17:51,529
And stop him from wasting money.

154
00:18:31,152 --> 00:18:34,113
Do it for the respect of your ancestors.

155
00:18:36,115 --> 00:18:41,954
Martine, I have a few
minutes left. I can't hide

156
00:18:42,663 --> 00:18:45,082
the truth from you.

157
00:18:46,167 --> 00:18:50,004
Since past generations...

158
00:18:50,338 --> 00:18:55,426
Our family has been suffering from
a shameful congenital disease.

159
00:18:55,718 --> 00:18:58,304
All have died from it.

160
00:18:59,055 --> 00:19:00,681
And you will too.

161
00:19:03,726 --> 00:19:05,061
I can't fight anymore.

162
00:19:06,771 --> 00:19:09,440
I don't even have self respect.

163
00:19:11,942 --> 00:19:16,030
And I can't feel anything else
for him but love.

164
00:19:17,156 --> 00:19:19,116
A hopeless love.

165
00:19:19,408 --> 00:19:21,035
Without illusions.

166
00:19:22,078 --> 00:19:24,288
Blind, I feel a savage desire.

167
00:19:25,206 --> 00:19:27,416
I'm filled with his scent.

168
00:19:29,001 --> 00:19:30,921
When somebody talks to me,
I only hear his voice.

169
00:19:37,134 --> 00:19:40,262
Do you understand me?

170
00:19:42,932 --> 00:19:44,350
What can I do?

171
00:19:49,230 --> 00:19:50,940
I'm in love.

172
00:19:54,819 --> 00:19:55,861
Do you understand me?

173
00:20:04,995 --> 00:20:06,995
What can I do?

174
00:20:15,798 --> 00:20:17,508
I love you, Armando.

175
00:20:19,427 --> 00:20:21,804
Why have you left me alone all this time?

176
00:20:23,556 --> 00:20:24,796
I know it was you who wanted...

177
00:20:26,225 --> 00:20:29,937
Me to be in that horrible place.

178
00:20:31,939 --> 00:20:34,734
Not for having an incurable illness,

179
00:20:36,444 --> 00:20:38,195
but to get rid of me.

180
00:20:39,822 --> 00:20:41,822
Why?

181
00:20:42,658 --> 00:20:44,160
I gave you everything.

182
00:20:46,078 --> 00:20:49,415
I let you drive me through turbulent roads.

183
00:20:51,333 --> 00:20:54,754
Now you leave me with
my body soaked in desire.

184
00:20:56,172 --> 00:20:59,633
After a long time dreaming of my return.

185
00:21:01,135 --> 00:21:04,597
To feel your skin against mine.

186
00:21:06,724 --> 00:21:08,350
Why, lord?

187
00:21:13,522 --> 00:21:18,486
Lord, bring him back to me.

188
00:21:19,695 --> 00:21:21,614
May he desire me like I desire him.

189
00:21:23,991 --> 00:21:27,161
Our father! Bring him to me.

190
00:21:28,871 --> 00:21:29,872
Our father.

191
00:21:30,581 --> 00:21:33,501
May his wet cock moisten my dry pussy.

192
00:21:35,669 --> 00:21:38,631
His cock, inside me...

193
00:21:39,131 --> 00:21:41,091
Forgive me, oh lord,
for talking to you like that.

194
00:21:48,599 --> 00:21:51,227
But I can't take it anymore.

195
00:21:51,602 --> 00:21:54,313
Have mercy on your daughter,
for she is consumed

196
00:21:54,605 --> 00:21:57,316
by love and desire. You understand
everything, oh lord! I need him.

197
00:22:19,088 --> 00:22:20,631
It's him, I need to meet him.

198
00:22:22,883 --> 00:22:26,136
I will knee! To him.

199
00:22:26,971 --> 00:22:28,556
I will beg him. I need love,

200
00:22:29,139 --> 00:22:31,559
or I will go truly crazy.

201
00:24:28,759 --> 00:24:33,222
Martine! I know you're there.

202
00:24:35,182 --> 00:24:38,435
Don't hide, come here!
Watch and learn from my friend.

203
00:24:39,061 --> 00:24:40,688
He really knows how to please me.

204
00:24:43,857 --> 00:24:45,857
Well, leave then!

205
00:24:45,234 --> 00:24:49,279
If you're in heat, go and look for
the maid. She consents to everything.

206
00:24:58,956 --> 00:25:06,956
Keep going, like that, like that...

207
00:26:33,467 --> 00:26:36,720
- Who are you?
- My name is Norma.

208
00:26:39,056 --> 00:26:41,433
The Marquis brought me here.

209
00:26:42,893 --> 00:26:44,853
Are you his wife? The Marquis?

210
00:26:48,232 --> 00:26:50,025
You're so pretty, Norma.

211
00:26:52,277 --> 00:26:55,447
Have you ever made love?
Tell me the truth.

212
00:26:57,658 --> 00:26:58,909
Yes, ma'am.

213
00:27:01,161 --> 00:27:02,788
But it hurt me so much.

214
00:27:08,627 --> 00:27:09,670
It doesn't always hurt.

215
00:27:15,592 --> 00:27:17,511
It doesn't hurt when a woman does it.

216
00:27:20,264 --> 00:27:22,891
Please, my lady.

217
00:27:25,602 --> 00:27:28,272
I love that sound.

218
00:27:29,690 --> 00:27:31,066
Like a scared birdie.

219
00:27:34,153 --> 00:27:36,572
And that little girl's
skin. And these tights.

220
00:27:41,660 --> 00:27:44,288
No, my lady, no.

221
00:27:55,716 --> 00:27:57,676
Relax.

222
00:27:59,469 --> 00:28:02,306
What do you feel?

223
00:28:04,433 --> 00:28:05,517
I feel a lot of heat.

224
00:28:13,525 --> 00:28:19,323
It's a great sin, please lady.

225
00:30:09,141 --> 00:30:13,645
Get out of here! Skank!

226
00:30:28,076 --> 00:30:29,536
Armando!

227
00:30:29,828 --> 00:30:31,788
Do it to me!

228
00:30:38,253 --> 00:30:40,172
Make love to me, Armando.

229
00:30:49,931 --> 00:30:52,934
Make love to me.

230
00:30:56,855 --> 00:30:58,482
I can't take it anymore.

231
00:31:03,320 --> 00:31:06,281
Get out of this room! You whore!

232
00:31:06,573 --> 00:31:08,909
Get out! Get out of here! Get out!

233
00:31:13,789 --> 00:31:15,789
Don't lock me up! No!

234
00:31:17,459 --> 00:31:19,459
I can't take it anymore.

235
00:31:20,212 --> 00:31:23,757
Do what you please with me,
but don't leave me alone again.

236
00:32:38,832 --> 00:32:42,294
- Good morning, my lady.
- Good morning, Norma.

237
00:32:46,214 --> 00:32:48,550
Did you sleep well? You look tired.

238
00:32:50,969 --> 00:32:52,969
I didn't sleep at all.

239
00:32:54,139 --> 00:32:56,139
Last night was horrible.

240
00:32:56,224 --> 00:32:58,560
What are you talking about?

241
00:33:00,270 --> 00:33:01,790
I wasn't myself, I was so mean to you.

242
00:33:03,023 --> 00:33:05,025
You have to forgive me.

243
00:33:06,860 --> 00:33:08,403
Why are you apologizing?

244
00:33:09,154 --> 00:33:11,948
I was deeply asleep.
I don't know what happened.

245
00:33:13,033 --> 00:33:15,410
I don't understand your apologies.

246
00:33:22,375 --> 00:33:23,710
I've been sick.

247
00:33:25,462 --> 00:33:26,880
I have an illness.

248
00:33:29,007 --> 00:33:30,258
I am very sick.

249
00:33:31,176 --> 00:33:32,552
Will you be patient?

250
00:33:33,303 --> 00:33:37,891
A pleasure to serve you, my lady. And I
don't see why I should change my mind.

251
00:33:41,102 --> 00:33:45,815
I am at your service, Marquis.
Your wishes are my commands.

252
00:33:51,071 --> 00:33:54,991
- We'll have our secrets, nobody will ever know it.
- Yes, ma'am.

253
00:33:56,660 --> 00:33:58,537
- You can leave now.
- Yes, ma'am.

254
00:35:07,147 --> 00:35:08,273
Good morning, my lady.

255
00:35:10,692 --> 00:35:14,112
Your husband called me, urgently.

256
00:35:14,404 --> 00:35:17,157
He said you had a nervous
breakdown last night.

257
00:35:18,074 --> 00:35:20,118
What happened?
Aren't you feeling well?

258
00:35:21,202 --> 00:35:24,539
Are you noticing some hostility around?

259
00:35:50,190 --> 00:35:52,359
You must relax, darling.

260
00:35:52,651 --> 00:35:56,446
Reality is sometimes hard,
difficult to manage.

261
00:35:57,197 --> 00:36:03,119
If you have another breakdown, the Marquis
will send you back to my clinic.

262
00:36:03,703 --> 00:36:06,039
Perhaps that's what he wants, right?

263
00:36:09,250 --> 00:36:13,713
- But that is not what we want.
- Do you think he wants to send me back?

264
00:36:14,005 --> 00:36:17,467
Of course. I'm sure.

265
00:36:19,219 --> 00:36:22,514
You have to be strong,
keep taking the medication.

266
00:36:24,432 --> 00:36:28,103
Follow my plan, step by step.

267
00:36:29,104 --> 00:36:30,397
I don't know, doctor.

268
00:36:31,564 --> 00:36:34,275
You have to fight! Fight, my lady!

269
00:36:35,068 --> 00:36:36,194
If I only knew how.

270
00:36:38,446 --> 00:36:41,241
Hold on to the idea of a better future.

271
00:36:41,741 --> 00:36:43,201
You still love him, right?

272
00:36:44,869 --> 00:36:49,165
You have to defeat that feeling.
Otherwise, we have little to do.

273
00:36:50,625 --> 00:36:52,625
Goodbye.

274
00:37:40,133 --> 00:37:41,801
George! Come here.

275
00:37:42,469 --> 00:37:43,749
- Yes, Marquis.
- Get the doctor.

276
00:37:54,689 --> 00:37:57,150
- Doctor, please come.
- What's going on?

277
00:37:58,610 --> 00:38:02,530
The Marquis wants to talk to you.
He is waiting in the main hall.

278
00:38:06,409 --> 00:38:10,789
- Yes, Marquis.
- I have some questions for you.

279
00:38:11,331 --> 00:38:15,960
In the new diagnosis you gave me,
besides the proper medication,

280
00:38:16,753 --> 00:38:19,631
there are some notes.

281
00:38:20,340 --> 00:38:23,301
Like martine can't experience
sociological

282
00:38:23,927 --> 00:38:26,513
and physical emotions.

283
00:38:27,180 --> 00:38:29,500
- Otherwise, any excitement could be fatal?
- That's right.

284
00:38:29,641 --> 00:38:33,436
- So, any strong emotion could kill her?
- Exactly.

285
00:38:33,853 --> 00:38:36,439
Also, sexual activity is not allowed?

286
00:38:37,273 --> 00:38:39,273
Correct.

287
00:38:40,109 --> 00:38:45,824
If by any reason I can't control her behavior,
and we have to face the fatal outcome,

288
00:38:46,199 --> 00:38:49,160
would I be charged with negligence?

289
00:38:50,203 --> 00:38:52,203
That's right.

290
00:38:54,624 --> 00:39:01,714
My father, the Marquis of bressac,
took your father out of ruin.

291
00:39:02,507 --> 00:39:04,676
That's why his unfortunate son was able

292
00:39:05,385 --> 00:39:08,012
to make a career, open a clinic,

293
00:39:08,805 --> 00:39:10,085
and be embraced by high society.

294
00:39:11,015 --> 00:39:13,518
I suppose you haven't forgotten all that.

295
00:39:15,144 --> 00:39:19,357
No, Marquis, that's why
I took care of your wife,

296
00:39:19,732 --> 00:39:24,696
kept her at my clinic for 8 months,
and I refused to accept any payment.

297
00:39:25,154 --> 00:39:28,324
That's very honorable,
but it doesn't matter to me.

298
00:39:28,950 --> 00:39:31,750
If I have to remind you of the things the
bressac family did for yours,

299
00:39:31,786 --> 00:39:35,832
it's because after my
wife's breakdown last night,

300
00:39:36,207 --> 00:39:38,960
it's probable she'll die some time soon.

301
00:39:39,878 --> 00:39:42,088
In that case, I expect you can extend

302
00:39:42,630 --> 00:39:48,136
a certificate to exonerate me of all
negligence that can affect me.

303
00:39:51,890 --> 00:39:54,267
These are hard times, doctor.

304
00:39:54,642 --> 00:40:00,732
Lots of corrupt public servants would be
so happy to denigrate the aristocracy.

305
00:40:01,774 --> 00:40:03,568
I hope that isn't your case, doctor.

306
00:40:04,027 --> 00:40:12,027
And that you will keep
the diagnosis between us.

307
00:40:13,953 --> 00:40:17,415
Otherwise, it will look like I caused her
death to seize her father's great fortune.

308
00:40:17,874 --> 00:40:22,754
And don't forget, the bressacs still have enough
power to ruin you. Do you understand, doctor?

309
00:40:24,172 --> 00:40:26,172
Yes, sir.

310
00:40:32,639 --> 00:40:40,063
- Miss, please, calm down.
- I can't, Wanda.

311
00:40:44,275 --> 00:40:49,113
Armando, Armando, listen to me.

312
00:40:49,822 --> 00:40:52,408
Why don't you come in?
Why are you evading me?

313
00:40:53,034 --> 00:40:55,914
Why don't you talk to me? Don't forget
I'm your wife. Can't you remember?

314
00:40:56,537 --> 00:40:58,457
Unfortunately, I haven't
been able to forget it.

315
00:41:08,841 --> 00:41:12,887
A dried Rose in a buttonhole.
The last page of an old, unfinished diary.

316
00:41:13,388 --> 00:41:17,642
A guitar missing strings. A clock without a
pendulum. A weather vane without an arrow.

317
00:41:18,309 --> 00:41:21,938
I am all that without you, martine.
Do you like it? Tell me.

318
00:41:28,569 --> 00:41:34,617
Here is my dear wife. We are honored
to have her presence.

319
00:41:35,827 --> 00:41:37,827
Thank you.

320
00:41:37,036 --> 00:41:39,747
Today it's a very special date.

321
00:41:40,623 --> 00:41:43,918
It's the 3rd anniversary of
her first mental breakdown.

322
00:41:46,254 --> 00:41:48,254
Cheers!

323
00:41:51,884 --> 00:41:54,137
Martine is a very unique woman,

324
00:41:54,721 --> 00:41:56,472
as is her madness, schizophrenia.

325
00:41:58,766 --> 00:42:01,686
Produced by congenital syphilis.

326
00:42:02,395 --> 00:42:03,604
Hush Armando, please.

327
00:42:10,653 --> 00:42:16,117
I will not shut up. I want my friends to be
aware of all your attributes, darling.

328
00:42:22,665 --> 00:42:26,961
That's the reason you stayed tonight?
To use me as the target of your cynicism.

329
00:42:27,712 --> 00:42:29,464
Not at all, darling.

330
00:42:31,215 --> 00:42:33,843
Correct me if I'm wrong. She's a model
for a married woman.

331
00:42:40,641 --> 00:42:44,645
And almost the perfect lover.

332
00:42:50,485 --> 00:42:52,153
Right, my love?

333
00:42:55,073 --> 00:43:02,205
Delicate alabaster skin, like a
pale fruit ripped from a greenhouse.

334
00:43:04,749 --> 00:43:11,172
A sweet soft fruit, but also one who
will be quickly filled with worms.

335
00:43:34,779 --> 00:43:38,825
The most devoted painter would dream to
paint those two apples of temptation.

336
00:43:39,659 --> 00:43:41,659
Thank you!

337
00:43:57,260 --> 00:43:58,761
I'm afraid she got mad.

338
00:44:04,600 --> 00:44:06,978
Cheers to the most stupid wife!

339
00:44:47,268 --> 00:44:55,268
Norma, my little one. You must help me, help us.
Our lives will be a paradise when she's gone.

340
00:45:09,665 --> 00:45:12,084
Also we'll be rich, the 3 of us.

341
00:45:13,169 --> 00:45:14,253
What do you want me to do?

342
00:45:21,761 --> 00:45:26,557
- She's very nice to me.
- Very nice to you, but very bad to your master.

343
00:45:27,475 --> 00:45:28,684
She's a crazy bitch.

344
00:45:30,937 --> 00:45:38,152
Maybe she has been nice in recent days, but she
can change suddenly, and turn into a cruel monster.

345
00:45:38,653 --> 00:45:39,779
What do you want me to do?

346
00:45:40,947 --> 00:45:43,908
You have to help us to get rid of her.

347
00:45:44,825 --> 00:45:46,786
- Kill her?
- Yes.

348
00:45:47,828 --> 00:45:51,624
I know it's an unpleasant word.

349
00:45:53,417 --> 00:45:55,417
How?

350
00:46:00,758 --> 00:46:02,927
It's very simple, she trusts you.

351
00:46:04,887 --> 00:46:06,305
You always serve her food.

352
00:46:07,139 --> 00:46:13,145
- Yes, but Wanda is the one who cooks it.
- You will hide this little box in her room.

353
00:46:21,279 --> 00:46:22,280
Is this poison?

354
00:46:25,366 --> 00:46:29,620
No, it's a stimulant, a strong one.

355
00:46:30,162 --> 00:46:33,624
You will put it in her morning coffee
or in a glass of milk.

356
00:46:36,502 --> 00:46:37,920
She will die peacefully.

357
00:46:39,380 --> 00:46:40,881
Without evidence.

358
00:46:43,551 --> 00:46:47,179
Nobody would accuse you of anything.

359
00:46:47,763 --> 00:46:51,142
Will you do it? Tell me you will
do it, little one.

360
00:46:53,686 --> 00:46:56,314
Say yes, beautiful.

361
00:46:57,606 --> 00:47:03,195
It will be so easy and after...

362
00:47:05,740 --> 00:47:10,077
It will be paradise for the 3 of us.

363
00:47:20,671 --> 00:47:25,885
And love, and fortune.

364
00:51:11,902 --> 00:51:14,363
My lady! Are you ok?

365
00:51:34,675 --> 00:51:36,675
My lady!

366
00:51:42,725 --> 00:51:45,352
My lady! Where are you?

367
00:52:04,079 --> 00:52:08,208
- Let's go, Eros. To the clinic of doctor louys.
- Yes, madam.

368
00:52:40,783 --> 00:52:43,619
- Where is Wanda going?
- To the house of doctor louys.

369
00:52:44,119 --> 00:52:47,665
- How do you know?
- I heard her giving instructions to the rider.

370
00:52:52,252 --> 00:52:54,380
And she thinks he is going to help?

371
00:53:10,771 --> 00:53:15,401
- The Marquis knows you're here?
- No, doctor.

372
00:53:15,901 --> 00:53:18,070
You know those are
very serious accusations.

373
00:53:18,362 --> 00:53:21,990
You are telling me the
Marquis is a murderer.

374
00:53:22,741 --> 00:53:24,741
Yes, doctor.

375
00:53:23,909 --> 00:53:27,204
And what proof do you have of it?
Besides overhearing through a door,

376
00:53:27,705 --> 00:53:31,792
and assuming you're not mistaken?

377
00:53:32,167 --> 00:53:33,669
I'm sure of it.

378
00:53:34,044 --> 00:53:36,672
The bressacs have always
been a role model couple.

379
00:53:38,424 --> 00:53:40,424
Just appearances.

380
00:53:40,384 --> 00:53:43,303
I live there and if you don't
help her, she could die.

381
00:53:44,972 --> 00:53:46,682
The Marquis is an honorable man.

382
00:53:47,516 --> 00:53:51,979
And very powerful. I should have known
you would never confront him.

383
00:53:52,813 --> 00:53:54,898
Excuse me for wasting your time, doctor.

384
00:54:37,399 --> 00:54:39,610
- Good afternoon, Norma.
- Good afternoon.

385
00:54:40,944 --> 00:54:43,739
- Do you mind if I sit here?
- I don't mind at all.

386
00:54:44,948 --> 00:54:47,284
Sometimes it's much better to be alone.

387
00:54:48,327 --> 00:54:52,748
At those times the presence of
anyone disturbs me.

388
00:54:55,250 --> 00:54:59,546
- But sometimes it's better to vent our feelings.
- I regret some things.

389
00:55:01,548 --> 00:55:02,800
That's a sincere feeling.

390
00:55:06,220 --> 00:55:09,348
I stopped caring about
others a long time ago.

391
00:55:13,268 --> 00:55:16,522
When I was a little kid and my father
started to call me flor just for fun.

392
00:55:20,609 --> 00:55:23,070
And he dressed me like a girl to
expose me to his friends.

393
00:55:25,113 --> 00:55:26,365
I used to hate him for a while,

394
00:55:27,032 --> 00:55:29,326
but then I enjoyed it.

395
00:55:31,537 --> 00:55:32,788
Now I'm so confused.

396
00:55:37,835 --> 00:55:40,128
- I think I'm in love with you.
- Me too.

397
00:55:44,341 --> 00:55:49,888
Thank you for telling me. But if that's the
case you have to put sentimentality aside.

398
00:55:50,597 --> 00:55:52,015
If that woman dies, we win.

399
00:55:52,516 --> 00:55:54,726
And maybe one day we could run away.

400
00:55:55,644 --> 00:56:00,858
You and I, together without
Armando de bressac.

401
00:56:01,567 --> 00:56:04,611
Deep inside, we both hate him to death.

402
00:56:12,119 --> 00:56:15,163
I love you, Armando.

403
00:56:16,248 --> 00:56:19,126
Tonight I will look for you,
and I will be as you wish,

404
00:56:20,168 --> 00:56:22,629
more indecent than ever.
You will take me in your arms.

405
00:56:50,240 --> 00:56:58,240
You will take me to the bed.
Uncover my breasts.

406
00:57:06,423 --> 00:57:09,176
You have always loved 'em.

407
00:57:12,262 --> 00:57:16,141
You will caress them.

408
00:57:19,770 --> 00:57:23,649
First softly and gently.

409
00:57:24,650 --> 00:57:31,782
Then your hands will turn
violent against my flesh.

410
00:57:44,503 --> 00:57:49,132
Then you'll descend slowly...

411
00:57:49,758 --> 00:57:57,641
To my pussy, and you will touch it
with uncontrollable desire.

412
00:58:29,006 --> 00:58:37,006
The first Marquis of bressac.
What an idiot! What an idiot!

413
00:58:42,352 --> 00:58:45,439
The Marquis of the idiots!

414
00:58:47,941 --> 00:58:49,317
Poor bressac.

415
00:58:51,862 --> 00:58:53,196
Hated by everybody.

416
00:58:55,198 --> 00:58:58,160
Even by his stupid housekeeper.

417
00:59:34,112 --> 00:59:35,781
Open the door, Wanda.

418
00:59:40,660 --> 00:59:43,705
- Good evening, Wanda.
- Good evening, Marquis. What do you want?

419
00:59:48,168 --> 00:59:49,795
You still have a hideous body...

420
00:59:50,420 --> 00:59:54,424
Like the last time we fucked.

421
00:59:55,926 --> 00:59:57,511
Don't worry, I'm not here to make love,

422
00:59:58,637 --> 00:59:59,846
but to kill you.

423
01:00:05,185 --> 01:00:06,228
Bitch!

424
01:00:28,333 --> 01:00:30,585
You thought the doctor wouldn't tell me?

425
01:00:31,628 --> 01:00:35,674
Everybody hates me, but
at the end I step on them.

426
01:00:36,049 --> 01:00:39,761
Like I'm stepping on you right now, Wanda.

427
01:02:24,324 --> 01:02:26,701
- Good morning, martine. How are you?
- Same, doctor.

428
01:02:28,745 --> 01:02:30,622
It seems you had a relapse yesterday.

429
01:02:32,582 --> 01:02:34,582
Yes, I did.

430
01:02:45,178 --> 01:02:48,056
We don't have much time.
Besides, they could be listening.

431
01:02:48,348 --> 01:02:51,643
Your husband told me that you have
imagined seeing Wanda strangled.

432
01:02:51,935 --> 01:02:55,897
But the truth is, she has vanished after
a few hours of visiting my clinic

433
01:02:56,189 --> 01:02:58,692
and accusing him of trying to kill you.

434
01:02:59,234 --> 01:03:02,988
- Martine, are you ready to follow my plans?
- Yes.

435
01:03:04,572 --> 01:03:07,492
Calm down, rest and avoid excitement.

436
01:03:10,662 --> 01:03:14,124
And of course keep taking the medication.
It seems your condition hasn't worsened.

437
01:03:18,878 --> 01:03:25,468
I'll read your document carefully, martine.
I hope you agree to my ideas.

438
01:03:32,475 --> 01:03:34,475
Have a nice day.

439
01:03:55,874 --> 01:04:01,838
Martine, listen to me. That bastard
doesn't deserve to live.

440
01:04:02,464 --> 01:04:07,344
He has destroyed your life, like everything
that crosses his path. Don't you want revenge?

441
01:04:49,386 --> 01:04:53,098
Here my lady, your glass of milk.
It's hot.

442
01:05:00,230 --> 01:05:04,275
Leave it there. Norma, tell me.

443
01:05:05,276 --> 01:05:07,654
- Do you love me?
- Yes, ma'am.

444
01:06:03,835 --> 01:06:05,545
Don't you like me instead, martine?

445
01:06:43,958 --> 01:06:50,465
Yes, Armando, come here my love.
Finally, finally.

446
01:06:51,341 --> 01:06:53,341
Come here.

447
01:07:34,384 --> 01:07:36,135
George, come here with us.

448
01:07:56,281 --> 01:07:58,825
No! Why?

449
01:08:18,428 --> 01:08:25,268
Poor thing. My sweet wife has died.
Ego te absolvo a peccatis tuis.

450
01:08:37,864 --> 01:08:42,076
Poor martine! Poor martine!

451
01:08:42,744 --> 01:08:47,081
- Poor martine!
- Poor martine.

452
01:08:48,708 --> 01:08:50,376
Poor martine.

453
01:08:51,878 --> 01:08:54,797
Poor martine, she's dead.

454
01:08:55,381 --> 01:08:57,467
- Poor martine.
- Poor martine.

455
01:08:58,468 --> 01:08:59,802
Poor martine.

456
01:09:00,553 --> 01:09:02,680
Poor martine.

457
01:11:51,599 --> 01:11:54,602
Look at them Marquis, the two lovers.

458
01:11:56,229 --> 01:11:58,229
What a romantic scene.

459
01:12:00,274 --> 01:12:03,319
Did you imagine the young flor
being that enamored?

460
01:12:12,203 --> 01:12:16,624
Yes, he is a kid, he doesn't have a
sense of honesty and loyalty.

461
01:12:18,042 --> 01:12:24,882
And you have no right to be that nosy.

462
01:13:15,850 --> 01:13:23,850
I love you! I love you! Yes! Yes!

463
01:20:05,801 --> 01:20:10,222
You! You came back from hell!

464
01:20:10,848 --> 01:20:14,893
Are you here to help me
or to drag me to my ruin?

465
01:20:15,477 --> 01:20:18,355
- I've returned to see you die.
- Are you alive?

466
01:20:18,814 --> 01:20:20,774
Or a ghost in my mind?

467
01:20:21,442 --> 01:20:23,442
You're alive!

468
01:20:28,407 --> 01:20:30,407
It's true.

469
01:20:30,826 --> 01:20:33,746
Now you are going to pay once and for all.

470
01:20:40,711 --> 01:20:41,795
What are you gonna do?

471
01:20:48,635 --> 01:20:50,929
The blood is still fresh.

472
01:20:55,559 --> 01:20:57,603
Yes, thank you for coming.

473
01:21:03,942 --> 01:21:06,403
Do it, martine. Do it.

474
01:21:08,614 --> 01:21:09,894
Do it. What are you waiting for?

475
01:21:10,449 --> 01:21:13,160
Do it! Do it! Do it!

476
01:22:16,682 --> 01:22:18,267
Louys.

477
01:22:23,605 --> 01:22:26,900
My love, be brave.
It's a new beginning for you.

478
01:22:27,359 --> 01:22:28,861
I'm scared.

479
01:22:30,070 --> 01:22:33,323
I destroyed your death
certificate. Everything is in order.

480
01:22:33,657 --> 01:22:35,657
They will not charge you.

481
01:22:35,325 --> 01:22:38,537
I will write a certificate.

482
01:22:41,790 --> 01:22:43,417
This is horrible.

483
01:22:44,460 --> 01:22:45,794
Just for a few months.

484
01:22:46,336 --> 01:22:49,715
Then we are heading far
away with all your money.

485
01:22:51,008 --> 01:22:55,721
Until you forget these sad
walls and this sad story.

[Matthew sighing]

22
00:02:07,662 --> 00:02:10,364
This is my film school
graduation film.

23
00:02:13,501 --> 00:02:15,503
45 minutes of crap.

24
00:02:17,204 --> 00:02:19,707
More scripts. Oh!

25
00:02:19,841 --> 00:02:21,876
The very first draft

26
00:02:22,376 --> 00:02:24,812
of <i>The Emperor's New Groove,</i>

27
00:02:24,946 --> 00:02:27,180
when it was called
<i>Children of the Sun.</i>

28
00:02:27,314 --> 00:02:30,317
Oh, my God! Floppies.

29
00:02:31,853 --> 00:02:33,054
-[Stephanie] Do you want this?
-[Matthew] Jesus.

30
00:02:33,186 --> 00:02:34,756
It's like I was on the run.

31
00:02:34,889 --> 00:02:37,058
I got the lid,
'cause I have the pot.

32
00:02:37,190 --> 00:02:38,191
Okay.

33
00:02:38,325 --> 00:02:40,360
Finding this in the query pile?

34
00:02:41,763 --> 00:02:44,799
This would be just like
the meetings that we have,

35
00:02:44,932 --> 00:02:46,299
but with George Lucas.

36
00:02:49,504 --> 00:02:51,405
[bottles clatter]

37
00:02:57,045 --> 00:02:58,780
Oh, United States.

38
00:02:58,913 --> 00:03:01,348
No. Denial.

39
00:03:01,481 --> 00:03:03,117
[Matthew] Oh,
somebody gave me that.

40
00:03:03,250 --> 00:03:04,519
Do you want it?

41
00:03:05,753 --> 00:03:06,821
Not yet.

42
00:03:08,656 --> 00:03:10,925
-This is relevant.
-It's like Christmas.

43
00:03:11,059 --> 00:03:12,794
<i>Doctor Who: Regeneration.</i>

44
00:03:12,927 --> 00:03:15,495
This is all about my--
my Doctor.

45
00:03:15,630 --> 00:03:18,766
And, um,
it's written by Phil Segal,

46
00:03:19,232 --> 00:03:22,937
and he says some deeply personal
stuff about me in here,

47
00:03:23,071 --> 00:03:25,540
which is totally inaccurate.

48
00:03:26,808 --> 00:03:29,342
I was just a hired hand,
I was a writer,

49
00:03:29,476 --> 00:03:31,478
who came up with a good idea,

50
00:03:31,612 --> 00:03:35,516
which was, ""Let's have
the Doctor lose his memory,

51
00:03:35,650 --> 00:03:39,053
and then have to try
and work out who he is,

52
00:03:39,187 --> 00:03:41,421
and that will introduce him

53
00:03:41,556 --> 00:03:43,490
to the American public.""

54
00:03:43,991 --> 00:03:45,827
Yeah,
really bad special effects.

55
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:49,097
That light's meant to be coming
from his eyes,

56
00:03:49,229 --> 00:03:50,397
instead of him sitting up

57
00:03:50,531 --> 00:03:53,000
and peering
into my storage unit.

58
00:03:53,835 --> 00:03:56,704
<i>Doctor Who</i> was conceived
as a children's show

59
00:03:56,838 --> 00:03:58,573
in 1963,

60
00:03:58,706 --> 00:04:01,743
about a Time Lord
from the planet Gallifrey,

61
00:04:01,876 --> 00:04:04,779
who travels through time
and space saving people.

62
00:04:05,613 --> 00:04:07,982
And his spaceship
is called the TARDIS,

63
00:04:08,116 --> 00:04:12,252
T-A-R-D-I-S, Time and Relative
Dimension In Space.

64
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:15,288
It's bigger on the inside.

65
00:04:16,624 --> 00:04:18,893
He's an alien,
he looks like a human,

66
00:04:19,026 --> 00:04:20,728
but he has two hearts.

67
00:04:21,495 --> 00:04:23,765
You also can't kill him.

68
00:04:24,565 --> 00:04:26,366
He regenerates
and comes back to life

69
00:04:26,501 --> 00:04:29,336
as a different Doctor,
but the same Doctor.

70
00:04:29,871 --> 00:04:32,974
He's had about 12
or 13 lives so far,

71
00:04:33,107 --> 00:04:34,542
maybe 50, who knows?

72
00:04:34,675 --> 00:04:36,244
Depends
when you're watching this.

73
00:04:36,376 --> 00:04:37,678
[bangs on door]

74
00:04:37,812 --> 00:04:39,781
I wrote the Eighth Doctor,

75
00:04:41,015 --> 00:04:42,750
played by Paul McGann.

76
00:04:47,021 --> 00:04:50,158
Since the BBC
abandoned the show,

77
00:04:50,290 --> 00:04:51,692
nearly a decade before,

78
00:04:51,826 --> 00:04:54,461
my job was to write
a TV movie pilot

79
00:04:54,595 --> 00:04:55,863
with the hope
that it would spawn

80
00:04:55,997 --> 00:04:59,066
a new American
<i>Doctor Who</i> series.

81
00:04:59,700 --> 00:05:01,903
So we had Paul McGann
as the Eighth Doctor,

82
00:05:02,036 --> 00:05:05,740
we had Daphne Ashbrook
as his companion,

83
00:05:05,873 --> 00:05:07,608
we had Eric Roberts
as the Master.

84
00:05:07,742 --> 00:05:11,913
We were sure this could be
a long-running show.

85
00:05:13,446 --> 00:05:14,782
But our big mistake

86
00:05:14,916 --> 00:05:17,251
was to make the Doctor
half-human.

87
00:05:17,417 --> 00:05:19,921
The Doctor is half-human!

88
00:05:20,955 --> 00:05:22,123
No wonder.

89
00:05:22,256 --> 00:05:23,858
[Matthew] And we had him kiss.

90
00:05:25,526 --> 00:05:27,161
-What?
-What?

91
00:05:27,795 --> 00:05:29,063
[in slow-motion] What?

92
00:05:30,430 --> 00:05:32,099
[in slower slow-motion] What?

93
00:05:33,734 --> 00:05:35,570
[Matthew] Two fatal errors.

94
00:05:35,970 --> 00:05:38,105
And it wasn't picked up
as a series.

95
00:05:47,114 --> 00:05:48,549
I'd always assumed

96
00:05:48,683 --> 00:05:50,483
that maybe the reason
he wasn't doing conventions

97
00:05:50,618 --> 00:05:53,621
was perhaps he, um,

98
00:05:53,754 --> 00:05:55,355
was feeling defensive

99
00:05:55,488 --> 00:05:58,425
about fans asking questions
about the movie.

100
00:06:01,329 --> 00:06:04,131
Bad <i>Doctor Who</i> is better
than no <i>Doctor Who.</i>

101
00:06:06,934 --> 00:06:08,769
[interviewer] <i>Are you saying,</i>
<i>then, you liked the movie?</i>

102
00:06:08,903 --> 00:06:10,171
<i>'Cause if you didn't,</i>
<i>that's fine, too.</i>

103
00:06:10,304 --> 00:06:11,639
No, no, I di-- well, I'm aware

104
00:06:11,772 --> 00:06:13,975
that the writer's
within earshot, um...

105
00:06:16,177 --> 00:06:18,646
It was recognizable
as <i>Doctor Who.</i>

106
00:06:20,081 --> 00:06:21,515
[Matthew]
I didn't go to conventions

107
00:06:21,649 --> 00:06:23,017
for a very good reason.

108
00:06:23,684 --> 00:06:25,620
I thought
the fans would kill me.

109
00:06:28,556 --> 00:06:31,893
But my longtime collaborator
and friend, Vanessa Yuille,

110
00:06:32,026 --> 00:06:34,528
encouraged me
to accept invitations,

111
00:06:34,662 --> 00:06:37,497
and indeed,
make a film about my journey

112
00:06:37,632 --> 00:06:39,166
back into that world.

113
00:06:43,271 --> 00:06:46,741
Now, opportunity had arisen,
and I needed the money.

114
00:06:47,275 --> 00:06:51,411
People are gonna pay me
20 bucks for my signature.

115
00:06:51,545 --> 00:06:53,581
And now I'm beginning to wonder

116
00:06:53,714 --> 00:06:55,816
why I've never done this before.

117
00:06:56,416 --> 00:06:58,451
But also, this is the budget.

118
00:06:59,553 --> 00:07:00,955
So, over the next year,

119
00:07:01,088 --> 00:07:03,524
Vanessa dragged me
to conventions in Los Angeles,

120
00:07:04,058 --> 00:07:08,562
in New York,
and in and out of fans' homes.

121
00:07:09,597 --> 00:07:10,831
[Vanessa] Be nice.

122
00:07:11,999 --> 00:07:14,335
It sounds like I'm the only one
at the table here

123
00:07:14,467 --> 00:07:16,570
who actually saw your movie

124
00:07:16,704 --> 00:07:18,606
the night
it was broadcast on Fox.

125
00:07:18,739 --> 00:07:19,774
Well, I'm one of people
in America

126
00:07:19,907 --> 00:07:21,108
that did watch it, you know?

127
00:07:21,242 --> 00:07:23,010
We were hoping
this was the birth,

128
00:07:23,144 --> 00:07:24,812
the pilot to a series,

129
00:07:24,946 --> 00:07:26,814
that this was going to
launch us,

130
00:07:26,948 --> 00:07:28,916
that Doctor Who
was going to be back.

131
00:07:29,050 --> 00:07:30,551
I knew that <i>Doctor Who</i>
had been off the air,

132
00:07:30,685 --> 00:07:32,420
they'd stopped showing it
on PBS,

133
00:07:32,553 --> 00:07:34,055
and then this thing
was coming out

134
00:07:34,188 --> 00:07:36,624
and it was new,
and people were excited.

135
00:07:49,737 --> 00:07:51,005
There was a lot of enthusiasm

136
00:07:51,138 --> 00:07:53,708
around the movie coming back
in 1996, um,

137
00:07:53,841 --> 00:07:55,876
and people were really
putting all their hopes

138
00:07:56,010 --> 00:07:58,412
into it leading
to a new TV series,

139
00:07:58,546 --> 00:08:00,881
and I think a lot of people
were very devastated by the fact

140
00:08:01,015 --> 00:08:02,850
that it didn't lead
to a series at that point.

141
00:08:03,351 --> 00:08:06,654
[announcer] <i>It's 2005,</i>
<i>and the Doctor is finally back!</i>

142
00:08:07,288 --> 00:08:09,824
<i>Christopher Eccleston</i>
<i>stars as the Ninth Doctor,</i>

143
00:08:09,957 --> 00:08:12,660
<i>and he's ready</i>
<i>to save the world.</i>

144
00:08:13,194 --> 00:08:15,129
Since they brought
the series back in 2005,

145
00:08:15,262 --> 00:08:16,464
it's just taken off.

146
00:08:16,864 --> 00:08:19,000
Nobody really expected
<i>Doctor Who</i> to come back anytime

147
00:08:19,133 --> 00:08:20,701
at-- at any point
in the near future.

148
00:08:20,835 --> 00:08:22,737
And then when it did,
I think it was just--

149
00:08:22,870 --> 00:08:26,440
it was literally
the second wind in a life.

150
00:08:26,574 --> 00:08:28,376
-Hi, how're you doing, sir?
-[Matthew] Good, you?

151
00:08:28,509 --> 00:08:29,777
Good.

152
00:08:29,910 --> 00:08:31,812
It's a bit posey, isn't it?

153
00:08:31,946 --> 00:08:33,647
I don't look like a dork.

154
00:08:34,081 --> 00:08:35,516
-There you go.
-[crewmember] <i>There you go.</i>

155
00:08:35,649 --> 00:08:36,650
-[crewmember 2] <i>Yeah.</i>
-All right.

156
00:08:36,784 --> 00:08:37,618
[crewmember] <i>Good compromise.</i>

157
00:08:38,152 --> 00:08:39,620
[crewmember 2]
<i>Put your hand down.</i>

158
00:08:41,756 --> 00:08:43,657
The movie bridges the gap

159
00:08:43,791 --> 00:08:45,960
from the old series
to the new series.

160
00:08:46,093 --> 00:08:48,562
And it's--
it's very much a forerunner

161
00:08:48,696 --> 00:08:50,965
of what <i>Doctor Who</i>
has become now.

162
00:08:53,034 --> 00:08:54,668
[Matthew] This isn't Comic-Con.

163
00:08:55,870 --> 00:08:58,606
This is a very particular
kind of fair.

164
00:08:59,673 --> 00:09:01,542
These guys are fanatics,

165
00:09:01,675 --> 00:09:04,645
but they exist
within a special corner

166
00:09:04,779 --> 00:09:06,313
of American fandom.

167
00:09:06,447 --> 00:09:08,015
-Hi! Hi!
-How are you?

168
00:09:08,149 --> 00:09:09,717
-Good, how are you?
-Good.

169
00:09:09,850 --> 00:09:11,285
This is the thing,
this is like--

170
00:09:11,419 --> 00:09:14,989
I'm not a celebrity,
I don't have fans,

171
00:09:15,122 --> 00:09:17,691
but somehow, in this world?

172
00:09:18,259 --> 00:09:19,827
I'm suddenly a guest.

173
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:21,929
[announcer speaking
indistinctly]

174
00:09:22,063 --> 00:09:24,498
[crowd applauding, cheering]

175
00:09:24,632 --> 00:09:27,034
[announcer speaking
indistinctly]

176
00:09:31,806 --> 00:09:33,040
-[Matthew] No.
-Here all on me own?

177
00:09:33,174 --> 00:09:34,308
[Matthew]
Well, then you come back there.

178
00:09:36,243 --> 00:09:37,311
Right.

179
00:09:37,845 --> 00:09:40,081
I mean, it may seem like
I'm a dickhead,

180
00:09:40,214 --> 00:09:42,650
going around,
being followed by a camera,

181
00:09:42,783 --> 00:09:45,319
but-- but really, um... I'm--

182
00:09:45,453 --> 00:09:49,356
I'm hoping to deflect it
and find out about the fans.

183
00:09:51,225 --> 00:09:53,260
This is the best place
to drown your sorrows.

184
00:09:53,394 --> 00:09:54,829
You know?

185
00:09:54,962 --> 00:09:57,998
They're 3000 Whovians,
and lots and lots of booze.

186
00:09:58,132 --> 00:09:59,900
[cosplayer]
Ah, the American fans.

187
00:10:00,034 --> 00:10:01,503
They are the diehards.

188
00:10:01,635 --> 00:10:03,572
Balls-to-the-wall
kind of attitude.

189
00:10:03,704 --> 00:10:05,005
All through medical school,

190
00:10:05,139 --> 00:10:06,707
I was still kind of the--
the closet Whovian.

191
00:10:06,841 --> 00:10:08,943
But, no, yeah,
we're just a normal couple.

192
00:10:09,076 --> 00:10:10,778
We just got married
two years ago.

193
00:10:11,412 --> 00:10:12,680
I'm special.

194
00:10:12,813 --> 00:10:15,015
Please don't hurt me
because I am so special.

195
00:10:16,951 --> 00:10:18,385
[Shaun] This convention,
Gallifrey One,

196
00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:20,955
has been a part of my life,
my entire adult lives.

197
00:10:21,088 --> 00:10:23,691
I was 19 when we started this,
and I'm 46 now.

198
00:10:24,091 --> 00:10:26,026
I'm a-- I work at a restaurant,
I'm a food server,

199
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:29,598
and I also am a teacher
part-time, so, yeah.

200
00:10:29,730 --> 00:10:30,998
-[baby cooing]
-Ooh.

201
00:10:32,099 --> 00:10:33,868
Hello. And Piper's a baby.

202
00:10:34,001 --> 00:10:36,103
There's a whole community
of people that do this.

203
00:10:36,237 --> 00:10:38,305
That knit specifically
Tom Baker scarves.

204
00:10:38,439 --> 00:10:41,075
And we sit there and talk
to each other and stuff,

205
00:10:41,208 --> 00:10:43,711
and that I found
because this is what I did.

206
00:10:43,844 --> 00:10:47,616
I found myself working in toys,
I worked in industrial design,

207
00:10:47,748 --> 00:10:49,116
and then I ended up
in chocolate.

208
00:10:49,250 --> 00:10:51,620
So Anna and I
are sign language interpreters

209
00:10:51,785 --> 00:10:54,556
for an elementary
and a high school

210
00:10:54,688 --> 00:10:55,990
from where we're from.

211
00:10:56,123 --> 00:10:57,458
It's like, I will do anything
for anybody,

212
00:10:57,592 --> 00:10:58,893
I wanna make sure

213
00:10:59,026 --> 00:11:02,296
that people are okay
in their lives.

214
00:11:06,367 --> 00:11:08,836
-And I'm Andrew Skinner.
-Andrew Skinner!

215
00:11:08,969 --> 00:11:10,171
And that's a good
English accent.

216
00:11:10,304 --> 00:11:11,972
Oh, thank you,
I live in Syracuse.

217
00:11:12,106 --> 00:11:13,575
But I'd say
I'm the mad man with the box,

218
00:11:13,707 --> 00:11:16,210
'cause if I had a TARDIS,
I would be all over the place.

219
00:11:17,011 --> 00:11:20,247
It was very, very
in-the-closet, so to speak.

220
00:11:20,381 --> 00:11:23,017
When we were growing up,
holding a <i>Doctor Who</i> book meant

221
00:11:23,150 --> 00:11:26,187
""Please, please,
punch me in the face.""

222
00:11:26,621 --> 00:11:27,855
Um, ""Please--

223
00:11:27,988 --> 00:11:29,990
please reject me
every time I ask you out.""

224
00:11:30,124 --> 00:11:32,259
You know, it was kinda tough
to be a fan in the '90s,

225
00:11:32,393 --> 00:11:34,596
because it was-- it's always
been a niche program,

226
00:11:34,728 --> 00:11:36,897
but-- but even then,
it was, you know,

227
00:11:37,031 --> 00:11:38,533
a niche within a niche.

228
00:11:38,667 --> 00:11:40,968
<i>Doctor Who</i> fans
are the people that, uh, they--

229
00:11:41,101 --> 00:11:43,137
the <i>Star Trek</i> fans
don't even appreciate very much.

230
00:11:43,270 --> 00:11:45,272
But now it's--
it's grown and it's--

231
00:11:45,406 --> 00:11:48,108
it's that freedom
to finally say,

232
00:11:48,242 --> 00:11:50,110
""Yes, <i>Doctor Who</i> is a thing,""

233
00:11:50,244 --> 00:11:53,047
whereas in Britain,
it's sort of always been there.

234
00:11:53,180 --> 00:11:55,449
The Brits have been enjoying it
for 50 years,

235
00:11:55,584 --> 00:11:57,384
and it's only been,
like, the last ten

236
00:11:57,519 --> 00:11:59,554
that Americans
have really caught on to it.

237
00:11:59,688 --> 00:12:00,854
I actually, um, well--

238
00:12:00,988 --> 00:12:03,424
not from the States,
I'm from Canada,

239
00:12:03,558 --> 00:12:04,858
so I think you have to

240
00:12:04,992 --> 00:12:07,596
change the name
of your documentary

241
00:12:08,229 --> 00:12:11,098
The-- the fans of America,
and one boy from Canada.

242
00:12:11,232 --> 00:12:12,601
-[audience member] Okay.
-[audience laughing]

243
00:12:12,733 --> 00:12:14,502
It's like,
this is our little TARDIS

244
00:12:14,636 --> 00:12:15,970
that's bigger on the inside,

245
00:12:16,103 --> 00:12:17,304
the entire world fits in here
for a weekend,

246
00:12:17,438 --> 00:12:19,173
-and then we all go off again.
-Yeah.

247
00:12:19,306 --> 00:12:20,374
I love it.

248
00:12:22,409 --> 00:12:25,379
<i>Doctor Who</i> has helped
a lot of people

249
00:12:25,513 --> 00:12:27,348
find who they are.

250
00:12:29,216 --> 00:12:30,585
Beg your pardon, sir.

251
00:12:30,719 --> 00:12:32,386
<i>""Doctor Who</i> am I?""
It's like identity.

252
00:12:32,520 --> 00:12:34,888
It's a line from the <i>Doctor Who</i>
movie, of course.

253
00:12:35,022 --> 00:12:38,192
<i>""Doctor Who</i> Am I?""
was the pitch

254
00:12:38,325 --> 00:12:41,529
that I made
to get the 1996 movie.

255
00:12:43,732 --> 00:12:47,034
It's a very iconic moment.
Um, it's a divisive moment.

256
00:12:47,167 --> 00:12:48,936
Some fans love it,
some fans hate it.

257
00:12:51,272 --> 00:12:52,806
The Eighth Doctor
just regenerated,

258
00:12:52,940 --> 00:12:54,108
and he's in the shroud--

259
00:12:54,241 --> 00:12:55,876
the Shroud of Turin,
as I call it.

260
00:12:56,310 --> 00:12:58,479
And he falls down to his knees,

261
00:12:58,613 --> 00:13:01,949
he doesn't know who he is,
and he says, ""Who am I?""

262
00:13:07,656 --> 00:13:10,057
[Matthew] At some point or other
in our lives,

263
00:13:10,190 --> 00:13:12,926
we all ask the same question.

264
00:13:14,328 --> 00:13:15,296
Who am I?

265
00:13:15,429 --> 00:13:19,466
[crowd chattering]

266
00:13:21,536 --> 00:13:23,705
[Paul B] There haven't been
too many conversations about

267
00:13:23,837 --> 00:13:24,905
where Matthew is.

268
00:13:25,740 --> 00:13:28,842
But that's because people
seem to be more concentrating,

269
00:13:28,976 --> 00:13:31,345
I think,
on the kind of Doctor, right?

270
00:13:31,478 --> 00:13:32,547
And-- and the stars.

271
00:13:37,985 --> 00:13:41,355
So, then you came to the States

272
00:13:41,488 --> 00:13:45,727
in 1990--

273
00:13:45,859 --> 00:13:47,394
-Two.
-Two.

274
00:13:47,529 --> 00:13:48,495
Or three, yeah.

275
00:13:48,630 --> 00:13:50,164
1992, 1993.

276
00:13:50,297 --> 00:13:52,734
Are you an American citizen?

277
00:13:52,866 --> 00:13:55,469
No, I'm a resident alien.

278
00:13:55,603 --> 00:13:59,541
But that's just 'cause I'm lazy.
I could be a citizen.

279
00:13:59,907 --> 00:14:01,342
-Um...
-Would you be a citizen?

280
00:14:01,475 --> 00:14:02,544
Well...

281
00:14:09,016 --> 00:14:10,752
There's so much marketing.

282
00:14:10,884 --> 00:14:12,721
It's just,
America is in-your-face

283
00:14:12,853 --> 00:14:14,855
with the marketing,
I mean, everywhere you go,

284
00:14:14,988 --> 00:14:17,157
you're gonna see
David Tennant's face everywhere,

285
00:14:17,291 --> 00:14:18,992
because they know--
they know how to sell things

286
00:14:19,126 --> 00:14:20,427
here as well.

287
00:14:20,562 --> 00:14:22,196
And they're just very,
um, visual about it.

288
00:14:22,329 --> 00:14:23,798
[fan] Okay,
Daleks have no gender.

289
00:14:23,931 --> 00:14:25,933
-That's right. They're pulsing.
-[fan 2] Genderless.

290
00:14:26,066 --> 00:14:27,401
American conventions, you have--

291
00:14:27,535 --> 00:14:29,937
you have fans
re-enacting things in the lobby,

292
00:14:30,070 --> 00:14:32,841
you've probably seen groups
of people crowding round Daleks

293
00:14:32,973 --> 00:14:35,442
and people striking poses
and having photographs taken.

294
00:14:35,577 --> 00:14:37,945
That doesn't really go on
at UK conventions.

295
00:14:38,078 --> 00:14:39,446
[interviewer]
So what do they do?

296
00:14:39,581 --> 00:14:43,150
-[cameraman chuckling]
-Uh... [laughs] ...hmm.

297
00:14:43,283 --> 00:14:46,387
[Tara] American fans
are very enthusiastic.

298
00:14:46,855 --> 00:14:50,057
They like to do cosplay,
they like to dress up,

299
00:14:50,190 --> 00:14:51,526
they will wear a t-shirt, I--

300
00:14:51,659 --> 00:14:54,395
I did a couple of conventions
in the UK,

301
00:14:54,529 --> 00:14:56,997
and it looked as though
they had just rounded people up

302
00:14:57,131 --> 00:14:59,567
at the bus stop and--
and sent them in.

303
00:14:59,701 --> 00:15:01,669
No--
hardly anybody wore costumes,

304
00:15:01,803 --> 00:15:03,538
hardly anyone wore t-shirts.

305
00:15:03,671 --> 00:15:07,040
But here, almost everybody has
either a <i>Doctor Who</i> t-shirt on,

306
00:15:07,174 --> 00:15:10,578
or a scarf, or something to do
with <i>Doctor Who,</i>

307
00:15:10,712 --> 00:15:13,080
to proclaim that
they are a <i>Doctor Who</i> fan.

308
00:15:13,213 --> 00:15:16,618
[camera clicking]

309
00:15:16,751 --> 00:15:19,353
[Paul B] People come here
because they love this thing

310
00:15:19,486 --> 00:15:20,921
that society says

311
00:15:21,054 --> 00:15:22,657
you shouldn't love
as much as you do.

312
00:15:22,791 --> 00:15:24,291
And then you're surrounded
by other people

313
00:15:24,425 --> 00:15:26,994
who love it just as much,
if not more than you do.

314
00:15:27,461 --> 00:15:29,396
So, in some ways, being a fan

315
00:15:29,531 --> 00:15:31,331
is almost like
coming out of the closet

316
00:15:31,465 --> 00:15:33,167
when you come to a convention.

317
00:15:33,300 --> 00:15:35,503
Because you're allowed
to be who you are,

318
00:15:35,637 --> 00:15:38,138
and you're allowed
to kind of experience

319
00:15:38,272 --> 00:15:39,973
the things that
you want to experience, in--

320
00:15:40,107 --> 00:15:41,676
in-- in the safe space
that you can.

321
00:15:41,810 --> 00:15:43,377
[announcer]
We just have a couple more

322
00:15:43,511 --> 00:15:44,913
quick announcements
we want to share with you.

323
00:15:45,045 --> 00:15:46,213
I'm forgetting many,
many things,

324
00:15:46,346 --> 00:15:47,582
and I can't see
the schedule here,

325
00:15:47,715 --> 00:15:48,917
cause I'm blind as a bat.

326
00:15:49,049 --> 00:15:51,418
Americans feel religion
so strongly.

327
00:15:51,553 --> 00:15:55,122
Americans feel rights
and freedom so strongly.

328
00:15:55,255 --> 00:15:56,624
So, perhaps,
that's why there's--

329
00:15:56,758 --> 00:15:58,091
there's kind of
an unbridled feeling in fandom

330
00:15:58,225 --> 00:15:59,359
in America, too.

331
00:15:59,493 --> 00:16:01,763
[Matthew] In my opinion,
the American fan

332
00:16:01,896 --> 00:16:03,964
is a particularly

333
00:16:04,097 --> 00:16:06,967
more virulent species of fan.

334
00:16:07,100 --> 00:16:09,002
They practically
destroyed Mark Twain,

335
00:16:09,136 --> 00:16:11,171
Sherlock Holmes,
or any of those,

336
00:16:11,305 --> 00:16:13,340
they're making them
into cult figures.

337
00:16:13,474 --> 00:16:16,076
Oscar Wilde as well, actually,
he did an American tour

338
00:16:16,210 --> 00:16:19,046
and had lots of fans
following him, yeah.

339
00:16:25,052 --> 00:16:26,353
[Matthew]
What did you want to talk about?

340
00:16:26,821 --> 00:16:29,557
Oh, I-- I want to
talk about your movie.

341
00:16:29,691 --> 00:16:31,325
[Matthew] Okay,
did you ever see the movie?

342
00:16:31,458 --> 00:16:32,727
-Be honest.
-No.

343
00:16:32,861 --> 00:16:34,161
-[Matthew] Okay.
-No, I-- I-- I wouldn't lie.

344
00:16:34,294 --> 00:16:35,530
[Matthew] Oh, good.

345
00:16:35,663 --> 00:16:36,931
Lot of people
haven't seen the movie.

346
00:16:37,064 --> 00:16:39,366
Yeah, I don't have any hatred.

347
00:16:39,500 --> 00:16:42,971
You know, people hate RTV,
people hate Moffat,

348
00:16:43,103 --> 00:16:44,438
people hate,
with all due respect...

349
00:16:44,572 --> 00:16:46,340
-[Matthew] No.
-...your work.

350
00:16:47,407 --> 00:16:49,209
-[Matthew] Oh, hello!
-How's it going? I'm Kevin.

351
00:16:49,343 --> 00:16:51,445
-Hi, Kevin. Nice to meet you.
-Nice to meet you.

352
00:16:51,579 --> 00:16:53,013
And you've got
the paperback version--

353
00:16:53,146 --> 00:16:55,148
-Yeah, I got some questions.
-Yes?

354
00:16:55,282 --> 00:16:57,150
We're gonna talk later
about the TV movie.

355
00:16:57,552 --> 00:16:59,988
Okay.
Writer of the-- the TV movie.

356
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:01,321
1996.

357
00:17:01,455 --> 00:17:03,357
Uh, first of all,
you seem like a nice guy.

358
00:17:04,424 --> 00:17:08,161
Uh, the Doctor being half-human.
Is that you?

359
00:17:10,197 --> 00:17:12,667
It was--
I wrote it in the script...

360
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:14,002
-This interview's over.
-...and then--

361
00:17:14,134 --> 00:17:15,402
[all laughing]

362
00:17:15,537 --> 00:17:16,704
Yeah, I just wrote it off as,

363
00:17:16,838 --> 00:17:18,038
""Well,
Fox must have wanted that,""

364
00:17:18,171 --> 00:17:19,339
and-- and I just thought
it was--

365
00:17:19,473 --> 00:17:20,742
-[Kevin] But it wasn't Fox.
-Yeah.

366
00:17:20,875 --> 00:17:22,010
[Kevin] It was this guy,
I've learned this--

367
00:17:22,142 --> 00:17:23,477
But what's your problem with it?

368
00:17:23,611 --> 00:17:25,279
Oh, come on, he's the Doctor,
he's a Time Lord,

369
00:17:25,412 --> 00:17:26,581
he comes from Gallifrey.

370
00:17:26,714 --> 00:17:27,649
Ah, no, I hate it.

371
00:17:27,782 --> 00:17:29,283
I remember
the criticism at the time

372
00:17:29,416 --> 00:17:30,752
was it felt like Mr. Spock.

373
00:17:30,885 --> 00:17:32,620
Cause Mr. Spock
was half-Vulcan, half-human.

374
00:17:32,754 --> 00:17:35,823
Oh, yes, that's right,
I hadn't realized that.

375
00:17:35,957 --> 00:17:37,324
So, maybe subconsciously

376
00:17:37,457 --> 00:17:39,359
-I was ripping off <i>Star Trek.</i>
-There you go.

377
00:17:39,493 --> 00:17:41,228
...and half-human
on your mother's side

378
00:17:41,361 --> 00:17:44,197
is like-- is like saying
you're really Jewish.

379
00:17:45,365 --> 00:17:48,268
Um, and there's a lot of
references--

380
00:17:48,402 --> 00:17:52,205
I'm not Jewish, I'm half-Jewish
on my father's side.

381
00:17:53,273 --> 00:17:56,811
You should write
a Big Finish audio drama

382
00:17:56,945 --> 00:17:58,846
and title it ""Half-Human.""

383
00:17:59,581 --> 00:18:01,181
[Matthew] We-- Yeah,
it would be a big hit.

384
00:18:01,315 --> 00:18:02,482
It would be.

385
00:18:02,617 --> 00:18:05,152
Because everybody would tune in,
you know?

386
00:18:05,285 --> 00:18:07,254
They will be like--
they will be like,

387
00:18:07,387 --> 00:18:09,323
""He has to hide
his half-humanness.""

388
00:18:09,456 --> 00:18:11,124
Just like,
you know, in Nazi Germany

389
00:18:11,258 --> 00:18:13,260
you have to hide
that you're Jewish.

390
00:18:13,393 --> 00:18:15,262
Do you see what I'm saying?

391
00:18:15,395 --> 00:18:17,230
When will you pay attention,
you know?

392
00:18:17,364 --> 00:18:19,067
And all those people
will think, you know,

393
00:18:19,199 --> 00:18:21,101
and he can't admit

394
00:18:21,234 --> 00:18:23,838
that, in fact,
he's not totally alien.

395
00:18:23,972 --> 00:18:26,273
And then he turns around
and he says, ""Wait a minute...

396
00:18:27,075 --> 00:18:29,176
humans are aliens, too.""

397
00:18:29,309 --> 00:18:30,578
Yeah.

398
00:18:36,918 --> 00:18:40,153
[woman] I have ventured
onto Tumblr, God help me.

399
00:18:40,855 --> 00:18:44,759
These are people that
absolutely flat-out refuse

400
00:18:44,892 --> 00:18:48,096
to watch any classic <i>Who.</i>

401
00:18:48,362 --> 00:18:49,329
'Cause it's boring.

402
00:18:49,463 --> 00:18:51,666
And they just keep nattering on.

403
00:18:52,066 --> 00:18:56,104
""David Tennant, David Tennant,
David Tennant, David Tennant.""

404
00:18:56,504 --> 00:18:59,139
Do you watch the show?

405
00:18:59,272 --> 00:19:02,409
Do you know
what the show is about?

406
00:19:04,277 --> 00:19:06,681
You know, in very broad,
pretentious terms...

407
00:19:07,949 --> 00:19:10,350
you-- after Jesus dies,

408
00:19:10,484 --> 00:19:13,353
you start getting
religions and rules.

409
00:19:16,223 --> 00:19:17,491
[Kevin] Now I will ask you,

410
00:19:17,625 --> 00:19:21,194
the Doctor and Grace,
they share a kiss.

411
00:19:21,328 --> 00:19:23,463
-[Bob] More than one, actually.
-[Kevin] More than one!

412
00:19:23,598 --> 00:19:26,734
We went through
decades of <i>Doctor Who</i>

413
00:19:26,868 --> 00:19:28,168
with no kissing,

414
00:19:28,301 --> 00:19:29,971
and suddenly,
""Oh, look at this!""

415
00:19:30,104 --> 00:19:32,205
Well, maybe that's why
you were persecuted

416
00:19:32,339 --> 00:19:33,708
in the playground.

417
00:19:34,842 --> 00:19:37,045
-Ooh.
-See now-- See now--

418
00:19:37,177 --> 00:19:38,746
I still like you as a person...

419
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:40,414
[all laughing]

420
00:19:40,548 --> 00:19:41,816
...but you, you know,

421
00:19:41,949 --> 00:19:43,618
it-- it's not
to the George Lucas level,

422
00:19:43,751 --> 00:19:45,853
but a little bit,
you destroyed my childhood.

423
00:19:45,987 --> 00:19:50,223
[piano music playing]

424
00:19:53,895 --> 00:19:57,699
[Matthew] As I was writing
that Doctor,

425
00:19:57,832 --> 00:20:01,736
I was pouring myself
into that character.

426
00:20:01,869 --> 00:20:05,807
I was pouring my experience
of the Doctor as a child,

427
00:20:05,940 --> 00:20:09,242
and all the wit
and all the warmth

428
00:20:09,376 --> 00:20:11,311
and all that sort of love

429
00:20:11,445 --> 00:20:13,715
that the Doctor has of humans,

430
00:20:13,848 --> 00:20:16,918
I was pouring
into this character.

431
00:20:17,051 --> 00:20:18,720
And I was loving doing it.

432
00:20:21,421 --> 00:20:24,491
I was putting myself
on the line there.

433
00:20:25,793 --> 00:20:27,528
[Paul M] Someone wrote to me
and said...

434
00:20:28,361 --> 00:20:30,064
""You've got it
the wrong way round.""

435
00:20:30,430 --> 00:20:31,866
-[Matthew] Yeah.
-[Paul M] Yeah.

436
00:20:31,999 --> 00:20:34,367
-[Matthew] I would--
-[Paul M] Don't need as long.

437
00:20:35,703 --> 00:20:38,539
My Doctor, the Eighth Doctor
has been mainly on audio

438
00:20:38,673 --> 00:20:39,941
-all these years.
-[Matthew] Right.

439
00:20:40,074 --> 00:20:41,642
[Paul M] So, I've played
the Doctor on the radio.

440
00:20:41,776 --> 00:20:43,410
[Matthew] You've been alive
for-- as a Doctor,

441
00:20:43,544 --> 00:20:44,712
you've been alive for longer
than any other Doctor.

442
00:20:44,846 --> 00:20:46,346
[Paul M] The longest
and the shortest,

443
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:47,915
it's become me.

444
00:20:51,519 --> 00:20:53,855
The idea of coming
to these fan shows,

445
00:20:54,287 --> 00:20:56,456
it's just-- I don't know, no.

446
00:20:56,591 --> 00:20:57,925
-[Matthew] Same-- same here.
-Creepy. Weird.

447
00:20:58,059 --> 00:20:59,193
Why would I want to--

448
00:20:59,326 --> 00:21:00,194
[Matthew]
I was invited on a cruise.

449
00:21:00,327 --> 00:21:01,495
Cause it had a kind of--

450
00:21:01,896 --> 00:21:04,431
it had a str--
it has a strange reputation.

451
00:21:05,199 --> 00:21:06,534
And some of it's merited.

452
00:21:06,934 --> 00:21:08,503
Um, and I thought,

453
00:21:08,636 --> 00:21:09,904
""Well, I wouldn't enjoy that.
Why would I--""

454
00:21:10,037 --> 00:21:11,539
So, I didn't do 'em
for a few years.

455
00:21:11,672 --> 00:21:13,406
And when I did,
I really did enjoy it.

456
00:21:13,541 --> 00:21:15,342
In a way, I mean, the simple--

457
00:21:15,777 --> 00:21:19,446
I suppose,
the simple feedback, um...

458
00:21:20,581 --> 00:21:21,849
it's just a pleasure.

459
00:21:22,216 --> 00:21:23,885
Oh, you got the script!

460
00:21:24,018 --> 00:21:25,887
I haven't even got
a copy of this.

461
00:21:26,020 --> 00:21:27,454
I gave it to my son.

462
00:21:27,588 --> 00:21:30,124
This is the first time
I started signing anything.

463
00:21:30,258 --> 00:21:31,324
-[fan] Really?
-[Matthew] Yeah.

464
00:21:31,859 --> 00:21:35,062
This is a real fan book
that you have here.

465
00:21:35,428 --> 00:21:37,899
But Philip Segal
is the wonderful person

466
00:21:38,032 --> 00:21:40,034
who's really responsible
for bringing...

467
00:21:40,168 --> 00:21:42,069
-[fan] Right, right.
-...the Eighth Doctor back.

468
00:21:42,203 --> 00:21:44,272
-Did you want me to write in it?
-Yes, I did.

469
00:21:44,404 --> 00:21:46,641
[Matthew] Or did you-- what--
what did you want me to write?

470
00:21:46,774 --> 00:21:48,075
Well, there's this--
oh, there it is.

471
00:21:48,209 --> 00:21:49,744
The Jacobs script.

472
00:21:50,545 --> 00:21:52,479
-[Matthew] Jacobs script.
-[fan] The Jacobs script.

473
00:21:52,613 --> 00:21:53,781
Dun dun dun!

474
00:21:53,915 --> 00:21:55,448
I don't know
if you got the criticism,

475
00:21:55,583 --> 00:21:58,653
and I know a lot of people
criticized the...

476
00:21:59,287 --> 00:22:00,688
-[Matthew] What, the shoes?
[fan] ...American--

477
00:22:00,822 --> 00:22:03,490
no, the Americanization stuff.

478
00:22:03,858 --> 00:22:05,560
[Matthew] We were making
an American film.

479
00:22:06,093 --> 00:22:08,129
-Yeah.
-[Matthew] What can you do?

480
00:22:08,262 --> 00:22:09,230
-Right.
-[Matthew] This.

481
00:22:09,362 --> 00:22:10,731
So it's 15.

482
00:22:10,865 --> 00:22:13,366
-Thank you so much.
-My pleasure.

483
00:22:13,868 --> 00:22:14,902
Okay.

484
00:22:16,604 --> 00:22:17,772
It seems to me,

485
00:22:17,905 --> 00:22:20,541
that everyone
connected with this show

486
00:22:20,675 --> 00:22:23,644
is trying to cash in
in some way.

487
00:22:23,778 --> 00:22:25,947
I'm in the middle
of the dealers' room here.

488
00:22:26,514 --> 00:22:28,749
There's a lot of rather,
sort of pathetic,

489
00:22:28,883 --> 00:22:32,019
middle-level writers,
like myself,

490
00:22:32,153 --> 00:22:35,289
and reduced us
to a narrative work.

491
00:22:35,723 --> 00:22:36,891
They're enjoying the fact

492
00:22:37,024 --> 00:22:38,259
that they're getting
this stardom.

493
00:22:38,391 --> 00:22:39,594
And I-- it's happening to me!

494
00:22:39,727 --> 00:22:41,329
I-- I feel that, too.

495
00:22:41,461 --> 00:22:44,031
This is the <i>Radio Times</i> cover.

496
00:22:45,533 --> 00:22:48,368
So it's all to do
with identity and ego.

497
00:22:48,836 --> 00:22:50,771
And pissing contests.

498
00:22:51,606 --> 00:22:54,275
I think, ""Oh, my God,

00:29:45,853 --> 00:29:47,821
I feel strangely aroused.

666
00:29:48,922 --> 00:29:50,224
Where'd you get the money
to do all this?

667
00:29:50,357 --> 00:29:51,992
It's expensive,
let me put it that--

668
00:29:52,126 --> 00:29:53,994
Uh, it-- it can add up.
It depends on the costume.

669
00:29:54,128 --> 00:29:55,462
And how'd-- how--
what's your day job?

670
00:29:55,597 --> 00:29:57,464
Do you have a d--
I mean, this is your day job.

671
00:29:57,599 --> 00:29:59,900
At the time I did this,
I actually did, uh,

672
00:30:00,034 --> 00:30:01,402
background checks for, uh, Uber.

673
00:30:01,536 --> 00:30:03,337
This was my homage
to the gunfighters.

674
00:30:03,470 --> 00:30:05,139
Says, uh-- you don't see it,
it got cut off,

675
00:30:05,272 --> 00:30:07,141
but it actually says
Doc Holliday on the very bottom

676
00:30:07,274 --> 00:30:09,410
-of the original graphic.
-Which was my dad.

677
00:30:09,544 --> 00:30:10,944
Yep. Yep.

678
00:30:12,279 --> 00:30:15,449
<i>Doctor Who</i> is present
throughout my life,

679
00:30:15,583 --> 00:30:18,052
or my conscious life,
for the most part,

680
00:30:18,185 --> 00:30:21,088
because it began in 1963.

681
00:30:22,022 --> 00:30:24,726
The same day
as Kennedy's assassination,

682
00:30:24,858 --> 00:30:26,493
and I was only about seven.

683
00:30:28,862 --> 00:30:32,266
And my father was an actor.
His name was Anthony Jacobs.

684
00:30:32,399 --> 00:30:34,501
He was
in an early <i>Doctor Who</i> adventure

685
00:30:34,636 --> 00:30:35,704
with the First Doctor,

686
00:30:35,836 --> 00:30:38,472
called ""The Gunfighters""
in 1966.

687
00:30:38,606 --> 00:30:41,710
<i>How're you proposin' to handle</i>
<i>this little clamp matter?</i>

688
00:30:41,842 --> 00:30:43,177
<i>What is your way,</i>

689
00:30:43,310 --> 00:30:46,013
<i>Doctor Holliday, hmm?</i>

690
00:30:46,146 --> 00:30:47,515
[Matthew] Where the Doctor
travelled back

691
00:30:47,649 --> 00:30:49,083
to the O.K. Corral,

692
00:30:49,316 --> 00:30:52,152
and befriended Doc Holliday,
who was played by my father.

693
00:30:52,286 --> 00:30:53,887
<i>Oh, you don't owe me nothin',</i>
<i>mister.</i>

694
00:30:54,021 --> 00:30:56,256
<i>You're my first customer,</i>
<i>you have this one on the house.</i>

695
00:30:56,390 --> 00:30:57,659
<i>[grunts]</i>

696
00:30:57,792 --> 00:30:59,360
There was the mirror,
you know, the back of the bar,

697
00:30:59,493 --> 00:31:02,096
and when they wanted
an over-the-shoulder shot,

698
00:31:02,630 --> 00:31:03,798
they slid back the mirror

699
00:31:03,931 --> 00:31:05,600
and the camera
would poke through.

700
00:31:05,734 --> 00:31:07,901
And beside that camera was--

701
00:31:08,035 --> 00:31:09,504
I was there as,
little ten-year-old.

702
00:31:09,637 --> 00:31:12,707
They'd given me a chair
and in front of the chair,

703
00:31:12,841 --> 00:31:16,745
they'd put a little TV monitor
of the selected shots.

704
00:31:16,877 --> 00:31:18,546
It was my birthday treat.

705
00:31:18,680 --> 00:31:20,981
And I had a set of cans,

706
00:31:21,115 --> 00:31:22,650
and I was listening
to Rex Tucker,

707
00:31:22,784 --> 00:31:25,886
who sh-- who was the director
up in the gallery,

708
00:31:26,019 --> 00:31:28,021
calling the shots.

709
00:31:30,324 --> 00:31:32,493
And of course,
for me it was wonderful.

710
00:31:33,127 --> 00:31:34,461
You know, can you imagine,

711
00:31:34,596 --> 00:31:36,964
it was like being there
with my two heroes.

712
00:31:37,364 --> 00:31:40,501
This was my dad and the Doctor.

713
00:31:41,001 --> 00:31:42,737
And my dad was the doctor.

714
00:31:43,170 --> 00:31:44,138
[interviewer]
Even more confusing.

715
00:31:44,271 --> 00:31:45,540
Yeah, that was confusing,

716
00:31:45,673 --> 00:31:47,642
it's account of
my fucked-up childhood.

717
00:31:58,919 --> 00:32:02,256
So this is around the time
that I went with my father

718
00:32:02,389 --> 00:32:04,191
to see him shoot <i>Doctor Who,</i>

719
00:32:04,324 --> 00:32:07,327
and it's also trying to look
very much like hero.

720
00:32:08,095 --> 00:32:10,063
This is my dad taking us

721
00:32:10,197 --> 00:32:12,266
on a small vacation,

722
00:32:12,399 --> 00:32:15,035
in a very small tent.

723
00:32:18,305 --> 00:32:21,041
This is when I was writing
<i>Young Indiana Jones.</i>

724
00:32:21,408 --> 00:32:23,477
And I took the boys on set,

725
00:32:23,611 --> 00:32:26,013
and they met
Sean Patrick Flanery.

726
00:32:27,882 --> 00:32:31,553
And they hung out
with Indiana Jones for the day,

727
00:32:31,686 --> 00:32:35,088
so it was--
I was kind of doing for them

728
00:32:35,222 --> 00:32:38,358
what my dad did for me
with <i>Doctor Who,</i>

729
00:32:38,492 --> 00:32:40,562
which was-- was very sweet.

730
00:32:41,729 --> 00:32:43,997
We haven't taken this camera
out of this house, have we?

731
00:32:44,131 --> 00:32:45,533
<i>Hi, Dad.</i>

732
00:32:45,667 --> 00:32:47,334
<i>[Matthew]</i>
<i>What have you got there, Josh?</i>

733
00:32:47,468 --> 00:32:48,870
<i>-What's that?</i>
<i>-This is my new pocket knife.</i>

734
00:32:49,002 --> 00:32:50,705
<i>It's got two blades, but, um,</i>

735
00:32:50,839 --> 00:32:54,809
<i>I'm about to carve</i>
<i>Anthony Jacobs' initials</i>

736
00:32:54,943 --> 00:32:56,644

00:32:56,778 --> 00:33:00,013

<i>after I've had a Pop-Tart.</i>

[baby cooing]

739
00:33:03,417 --> 00:33:05,085
[Heather] Well,
this is my daughter, Piper.

740
00:33:05,219 --> 00:33:07,187
We named her after Billie Piper.

741
00:33:07,889 --> 00:33:10,290
And she's three months old

742
00:33:10,424 --> 00:33:12,259
and this is
her very first cosplay.

743
00:33:12,392 --> 00:33:15,262
[Stephan] She just came back
from her first convention,

744
00:33:15,395 --> 00:33:17,264
San Diego Comic-Con,
we just got back from.

745
00:33:17,397 --> 00:33:19,466
And, uh--
so she did really well.

746
00:33:19,601 --> 00:33:21,970
She was on the floor
every day, all day long

747
00:33:22,102 --> 00:33:24,371
with, you know, couple-- what,

748
00:33:24,506 --> 00:33:26,708
it's what, 75,000 people a day,
something like that?

749
00:33:26,841 --> 00:33:28,910
All the white noise,
all the people together

750
00:33:29,042 --> 00:33:31,111
kind of kept her soothed,

751
00:33:31,245 --> 00:33:32,814
-so, uh--
-She slept through a lot of it.

752
00:33:32,947 --> 00:33:35,683
Yeah, she slept through a lot.
But she cosplayed every day.

753
00:33:36,116 --> 00:33:37,484
[Heather]
This is all new for us.

754
00:33:37,619 --> 00:33:39,086
We've only been doing it
for what,

755
00:33:39,219 --> 00:33:40,420
-two years?
-[Stephan] Two, three years.

756
00:33:40,555 --> 00:33:41,956
Yeah, the cos--
the cosplay aspect.

757
00:33:42,089 --> 00:33:43,390
[Heather] It kind of
jumped on us.

758
00:33:43,525 --> 00:33:45,425
I made a costume for Halloween,

759
00:33:45,560 --> 00:33:47,862
and happened to wear it
to WonderCon.

760
00:33:48,796 --> 00:33:50,999
And it was such a hit
that we kind of went with it,

761
00:33:51,131 --> 00:33:53,267
and then
it just expanded from there.

762
00:33:53,400 --> 00:33:56,538
Her dress is really what got us
invited to Graham Norton.

763
00:34:05,580 --> 00:34:08,482
I'm just gonna rest it
on my head, if that's safe.

764
00:34:10,183 --> 00:34:12,419
What-- what that looks like?

765
00:34:16,056 --> 00:34:19,126
[Stephan] At San Diego,
I literally ran into Matt Smith

766
00:34:19,259 --> 00:34:20,494
in a hotel lobby.

767
00:34:20,628 --> 00:34:22,296
I was gonna have this--
a tattoo project.

768
00:34:22,429 --> 00:34:24,832
♪

769
00:34:24,966 --> 00:34:31,471
[inaudible speaking]

770
00:34:32,139 --> 00:34:33,808
[Stephan] We picked the elbow,
which, thanks Matt,

771
00:34:33,942 --> 00:34:35,977
I don't know if you've ever had
your elbow tattooed.

772
00:34:36,109 --> 00:34:37,377
[Graham] Where's-- where's that?

773
00:34:37,512 --> 00:34:39,781
[inaudible speaking]

774
00:34:39,914 --> 00:34:41,049
[Matthew] That's big.

775
00:34:41,181 --> 00:34:43,383
[Stephan]
The original idea was that

776
00:34:43,518 --> 00:34:44,886
I was gonna do
the TARDIS sleeve,

777
00:34:45,019 --> 00:34:46,821
and then if I ever happened to
run into David,

778
00:34:46,955 --> 00:34:48,388
there's a blank space

779
00:34:48,523 --> 00:34:49,924
in the middle of the vortex
there for his signature.

And this one's very readable,

00:34:58,600 --> 00:34:59,901
-Peter Capaldi--
-[Stephan] Yeah, well,

783
00:35:00,034 --> 00:35:01,536
it's also the newest, so it's--

784
00:35:01,669 --> 00:35:02,670
it's, uh--

785
00:35:02,804 --> 00:35:04,338
[Matthew] Oh,
that's why it's so sharp.

786
00:35:04,471 --> 00:35:06,340
We talk about
the <i>Doctor Who</i> in you,

787
00:35:06,473 --> 00:35:08,241
but you don't have
a <i>Doctor Who</i> in you,

-you have a <i>Doctor Who</i> on you.
-[Stephan] And all over me.

-Yeah.
-[Matthew] All over you.

790
00:35:12,112 --> 00:35:13,781
[Stephan] Yeah, so I have--
I have every Doctor

791
00:35:13,915 --> 00:35:15,883
except for Chris Eccleston
right now.

792
00:35:20,989 --> 00:35:22,456
As a married couple,

793
00:35:23,091 --> 00:35:24,391
it's-- for me, anyway,

794
00:35:24,525 --> 00:35:25,927
I found that it's been important
to, you know,

00:35:26,060 --> 00:35:27,762
when we find something
we're both interested in,

796

-to, like, hang on to that...
-Exploit it.

797
00:35:30,130 --> 00:35:31,465
...and not let it go, ever.

798
00:35:31,599 --> 00:35:33,101
Um, cause it's really,
you know, strengthened

799
00:35:33,233 --> 00:35:34,702
our relationship considerably.

800
00:35:34,836 --> 00:35:36,871
I feel like I'm just--
I'm just a huge fan

801
00:35:37,005 --> 00:35:38,238
that loves this show,

802
00:35:38,372 --> 00:35:40,273
and brought me so much joy
in my life,

803
00:35:40,407 --> 00:35:41,475
and in our home.

804
00:35:41,943 --> 00:35:44,746
Just like he brings joy to me!

I just got married last year.

806
00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:47,982
Had a big fat gay wedding,

807
00:35:48,116 --> 00:35:50,417
and when we walked into
the reception, it was like...

808
00:35:50,551 --> 00:35:52,185
[hums <i>Doctor Who</i> theme]

809
00:35:52,319 --> 00:35:53,521
...kind of disco thing,

810
00:35:53,655 --> 00:35:54,822
and everybody
was just on the floor.

811
00:35:54,956 --> 00:35:55,957
They're like,
""Yes, finally, finally.""

812
00:35:56,090 --> 00:35:57,491
[Daphne] Finally!

813
00:35:59,761 --> 00:36:02,130
Oh, my God! Come in this house!

814
00:36:02,262 --> 00:36:03,765
-Aww.
-[Eric] Look who's here.

815
00:36:03,898 --> 00:36:05,700
-[Eliza] Great to see you.
-[Eric] I'm in love

816
00:36:05,833 --> 00:36:06,968
with being married.

817
00:36:07,101 --> 00:36:10,270
We've been together, now,
almost 30 years, and, uh,

818
00:36:10,404 --> 00:36:12,840
I've learned how to really
do this job

819
00:36:12,974 --> 00:36:14,042
of being the husband.

820
00:36:14,174 --> 00:36:15,275
-[Matthew] True.
-And I like it.

821
00:36:15,843 --> 00:36:19,047
We've been in, I don't know,
two dozen movies together.

822
00:36:19,514 --> 00:36:21,049
[Eliza]
We love working together.

823
00:36:21,181 --> 00:36:22,750
And we--
we're gonna do a count once

824
00:36:22,884 --> 00:36:24,852
of how many times
we've killed each other

825
00:36:24,986 --> 00:36:26,020
in various shows.

826
00:36:26,988 --> 00:36:29,891
Here's my relationship
to conventions.

827
00:36:30,024 --> 00:36:32,259
I go 'cause she tells me
to go for the fans.

828
00:36:32,392 --> 00:36:34,095
And I had the best time!

829
00:36:34,227 --> 00:36:35,495
I-- I effectively have fun,

830
00:36:35,630 --> 00:36:37,899
because of the fans
are havin' a great time,

831
00:36:38,398 --> 00:36:39,734
and they're dedicated!

832
00:36:42,302 --> 00:36:44,438
I think what's interesting

833
00:36:44,572 --> 00:36:46,406
about <i>Doctor Who</i> fandom is

834
00:36:46,541 --> 00:36:49,077
it fills this hole
of belief structure,

835
00:36:49,209 --> 00:36:50,678
that religion used to do.

836
00:36:50,812 --> 00:36:53,681
The Doctor's belief
of the attempt of non-violence,

837
00:36:53,815 --> 00:36:56,483
the bravery, and so, you know

838
00:36:56,617 --> 00:36:58,452
you can meet the right person

839
00:36:58,586 --> 00:37:00,788
and you know
that the people in the room

840
00:37:00,922 --> 00:37:03,758
are the right people
because they share your values.

841
00:37:04,491 --> 00:37:07,729
[Eric] Fandom
can be kind of religious.

842
00:37:08,129 --> 00:37:09,664
[Matthew] Mm-hmm.

843
00:37:09,797 --> 00:37:13,366
And religion can be sought
by the fans of that situation,

844
00:37:13,500 --> 00:37:15,368
which-- just weird.

845
00:37:15,737 --> 00:37:17,972
There is a worship thing
that goes on,

846
00:37:18,106 --> 00:37:19,173
there's no question about it.

847
00:37:19,841 --> 00:37:21,308
But I think
that you can find that

848
00:37:21,441 --> 00:37:22,877
in a million places.

849
00:37:24,979 --> 00:37:26,346
[Matthew] Amen.

850
00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:28,916
You know, we met the keeper
of the Holy Grail?

851
00:37:29,817 --> 00:37:31,986
There's a lot of people
who have memorabilia from shows,

852
00:37:32,120 --> 00:37:34,254
not just-- you know,
not just <i>Doctor Who,</i>

853
00:37:34,387 --> 00:37:35,790
that are very--
like, this is mine.

854
00:37:36,224 --> 00:37:38,425
You know, uh, I--
I don't feel that way, I-- I--

855
00:37:38,559 --> 00:37:40,360
I think it's--
the responsibility is to share.

856
00:37:40,494 --> 00:37:42,096
So, like, dynamic.

857
00:37:43,330 --> 00:37:47,101
This is the only TARDIS console
in the United States.

858
00:37:47,602 --> 00:37:50,705
And it's one of the only ones
in existence.

859
00:37:52,807 --> 00:37:55,042
I understand what that means.

860
00:37:57,178 --> 00:37:59,147
When we had
the <i>Doctor Who</i> movie reunion

861
00:37:59,279 --> 00:38:01,783
at the Gallifrey Convention,
Phil Segal was there.

862
00:38:01,916 --> 00:38:03,483
He thought
it had been destroyed.

863
00:38:03,618 --> 00:38:05,352
And he was really
emotionally touched by the fact

864
00:38:05,485 --> 00:38:08,723
that somebody had saved it,
and somebody had restored it.

865
00:38:09,624 --> 00:38:10,958
He looked down and he said,

866
00:38:11,092 --> 00:38:12,860
""Oh, you know,
I see you guys built a replica

867
00:38:12,994 --> 00:38:13,861
of the Doctor's bag.

868
00:38:13,995 --> 00:38:15,462
You know,
I have the original one.""

869
00:38:15,596 --> 00:38:16,831
And I'm like,
""Oh, wow, that's great.""

870
00:38:16,964 --> 00:38:17,932
He goes, ""You know what?

871
00:38:18,065 --> 00:38:19,734
I-- I want you
to come to my place,

872
00:38:19,867 --> 00:38:21,569
and I'm gonna give you
some of the props

873
00:38:21,702 --> 00:38:23,204
I have left over from the show,

874
00:38:23,336 --> 00:38:25,606
'cause I want you-- I want 'em
to be with the console,

875
00:38:25,740 --> 00:38:28,776
I want you to sort of
be in charge of that.

876
00:38:29,143 --> 00:38:31,546
Be a curator of, sort of,
the <i>Doctor Who</i> movie.""

877
00:38:31,679 --> 00:38:33,714
Which, of course, you know,
I'm sitting there going,

878
00:38:33,848 --> 00:38:35,415
""Hmm. That would be wonderful.""

879
00:38:35,550 --> 00:38:38,318
And inside I'm going,
""Oh, my God! Oh, my God!""

880
00:38:40,588 --> 00:38:43,691
[Matthew] We're outside
Philip Segal's office.

881
00:38:44,058 --> 00:38:46,194
And Philip is now

882
00:38:46,326 --> 00:38:49,597
a major reality TV CEO,

883
00:38:49,730 --> 00:38:53,634
and so we've decided
to out-real the reality...

884
00:38:54,467 --> 00:38:55,736
TV guy.

885
00:38:56,971 --> 00:38:58,940
I'm really hoping this is good.

886
00:38:59,073 --> 00:39:01,943
I'm obviously
incredibly excited to see him,

887
00:39:02,076 --> 00:39:03,611
um, after all this time.

888
00:39:03,744 --> 00:39:05,680
A little trepidatious as well.

889
00:39:07,815 --> 00:39:10,785
He completely distanced himself
from the script.

890
00:39:11,185 --> 00:39:12,954
I see all of the things
that I wish

891
00:39:13,087 --> 00:39:15,656
I could've done better,
or wanted to change,

892
00:39:15,790 --> 00:39:17,758
or weren't supposed
to be the way they are.

893
00:39:19,160 --> 00:39:20,628
We sadly were in a time

894
00:39:20,761 --> 00:39:23,664
where we weren't allowed
to make the script

895
00:39:23,798 --> 00:39:25,833
as fantastic
as it could have been.

896
00:39:26,334 --> 00:39:27,668
[doorbell chiming]

897
00:39:31,606 --> 00:39:32,874
Hey there.

898
00:39:33,007 --> 00:39:34,374
-[receptionist] How are you--
-I'm good.

899
00:39:34,508 --> 00:39:35,977
It's Matthew Jacobs
for Philip Segal.

900
00:39:36,110 --> 00:39:37,578
Okay, let me call him.

901
00:39:37,712 --> 00:39:40,815
[Matthew] He's probably
the number one American fan.

902
00:39:40,948 --> 00:39:43,684
Without him,
there would be no <i>Doctor Who.</i>

903
00:39:43,818 --> 00:39:45,586
He is the reason, in my mind,

904
00:39:45,720 --> 00:39:47,154
that <i>Doctor Who</i>
has stayed alive.

905
00:39:47,288 --> 00:39:48,723
Philip, Matthew's here for you.

906
00:39:49,757 --> 00:39:51,726
-[Philip] Oh, my God.
-Hello, darling.

907
00:39:51,859 --> 00:39:53,294
-[Philip] How are you?
-Nice to see you.

908
00:39:53,426 --> 00:39:55,395
Good to see you.
You look terrific.

909
00:39:55,529 --> 00:39:56,898
-You haven't changed
-Same to you.

910
00:39:57,031 --> 00:39:58,199
-Well, maybe we both...
-You, you got taller.

911
00:39:58,332 --> 00:39:59,399
...few little gray hairs.

912
00:39:59,533 --> 00:40:00,835
-Yeah.
-It's the aggravation.

913
00:40:00,968 --> 00:40:02,435
-Why, it is.
-How are you?

914
00:40:02,570 --> 00:40:05,472
-I'm good. You've got taller.
-Have I?

915
00:40:05,606 --> 00:40:07,308
No, either that,
or I got smaller.

916
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:08,542
Better posture, I think.

917
00:40:08,676 --> 00:40:10,077
No, I think it's better posture.

918
00:40:10,211 --> 00:40:11,913
-I think it is.
-Oh, my God, what an operation.

919
00:40:12,046 --> 00:40:13,446
[Philip] Yeah, that was a gift
from Discovery Channel.

920
00:40:13,915 --> 00:40:16,651
For, uh,
shall we call <i>Deadliest Catch.</i>

921
00:40:16,784 --> 00:40:18,119
Well,
we did a show called <i>Ax Men,</i>

922
00:40:18,252 --> 00:40:20,121
and we've been doing it
for eight years now.

923
00:40:20,254 --> 00:40:21,389
We do a show called

924
00:40:21,522 --> 00:40:22,757
<i>-Ice Road Truckers.</i>
-Right.

925
00:40:22,890 --> 00:40:24,725
I mean,
who knew you could do a show

926
00:40:24,859 --> 00:40:28,629
about men sitting in a truck
driving at 15 miles an hour

927
00:40:28,763 --> 00:40:31,132
for 15 hours at a time,
doing nothing?

928
00:40:31,265 --> 00:40:33,334
-You did.
-We did.

929
00:40:33,466 --> 00:40:35,136
[Philip] This was a gift
from the BBC.

930
00:40:36,070 --> 00:40:38,973
If you pull the top up,
it used to have a lighter in it.

931
00:40:39,106 --> 00:40:42,576
We saw a Dalek that had a baby
in the middle there--

932
00:40:42,710 --> 00:40:43,878
-Oh, right.
-Don't know

933
00:40:44,011 --> 00:40:45,379
-if you have seen that one.
-Yeah.

934
00:40:45,513 --> 00:40:46,948
-No, but a real baby.
-Oh, right.

935
00:40:47,081 --> 00:40:48,716
Look at this.
It's got a wonderful detail.

936
00:40:48,849 --> 00:40:50,651
Look at the, uh, the face.

937
00:40:51,385 --> 00:40:52,485
He looks a little crazy.

938
00:40:52,620 --> 00:40:54,021
-Yes.
-Yeah.

939
00:40:54,155 --> 00:40:55,589
-No, you sit there.
-All right. I'll sit there.

940
00:40:55,723 --> 00:40:56,958
[Matthew] This is your thing.
Yeah.

941
00:40:57,091 --> 00:40:58,559
[Philip] I haven't seen you
in 20 years.

942
00:40:58,693 --> 00:41:00,528
Almost 20 years.

943
00:41:01,362 --> 00:41:02,930
-96. Yeah.
-Yeah.

944
00:41:03,064 --> 00:41:04,865
I'm left with an image
in my mind.

945
00:41:04,999 --> 00:41:06,734
-Yeah.
-And you're left with an image

946
00:41:06,867 --> 00:41:08,636
in your mind,
of a thinner Matthew

947
00:41:08,769 --> 00:41:11,372
-who probably wore glasses, so--
-Well, yes, you did.

948
00:41:11,505 --> 00:41:12,940
-You wore glasses.
-[Matthew] Yeah.

949
00:41:13,074 --> 00:41:15,910
And, um, but you always had
that impish smile, and...

950
00:41:16,777 --> 00:41:18,412
you looked curious at the world.

951
00:41:18,980 --> 00:41:21,415
-I was impish?
-[Philip] Oh, yeah. Absolutely.

952
00:41:21,549 --> 00:41:23,918
On The Seven-Year Itch,
you said--

953
00:41:24,051 --> 00:41:25,786
oh-- you said, ""Oh, Matthew,
he's mad,

954
00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:29,023
he's completely mad,
he's totally mad.""

955
00:41:29,156 --> 00:41:31,625
And I was thinking of it,
""Was I really mad?""

956
00:41:31,759 --> 00:41:33,394
No, was I insane?

957
00:41:33,527 --> 00:41:36,597
I-- no, looking back on it now,
that wasn't a fair statement.

958
00:41:36,731 --> 00:41:40,534
It wasn't mad.
It was passionate.

959
00:41:41,102 --> 00:41:42,570
-Driven.
-[Matthew] Passion, yeah, yeah.

960
00:41:42,703 --> 00:41:46,273
And, um, you--
you were really driven

961
00:41:46,407 --> 00:41:48,242
by what you saw in your head.

962
00:41:48,376 --> 00:41:49,777
-[Matthew] Right.
-Everything, you saw everything

963
00:41:49,910 --> 00:41:51,746
-in pictures, I think.
-[Matthew] Yeah.

964
00:41:51,879 --> 00:41:53,647
Everything was images
in your head,

965
00:41:53,781 --> 00:41:56,050
and you wanted to express that.

966
00:41:56,183 --> 00:42:00,721
When <i>Doctor Who</i> came out,
when our movie came out,

967
00:42:00,855 --> 00:42:04,492
right, I felt as though
I just-- it was like,

968
00:42:04,625 --> 00:42:06,027
even though there
was some nice reviews...

969
00:42:06,160 --> 00:42:07,862
-Mmm.
-...people universally

970
00:42:07,995 --> 00:42:09,397
-went after the script.
-Yes.

971
00:42:09,530 --> 00:42:12,867
People would say, ""Lovely movie.
Shame about the script.""

972
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:14,735
-Yes.
-And they would say--

973
00:42:14,869 --> 00:42:16,237
They were gonna say that
about any script.

974
00:42:16,370 --> 00:42:17,605
Any script.

975
00:42:17,738 --> 00:42:19,740
Uh, I was at a convention
in Chicago...

976
00:42:19,874 --> 00:42:21,142
-Yeah.
-...uh, right after

977
00:42:21,275 --> 00:42:22,910
it first came out,
they flew me out there

978
00:42:23,044 --> 00:42:24,812
and all this stuff,
but I got physically assaulted

979
00:42:24,945 --> 00:42:27,181
by someone
who was so angry at the idea

980
00:42:27,314 --> 00:42:30,718
that the Doctor
would kiss anyone.

981
00:42:31,552 --> 00:42:32,586
I mean, I-- yeah,
it was physically,

982
00:42:32,720 --> 00:42:34,088
I thought he was going to hu--

983
00:42:34,221 --> 00:42:36,257
-I was very scared.
-[Matthew] Yes.

984
00:42:37,725 --> 00:42:39,193
It was a very bizarre moment.

985
00:42:39,326 --> 00:42:41,128
[Matthew] But-- yeah,
I wanted to do the kiss.

986
00:42:41,262 --> 00:42:42,763
-Didn't you? It was like--
-Of course.

987
00:42:42,897 --> 00:42:44,131
[Matthew] I mean, the--
the whole idea was

988
00:42:44,265 --> 00:42:45,766
we were doing
a more romantic Doctor.

989
00:42:45,900 --> 00:42:47,468
Well, he w-- and he w--
he was half-human.

990
00:42:47,968 --> 00:42:49,370
[Matthew] Exactly.

991
00:42:49,504 --> 00:42:51,705
[both laughing]

992
00:42:51,839 --> 00:42:53,174
That's why
if he kisses somebody,

993
00:42:53,307 --> 00:42:55,076
then he no longer belongs
to everybody, does he?

994
00:42:55,209 --> 00:42:58,179
-He belongs to someone.
-That's right. That's right.

995
00:42:58,312 --> 00:43:01,048
That-- but, but it's cool now,
because there are--

996
00:43:01,182 --> 00:43:02,883
-there are women involved.
-That's right.

997
00:43:03,017 --> 00:43:04,919
There are girls involved.
And so now you can be romantic.

998
00:43:05,052 --> 00:43:06,387
-Yeah. Exactly. But it's all--
-But before,

999
00:43:06,521 --> 00:43:07,922
-it was an anorak boys thing.
-That's right.

1000
00:43:08,055 --> 00:43:09,256

about being a <i>Doctor Who</i> fan.

00:53:03,216 --> 00:53:04,351
I'm starting to realize,

00:53:04,484 --> 00:53:06,954
maybe it's not all about
the show at all.

1209

the sense of community

that they find with each other.

[interviewer] Jackie Lane
is famous, kind of,

1248
00:54:52,894 --> 00:54:54,327
for almost vanishing
from <i>Doctor Who</i> fandom,

1249
00:54:54,461 --> 00:54:55,997
and has never really done
a convention

1250
00:54:56,130 --> 00:54:58,431
or been interviewed about
her time on <i>Doctor Who.</i>

1251
00:54:58,566 --> 00:55:00,333
Do you remember
meeting her on set,

-[Matthew] Yes, yes,

1253
00:55:02,136 --> 00:55:03,638
-I did meet her.
-Mm-hmm.

1254
00:55:03,771 --> 00:55:07,642
This is strange story, I mean,
it's all a half memory,

1255
00:55:07,775 --> 00:55:11,846
but my father, um, uh,
my-- my father w--

1256
00:55:13,548 --> 00:55:15,950
my father was bipolar.

1257
00:55:16,449 --> 00:55:18,886
So sometimes he would be,
you know,

1258
00:55:19,020 --> 00:55:21,689
manic, and sometimes
he would be depressed,

1259
00:55:21,823 --> 00:55:25,492
and in those days it was
a perilous kind of illness.

1260
00:55:25,626 --> 00:55:30,531
And one day he put together
a village fete,

1261
00:55:30,665 --> 00:55:32,432
where we lived out in Essex,

1262
00:55:32,567 --> 00:55:37,004
and he invited her
to be the celebrity who came

1263
00:55:37,138 --> 00:55:39,540
and, you know,
opened the village fete.

1264
00:55:39,674 --> 00:55:42,977
Um, and so my memory was
us picking her up

1265
00:55:43,110 --> 00:55:46,547
from Harlow Town station,
and I was very excited.

1266
00:55:47,014 --> 00:55:49,116
And Dad had said,
""You! You-- you, Matthew

1267
00:55:49,250 --> 00:55:50,551

that kind of thing,

1272
00:56:01,863 --> 00:56:03,396
uh, which of course,
I was a little kid,

1273
00:56:03,531 --> 00:56:04,866
it was totally weird.

1274
00:56:04,999 --> 00:56:06,466
Everybody ignored me,
and I was very upset,

1275
00:56:06,601 --> 00:56:08,836
but she was, I think,
quite sympathetic.

You are on hallowed ground.

1277

actually get to speak with her,

1278
00:56:12,840 --> 00:56:14,075
and, uh, have a relationship.

1279
00:56:14,208 --> 00:56:15,408
Well, I wonder why
she didn't turn up?

1280
00:56:15,543 --> 00:56:16,911
You know, maybe--

1281
00:56:17,044 --> 00:56:18,378
[interviewer]
I hope we didn't scare her off.

1282
00:56:18,512 --> 00:56:19,379
Maybe that's why
I kept away as well.

1283
00:56:19,513 --> 00:56:20,681
[interviewer] Possibly.

1284

Being connected with my dad,
yeah.

1285
00:56:23,784 --> 00:56:25,586
[Matthew] I think
most of my work's intertwined

1286
00:56:25,720 --> 00:56:27,788
with my relationship
with my father,

1287
00:56:27,922 --> 00:56:31,959
and with a very turbulent era
of my life.

1288
00:56:32,360 --> 00:56:33,594
This is me.

1289
00:56:34,228 --> 00:56:37,832
Looking a little bit shocked,
basically.

1290
00:56:38,266 --> 00:56:42,603
Where the big shift
that happened around 1963,

1291
00:56:42,737 --> 00:56:44,672
which is when
my mother committed suicide.

1292
00:56:45,072 --> 00:56:49,310
And when the whole life shifted
in this giant gear.

1293
00:56:49,442 --> 00:56:53,014
And even though
it wasn't like I'm going around

1294
00:56:53,147 --> 00:56:56,217
every time I see <i>Doctor Who,</i>
I-- you know,

1295
00:56:56,350 --> 00:56:57,685
I turn into...

1296
00:56:58,786 --> 00:57:00,922
Bates Motel. [hums Psycho theme]

1297
00:57:01,055 --> 00:57:02,723
[laughing] Um, you know,
it's f--

1298
00:57:02,857 --> 00:57:07,795
it is-- it is, um, it is
a very seminal part of my life,

1299
00:57:07,929 --> 00:57:11,065
the early '60s, um,
and then it stayed

1300
00:57:11,198 --> 00:57:13,935
as a constant reminder,
that is <i>Doctor Who.</i>

1301
00:57:14,068 --> 00:57:16,170
I think that it applies
to a lot of people.

1302
00:57:16,304 --> 00:57:21,208
A lot of people hold onto,
um, their memories

1303
00:57:21,342 --> 00:57:25,212
of TV shows at certain points
in their lives.

1304

1306
00:57:29,517 --> 00:57:32,353

a very young fan down there.

-How new are you?
-Two years.

1308
00:57:33,921 --> 00:57:36,757
My mom was re-watching
the whole series...

1309
00:57:37,591 --> 00:57:40,227
and so I was just like, ""Oh,
what is this she's watching?""

1310
00:57:40,361 --> 00:57:44,265
And then that's when
my Whovian-ship started.

1311
00:57:44,398 --> 00:57:45,933

1312
00:57:46,734 --> 00:57:47,835
My favorite Doctor

1313
00:57:47,969 --> 00:57:49,704
-is Matt Smith.
-[Matthew] Ah.

1314
00:57:49,837 --> 00:57:52,273
And when I first discovered him,
I started to see

1315
00:57:52,406 --> 00:57:56,744
a lot of myself in him,
and as was brought up earlier,

1316
00:57:56,877 --> 00:57:59,947
I also was-- was bullied
quite a bit as a kid.

1317
00:58:00,081 --> 00:58:02,516
And I always felt ashamed
for being the odd man out,

1318
00:58:02,650 --> 00:58:05,286
and ever since Matt Smith,
he has helped me

1319
00:58:05,419 --> 00:58:08,389
to embrace the silliness
and just go out and have fun

1320
00:58:08,522 --> 00:58:10,191
and-- and do whatever.

1321
00:58:11,692 --> 00:58:13,627
[Matthew]
<i>So is fandom a form of escape?</i>

1322
00:58:13,761 --> 00:58:15,629
I don't feel an escape,
or a leap of faith.

1323
00:58:15,763 --> 00:58:18,966
I feel a close
emotional connection.

1324
00:58:20,334 --> 00:58:22,403
In some ways, I aspire as a fan,

1325
00:58:22,536 --> 00:58:24,171
I aspire to be like what I see.

1326
00:58:24,305 --> 00:58:27,241
But I also see myself reflected
in it,

1327
00:58:27,375 --> 00:58:29,210
um, so it's--
it's a learning experience

1328
00:58:29,343 --> 00:58:31,512
and it's also
an aspirational experience.

Praise him!

[inhuman growling]

1335
00:59:07,181 --> 00:59:11,652
I know I have the body
of a weak and feeble woman,

1336
00:59:11,786 --> 00:59:15,322
but I have the heart
and the stomach of a king!

1337
00:59:15,456 --> 00:59:17,958
And of a king of England, too!

1338
00:59:18,092 --> 00:59:21,295
And to think that Dalek,
or Zygon,

1339
00:59:21,429 --> 00:59:24,865
or any creature of the universe
should dare to invade

1340
00:59:24,999 --> 00:59:30,204
the borders of my realm,
I myself shall take up arms!

1341
00:59:31,305 --> 00:59:32,440
Good Doctor!

1342
00:59:33,007 --> 00:59:36,511
The Doctor never a more noble
of a subject.

1343
00:59:36,644 --> 00:59:40,848
We shall have victory
over the enemies of my church

1344
00:59:40,981 --> 00:59:44,752

01:00:26,127 --> 01:00:27,728
It's turned my head a bit.

1352
01:00:27,862 --> 01:00:29,864
It was easy, at first,
to kind of...

1353
01:00:30,331 --> 01:00:31,632
not laugh at it.

1354
01:00:31,765 --> 01:00:32,967
I mean, it's easy to lampoon,

1355
01:00:33,100 --> 01:00:34,268
and some of it
is worth laughin' at.

1356
01:00:34,401 --> 01:00:36,103
-[Matthew] Yeah, yeah.
-Come on. But...

1357
01:00:36,237 --> 01:00:37,972
there's somethin' about it,
there's somethin' about...

1358
01:00:38,105 --> 01:00:39,206
you know, when you get people--

1359
01:00:39,340 --> 01:00:41,208
and these shows,
and these meetings

1360
01:00:41,342 --> 01:00:43,310
and these conventions,
and these weekends.

1361
01:00:44,044 --> 01:00:45,779
You know,
aside from being sociable,

1362
01:00:46,515 --> 01:00:48,315
Who-- you know
it's got a sense of humor...

1363
01:00:48,449 --> 01:00:50,084
-[Matthew] Right.
-...which is a great relief.

1364
01:00:50,217 --> 01:00:52,953
-Um, something goes on.
-[Matthew] Yeah.

1365
01:00:53,087 --> 01:00:54,556
You know, friendships that form.

1366
01:00:54,688 --> 01:00:56,023
And I mean that,
I mean that sincerely.

1367
01:00:56,157 --> 01:00:57,858
Yeah. And I've been
really-- that's why--

1368
01:00:57,992 --> 01:00:59,493
that-- that's what's keeping me
coming back to it.

1369
01:00:59,628 --> 01:01:02,696
That's what-- that's what
I enjoy the most about it.

1370
01:01:02,830 --> 01:01:04,031
Um... it--

1371
01:01:04,165 --> 01:01:06,066
-It is like finding a family.
-Yeah.

1372
01:01:06,200 --> 01:01:07,868
You're a part of this now!

1373
01:01:08,002 --> 01:01:09,370
-Forever.
-[Matthew] I know,

1374
01:01:09,503 --> 01:01:11,472
-it's mind-boggling.
-[fan] Forever, one of us.

1375
01:01:11,606 --> 01:01:13,140
Maybe we could do
a musical version

1376
01:01:13,274 --> 01:01:16,477
of the TV movie, you know,
a Broadway version.

1377
01:01:16,611 --> 01:01:18,212
-[audience member] Yes.
-Maybe you could write it.

1378
01:01:18,345 --> 01:01:21,081
Would you write it?
Cause it lends itself.

1379
01:01:21,215 --> 01:01:22,316
""Who Am I?""

1380
01:01:22,449 --> 01:01:25,352
I've actually been a fan
since the '96 movie,

1381
01:01:25,486 --> 01:01:27,388
which I've been laughed at for,
but--

1382
01:01:27,522 --> 01:01:28,523
-Why?
-You know what?

1383
01:01:28,657 --> 01:01:29,790
[Matthew] Which-- which I wrote.

1384
01:01:29,924 --> 01:01:31,358
-Nice.
-[Matthew] Yeah.

1385
01:01:31,492 --> 01:01:32,860
-And-- and co-produced.
-Can I get your autograph?

1386
01:01:32,993 --> 01:01:34,563
-[Matthew] Yes. Absolutely.
-Yes.

01:01:35,229 --> 01:01:36,864
Ah, I am so frickin' pretty!

1388
01:01:36,997 --> 01:01:39,366
Do you ever have those moments
where you're like--

1389
01:01:39,500 --> 01:01:40,868
no, really, really, it's a thing

1390
01:01:41,001 --> 01:01:42,102
with cosplayers
where you're-- you're working

1391
01:01:42,236 --> 01:01:43,538

fifty-odd years of it.

really take it--

have taken things to heart.

completely unexpectedly,
in 2009.

01:04:33,608 --> 01:04:35,643
He had a heart condition,
and he just--

1453
01:04:35,777 --> 01:04:37,911
one minute he was here,
and the next minute he was gone.

1454
01:04:38,546 --> 01:04:42,617
And it was... pretty devastating
for my son and myself.

1455
01:04:43,618 --> 01:04:47,622
Those quiet, silent times
between sunset and sunrise,

1456

And out of my sorrow.

1461
01:05:03,470 --> 01:05:05,205
And gave me
something to laugh at.

01:05:05,339 --> 01:05:06,775
And look forward to.

1463
01:05:07,542 --> 01:05:09,677
Without that,
I don't know where I would be.

01:05:13,480 --> 01:05:14,481
People come here

1465
01:05:14,616 --> 01:05:16,551
and they get involved
in time travel

1466
01:05:16,684 --> 01:05:19,521
and they can forget about
what's going on outside,

1467
01:05:19,654 --> 01:05:21,321

there's a lot of things

1468

that we don't
want to even talk about.

01:05:26,661 --> 01:05:27,796
hold that thought.

-Okay.
-Yeah.

1477
01:05:42,443 --> 01:05:45,379

kind of loaded, and...

01:05:46,213 --> 01:05:47,849
-Um, complex questions.
-[Matthew] Okay.

1479
01:05:47,981 --> 01:05:49,383
-You're gonna be fantastic.
-[Matthew] Um, I will.

that they attach to The Doctor,

that was set in America,

1584

1586
01:11:32,059 --> 01:11:34,996

1587

-Yes.

to be the best period

To be honest,
making stuff like this,

1595
01:11:55,149 --> 01:11:56,349
making small films

1596
01:11:56,483 --> 01:11:58,586
and Hollywood's
an ageist industry,

1597
01:11:58,719 --> 01:12:01,055
so as you get a little older,
you have to find

1598
01:12:01,189 --> 01:12:02,657
other ways of making films.

Link me in an hour
and bring all my scrilla, blud.

102
00:07:50,395 --> 00:07:54,227
Paper... All of the paper? I didn't know
you was coming out like today, rude boy.

103
00:07:54,399 --> 00:07:57,602
<i>- All of the paper, Don?</i>
- Yo, you turn into a fucking parrot?

104
00:07:58,322 --> 00:08:01,744
Bring all my papers, blud,
and link me outside the pen in an hour.

105
00:08:01,770 --> 00:08:03,488
You got a fucking problem with that?

106
00:08:04,685 --> 00:08:08,827
It's not a parrot thing, my parrot died
Alright, safe, we link up in a bit.

Fucking hell...

111
00:08:17,922 --> 00:08:21,125
Alright, Baby T?
Daddy's in trouble, right now.

112
00:08:28,558 --> 00:08:30,764
- I got that, you know. Mmm.
- Yeah?

113
00:08:30,935 --> 00:08:33,806
Looked like you was put under
a bit of pressure over there.

114
00:08:33,980 --> 00:08:35,557
- No pressure.
- No pressure?

115
00:08:36,774 --> 00:08:39,349
Hear what. Don't be acting like a killer

116
00:08:39,527 --> 00:08:42,362
just 'cause you got a ghost
under your belt.

117
00:08:42,530 --> 00:08:45,633
Just remember a man like me got many.
You understand?

118
00:08:49,584 --> 00:08:50,864
Funny boy.

119
00:08:53,207 --> 00:08:57,704
- Oi, okay. I gotta make a move.
- I'm in the bath, man.

120
00:09:01,299 --> 00:09:03,090
I know he lives around here somewhere.

121
00:09:03,259 --> 00:09:07,720
- It's one of these...
- It's either this one or that one...

122
00:09:07,889 --> 00:09:09,929
All these houses
are just the same to me.

123
00:09:18,524 --> 00:09:20,731
- Flash!
- Daddy!

124
00:09:20,902 --> 00:09:24,022
- Daddy! Daddy!
- Flash!

125
00:09:32,038 --> 00:09:34,707
- Mummy, where did Daddy go?
- Dickhead!

126
00:10:13,371 --> 00:10:14,533
Yo?

127
00:10:14,706 --> 00:10:16,532
<i>Yo, Flash, man. Where you, man?</i>

128
00:10:16,708 --> 00:10:20,290
- Yeah. I'm coming to you right now.
<i>- I'm at the spot, still.</i>

129
00:10:20,461 --> 00:10:22,454
Yeah. I'm coming to you.
Just relax, Don.

130
00:10:44,152 --> 00:10:45,896
Yo, Flash, where are you?

131
00:10:46,070 --> 00:10:48,858
- Yo, Don.
<i>- Hurry up. Hurry up, I beg you.</i>

132
00:10:50,158 --> 00:10:52,399
Blud, give me about ten, 15 minutes.

133
00:10:52,577 --> 00:10:54,866
Hurry up. People,
they're bugging me on the road.

134
00:10:55,037 --> 00:10:56,864
You trying to get me
sucked or something?

135
00:10:57,039 --> 00:10:58,072
Where are you?

00:10:58,249 --> 00:11:01,002
Give me about half an hour,
45 minutes and I'm with you.

137

You taking fucking long.

138
00:11:02,587 --> 00:11:05,790
Bear with me, man, I'll soon come,
half an hour, 45 minutes.

139
00:11:05,965 --> 00:11:09,168
- Yo, where are you?
- I'm coming straight to you right now.

140
00:11:09,343 --> 00:11:11,669
- I'm jumping in my car.
- I've been waiting long.

141
00:11:11,846 --> 00:11:13,590
- Like an hour and a half.
- Yeah.

142
00:11:13,765 --> 00:11:16,635
<i>Don't take the piss.
Make sure you're here, you know.</i>

143
00:11:16,809 --> 00:11:19,099
<i>People are bugging me about the food.</i>

144
00:11:35,244 --> 00:11:37,467
Three bricks of yay in the bag.

145
00:11:41,086 --> 00:11:46,252
- I'm sorry, I'm sorry!
- What the fuck are you doing to my car?

146
00:11:48,674 --> 00:11:52,756
What the fuck are you doing in my car?
Thiefing out of my whip, rude boy?

147
00:11:53,095 --> 00:11:56,797
- No, I'm not, man.
- You thiefing out of my fucking car?

148
00:11:56,974 --> 00:11:59,727
- No. No. No. No.
- No? Look at me.

149
00:12:02,063 --> 00:12:05,065
I know this face from somewhere,
your mum smokes the dope?

150
00:12:05,233 --> 00:12:08,566
- Yeah.
- Pest, that's your name, Don.

151
00:12:08,736 --> 00:12:10,018
That's what they call me.

152
00:12:10,196 --> 00:12:13,862
Look at your fucking hat and
all of this. Look at this shit, blud.

153
00:12:14,033 --> 00:12:16,821
You see, when I was your age
I was fucking licking raises,

154
00:12:16,994 --> 00:12:18,702
I was fucking pop a tom or pull a bag.

155
00:12:18,871 --> 00:12:21,280
You think I'd ever hit the road
looking like this?

156
00:12:21,457 --> 00:12:23,165
You have to do something with yourself.

157
00:12:23,334 --> 00:12:25,659
Can't be standing around
wastemanning it out.

158
00:12:25,837 --> 00:12:27,498
- Hear this.
- I'm not a wasteman.

159
00:12:27,672 --> 00:12:29,546
Yous look like a fucking wasteman.

160
00:12:29,715 --> 00:12:32,919
Fucking hell. You better do
something with yourself, 'cause I know

161
00:12:33,094 --> 00:12:35,502
your mum ain't got no money
to buy you no trainers.

162
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:38,301
- Yeah, I know.
- Right, now, listen to me.

163
00:12:38,474 --> 00:12:41,013
- Lickle raise.
- What raise, what sort of raise?

164
00:12:41,185 --> 00:12:43,345
What do I do? Rob a bank or something?

165
00:12:43,521 --> 00:12:46,309
Nah, forget all of that.
You're not at that level now.

166
00:12:46,482 --> 00:12:49,981
Listen. Don't get scared, get mad,
spot the victim, pop the bag

167
00:12:50,152 --> 00:12:53,356
and run and don't get nabbed.
You understand that, blud?

168
00:12:53,531 --> 00:12:55,571
- Yeah.
- Go and do your thing.

169
00:12:55,741 --> 00:12:58,576
And listen to me. If I ever
catch you in my fucking car again

170
00:12:58,744 --> 00:13:01,615
I'm going to kick your fucking face off.
Understand that?

171
00:13:01,789 --> 00:13:06,914
Do your thing, Don. Fucking hell.

172
00:13:38,784 --> 00:13:45,036
Yo, it's Flash, you need food?
Phone you back in a bit.

173
00:13:45,207 --> 00:13:46,785
- Flash!
- Flash.

174
00:13:49,420 --> 00:13:52,208
What's poppin'? What you saying, G?

175
00:13:52,381 --> 00:13:53,758
Cool, cool.

176
00:13:53,925 --> 00:13:55,632
Fuck all, man.

177
00:13:55,801 --> 00:13:58,091
Angel's touching road, blud.

178
00:13:58,262 --> 00:14:02,924
Hmm... that's kind of the problem
right now. I got 500 thou for the man.

179
00:14:03,100 --> 00:14:05,722
- Serious, blud?
- I've only got 400 thousand of it.

180
00:14:05,895 --> 00:14:07,935
I owe my man 100 grand, rude boy.

181
00:14:08,105 --> 00:14:09,387
Bloodclot!

182
00:14:09,565 --> 00:14:11,689
I got the food in the car
right now, blud.

183
00:14:11,859 --> 00:14:13,108
Buoy, Don.

184
00:14:15,029 --> 00:14:16,690
D'you need food?

185
00:14:16,864 --> 00:14:21,408
I'm wounded right now, B,
I've got pure food, pure food.

186
00:14:21,577 --> 00:14:24,864
I need to go out on the road
and lick two sales. You get me?

187
00:14:25,039 --> 00:14:27,448
That's what I'm saying, blud, fucked up.

188
00:14:27,625 --> 00:14:29,950
Fucking hell. Try Evil.

189
00:14:30,127 --> 00:14:34,339
Evil, blud? Evil's a dodgy guy,
rude boy. I can't fuck with him, man.

190
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:39,217
Boy, he's been sticking up pure man
on the ends lately still,

191
00:14:39,387 --> 00:14:41,344
but he's the man with the P's, blud.

Sorry about that.

Where's my Coke?

247
00:17:38,149 --> 00:17:40,106
Haven't had good food for ages.

You get me. Some joke thing. You get me.

253
00:18:00,045 --> 00:18:03,297
Imagine my man phoned me a half hour
before he got popped, you know,

254
00:18:03,465 --> 00:18:05,506
and told me to come and link him.

255
00:18:05,676 --> 00:18:09,971
I was up in that dutty bloodclot girl,
Simone's yard. You get me.

256
00:18:10,139 --> 00:18:12,429
I miss him, cuz.

257
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:15,933
Joke thing. Imagine my man,
like walked around the corner

258
00:18:16,103 --> 00:18:18,345
or phoned me ten minutes earlier.

259
00:18:18,522 --> 00:18:21,144
Or even bent down
to tie his shoelace or something.

260
00:18:21,317 --> 00:18:25,612

353
00:24:57,254 --> 00:25:00,338
- Yo. I'm down by the ends.
- All right, say no more.

354
00:25:09,975 --> 00:25:12,099
Make sure you got
the money by one.

355
00:25:12,269 --> 00:25:14,475
- Definitely. One o'clock.
- One o'clock. Serious.

356
00:25:14,646 --> 00:25:16,687
- I'll have that.
- Cool.

00:25:53,685 --> 00:25:55,393
Wagwan, Don? Tell me.

360
00:25:55,562 --> 00:25:58,433

00:26:03,820 --> 00:26:06,395
No I ain't got the scrilla, fam. Na...

364
00:26:06,573 --> 00:26:09,860
What do you mean ""Na,"" blud?
That's what I said to you on the phone.

365
00:26:10,035 --> 00:26:12,325
I didn't know you wanted
the money right now.

366
00:26:12,496 --> 00:26:16,197
That's what I'm trying to tell you. That
back slam shallawa shallawa bullshit.

367
00:26:16,375 --> 00:26:19,542
You have to talk a bit slower,
I don't really too understand it.

368
00:26:19,711 --> 00:26:21,538
I thought you said ""can I deal with it?""

369
00:26:21,713 --> 00:26:24,086
- I can deal with it.
- It's not a thing like that.

370
00:26:24,257 --> 00:26:26,417
It's not a work thing.
I need the scrilla now.

371
00:26:26,593 --> 00:26:29,962
My man's talking. I need to link him
in an hour, you know how he goes on.

372
00:26:30,138 --> 00:26:32,713
I'm not looking to wigged over
fucking this scrilla.

373
00:26:32,891 --> 00:26:35,382
I can get it for you.
You got the yay, I got the paper.

374
00:26:35,560 --> 00:26:37,387
We can go to my baby mother's,
pick it up.

375
00:26:37,562 --> 00:26:39,971
- It's not long.
- Since when you got a baby mother?

376
00:26:40,148 --> 00:26:43,316
What do you mean? Come on.
Have you got a baby mother?

377
00:26:43,485 --> 00:26:45,229
Yeah, you know who my baby mother is.

378
00:26:45,404 --> 00:26:48,192
- Who's your baby mother?
- You don't know her. She's...

379
00:26:48,365 --> 00:26:51,034
She's not from around here,
but she's kind of close by.

380
00:26:51,201 --> 00:26:53,028
- Close by, rude boy?
- You get me so...

381
00:26:53,203 --> 00:26:55,742

Look at what I am repping...

383
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:01,836
Yo, come on, behave yourself.
A hundred grand is nothing.

384
00:27:02,003 --> 00:27:06,832
It's a minor. Understand? What you going
to say, you wanna go for the paper?

385
00:27:07,008 --> 00:27:09,168
We can go for it now.
You wanna jump in my car?

386
00:27:09,344 --> 00:27:10,542
You know something.

387
00:27:10,721 --> 00:27:13,924
Better still we jump in this,

388
00:27:14,099 --> 00:27:16,638

389
00:27:36,997 --> 00:27:38,872
Everything cool though differently?

390
00:27:39,040 --> 00:27:41,579
Yeah, man. Yeah, blud.
Living and breathing.

391
00:27:41,752 --> 00:27:45,038
- I can't complain. Doing my thing...
- That's the main thing.

392
00:27:45,213 --> 00:27:49,081
If my man didn't come out of jail today
it'd have been a lily more easy.

393
00:27:49,259 --> 00:27:51,750
It's a headache.
I wasn't expecting to see him.

394
00:27:51,928 --> 00:27:55,297
Good to see him still, differently,
but wasn't expecting to see him.

395
00:27:55,474 --> 00:27:59,341
- You get me?
- Rather you than me, B.

396
00:27:59,519 --> 00:28:02,094
Take a right when you
get down the bottom there.

397
00:28:12,783 --> 00:28:17,777
Yo, where the fuck you are
really bringing me, you know, Don?

398
00:28:18,872 --> 00:28:23,498
- You worry too much. You're with me.
- With you. It's Zampa Boy ends.

399
00:28:23,668 --> 00:28:26,622
So with you and the Zampa Boys
'round here. You mad.

400
00:28:26,797 --> 00:28:28,865
Don't watch nothing. Everything's cool.

401
00:28:28,923 --> 00:28:30,632
Yeah, so you think, rude boy.

402
00:28:33,053 --> 00:28:34,714
Fuck, blud.

403
00:28:34,888 --> 00:28:37,890
You worry too much, man.
I got it covered...

404
00:28:38,225 --> 00:28:41,344
Frightened Friday all the time.
Just keep driving.

405
00:28:45,982 --> 00:28:50,893
Now listen, man. Just remember you're
the only person to see me cry, you know.

406
00:28:52,697 --> 00:28:55,699
When El Presidente died.
Don't watch nothing.

407
00:28:55,867 --> 00:28:58,406
- I got your back.
- Say no more, cuz.

408
00:28:58,578 --> 00:29:00,453

409
00:29:00,622 --> 00:29:03,540
- Yeah, but drive. Stop worrying.

410
00:29:18,723 --> 00:29:22,769
We're here.
My girl's is just over the grass.

411
00:29:22,936 --> 00:29:25,427

Else people wouldn't get involved in it.

572
00:39:39,719 --> 00:39:42,886
But it's the consequence
that crime brings,

573
00:39:43,055 --> 00:39:46,093
you're constantly
looking over your shoulders.

574
00:39:47,143 --> 00:39:51,390
- What kind of a lifestyle is that?
- I respect you, Big Man.

575
00:39:51,564 --> 00:39:55,230
We need to sit down and
reason differently, one of these days...

576
00:39:55,401 --> 00:39:56,979
- You walk tall.
- Yeah, man.

577
00:39:57,153 --> 00:40:00,404
No doubt that police siren
is another incident

578
00:40:00,573 --> 00:40:05,034
that's just gone off in the community.
Probably somebody else is dead.

579
00:40:05,203 --> 00:40:09,118
That's what we're hearing every day,
man. You are causing it.

580
00:40:09,290 --> 00:40:11,366
You and your friends are causing it.

581
00:40:11,542 --> 00:40:14,995
You are taking away
the very sanctity of the neighbourhood

582
00:40:15,171 --> 00:40:17,579
because of what you
are doing in the community.

583
00:40:17,757 --> 00:40:21,293
And, sadly, you are killing each other.

584
00:40:21,469 --> 00:40:24,304
You are exterminating your own race,

585
00:40:24,472 --> 00:40:27,805
because of the stupidities
of your actions.

586
00:40:27,975 --> 00:40:30,514
It's evil, Terence. It's evil.

587
00:40:32,438 --> 00:40:33,980
I hear you, Big Man.

588
00:40:34,148 --> 00:40:38,194
But, right now, if you give me
your number or something.

589
00:40:38,361 --> 00:40:40,401
I beg you drop me
by town 'cause I need to,

590
00:40:40,571 --> 00:40:42,564
I got one and two things I need to do.

591
00:40:46,244 --> 00:40:49,613

- Yo.
- Yo, where are you?

596
00:41:09,433 --> 00:41:12,186
Just hold tight for me.
Right now I'm coming to you.

597
00:41:12,353 --> 00:41:14,394
You're really testing my patience now.

598
00:41:14,564 --> 00:41:16,853
- If you don't...
- Hello?

599
00:41:17,024 --> 00:41:21,070
Where are you?
I've already been here for four hours!

600
00:41:21,237 --> 00:41:23,112
- It don't look good!
- Four hours!

601
00:41:23,281 --> 00:41:26,235
How long you going to be?
Fuck, how long you going to be?

602
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:27,792
I'm sending someone
else out to get it.

603
00:41:27,867 --> 00:41:29,992
No, look I'm coming to you right now,
bear with me.

604
00:41:30,028 --> 00:41:31,985
Call that later... Yo.

605
00:41:33,601 --> 00:41:34,644
Hello?

606
00:41:36,460 --> 00:41:40,376
I know you've been there hours, I'm
coming to you. I can't move no quicker.

607
00:41:40,548 --> 00:41:43,003
I'm under pressure.
If I ever told you I was going--

608
00:41:43,175 --> 00:41:45,928
- I'm not joking.
- Relax yourself.

609
00:41:46,095 --> 00:41:49,179
You said that about four, five
hours ago, you're on your way.

610
00:41:49,348 --> 00:41:53,513
I know you're out, come out the heat,
sit down in the shade or something.

611
00:41:53,686 --> 00:41:55,928
Dickhead. Prick.

612
00:42:00,568 --> 00:42:02,478
- Hello.
<i>- Yo, where's my money?</i>

613
00:42:03,199 --> 00:42:05,522
<i>- ...a problem...</i>
- What? Yo!

614
00:42:05,698 --> 00:42:08,237
I'm waiting on you.
I've got people waiting on me.

615
00:42:08,409 --> 00:42:10,651
I'm looking like a fucking prick
in front of them.

616
00:42:10,828 --> 00:42:13,830
- That's your problem.
<i>- Got it sorted. I'm there in a bit.</i>

617
00:42:16,196 --> 00:42:17,239
Fuck.

618
00:42:22,798 --> 00:42:27,010
Yo! What you doing

619
00:42:27,657 --> 00:42:28,340
Huh?

620
00:42:28,512 --> 00:42:30,505
My mum brought me here
when I was younger.

621
00:42:30,681 --> 00:42:33,006
What you saying?
Come here to do some shopping?

622
00:42:33,184 --> 00:42:34,216
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

623
00:42:34,393 --> 00:42:37,762

626
00:42:44,070 --> 00:42:45,980
Right now, blud. Listen to me.

627
00:42:46,155 --> 00:42:48,646
You can't be in this part of town.
It's not our endz.

628
00:42:48,824 --> 00:42:51,399
These youths are out here
looking for man right now.

629
00:42:51,577 --> 00:42:55,444
I'm sure I can see them right there.
Come on, I can see them right there.

630
00:42:55,623 --> 00:42:58,162
- Come. Come on!
- Yo, what!

631
00:42:58,334 --> 00:43:00,244
There he is! There he is!

00:43:27,947 --> 00:43:30,438
Got trousers that will match these?

633
00:43:30,616 --> 00:43:33,570
This would look nice
with some baggy jeans.

634
00:43:33,744 --> 00:43:35,619
That is a boom top...
What the hell?

635
00:43:35,788 --> 00:43:38,078

Late for El Prezzie's day as well. Shit.

00:46:48,272 --> 00:46:50,514
There's Flash.

00:46:50,691 --> 00:46:52,933

- Mmm.
- What's popping?

697
00:47:08,667 --> 00:47:11,337
Yo, blud, Angel's looking for you, blud.

698
00:47:11,503 --> 00:47:16,297
- He's on a mad thing, Don.
- Beating off his gums, blud?

699
00:47:16,467 --> 00:47:20,844
Beating them off, blud. Watch out,
you get me. He's on a mad one.

700
00:47:24,642 --> 00:47:26,386
If Prezzie was about still.

701
00:47:26,560 --> 00:47:28,766
Streets ain't been the same
since he's gone.

702
00:47:36,946 --> 00:47:41,572
Swear. In a mad way, I can still hear
the nigger's voice in my head.

703
00:47:42,618 --> 00:47:45,287
All the tracks that we
did together and that, man.

704
00:47:46,830 --> 00:47:50,082
Even down to the other day
I was listening to the CD still.

705
00:47:51,085 --> 00:47:52,911
Mmm.

706
00:47:53,087 --> 00:47:56,005
Blud, right now, my man
was there for me, you get me?

707
00:47:56,173 --> 00:48:00,669
When my mum kicked me out my yard, Don,
he was the only one who took me in.

708
00:48:00,844 --> 00:48:03,514
The geezer kept me out of trouble,
blud, you get me?

709
00:48:03,681 --> 00:48:06,848
When I was on a mad thing,
he made sure that I didn't go jail.

710
00:48:07,685 --> 00:48:09,227
I love him for that.

711
00:48:12,064 --> 00:48:14,140
Blud, I feel it for you, Don.

712
00:48:14,316 --> 00:48:16,938
Got kicked out of my house, too.

713
00:48:17,111 --> 00:48:21,690
- Wish I knew him.
- My man was a Dads.

714
00:48:21,865 --> 00:48:23,740
You get me? Straight Dads.

715
00:48:23,909 --> 00:48:27,077
He had the streets boxed
when he was on road. D'you get me?

716
00:48:27,246 --> 00:48:28,492
Serious.

717
00:48:28,664 --> 00:48:31,666
We need to go do what we got to do,
blud. For our nigger.

718
00:48:32,376 --> 00:48:36,042
- Don't want to hear nothing else.
- I hear what you're saying. I hear you,

719
00:48:36,213 --> 00:48:39,001
but a certain time, that's not
always the way, you get me?

720
00:48:39,174 --> 00:48:41,796
- It's not always the way.
- I don't care about the way.

721
00:48:41,969 --> 00:48:44,590
It's about El Prezzie.
They killed our nigger.

722
00:48:44,763 --> 00:48:46,839
There is a time
and a place for everything.

723
00:48:47,016 --> 00:48:50,349
I knew you were going to come out
with that. I don't want to hear that,

724
00:48:50,519 --> 00:48:52,512
Don't wanna hear about
no time and place.

725
00:48:52,688 --> 00:48:53,886
Listen, listen.

726
00:48:54,064 --> 00:48:56,306
- Just forget it.
- Shut your mouth.

727
00:48:56,483 --> 00:48:58,856
Don't speak.
Know who you are speaking to.

728
00:48:59,028 --> 00:49:02,396
- Don't speak.
- As long as a year down the line

729
00:49:02,573 --> 00:49:07,235
I'm not here same place, same thing,
but at your graveside, you get me.

730
00:49:07,411 --> 00:49:10,199
- That's all I'm sayin'.

00:56:09,026 --> 00:56:10,663
You want to come to church with me?

841
00:56:10,834 --> 00:56:14,333
Nanny, my generation don't too believe
in the church thing, you know.

842
00:56:14,504 --> 00:56:15,833
We believe in the big bang.

843
00:56:16,006 --> 00:56:19,173
Big bang? What you name so?
What are you a call big bang?

844
00:56:19,342 --> 00:56:22,095
You know, evolution,
the beginning of time.

845
00:56:22,262 --> 00:56:25,798
Instead of, like, God at the beginning,
there was a big bang,

846
00:56:25,974 --> 00:56:29,225
and that's what created everything.
Don't you know about evolution?

847
00:56:29,394 --> 00:56:32,514
- No.
- Evolution. Beginning of time.

848
00:56:32,689 --> 00:56:35,358
- The big bang.
- You know something.

849
00:56:35,525 --> 00:56:38,942
If you no come a church with me,

850
00:56:39,112 --> 00:56:42,980
you're gonna hell and you a gonna burn.

851
00:56:43,909 --> 00:56:47,776
You know when they gave you that bible
they gave you in the slave days.

852
00:56:47,954 --> 00:56:50,624
To turn the other cheek.
It was a mind control.

853
00:56:50,790 --> 00:56:55,666
Right now there is a big conspiracy
going on. The Illuminati, Freemasons.

854
00:56:55,837 --> 00:56:58,376
- They got us really confused.
- Freemasons?

855
00:56:58,548 --> 00:57:00,090
- Yeah.
- What name Freemasons?

856
00:57:00,258 --> 00:57:02,215
Me not know about Freemasons.

857
00:57:02,385 --> 00:57:05,470
They're involved in the conspiracy
to keep the black man down.

858
00:57:05,639 --> 00:57:07,513
Me and you need to sit down and reason.

859
00:57:07,682 --> 00:57:10,720
Personally, I'm trying to
elevate myself, get my mind right

860
00:57:10,894 --> 00:57:12,970
so I can activate my seven chakras.

861
00:57:13,146 --> 00:57:15,187
Shackles, me no know what you call so.

862
00:57:15,357 --> 00:57:18,441
Chakras, if you activate your
seven chakras, you can activate

863
00:57:18,610 --> 00:57:21,564
your pioneer gland. Then me and you
can speak without speaking.

864
00:57:21,738 --> 00:57:26,068
Bullshit. All you're doing is running
out there with your gang-banging-self

865
00:57:26,243 --> 00:57:29,861
selling your drugs, keeping
yourself down. And what about us women?

866
00:57:30,038 --> 00:57:33,289
Breeding up. One after another.
You're just full of shit.

867
00:57:33,959 --> 00:57:36,829
Stop. We not talk about big bang,

868
00:57:37,003 --> 00:57:41,334
pioneer gland,
goddamn pen and thiefing TV.

869
00:57:41,508 --> 00:57:44,960
Wanna stop man, all me want to do
is eat me food and get fat.

870
00:57:45,136 --> 00:57:47,177

- On the road.

1048
01:10:25,563 --> 01:10:27,639
Do I give a shit about the fucking road?

1049
01:10:27,815 --> 01:10:31,433
Make sure you've got money. This morning
you never had nothing to eat.

1050
01:10:31,610 --> 01:10:33,686
You hadn't had a change,
hadn't had a wash for days.

1051
01:10:33,863 --> 01:10:37,908
I don't care. Why are you shotting my
mum shit though, man? What the fuck?

1052
01:10:38,075 --> 01:10:40,828
Getting all emotional, blud.
You look weak, rude boy.

1053
01:10:40,995 --> 01:10:43,949
Man'll walk all over you if
you're looking weak, you know.

1054
01:10:44,123 --> 01:10:48,074
You understand that? Look,
you don't want to be doing that shit.

1055
01:10:48,252 --> 01:10:51,087
Fix up, rude boy.
Are you rolling with me or not?

1056
01:10:51,255 --> 01:10:54,292
If you crying and shit like a baby,
blud, get out of the car.

1057
01:10:55,968 --> 01:10:57,214
Huh?

1058
01:10:57,386 --> 01:11:00,257
- Treating me like this?
- Fix the fuck up, blud.

1059
01:11:00,431 --> 01:11:02,009
- You, blud.
- Me?

1060
01:11:02,183 --> 01:11:03,511
Shut up, man.

1061
01:11:05,311 --> 01:11:07,932
Crying like some
little fucking girl, blud.

1062
01:11:12,109 --> 01:11:14,150
Here, hold this.

1063
01:11:15,029 --> 01:11:18,695
Start work for me tomorrow, but take
note of everything I do, you hear me?

1064
01:11:19,950 --> 01:11:22,406
Trick is to deal with them
as quick as possible.

1065
01:11:22,578 --> 01:11:24,987
- Yo, blud.
- Fucking hell.

1066
01:11:25,164 --> 01:11:26,196
What's popping, G?

1067
01:11:26,374 --> 01:11:31,249
Man was beginning to think
you were dead. What the fuck?

1068
01:11:31,420 --> 01:11:34,208
Man, left man waiting out there
for over five hours.

1069
01:11:34,382 --> 01:11:36,873
- I'm going to give you the thing.
- It's hot anyway.

1070
01:11:37,051 --> 01:11:39,008
- Yeah, yeah. It's hot.
- Cool.

1071
01:11:39,178 --> 01:11:41,005
- Sauna.
- Yeah, yeah.

1072
01:11:45,684 --> 01:11:48,769
Yo, Flash, what the fuck you call this?

1073
01:11:48,938 --> 01:11:52,604
Here, take these couple.
Deal with the rest of it later on.

1074
01:11:52,775 --> 01:11:55,859
- What you got for me?
- You want more, Don?

1075
01:11:56,028 --> 01:11:58,781
Don't fuck with me, rude boy. Yo.

1076
01:11:58,948 --> 01:12:00,858
- Alright, yeah.
- Walk safe with it, G.

1077
01:12:01,033 --> 01:12:02,065
In a minute.

1078
01:12:03,160 --> 01:12:08,119
Yo, Flash, you take the piss.

1079
01:12:08,290 --> 01:12:10,497
Blud, my day's been fucked up.

1080
01:12:10,668 --> 01:12:14,001
I don't care about your day.
There's been money to be made out there,

1081
01:12:14,171 --> 01:12:18,217
and you there taking the piss.
Who's this little shit anyway?

1082
01:12:18,384 --> 01:12:21,172
- Shut the fuck up.
- See...

1083
01:12:21,345 --> 01:12:24,632
See, while you're there picking up
little hood rats, you get me,

1084
01:12:24,807 --> 01:12:27,633
money's just been taking its time
to come, you get me?

1085
01:12:27,659 --> 01:12:31,535
But anyway, sort me out
with a little soops.

1086
01:12:33,656 --> 01:12:34,482
Safe.

1087
01:12:36,193 --> 01:12:38,433
Just doing business.
Hold it, yeah?

1088
01:12:40,857 --> 01:12:41,865
That scrilla, blud.

1089
01:12:42,439 --> 01:12:45,651
Getting hold of the money,
seven thousand pounds

1090
01:12:45,828 --> 01:12:48,483
in a 120 seconds, rude boy.

1091
01:12:57,173 --> 01:12:58,750
What time is it?

1092
01:12:58,924 --> 01:13:02,590
- I'm on point.
- You better be.

1093
01:13:19,653 --> 01:13:22,323
You alright, baby? Hmm?

1094
01:13:22,490 --> 01:13:25,111
Sorry about earlier, man.

1095
01:13:26,619 --> 01:13:28,992
This pretty face.

1096
01:13:30,498 --> 01:13:32,408
Don't move away from me.

1097
01:13:35,336 --> 01:13:39,168
S'wrong? Not talking to me
because of that bullshit?

1098
01:13:39,340 --> 01:13:43,717
Baby? Hmm?

1099
01:13:43,886 --> 01:13:46,341
I need my money, babe.

1100
01:13:46,514 --> 01:13:49,052
I'm going to have the money
for you later, alright.

1101
01:13:49,225 --> 01:13:52,641
- You know I love you, innit.
- I love you, too.

1102
01:13:54,563 --> 01:13:55,545
Hmm?

1103
01:13:58,526 --> 01:14:00,518
So sexy.

1104
01:14:11,142 --> 01:14:12,116
Flash!

1105
01:14:22,216 --> 01:14:23,793
Gentlemen.

1106
01:14:24,635 --> 01:14:26,044
Cool. Yeah.

1107
01:14:26,220 --> 01:14:29,008
- You seen Ashantay?
- Me no see her.

1108
01:14:37,398 --> 01:14:38,809
Big man.

1109
01:14:38,983 --> 01:14:41,272
You cool? Yeah, man. Yeah.

1110
01:14:42,319 --> 01:14:43,945
Cool.

1111
01:14:48,534 --> 01:14:50,409
Man, you alright?

1112
01:14:54,582 --> 01:14:56,408
- You alright?
- Yeah, I'm alright.

1113
01:14:56,584 --> 01:14:58,079
- You sure?
- Yeah.

1114
01:14:58,252 --> 01:15:00,494
- Sorted out everything still.
- You sure?

1115
01:15:00,671 --> 01:15:02,332
Yeah, it's alright.

1116
01:15:03,632 --> 01:15:05,424
See Ashantay, Mummy?

1117
01:15:05,593 --> 01:15:08,001
She over there in the kitchen
there, so you know.

1118
01:15:13,809 --> 01:15:16,430
Ashantay, baby. What's happening?

1119
01:15:16,604 --> 01:15:18,680
Why, what you saying?

1120
01:15:18,856 --> 01:15:25,108
Not much. Just come to tell you
how much I love you.

1121
01:15:25,279 --> 01:15:27,154
- Me?
- Yeah, you.

1122
01:15:27,323 --> 01:15:31,534
- Okay. What's brought all this on?
- Nothing.

1123
01:15:32,411 --> 01:15:35,329
Going to marry you one of
these days, you know that, don't you?

1124
01:15:35,497 --> 01:15:37,242
- Married.
- Married.

1125
01:15:40,002 --> 01:15:42,872
Suppose you're going get me
a big house in the country?

1126
01:15:43,047 --> 01:15:44,079
Umm-hmm.

1127
01:15:44,256 --> 01:15:47,127
- Big ring.
- So where's my ring?

1128
01:15:47,301 --> 01:15:50,800
I'm going to buy you one real soon,
when I buy you the house...

1129
01:15:54,850 --> 01:15:56,677
So, really, what's going on?

1130
01:15:58,979 --> 01:16:00,806
I'm kind of in some trouble.

1131
01:16:02,816 --> 01:16:06,020
You always come to me when you're
in trouble. What is it this time?

1132
01:16:07,363 --> 01:16:09,154
Money trouble.

1133
01:16:10,449 --> 01:16:13,154
I wanted to believe it,
but I was just waiting for it.

1134
01:16:13,327 --> 01:16:16,696
You're in trouble so you come
sniffing around me. What do you want?

1135
01:16:18,957 --> 01:16:21,662
You want the chain?
The one good thing you give me?

1136
01:16:23,796 --> 01:16:27,497
I'm going to get you another one.
I just need to take it for a hot second.

1137
01:16:27,675 --> 01:16:30,510
Not bad enough I have to care
for the youths all of the time,

1138
01:16:30,678 --> 01:16:33,299
and the one little thing
that I've got, you want.

1139
01:16:33,472 --> 01:16:36,924
You know what, take it,
I don't even want nothing from you.

1140
01:16:37,101 --> 01:16:38,596
You can have it. Yeah?

1141
01:16:38,769 --> 01:16:42,221
- You got what you want now.
- You know I love you, innit.

1142

I'm going to sleep on the floor,
or the settee.

1363
01:34:51,068 --> 01:34:54,188
Me new brand settee that me just buy?

1364
01:34:54,363 --> 01:34:59,239
- No. Just for tonight, Nan.
- Just for the one night.

1365
01:34:59,410 --> 01:35:02,827
You come wake me up out of my sleep.

1366
01:35:02,997 --> 01:35:05,239
- You feisty...
- Sorry, Nan.

1367
01:35:05,416 --> 01:35:10,043
You know something?
Me a gonna tell you momma, you know.

1368
01:35:10,213 --> 01:35:12,289
Me a going to call you momma
and tell her.

1369
01:35:12,465 --> 01:35:15,633
Not come back here again,
you better come out.

1370
01:35:15,802 --> 01:35:21,591
Me no want you here.
You hear me say?

1371
01:35:21,766 --> 01:35:24,684
Ah, Oh!

1372
01:35:45,706 --> 01:35:47,830
Flash.

1373
01:35:48,292 --> 01:35:50,000
Flash.

1374
01:35:51,170 --> 01:35:52,997
Flash, oi.

1375
01:35:53,172 --> 01:35:55,711
Is Kite dead?

1376
01:36:02,731 --> 01:36:04,674
Is... Are all of them dead?

1377
01:36:06,686 --> 01:36:09,260
Don't worry about that right now.

1378
01:36:09,438 --> 01:36:13,057
Tomorrow I'm going to
sort out everything.

1379
01:36:13,234 --> 01:36:15,559
Done it with this road thing, blud.

1380
01:36:20,366 --> 01:36:25,574
You see this here, this 100 grand here,
you can do anything you like,

1381
01:36:25,746 --> 01:36:28,914
you hear me? Where would you like to go?

1382
01:36:33,004 --> 01:36:34,546
America.

1383
01:36:34,714 --> 01:36:36,754
Tomorrow we sort it out. We go America.

1384
01:36:36,924 --> 01:36:40,756
Go to sleep, and don't worry
about nothing. It's going to be cool.

1385
01:36:40,928 --> 01:36:44,262
You hear me. Go to sleep.

1386
01:37:43,741 --> 01:37:46,576
Blud, are you going to
answer your phone, man?

1387
01:37:48,245 --> 01:37:51,413
Fuck, man.

1388
01:38:02,468 --> 01:38:08,056
- Yo.
<i>- Yo, you need that food still?</i>

1389
01:38:08,224 --> 01:38:11,557
<i>- Yo...</i>
- I don't know, you know.

1390
01:38:13,813 --> 01:38:16,138
- I don't know.
<i>- Where's Flash?</i>

1391
01:38:16,315 --> 01:38:20,562
- We need the food still?
- Yeah... Yeah.

1392
01:38:20,736 --> 01:38:22,812
<i>Tell him I got three bricks, 100 bags.</i>

1393
01:38:22,989 --> 01:38:25,693
Yeah, safe, you know what? Make it four.

1394
01:38:25,866 --> 01:38:28,026
<i>Put Flash on the phone!</i>

1395
01:38:31,247 --> 01:38:34,201
- Yo.
<i>- Yo. You want that then?</i>

1396
01:38:34,375 --> 01:38:38,373
What you saying? Three boxes, 100 bags.

1397
01:38:39,797 --> 01:38:42,122
Make it three and a half
and I'll take it.

1398
01:38:42,299 --> 01:38:45,384
<i>You know the deal. Link me in
the same spot half an hour, yeah?</i>

1399
01:38:45,739 --> 01:38:46,782
Yeah, yeah.

1400
01:39:01,318 --> 01:39:03,229
Are you coming or what?

1401
01:39:07,241 --> 01:39:09,068
Come on man, fix up.

00:00:06,381 --> 00:00:07,340
- ....get back to that
breaking news.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Official HQCINEMAS.COM movies site:
HQCINEMAS.COM

4
00:00:08,591 --> 00:00:09,801
- We start with breaking news,
- An Amber Alert.

5
00:00:09,843 --> 00:00:11,011
There is an Amber Alert.

6
00:00:11,052 --> 00:00:13,513
- An Amber Alert.
- Two 15 year old boys.

7
00:00:13,555 --> 00:00:15,557
- An Amber Alert
has been issued...

8
00:00:22,355 --> 00:00:24,774
- Look mama,
I made this for you.

9
00:00:24,816 --> 00:00:26,276
- Dear Mom,
this is for you.

10
00:00:26,317 --> 00:00:28,570
I love you a lot.
Love Amber.

11
00:00:33,158 --> 00:00:34,909
- Well, my daughter
worries a lot,

12
00:00:34,951 --> 00:00:37,078
but I told her
everything will be okay.

13
00:00:53,386 --> 00:00:56,806
- This was every
parent's nightmare.

14
00:00:56,848 --> 00:01:00,894
- At that particular time,
everybody is a suspect.

15
00:01:00,935 --> 00:01:02,228
We're both innocent.

16
00:01:02,270 --> 00:01:03,688
I mean, there's no reason
for us to harm our child.

17
00:01:03,730 --> 00:01:06,733
- This individual may have
committed this crime before.

18
00:01:06,775 --> 00:01:09,194
Who is in our circle?

19
00:01:09,235 --> 00:01:11,279
Who's around Amber
all the time?

20
00:01:11,321 --> 00:01:13,656
- I immediately thought,
oh, my gosh,

21
00:01:13,698 --> 00:01:15,116
she was targeted.

22
00:01:15,158 --> 00:01:16,409
- We interrupt this program
to bring you

23
00:01:16,451 --> 00:01:18,703
the following News 8
Special Report.

24
00:01:18,745 --> 00:01:21,414
- We feel that this
tentatively is going to be

25
00:01:21,456 --> 00:01:23,416
the body of Amber Hagerman.

26
00:01:25,460 --> 00:01:28,838
- The suspect was familiar with
not only the abduction site

27
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:31,091
but the disposal site
as well.

28
00:01:31,132 --> 00:01:32,884
- We followed
thousands of leads.

29
00:01:32,926 --> 00:01:34,010
What's your name again?

30
00:01:34,052 --> 00:01:35,720
- Not just hundreds,
but thousands.

31
00:01:37,514 --> 00:01:39,349
- I believe there are
people out there

32
00:01:39,391 --> 00:01:41,267
who know what happened.

33
00:01:41,309 --> 00:01:42,769
- It would mean a lot
to be able to give

34
00:01:42,811 --> 00:01:45,772
Donna and Ricky the answer
to who killed Amber.

35
00:01:47,774 --> 00:01:50,527
- This is an activation
of the Amber Alert system.

36
00:01:50,568 --> 00:01:52,153
- Every time I hear
a Amber Alert,

37
00:01:52,195 --> 00:01:55,156
I say to myself, it's time
to go to work, Sis.

38
00:01:55,198 --> 00:01:56,616
Do your thing.

39
00:01:56,658 --> 00:01:59,119
- Everybody knows
the Amber Alert.

40
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:01,996
I want the world
to know who Amber was.

41
00:02:02,038 --> 00:02:16,344
**

42
00:02:17,762 --> 00:02:30,066
**

43
00:02:30,108 --> 00:02:35,155
- I believe this will be
my last interview.

44
00:02:35,196 --> 00:02:37,365
I'm tired of being sad.

45
00:02:38,867 --> 00:02:43,580
I'm broken because
my daughter's not here.

46
00:02:43,621 --> 00:02:46,332
Normally I don't have
a lot of this out.

47
00:02:47,542 --> 00:02:49,753
I normally keep it
in plastic totes,

48
00:02:49,794 --> 00:02:51,296
just to keep it safe

49
00:02:51,338 --> 00:02:54,674
and not to get torn up
or anything.

50
00:02:54,716 --> 00:02:58,303
{\an8}Everybody knows the Amber Alert
and what it's used for.

51
00:02:58,345 --> 00:03:02,057
{\an8}I want the world to know
who Amber was.

52
00:03:02,098 --> 00:03:04,642
{\an8}She was my dream.
She was my everything.

53
00:03:07,228 --> 00:03:10,023
This dress here is,
uh, Amber's dress

54
00:03:10,065 --> 00:03:12,817
that she wore
on her ninth birthday.

55
00:03:12,859 --> 00:03:16,529
And I just couldn't
seem to give it away.

56
00:03:17,655 --> 00:03:20,950
Special memories,
and happy memories for Amber.

57
00:03:20,992 --> 00:03:24,329
* Happy birthday to you *

58
00:03:28,458 --> 00:03:30,835
No, no, never, ever.

59
00:03:30,877 --> 00:03:33,338
I just assumed that he would
get caught real quick

60
00:03:33,380 --> 00:03:36,091
and it would be
done and over with

61
00:03:36,132 --> 00:03:39,636
but it didn't happen
that way, so...

62
00:03:50,772 --> 00:03:53,316
- We started
shooting video with

63
00:03:53,358 --> 00:03:56,778
Donna, Amber, and Ricky
in August of 1995.

64
00:03:59,739 --> 00:04:03,201
There are probably between
200 and 300 tapes

65
00:04:03,243 --> 00:04:05,995
and hundreds of hours
of video.

66
00:04:09,708 --> 00:04:11,710
{\an8}I don't know that I have
a good answer as to why

67
00:04:11,751 --> 00:04:14,587
{\an8}I've held on to 'em
for 25 years.

68
00:04:17,757 --> 00:04:19,551
I think that when you
look back on your life

69
00:04:19,592 --> 00:04:24,264
there are a few
life-changing moments.

70
00:04:24,305 --> 00:04:28,977
I already knew
that this was one of them.

71
00:04:29,019 --> 00:04:31,104
The fact that
we had her alive

72
00:04:31,146 --> 00:04:32,856
and people could see her,

73
00:04:32,897 --> 00:04:36,735
usually that doesn't happen
in a tragedy like this.

74
00:04:36,776 --> 00:04:39,821
Then we become an important
aspect of that story

75
00:04:39,863 --> 00:04:43,366
in deciding whether
we were going to release

76
00:04:43,408 --> 00:04:45,243
some of the footage
that we had

77
00:04:45,285 --> 00:04:47,495
which was exclusive footage.

78
00:04:55,170 --> 00:04:57,339
Come on.

79
00:05:02,552 --> 00:05:05,138
Richard, please don't.

80
00:05:05,180 --> 00:05:08,391
- At the time I was
a single mom with two children,

81
00:05:08,433 --> 00:05:10,602
and I was on welfare.

82
00:05:10,643 --> 00:05:12,854
They asked me if I wanted
to be in the documentary

83
00:05:12,896 --> 00:05:17,442
and the documentary is about
how women get off welfare.

84
00:05:17,484 --> 00:05:19,986
Let mommy see, Amber.

85
00:05:20,028 --> 00:05:21,446
Oh, you're going to
have to color that.

86
00:05:21,488 --> 00:05:24,532
That's pretty.
Look.

87
00:05:24,574 --> 00:05:26,451
Happy Halloween.
When is Halloween?

88
00:05:26,493 --> 00:05:27,869
Do y'all know
when Halloween is?

89
00:05:27,911 --> 00:05:30,705
- What's that?
- Um, October 31st...

90
00:05:34,709 --> 00:05:37,420
- Well, they found me
at a women's shelter.

91
00:05:39,464 --> 00:05:42,509
- A lot of us who were
working moms

92
00:05:42,550 --> 00:05:44,844
felt like that we weren't
doing enough stories

93
00:05:44,886 --> 00:05:47,347
about what families
were facing

94
00:05:47,389 --> 00:05:49,766
and how to make
things better.

95
00:05:49,808 --> 00:05:52,811
We wanted to have someone
who fit the national profile,

96
00:05:52,852 --> 00:05:55,855
which was a single mom
with two children.

97
00:05:55,897 --> 00:05:58,650
And it was really hard
to find somebody

98
00:05:58,692 --> 00:06:00,402
who was willing to do that,

99
00:06:00,443 --> 00:06:02,362
and willing to share
their lives.

100
00:06:02,404 --> 00:06:04,072
And I was just about
to give up

101
00:06:04,114 --> 00:06:06,449
when I got a call from
one-one of my contacts

102
00:06:06,491 --> 00:06:10,036
who said, I think I have
somebody for you.

103
00:06:10,078 --> 00:06:11,830
- I had to think about it
for a little bit.

104
00:06:11,871 --> 00:06:14,082
But maybe I could
help other moms

105
00:06:14,124 --> 00:06:15,959
in the same situation
I was in

106
00:06:16,001 --> 00:06:18,336
and get them on their feet
like I was getting--

107
00:06:18,378 --> 00:06:21,506
trying to get on my feet.

108
00:06:21,548 --> 00:06:25,051
When I was 18,
I found out I was pregnant.

109
00:06:25,093 --> 00:06:28,388
I was terrified and scared.

110
00:06:28,430 --> 00:06:30,390
I waited 'til she was born,
and then I seen

111
00:06:30,432 --> 00:06:33,685
her pretty little face,
and that's Amber.

112
00:06:33,727 --> 00:06:35,645
I thought Amber was
a really pretty name,

113
00:06:35,687 --> 00:06:38,148
and it just fit
her pretty little face.

114
00:06:43,945 --> 00:06:46,531
- I just did a lot of
walking in the neighborhood,

115
00:06:46,573 --> 00:06:48,283
with my friends,
my girlfriends,

116
00:06:48,324 --> 00:06:49,659
and he was out
in the yard,

117
00:06:49,701 --> 00:06:51,327
and we just
started talking,

118
00:06:51,369 --> 00:06:53,955
and next thing I knew,
we were together.

119
00:06:55,582 --> 00:06:58,126
'Course he was a lot
older than me.

120
00:06:58,168 --> 00:06:59,836
He was like 34.

121
00:06:59,878 --> 00:07:01,713
I basically grew up
with him.

122
00:07:01,755 --> 00:07:05,675
Then four years later,
I got pregnant with Ricky.

123
00:07:05,717 --> 00:07:08,845
It was wonderful.
It was awesome.

124
00:07:08,887 --> 00:07:10,764
Amber said,
this is my baby, Mommy.

125
00:07:10,805 --> 00:07:12,766
I said, okay,
it could be your baby.

126
00:07:12,807 --> 00:07:15,852
So she just kind of put
her baby brother under her wing,

127
00:07:15,894 --> 00:07:18,521
and that's where he stayed.

128
00:07:19,981 --> 00:07:21,775
I was living
with her father

129
00:07:21,816 --> 00:07:24,611
until Amber was about seven.

130
00:07:24,652 --> 00:07:28,114
Ricky was about two, three.

131
00:07:28,156 --> 00:07:31,117
That's when he really
started drinking a lot.

132
00:07:33,495 --> 00:07:37,123
Her father was
physically abusive to me.

133
00:07:37,165 --> 00:07:39,459
He never abused my children.

134
00:07:39,501 --> 00:07:41,836
He was just really mean
when he was drinking.

135
00:07:43,213 --> 00:07:44,631
He used to go out
and hang out

136
00:07:44,673 --> 00:07:46,383
with his friend,
Mike Thompson,

137
00:07:46,424 --> 00:07:49,427
and they would party
and drink together.

138
00:07:49,469 --> 00:07:51,680
And then he'll
come home or--

139
00:07:51,721 --> 00:07:54,724
And then he'll drink more,
and get drunk more.

140
00:07:54,766 --> 00:07:56,685
So the neighbors
would always call the police

141
00:07:56,726 --> 00:07:58,019
because of the noise.

142
00:07:58,061 --> 00:08:00,647
And the police
would always come.

143
00:08:00,689 --> 00:08:03,608
And the police--
the last time the police said,

144
00:08:03,650 --> 00:08:05,485
if we come back here again,

145
00:08:05,527 --> 00:08:07,737
we will take
your children from you.

146
00:08:07,779 --> 00:08:10,490
And that's all
I had to hear.

147
00:08:10,532 --> 00:08:12,409
- You want some fruit,
Richard?

148
00:08:12,450 --> 00:08:13,618
You want some fruit?

149
00:08:13,660 --> 00:08:17,497
- I knew my kids
need to be safe.

150
00:08:17,539 --> 00:08:20,208
I just took personal things
and just left

151
00:08:20,250 --> 00:08:21,835
and never went back.

152
00:08:21,876 --> 00:08:24,629
And we stayed in my car
for like two days

153
00:08:24,671 --> 00:08:26,381
in the parking lot.

154
00:08:26,423 --> 00:08:29,968
I couldn't go to my parents
because he would find us there,

155
00:08:30,010 --> 00:08:33,972
and so we just kind of hid out
in my car for two days.

156
00:08:34,014 --> 00:08:35,974
And then we went to
the women's shelter

157
00:08:36,016 --> 00:08:38,643
and stayed there for
about six weeks.

158
00:08:38,685 --> 00:08:40,353
And they helped me
get an a-apartment

159
00:08:40,395 --> 00:08:42,355
and get on welfare

160
00:08:42,397 --> 00:08:45,108
and help me get back
on my feet.

161
00:08:49,237 --> 00:08:50,572
We were still scared.

162
00:08:50,613 --> 00:08:53,491
And every little sound
or every little door knock

163
00:08:53,533 --> 00:08:54,868
we would jump to the ceiling

164
00:08:54,909 --> 00:08:56,828
because we didn't know
if he found out

165
00:08:56,870 --> 00:08:59,122
where we stayed at
or whatever.

166
00:08:59,164 --> 00:09:02,000
And it took almost
a good year before

167
00:09:02,042 --> 00:09:04,586
we could actually
live life again

168
00:09:04,627 --> 00:09:07,047
and be happy again.

169
00:09:12,052 --> 00:09:14,387
- They're having
a skating party for school

170
00:09:14,429 --> 00:09:16,306
and that's gonna
be $3 apiece.

171
00:09:16,348 --> 00:09:17,724
I can't do that.

172
00:09:17,766 --> 00:09:20,727
{\an8}So they're a little upset
about that, you know,

173
00:09:20,769 --> 00:09:23,229
{\an8}but I tell them
we'll save money

174
00:09:23,271 --> 00:09:24,773
{\an8}and next time you can go.

175
00:09:25,774 --> 00:09:27,734
- You always have
such a positive attitude

176
00:09:27,776 --> 00:09:29,903
no matter how much money
you've got in your pocket.

177
00:09:29,944 --> 00:09:31,738
You always tell me
you're not worried,

178
00:09:31,780 --> 00:09:33,239
- it'll be okay.
- Yeah.

179
00:09:33,281 --> 00:09:34,657
How do you do that?

180
00:09:34,699 --> 00:09:36,493
- It's depressing sometimes
but I try not to show it,

181
00:09:36,534 --> 00:09:37,911
especially in front
of my kids.

182
00:09:37,952 --> 00:09:39,954
I don't want them
to worry.

183
00:09:43,708 --> 00:09:46,920
I was going to school.

184
00:09:46,961 --> 00:09:50,006
I was volunteering at
the food stamp office,

185
00:09:50,048 --> 00:09:52,175
and-and my kids
were going to school

186
00:09:52,217 --> 00:09:53,968
and they were happy.

187
00:09:55,804 --> 00:09:57,722
- That's actually
asking a lot for somebody

188
00:09:57,764 --> 00:09:59,265
to be that open with us

189
00:09:59,307 --> 00:10:01,476
and to share all the hurdles,

190
00:10:01,518 --> 00:10:03,937
the ups and downs
and frustrations

191
00:10:03,978 --> 00:10:06,898
and the trials and tribulations
that they go to

192
00:10:06,940 --> 00:10:09,776
for people to have
a better understanding

193
00:10:09,818 --> 00:10:13,071
of what being
in that situation is like.

194
00:10:13,113 --> 00:10:16,199
And so it was a journey
that I couldn't have predicted.

195
00:10:16,241 --> 00:10:19,619
I couldn't have known
what would happen.

196
00:10:19,661 --> 00:10:21,121
- My daughter
worries a lot.

197
00:10:21,162 --> 00:10:22,747
She thinks we are going
to run out of money,

198
00:10:22,789 --> 00:10:24,207
don't have no money
for this or that.

199
00:10:24,249 --> 00:10:26,459
But I told her
everything will be okay.

200
00:10:26,501 --> 00:10:28,128
We'll never starve.

201
00:10:28,169 --> 00:10:31,214
We'll always eat.

202
00:10:31,256 --> 00:10:33,174
- Richard tried
so many times for me

203
00:10:33,216 --> 00:10:35,969
to come back
and move back in with him.

204
00:10:36,011 --> 00:10:38,179
And I said, no, I cannot.

205
00:10:38,221 --> 00:10:40,140
Because I know
what's going to happen.

206
00:10:40,181 --> 00:10:42,308
If I do that,
you'll just go right back

207
00:10:42,350 --> 00:10:44,477
to the way you were.

208
00:10:44,519 --> 00:10:47,147
Slowly I let Richard
come back into the kids' lives.

209
00:10:47,188 --> 00:10:48,648
Because that-that
is their father

210
00:10:48,690 --> 00:10:51,735
and like it or not,
that's--

211
00:10:51,776 --> 00:10:54,070
I had to for my kids.

212
00:10:54,112 --> 00:10:57,824
Amber was still
a little leery of him.

213
00:10:57,866 --> 00:10:59,743
She was still
a little scared that maybe

214
00:10:59,784 --> 00:11:01,870
he will get drunk again.

215
00:11:01,911 --> 00:11:04,956
But eventually that
kind of faded away as well.

216
00:11:04,998 --> 00:11:07,167
And they were okay together.

217
00:11:15,008 --> 00:11:18,720
* Happy birthday to you *

218
00:11:18,762 --> 00:11:22,515
* Happy birthday to you *

219
00:11:22,557 --> 00:11:24,351
* Happy birthday *

220
00:11:24,392 --> 00:11:27,270
- On her ninth birthday,
she had all her friends,

221
00:11:27,312 --> 00:11:30,023
and had birthday cake
and ice cream.

222
00:11:30,065 --> 00:11:32,609
Make a wish
and blow it out, baby.

223
00:11:32,650 --> 00:11:35,570
All right, whoo!

224
00:11:35,612 --> 00:11:37,030
Oh, boy!

225
00:11:37,072 --> 00:11:40,283
- She was just
bright-eyed and wide-eyed,

226
00:11:40,325 --> 00:11:42,202
and mouth open like, yay.

227
00:11:42,243 --> 00:11:45,622
- Oh!
- Look, sheets for your bed.

228
00:11:45,663 --> 00:11:48,541
- Donna's motivation
was that she wanted

229
00:11:48,583 --> 00:11:51,044
to make things better
for her kids.

230
00:11:51,086 --> 00:11:54,214
She was very open with us,

231
00:11:54,255 --> 00:11:58,551
and we were part
of their family for months.

232
00:11:58,593 --> 00:12:02,847
And you felt like they were
just part of mine, too.

233
00:12:02,889 --> 00:12:05,642
- The party's over!
- The party's over?

234
00:12:05,684 --> 00:12:07,560
[chuckling]

235
00:12:07,602 --> 00:12:09,062
She's a funny little girl.

236
00:12:09,104 --> 00:12:11,898
She's takes after
her grandpa with that.

237
00:12:11,940 --> 00:12:14,651
Um, she always
wants to be silly.

238
00:12:14,693 --> 00:12:17,946
Very smart,
fun-loving little girl.

239
00:12:53,565 --> 00:12:55,150
- Saturday is
our family day,

240
00:12:55,191 --> 00:12:58,069
so we decided we wanted
to go to Castle Park

241
00:12:58,111 --> 00:13:01,156
and we played there
for a couple hours

242
00:13:01,197 --> 00:13:02,991
and then they wanted
to come back here

243
00:13:03,033 --> 00:13:06,244
to granny and pawpaw's house.

244
00:13:06,286 --> 00:13:08,705
It was really nice,
warm winter days

245
00:13:08,747 --> 00:13:10,123
that were gorgeous days.

246
00:13:10,165 --> 00:13:13,793
Sun shining and everybody
was out and about.

247
00:13:13,835 --> 00:13:16,296
They decided they wanted
to ride their bicycles

248
00:13:16,338 --> 00:13:18,131
and I told them
it'd be fine

249
00:13:18,173 --> 00:13:21,843
and so once we got here,
they run up to the driveway

250
00:13:21,885 --> 00:13:24,012
and said hi to their pawpaw.

251
00:13:26,973 --> 00:13:28,308
And they got
on their bicycles

252
00:13:28,350 --> 00:13:30,435
and went towards
Claudia Street.

253
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:35,398
- Me being the little brother,
I'm gonna follow her

254
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:37,942
wherever she goes.

255
00:13:37,984 --> 00:13:40,820
{\an8}We would always ride our bikes
around the neighborhood,

256
00:13:40,862 --> 00:13:41,988
{\an8}and we did it very often,

257
00:13:42,030 --> 00:13:45,241
so I memorized
the neighborhood.

258
00:13:45,283 --> 00:13:46,618
- And I hollered
at them and said,

259
00:13:46,659 --> 00:13:49,454
well, y'all stay together
and y'all come right back.

260
00:13:49,496 --> 00:13:51,873
And Amber turns around
and she looks at me,

261
00:13:51,915 --> 00:13:54,834
okay Mommy, we will.

262
00:13:54,876 --> 00:13:56,920
And that was
my last time seeing her

263
00:14:06,638 --> 00:14:07,514
{\an8}**

264
00:14:12,435 --> 00:14:16,189
{\an8}- That day we went
to visit our grandparents

265
00:14:16,231 --> 00:14:17,982
{\an8}and, uh, every time
we go over there

266
00:14:18,024 --> 00:14:20,068
{\an8}we-we ride our bikes.

267
00:14:22,195 --> 00:14:24,030
{\an8}We would always
ride around the block

268
00:14:24,072 --> 00:14:26,574
{\an8}and come back around
to Highland,

269
00:14:26,616 --> 00:14:28,410
{\an8}but that day
we took a left

270
00:14:28,451 --> 00:14:30,954
{\an8}where we weren't
supposed to go.

271
00:14:30,995 --> 00:14:34,582
We went to a, uh,
abandoned parking lot

272
00:14:34,624 --> 00:14:37,502
that had a little, uh, ramp
that we can ride down.

273
00:14:38,962 --> 00:14:41,172
We were not allowed to go
to that parking lot

274
00:14:41,214 --> 00:14:43,633
without someone with us.

275
00:14:43,675 --> 00:14:47,095
But you know, kids,
we don't always listen, so...

276
00:14:51,683 --> 00:14:52,892
Something came over me.

277
00:14:52,934 --> 00:14:54,936
I got afraid
to get in trouble.

278
00:14:54,978 --> 00:14:57,605
So, uh, I was
telling my sister, Amber,

279
00:14:57,647 --> 00:14:59,983
let's-let's go back home.
Let's go back home.

280
00:15:00,025 --> 00:15:00,942
She was like,
""I'll be right behind you,

281
00:15:00,984 --> 00:15:02,736
""just go ahead.""

282
00:15:02,777 --> 00:15:05,155
So, I took off.

283
00:15:05,196 --> 00:15:07,073
And by the time I got home,

284
00:15:07,115 --> 00:15:09,159
I noticed
she wasn't behind me.

285
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:14,247
And my grandfather was outside
in the garage working.

286
00:15:14,289 --> 00:15:17,334
He asked me
where my sister was

287
00:15:17,375 --> 00:15:20,920
and so I told him, ""Oh,
she's over there at the ramps.""

288
00:15:20,962 --> 00:15:23,173
He, uh, grabbed me
and put me in the truck

289
00:15:23,214 --> 00:15:25,008
and we went to go look
for her.

290
00:15:28,386 --> 00:15:31,890
We just found her bike
laying there.

291
00:15:31,931 --> 00:15:36,144
And, uh...

292
00:15:36,186 --> 00:15:38,021
that's where it kinda
gets a little hazy.

293
00:16:09,427 --> 00:16:10,679
{\an8}- There was a witness
to this,

294
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:13,848
{\an8}his name was Jimmie Kevil.
He was 78 years old.

295
00:16:13,890 --> 00:16:16,351
{\an8}He lived there
on Ruth Street.

296
00:16:16,393 --> 00:16:22,232
{\an8}He described the suspect as
a non-African American male,

297
00:16:22,273 --> 00:16:24,109
{\an8}less than six feet tall

298
00:16:24,150 --> 00:16:25,527
{\an8}with medium build

299
00:16:25,568 --> 00:16:28,697
{\an8}and clearly
of sufficient strength

300
00:16:28,738 --> 00:16:31,449
{\an8}that he was able to pick Amber
up off of the bicycle.

301
00:16:31,491 --> 00:16:34,244
Amber's feet never
hit the ground.

302
00:16:34,285 --> 00:16:37,288
Kevil also said
that he just drove

303
00:16:37,330 --> 00:16:38,915
at what appeared to be

304
00:16:38,957 --> 00:16:43,044
a normal speed
across the parking lot.

305
00:16:43,086 --> 00:16:45,213
The patrol officer
pulled into the parking lot

306
00:16:45,255 --> 00:16:47,173
because that's
where Jimmie Kevil said

307
00:16:47,215 --> 00:16:49,217
that the offense
took place.

308
00:16:49,259 --> 00:16:52,220
But as it turns out
Jimmy Whitson was there.

309
00:16:52,262 --> 00:16:54,723
He's come up there
to get his granddaughter, Amber.

310
00:16:54,764 --> 00:16:57,058
And there's nothing there
but Amber's bicycle.

311
00:16:57,100 --> 00:17:01,021
So, you've got
what Jimmie Kevil told 911

312
00:17:01,062 --> 00:17:02,856
and you've got
what Jimmy Whitson

313
00:17:02,897 --> 00:17:04,399
told the patrol officer.

314
00:17:04,441 --> 00:17:08,403
The patrol officer realizes
that we've got a problem here.

315
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:18,329
- I'll never forget it,
telling my mom.

316
00:17:22,083 --> 00:17:24,210
Mom...

317
00:17:30,842 --> 00:17:34,262
My mom coming out the door

318
00:17:34,304 --> 00:17:36,931
expecting all of us
to-to be together

319
00:17:36,973 --> 00:17:41,811
and my grandpa
telling my mom that...

320
00:17:41,853 --> 00:17:45,940
that her baby girl is gone,

321
00:17:45,982 --> 00:17:49,319
and...

322
00:17:49,361 --> 00:17:52,197
and then she lost it.

323
00:17:52,238 --> 00:17:54,366
- So I immediately
started running

324
00:17:54,407 --> 00:17:55,700
and screaming her name,

325
00:17:55,742 --> 00:17:59,871
going towards
where she was last seen at.

326
00:17:59,913 --> 00:18:01,331
{\an8}I was just
screaming and crying

327
00:18:01,373 --> 00:18:04,292
{\an8}and screaming and crying
her name, ""Amber! Amber!

328
00:18:04,334 --> 00:18:05,960
{\an8}""Where are you?""
You know?

329
00:18:06,002 --> 00:18:08,004
{\an8}And a few minutes later,

330
00:18:08,046 --> 00:18:10,715
{\an8}the neighbors
were coming outside,

331
00:18:10,757 --> 00:18:12,676
{\an8}wanting to know
what was going on.

332
00:18:19,391 --> 00:18:21,685
{\an8}I immediately called
Amber's father

333
00:18:21,726 --> 00:18:23,853
{\an8}at his best friend,
Mike Thompson's home.

334
00:18:39,869 --> 00:18:41,454
I'm at home on a Saturday.

335
00:18:41,496 --> 00:18:44,749
It was my day off
and the telephone rang

336
00:18:44,791 --> 00:18:46,334
and it was dispatch.

337
00:18:46,376 --> 00:18:50,255
{\an8}There was a possible
child abduction

338
00:18:50,296 --> 00:18:54,175
{\an8}on East Abram Street
in Arlington.

339
00:18:54,217 --> 00:18:57,012
My mind just goes
into overdrive.

340
00:18:57,053 --> 00:18:58,221
Is there a family member

341
00:18:58,263 --> 00:18:59,764
that's come and picked up
the child?

342
00:18:59,806 --> 00:19:01,683
Is there a custody issue?

343
00:19:01,725 --> 00:19:05,270
Is it someone that's known
to the child,

344
00:19:05,311 --> 00:19:10,275
that has
come and-and taken them?

345
00:19:10,316 --> 00:19:12,360
That used to be
a grocery store,

346
00:19:12,402 --> 00:19:15,697
and the trucks would pull in
and back in.

347
00:19:15,739 --> 00:19:17,866
They'd deliver
into the grocery store,

348
00:19:17,907 --> 00:19:20,326
and then of course
the ramp was for the workers

349
00:19:20,368 --> 00:19:22,829
to go up and down.

350
00:19:22,871 --> 00:19:25,582
Mr. Kevil lived
in this residence right here.

351
00:19:25,623 --> 00:19:28,251
He was in the backyard
doing some yard work

352
00:19:28,293 --> 00:19:33,131
and then he heard
a young girl scream.

353
00:19:33,173 --> 00:19:36,051
He noticed
the pickup truck stopped

354
00:19:36,092 --> 00:19:37,969
right there in that area,

355
00:19:38,011 --> 00:19:39,721
the driver
get out of the truck

356
00:19:39,763 --> 00:19:43,224
and grab the girl
off her bicycle.

357
00:19:43,266 --> 00:19:45,602
He exited out the north side
of the parking lot

358
00:19:45,643 --> 00:19:48,730
and then turned
to the west.

359
00:19:48,772 --> 00:19:51,524
The interesting thing about
going back to the west

360
00:19:51,566 --> 00:19:55,445
is it's back toward town
and it's more congested.

361
00:19:55,487 --> 00:19:59,074
The speculation was that
there was a specific place

362
00:19:59,115 --> 00:20:01,076
back to the west.

363
00:20:01,117 --> 00:20:02,786
If he was from out of town,

364
00:20:02,827 --> 00:20:04,412
I think he would have
gone to the east

365
00:20:04,454 --> 00:20:08,625
and accessed off of 360
to I-30 or I-20.

366
00:20:12,671 --> 00:20:14,422
{\an8}- I got a call
from my husband,

367
00:20:14,464 --> 00:20:16,508
{\an8}and he said,
""Donna's looking for you.

368
00:20:16,549 --> 00:20:18,426
{\an8}""She says
she needs your help.""

369
00:20:18,468 --> 00:20:20,595
{\an8}So I called her
at Jimmy and Glenda's house,

370
00:20:20,637 --> 00:20:22,639
{\an8}the grandparents' house.

371
00:20:22,681 --> 00:20:24,516
And I said,
Donna, what's going on?

372
00:20:24,557 --> 00:20:27,519
She goes,
Amber's been taken.

373
00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:29,729
And my heart just sunk.

374
00:20:29,771 --> 00:20:32,607
I said, Okay,
I will be right there.

375
00:20:32,649 --> 00:20:35,318
- My main focus
was to find my baby.

376
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:38,446
I wanted to go look for her.
I wanted to go.

377
00:20:38,488 --> 00:20:41,199
But my parents are saying,
""No, you have to stay here.

378
00:20:41,241 --> 00:20:43,868
""You need to be here
if she comes home.""

379
00:20:43,910 --> 00:20:45,412
Not too long after that,

380
00:20:45,453 --> 00:20:48,373
Richard showed up
at my mother's house.

381
00:20:50,208 --> 00:20:51,710
{\an8}- There's a lot
of things moving

382
00:20:51,751 --> 00:20:53,378
{\an8}in the first 15 minutes
of the investigation.

383
00:20:54,421 --> 00:20:56,256
At the abduction site,
one of the things you do

384
00:20:56,297 --> 00:20:58,258
is you take stock
and look around

385
00:20:58,299 --> 00:20:59,718
to see what all is there,

386
00:20:59,759 --> 00:21:01,636
and also specifically
what isn't there.

387
00:21:01,678 --> 00:21:03,138
Where that truck
was sitting,

388
00:21:03,179 --> 00:21:06,516
if there was any dirt that
would hold a tire impression,

389
00:21:06,558 --> 00:21:08,351
if the guy
had smoked a cigarette,

390
00:21:08,393 --> 00:21:11,604
or anything.
There was none of that.

391
00:21:11,646 --> 00:21:13,481
- We looked around
the area,

392
00:21:13,523 --> 00:21:16,317
and we noticed that
there was a laundromat there

393
00:21:16,359 --> 00:21:18,028
and that there were
people coming and going

394
00:21:18,069 --> 00:21:19,904
from the laundromat.

395
00:21:19,946 --> 00:21:21,531
- On the west side
of the laundromat,

396
00:21:21,573 --> 00:21:23,408
which is
where she was abducted from,

397
00:21:23,450 --> 00:21:24,701
there are no windows,

398
00:21:24,743 --> 00:21:27,412
so no one in the laundromat
could see anything

399
00:21:27,454 --> 00:21:29,664
that was going on.

400
00:21:29,706 --> 00:21:32,500
Jimmie Kevil by far,
where he was standing,

401
00:21:32,542 --> 00:21:34,627
had the best vantage point.

402
00:21:34,669 --> 00:21:36,463
There's no sense
in everybody sitting around

403
00:21:36,504 --> 00:21:38,048
that parking lot
because she's not there.

404
00:21:43,219 --> 00:21:44,804
{\an8}- Once the call went out
over the radio

405
00:21:44,846 --> 00:21:47,223
{\an8}that we had a child
that had been abducted,

406
00:21:47,265 --> 00:21:49,351
{\an8}I started
going all over the area,

407
00:21:49,392 --> 00:21:52,228
{\an8}looking for
the suspect vehicle,

408
00:21:52,270 --> 00:21:56,524
which was a black
single cab pickup truck.

409
00:21:56,566 --> 00:21:59,861
I did pull over
a few black pickup trucks

410
00:21:59,903 --> 00:22:02,572
in hopes that I would be able
to find the suspect

411
00:22:02,614 --> 00:22:05,408
and find Amber.

412
00:22:05,450 --> 00:22:08,161
- In Texas,
pickup trucks are everywhere.

413
00:22:08,203 --> 00:22:09,537
Black pickup trucks,

414
00:22:09,579 --> 00:22:11,915
you don't really realize
how many of them there are

415
00:22:11,956 --> 00:22:14,042
until you
start looking for them.

416
00:22:14,084 --> 00:22:15,543
They're everywhere.

417
00:22:15,585 --> 00:22:20,215
It helps narrow things down
but not much.

418
00:22:20,256 --> 00:22:22,550
When you look at
that area of town,

419
00:22:22,592 --> 00:22:24,386
as he goes west
on Abram Street,

420
00:22:24,427 --> 00:22:26,096
there's a number of places
where he can

421
00:22:26,137 --> 00:22:29,265
get off either into
a residential neighborhood

422
00:22:29,307 --> 00:22:30,558
on the south side,

423
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:32,185
or one of these
light industrial areas

424
00:22:32,227 --> 00:22:33,853
on the north side.

425
00:22:33,895 --> 00:22:37,315
- The Browning-Abram area
of Arlington, Texas,

426
00:22:37,357 --> 00:22:41,236
it's an area of town where
people have owned their homes

427
00:22:41,277 --> 00:22:44,155
sometimes
for 30, 40, 50 years,

428
00:22:44,197 --> 00:22:46,574
and so you have a very
established group of people

429
00:22:46,616 --> 00:22:47,867
that are living there.

430
00:22:47,909 --> 00:22:50,537
I would not describe it
as a high crime area

431
00:22:50,578 --> 00:22:55,583
or a high-risk area
necessarily.

432
00:22:55,625 --> 00:22:57,460
- This type of abduction
in Arlington

433
00:22:57,502 --> 00:23:00,672
is almost unheard of.

434
00:23:00,714 --> 00:23:02,173
The problem it creates
for law enforcement

435
00:23:02,215 --> 00:23:04,592
is you've got to be able
to get it off the ground

436
00:23:04,634 --> 00:23:06,594
in a rapid
but deliberate manner.

437
00:23:06,636 --> 00:23:08,555
There's not much room
for error here.

438
00:23:11,099 --> 00:23:12,142
So I got there,

439
00:23:12,183 --> 00:23:14,686
and I started going
under the tape,

440
00:23:14,728 --> 00:23:15,979
and of course
the police were like,

441
00:23:16,021 --> 00:23:18,982
""What are you doing?""
They had to go ask Donna.

442
00:23:19,024 --> 00:23:21,901
She goes, ""No,
I want her to come in.""

443
00:23:21,943 --> 00:23:24,195
And they were
all looking at each other,

444
00:23:24,237 --> 00:23:27,615
""Why is this reporter
just walking into the house

445
00:23:27,657 --> 00:23:30,118
""like she knows
these people?""

446
00:23:30,160 --> 00:23:31,995
But I did.
Uh, I knew them.

447
00:23:32,037 --> 00:23:34,039
I'd been living
their lives with them.

448
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:36,666
We just kept documenting
what was happening

449
00:23:36,708 --> 00:23:38,585
and being with the family

450
00:23:38,626 --> 00:23:43,089
and really showing
their side of the story.

451
00:23:43,131 --> 00:23:45,967
- On that day, once
all the police were involved,

452
00:23:46,009 --> 00:23:48,136
everyone asking me,
""Did you see anything?

453
00:23:48,178 --> 00:23:49,637
""Did you see anybody?

454
00:23:49,679 --> 00:23:51,181
""It's very important
that, you know,

455
00:23:51,222 --> 00:23:55,935
""if you did see anybody,
anything just tell me,

456
00:23:55,977 --> 00:23:58,313
""so we can
do something about it.""

457
00:23:58,355 --> 00:24:00,523
And I didn't have
an answer.

458
00:24:00,565 --> 00:24:03,276
I didn't see anybody.

459
00:24:03,318 --> 00:24:06,613
- If we had only been able to
get that word out immediately

460
00:24:06,654 --> 00:24:08,990
then maybe somebody
on that street

461
00:24:09,032 --> 00:24:11,910
where he turned would have
seen him immediately.

462
00:24:24,172 --> 00:24:25,465
- Amber was abducted
at about 3:20 in the afternoon.

463
00:24:30,011 --> 00:24:33,139
Somewhere around 4:30,
the police department

464
00:24:33,181 --> 00:24:35,684
contacted the various
media outlets

465
00:24:35,725 --> 00:24:37,435
and was trying
to get them there.

466
00:24:37,477 --> 00:24:39,437
{\an8}But what I truly wish

467
00:24:39,479 --> 00:24:42,190
{\an8}is that there would have
been a method

468
00:24:42,232 --> 00:24:44,943
{\an8}that we could have got
more information out faster.

469
00:24:49,280 --> 00:24:51,825
{\an8}- I remember I was in shorts
and a T-shirt.

470
00:24:51,866 --> 00:24:54,869
{\an8}On January 13, even for Texas,
that's not common.

471
00:24:54,911 --> 00:24:56,788
{\an8}It was unseasonably warm.

472
00:24:56,830 --> 00:24:59,708
{\an8}And I remember being at home
and got a call.

473
00:24:59,749 --> 00:25:03,294
{\an8}They said we had a witness
saw a girl get abducted.

474
00:25:03,336 --> 00:25:07,007
{\an8}I said, ""I'm on my way.""

475
00:25:07,048 --> 00:25:08,967
{\an8}I drove down the streets

476
00:25:09,009 --> 00:25:10,927
{\an8}of this little
residential neighborhood

477
00:25:10,969 --> 00:25:13,638
{\an8}and I could already see
all these TV vans

478
00:25:13,680 --> 00:25:15,974
{\an8}just lined up
and I remember thinking,

479
00:25:16,016 --> 00:25:18,351
{\an8}""Oh, my God,
this is what they mean

480
00:25:18,393 --> 00:25:20,270
{\an8}""when they say
'media circus.'""

481
00:25:23,857 --> 00:25:27,986
{\an8}- Statistics show
that in 74% of the cases

482
00:25:28,028 --> 00:25:31,114
{\an8}where an abducted child
is murdered,

483
00:25:31,156 --> 00:25:33,491
{\an8}they're killed within
the first three hours.

484
00:25:33,533 --> 00:25:35,535
{\an8}So time is of the essence

485
00:25:35,577 --> 00:25:37,662
{\an8}and getting
that information out

486
00:25:37,704 --> 00:25:41,416
{\an8}to the public
is just critical.

487
00:25:41,458 --> 00:25:43,335
{\an8}This was the '90s.

488
00:25:43,376 --> 00:25:46,504
The fastest way that you were
going to get out information

489
00:25:46,546 --> 00:25:48,173
would be
the 6 o'clock news.

490
00:25:48,214 --> 00:25:51,259
And so, of course,
there was a lag time.

491
00:25:51,301 --> 00:25:52,302
It doesn't sound like

492
00:25:52,344 --> 00:25:53,636
someone that
the little girl knew,

493
00:25:53,678 --> 00:25:55,847
or someone that she was
going with voluntarily.

494
00:25:55,889 --> 00:25:58,767
- We set up a command post
out by the residence

495
00:25:58,808 --> 00:26:01,853
at her grandparents' house.

496
00:26:01,895 --> 00:26:04,731
The media was responding,
huge response.

497
00:26:04,773 --> 00:26:07,650
I mean, every station
as far as they could get

498
00:26:07,692 --> 00:26:11,863
had Live trucks there.

499
00:26:11,905 --> 00:26:12,989
One of the things
we were doing

500
00:26:13,031 --> 00:26:14,449
is we're trying
to keep track

501
00:26:14,491 --> 00:26:15,909
of who was coming
to the house,

502
00:26:15,950 --> 00:26:17,243
who was coming to the door,

503
00:26:17,285 --> 00:26:20,455
who knew Donna, Richard
and their family,

504
00:26:20,497 --> 00:26:22,624
and what their
relationship was.

505
00:26:22,665 --> 00:26:24,542
{\an8}- The police
were asking me, you know,

506
00:26:24,584 --> 00:26:26,628
{\an8}who is in my--
in our circle,

507
00:26:26,670 --> 00:26:27,712
{\an8}you know,
who's around us,

508
00:26:27,754 --> 00:26:29,255
{\an8}who's around Amber
all the time?

509
00:26:29,297 --> 00:26:31,132
Who's around Ricky
all the time?

510
00:26:31,174 --> 00:26:33,259
And so, that's when
we thought about Pam,

511
00:26:33,301 --> 00:26:34,886
and I was telling them
about Pam Curry

512
00:26:34,928 --> 00:26:37,138
and the documentary.

513
00:26:37,180 --> 00:26:40,225
- This is my 1st grade
group picture

514
00:26:40,266 --> 00:26:42,477
and these are my friends
and Ms. Riley.

515
00:26:43,937 --> 00:26:47,232
{\an8}- Look, what's that thing
that goes on it?

516
00:26:47,273 --> 00:26:51,027
{\an8}- We had footage
of this little girl alive

517
00:26:51,069 --> 00:26:53,947
{\an8}not some grainy picture
that we were gonna slap up.

518
00:26:53,988 --> 00:26:55,907
{\an8}And back then,
that's what you did

519
00:26:55,949 --> 00:26:59,077
{\an8}in a tragic news story
like this.

520
00:26:59,119 --> 00:27:00,745
That's all the family
had to rely on

521
00:27:00,787 --> 00:27:03,707
is to throw up
a still picture.

522
00:27:03,748 --> 00:27:06,167
We put together a clip reel

523
00:27:06,209 --> 00:27:09,337
of some of the best
identifiable footage

524
00:27:09,379 --> 00:27:11,297
that I had from
shooting the documentary.

525
00:27:12,465 --> 00:27:14,426
- It was heart-wrenching,
the video was.

526
00:27:14,467 --> 00:27:16,344
I mean it was her
blowing out the candles

527
00:27:16,386 --> 00:27:17,762
of her birthday cake.

528
00:27:17,804 --> 00:27:19,681
It was her mom
putting her to bed.

529
00:27:19,723 --> 00:27:21,641
It was her playing
Ring Around the Rosie

530
00:27:21,683 --> 00:27:23,101
out in the yard
with her friends

531
00:27:23,143 --> 00:27:24,769
at her birthday party.

532
00:27:24,811 --> 00:27:26,104
It was her going to school.

533
00:27:26,146 --> 00:27:29,607
I mean, it made her
such a person.

534
00:27:29,649 --> 00:27:31,776
I read, um, 89 books.

535
00:27:31,818 --> 00:27:33,194
89?

536
00:27:33,236 --> 00:27:36,948
- I immediately thought,
""Oh, my gosh, this is it.

537
00:27:36,990 --> 00:27:39,951
""Someone saw that on TV
and that she was targeted.

538
00:27:39,993 --> 00:27:42,120
""You know,
they'd seen her on TV.""

539
00:27:42,162 --> 00:27:44,622
And they said,
""None of it's aired.

540
00:27:44,664 --> 00:27:47,959
""Not one bit of it
has aired.""

541
00:27:48,001 --> 00:27:51,087
- On the day
that Amber was kidnapped,

542
00:27:51,129 --> 00:27:55,258
we had finished
the welfare documentary,

543
00:27:55,300 --> 00:27:58,887
and it was gonna be airing
the next week.

544
00:27:58,928 --> 00:28:00,972
- Fairy stories.
- Fairy tales.

545
00:28:01,014 --> 00:28:04,267
Fairy tales.

546
00:28:04,309 --> 00:28:05,977
- I mean this just
touched everyone's heart

547
00:28:06,019 --> 00:28:08,480
and I thought this is
the absolute best break

548
00:28:08,521 --> 00:28:10,023
we could possibly get.

549
00:28:10,065 --> 00:28:12,150
Because everyone's
going to remember this now.

550
00:28:15,945 --> 00:28:17,113
{\an8}I won't say it threw us,

551
00:28:17,155 --> 00:28:22,327
{\an8}but it was something
that was highly unusual.

552
00:28:22,369 --> 00:28:24,496
{\an8}We had never been on a case
where somebody had already had

553
00:28:24,537 --> 00:28:25,914
{\an8}a television crew
following them around

554
00:28:25,955 --> 00:28:28,375
{\an8}taking footage of it.

555
00:28:28,416 --> 00:28:30,585
And we used that footage
not only to try

556
00:28:30,627 --> 00:28:33,713
and give people an idea
of what Amber looked like,

557
00:28:33,755 --> 00:28:37,926
but also the idea
of who Amber was.

558
00:28:37,967 --> 00:28:39,844
- Having the footage
of Amber

559
00:28:39,886 --> 00:28:42,847
really showed
the community

560
00:28:42,889 --> 00:28:45,308
the person they needed
to track down

561
00:28:45,350 --> 00:28:48,103
if they see
the black pickup truck

562
00:28:48,144 --> 00:28:49,688
and here's
what she looks like

563
00:28:49,729 --> 00:28:53,024
and her mannerisms.

564
00:28:53,066 --> 00:28:56,444
- That made
a tremendous impact

565
00:28:56,486 --> 00:28:58,029
on the community.

566
00:29:03,576 --> 00:29:06,162
- Eventually there were
just cameras everywhere.

567
00:29:06,204 --> 00:29:09,833
Everywhere I turned
there was a camera in my face.

568
00:29:09,874 --> 00:29:11,960
Don't hurt my baby.
Please.

569
00:29:12,002 --> 00:29:14,045
She's just
an innocent child.

570
00:29:14,087 --> 00:29:18,341
Please.
Please bring her home safe.

571
00:29:18,383 --> 00:29:19,884
Please.

572
00:29:19,926 --> 00:29:22,345
{\an8}- If anybody out
there's seen anything,

573
00:29:22,387 --> 00:29:25,015
{\an8}call the police,
tell them, let them know.

574
00:29:25,056 --> 00:29:28,435
{\an8}- I was on every camera
I could find

575
00:29:28,476 --> 00:29:32,147
{\an8}begging, ""Please,
let my little girl go.""

576
00:29:36,901 --> 00:29:38,111
You know, she's smart.

577
00:29:38,153 --> 00:29:41,156
She could find her way home,
just let her go.

578
00:29:45,076 --> 00:29:47,454
I didn't eat,
I couldn't sleep,

579
00:29:47,495 --> 00:29:52,792
I couldn't do anything
but watch the TV,

580
00:29:52,834 --> 00:29:57,088
beg for him
to let her come back home.

581
00:29:57,130 --> 00:29:58,340
- Just waiting
for her to come in the door

582
00:29:58,381 --> 00:30:01,718
any minute now,
which is hard.

583
00:30:03,303 --> 00:30:06,181
- It was just a lot
of sitting and waiting

584
00:30:06,222 --> 00:30:09,768
and just gut-wrenching.

585
00:30:09,809 --> 00:30:13,396
It was a helplessness,
a hopeful still.

586
00:30:13,438 --> 00:30:18,360
But she couldn't do anything
but just be there.

587
00:30:21,029 --> 00:30:23,782
What started out
as a welfare documentary

588
00:30:23,823 --> 00:30:28,161
that was really focused on
Donna and Amber and Ricky,

589
00:30:28,203 --> 00:30:31,164
turned into a real
true-crime documentary.

590
00:30:36,836 --> 00:30:41,091
{\an8}- We started getting tips
and leads on Amber's abduction

591
00:30:41,132 --> 00:30:42,801
{\an8}almost immediately.

592
00:30:42,842 --> 00:30:44,219
{\an8}As soon as
it hit the news,

593
00:30:44,260 --> 00:30:47,013
{\an8}people started
calling in with leads.

594
00:30:47,055 --> 00:30:48,473
{\an8}What's your name again?

595
00:30:48,515 --> 00:30:52,102
{\an8}- We never anticipated
the number of leads

596
00:30:52,143 --> 00:30:54,646
{\an8}and calls from
the general public

597
00:30:54,688 --> 00:30:58,566
{\an8}that we were going to get.

598
00:30:58,608 --> 00:31:01,069
- And then they were
also talking to anybody

599
00:31:01,111 --> 00:31:04,322
who they considered to be,
you know,

600
00:31:04,364 --> 00:31:05,657
involved with the family,

601
00:31:05,699 --> 00:31:09,661
which included me
and my photographers.

602
00:31:09,703 --> 00:31:11,579
- The people from
the television affiliate,

603
00:31:11,621 --> 00:31:15,000
they had quite a bit of footage
of her, and of course,

604
00:31:15,041 --> 00:31:16,292
one of the things
you've got to do

605
00:31:16,334 --> 00:31:18,837
in any investigation
is find out who they are

606
00:31:18,878 --> 00:31:23,425
because at that particular time
everybody is a suspect.

607
00:31:23,466 --> 00:31:25,510
- It was still
a little intimidating

608
00:31:25,552 --> 00:31:27,262
that you had to
go through that.

609
00:31:27,303 --> 00:31:30,765
But you wanted to
do what you could to help.

610
00:31:30,807 --> 00:31:32,183
- We identified
who they were

611
00:31:32,225 --> 00:31:33,977
and interviewed
several of them.

612
00:31:34,019 --> 00:31:35,145
There was no question
in our mind

613
00:31:35,186 --> 00:31:37,689
that whoever took her
had nothing to do

614
00:31:37,731 --> 00:31:40,567
with that television crew.

615
00:31:42,694 --> 00:31:44,070
I am hopeful.

616
00:31:44,112 --> 00:31:47,449
I pray all the time that
the little girl won't be hurt.

617
00:31:47,490 --> 00:31:51,536
That's all we got to live on
right now is prayer.

618
00:31:51,578 --> 00:31:53,329
- I have a five-year-old
and a 20-month-old

619
00:31:53,371 --> 00:31:56,374
and I just--
I can't imagine it.

620
00:31:56,416 --> 00:32:00,170
- I think she's probably really,
really scared.

621
00:32:00,211 --> 00:32:02,172
I'm just sitting tight.

622
00:32:02,213 --> 00:32:03,715
I don't know what to do.

623
00:32:03,757 --> 00:32:05,717
You know, I want to help
and I want to go get her

624
00:32:05,759 --> 00:32:07,093
but I can't get her.

625
00:32:07,135 --> 00:32:08,720
You know,
I don't know where she's at.

626
00:32:15,602 --> 00:32:18,063
{\an8}- It was like, I think,
you know,

627
00:32:18,104 --> 00:32:20,982
{\an8}two or three weeks prior to

628
00:32:21,024 --> 00:32:22,484
{\an8}but we didn't
get along at that time

629
00:32:22,525 --> 00:32:29,532
{\an8}so we did mostly
just phone conversations.

630
00:32:29,574 --> 00:32:32,077
{\an8}- I met Richard that night
when Amber was kidnapped.

631
00:32:32,118 --> 00:32:35,080
{\an8}It was a little bit
of a tense situation

632
00:32:35,121 --> 00:32:37,957
{\an8}because he didn't know
what I was doing.

633
00:32:37,999 --> 00:32:41,294
{\an8}He was a little leery of that,
as I'm sure anybody would be

634
00:32:41,336 --> 00:32:43,588
{\an8}but we just kept doing
what we'd been doing

635
00:32:43,630 --> 00:32:45,173
{\an8}for so many months.

636
00:32:53,890 --> 00:32:57,936
{\an8}- No, no.
It-it wasn't abusive.

637
00:32:57,977 --> 00:32:59,229
{\an8}You know,
I may have yelled.

638
00:32:59,270 --> 00:33:01,189
{\an8}I may have yelled in the past,

639
00:33:01,231 --> 00:33:03,817
{\an8}but my dad yelled at me
and he yelled a-at my mom.

640
00:33:03,858 --> 00:33:05,694
{\an8}That's two people
trying to work something out.

641
00:33:05,735 --> 00:33:07,445
{\an8}- One of the things
that is critical

642
00:33:07,487 --> 00:33:09,614
{\an8}in the opening phases
of the investigation

643
00:33:09,656 --> 00:33:13,284
{\an8}is to try and establish
the family dynamics.

644
00:33:13,326 --> 00:33:17,664
{\an8}Amber's gone
but we don't know who took her.

645
00:33:17,706 --> 00:33:20,000
- Richard and I, at the time,
we were battling

646
00:33:20,041 --> 00:33:21,960
and we were
not getting along.

647
00:33:22,002 --> 00:33:24,796
And he was angry with me
for leaving him.

648
00:33:24,838 --> 00:33:28,174
- Nowadays standards,
an argument is-is violence.

649
00:33:28,216 --> 00:33:30,301
And that's not--
to me, that's not true.

650
00:33:30,343 --> 00:33:31,720
An argument's an argument.

651
00:33:31,761 --> 00:33:33,596
- All of these
investigative things

652
00:33:33,638 --> 00:33:34,723
come into play.

653
00:33:34,764 --> 00:33:37,559
It's not a very kind world
to live in.

654
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:40,937
{\an8}The dad's out of the picture,
where was he?

655
00:33:40,979 --> 00:33:41,980
{\an8}Who does he know?

656
00:33:42,022 --> 00:33:43,273
{\an8}You have to
just suspect anything

657
00:33:49,738 --> 00:33:49,988
{\an8}**

658
00:33:51,197 --> 00:33:52,490
{\an8}We're both innocent.

659
00:33:52,532 --> 00:33:53,783
{\an8}I mean, there's no reason for us
to harm our child.

660
00:33:53,825 --> 00:33:56,369
{\an8}We want our child back.
We want our child found.

661
00:34:01,541 --> 00:34:04,252
- Friends and family
continue to post notices

662
00:34:04,294 --> 00:34:07,005
and seek clues
in the search for Amber.

663
00:34:07,047 --> 00:34:09,424
- We're more upset because
there's nothing we can do.

664
00:34:09,466 --> 00:34:11,051
Nobody knows anything.
That's the thing.

665
00:34:11,092 --> 00:34:14,804
We can't do anything.
You don't know where to look.

666
00:34:19,893 --> 00:34:25,648
{\an8}- Day three, we did not have
an individual identified.

667
00:34:25,690 --> 00:34:27,859
{\an8}Of course,
in any investigation like this

668
00:34:27,901 --> 00:34:30,612
{\an8}you start at the core
and work out.

669
00:34:30,653 --> 00:34:32,989
{\an8}- Less than one percent of
child abduction cases

670
00:34:33,031 --> 00:34:36,659
{\an8}in the United States,
are stranger abductions,

671
00:34:36,701 --> 00:34:39,871
{\an8}children who are taken by
someone that they do not know.

672
00:34:39,913 --> 00:34:43,124
The majority of the cases
in this country

673
00:34:43,166 --> 00:34:45,585
are family abductions.

674
00:34:45,627 --> 00:34:47,837
- We're trying to identify
Richard's movements

675
00:34:47,879 --> 00:34:50,298
for January the 13th.

676
00:34:50,340 --> 00:34:52,592
He told us that--
in the afternoon

677
00:34:52,634 --> 00:34:54,427
that he went down
to the mini warehouse,

678
00:34:54,469 --> 00:34:57,138
going to one of the stalls.

679
00:34:57,180 --> 00:35:00,100
- And we got him
on surveillance video

680
00:35:00,141 --> 00:35:01,476
not a care in the world,

681
00:35:01,518 --> 00:35:05,689
no idea that anything amiss
had happened

682
00:35:05,730 --> 00:35:07,148
but we went down
to the mini warehouse

683
00:35:07,190 --> 00:35:08,316
and searched it anyway

684
00:35:08,358 --> 00:35:10,860
and of course
there was nothing there.

685
00:35:10,902 --> 00:35:12,529
{\an8}- So without a doubt,
we were able to

686
00:35:12,570 --> 00:35:14,489
{\an8}eliminate Richard as a suspect,

687
00:35:14,531 --> 00:35:16,908
{\an8}because of him being on video
at another location,

688
00:35:16,950 --> 00:35:19,494
{\an8}and he physically could not
have been at the location

689
00:35:19,536 --> 00:35:22,497
{\an8}to abduct his daughter.

690
00:35:22,539 --> 00:35:24,708
{\an8}- For a split second,
I did think

691
00:35:24,749 --> 00:35:28,128
{\an8}Richard might have had
something to do with it.

692
00:35:28,169 --> 00:35:31,506
Once Richard got there,
when I seen him face-to-face

693
00:35:31,548 --> 00:35:34,759
and how much shock he was in
that Amber was taken

694
00:35:34,801 --> 00:35:37,595
and how confused he was,
how can this happen,

695
00:35:37,637 --> 00:35:38,763
and I knew right then and there

696
00:35:38,805 --> 00:35:42,183
that he had
nothing to do with it.

697
00:35:42,225 --> 00:35:45,061
- I will say this for him,
that when he was interviewed

698
00:35:45,103 --> 00:35:46,855
he bared his soul.

699
00:35:46,896 --> 00:35:51,401
I mean he just,
anything we asked he told us

700
00:35:51,443 --> 00:35:53,653
because he didn't want us
wasting time on that.

701
00:35:53,695 --> 00:35:55,655
And the best way
to get away from that

702
00:35:55,697 --> 00:35:59,868
is to tell us anything and
everything we need to know.

703
00:35:59,909 --> 00:36:01,536
- Amber, baby,
if you're seeing me,

704
00:36:01,578 --> 00:36:03,747
if you hear Daddy,
we love you,

705
00:36:03,788 --> 00:36:10,378
Mommy loves you.
Miss you,

706
00:36:10,420 --> 00:36:13,923
we need you--
need you to come home.

707
00:36:13,965 --> 00:36:16,343
- I remember thinking that
that must have been

708
00:36:16,384 --> 00:36:17,969
so hard for her.

709
00:36:18,011 --> 00:36:22,223
{\an8}Given that theirs had not been,
from what she told me,

710
00:36:22,265 --> 00:36:24,392
{\an8}an amicable parting.

711
00:36:24,434 --> 00:36:29,105
{\an8}And so I think
she just kept focused on

712
00:36:29,147 --> 00:36:30,565
{\an8}what needed to be done.

713
00:36:30,607 --> 00:36:34,527
{\an8}And she didn't really
let any of that get in her way.

714
00:36:36,279 --> 00:36:37,572
I did love him at one point

715
00:36:37,614 --> 00:36:40,241
and he is the father
of my two children.

716
00:36:40,283 --> 00:36:43,536
I think he knew in his mind
that he--

717
00:36:43,578 --> 00:36:44,746
he should be there

718
00:36:44,788 --> 00:36:49,459
and he should help
support me a-and Ricky.

719
00:36:49,501 --> 00:36:51,544
- It's very typical
for law enforcement

720
00:36:51,586 --> 00:36:54,589
to immediately
interview the family

721
00:36:54,631 --> 00:36:56,925
after a child abduction case.

722
00:36:56,966 --> 00:37:01,971
And then quickly eliminate them
and then work on other people

723
00:37:02,013 --> 00:37:05,100
that may have had
some sort of interaction

724
00:37:05,141 --> 00:37:08,478
with the child.

725
00:37:08,520 --> 00:37:10,772
- Even though
you have every indication,

726
00:37:10,814 --> 00:37:14,526
at least initially that
this was a stranger abduction,

727
00:37:14,567 --> 00:37:17,112
it doesn't mean that
you can just walk away

728
00:37:17,153 --> 00:37:19,531
from other potential leads.

729
00:37:21,408 --> 00:37:22,784
{\an8}- One of the other things
that we look at

730
00:37:22,826 --> 00:37:24,285
{\an8}is the friends of the family.

731
00:37:24,327 --> 00:37:29,040
{\an8}In this case there was a man
named Mike Thompson.

732
00:37:29,082 --> 00:37:31,292
{\an8}- There were people
that immediately

733
00:37:31,334 --> 00:37:32,836
{\an8}voiced suspicion about him

734
00:37:32,877 --> 00:37:34,087
{\an8}when they heard
what had happened

735
00:37:34,129 --> 00:37:35,964
{\an8}that there might be
some involvement there.

736
00:37:37,757 --> 00:37:40,051
{\an8}- We're going to take
Mr. Thompson with us for a while

737
00:37:40,093 --> 00:37:41,886
{\an8}and we're going to talk to him
some more.

738
00:37:41,928 --> 00:37:44,389
{\an8}- Mike Thompson
was frequently part--

739
00:37:44,431 --> 00:37:46,141
{\an8}part of kind of
the family outings

740
00:37:46,182 --> 00:37:47,642
{\an8}and things like that.

741
00:37:47,684 --> 00:37:50,353
{\an8}He kind of held himself out
to be a family spokesperson

742
00:37:50,395 --> 00:37:51,813
{\an8}if needed.

743
00:37:51,855 --> 00:37:53,857
{\an8}- You're here and
you're not hearing anything.

744
00:37:53,898 --> 00:37:57,068
{\an8}It's frustrating and
for Donna it's more frustrating

745
00:37:57,110 --> 00:37:59,779
{\an8}than to the rest of us.

746
00:37:59,821 --> 00:38:01,823
- Especially in
high profile crime,

747
00:38:01,865 --> 00:38:03,199
if we've got someone
who is trying to

748
00:38:03,241 --> 00:38:05,201
actively insert themselves
into the investigation,

749
00:38:05,243 --> 00:38:09,497
one of the first things
I want to know is, why?

750
00:38:09,539 --> 00:38:10,790
One of the things
that we learned

751
00:38:10,832 --> 00:38:12,083
in interviewing Mike Thompson

752
00:38:12,125 --> 00:38:16,546
is that he also
drove a black truck.

753
00:38:16,588 --> 00:38:18,882
- I've got a black truck
so, you know,

754
00:38:18,923 --> 00:38:21,051
they automatically
they have to look.

755
00:38:21,092 --> 00:38:24,054
I welcome the-the opportunity
to, uh, you know,

756
00:38:24,095 --> 00:38:25,055
do whatever is necessary

757
00:38:25,096 --> 00:38:26,222
to show 'em
that they're looking

758
00:38:31,728 --> 00:38:32,896
{\an8}**

759
00:38:38,026 --> 00:38:40,111
{\an8}- We've got certainly
a group of potential suspects

760
00:38:40,153 --> 00:38:42,697
{\an8}we've identified and
people that we're checking on,

761
00:38:42,739 --> 00:38:44,574
{\an8}but whether one of those
is an actual suspect

762
00:38:44,616 --> 00:38:47,952
{\an8}or not it's too early to say.

763
00:38:47,994 --> 00:38:50,413
{\an8}- When Amber was abducted,
there were a lot of people

764
00:38:50,455 --> 00:38:51,623
{\an8}coming in and going

765
00:38:51,664 --> 00:38:53,208
{\an8}and I was just kind of
looking at people.

766
00:38:53,249 --> 00:38:55,877
{\an8}You know, do you know
where my baby is?

767
00:38:55,919 --> 00:38:58,088
{\an8}I wanted answers.
I wanted my baby back home.

768
00:39:03,968 --> 00:39:06,304
{\an8}- Police are still
talking with family and friends,

769
00:39:06,346 --> 00:39:07,806
{\an8}most recently Mike Thompson.

770
00:39:07,847 --> 00:39:09,808
{\an8}Amber's father
stays with Thompson,

771
00:39:09,849 --> 00:39:14,104
{\an8}who also drives
a black pickup truck.

772
00:39:14,145 --> 00:39:16,815
{\an8}- Now, how do you know
Richard and Donna?

773
00:39:16,856 --> 00:39:18,066
{\an8}- I mean,
we've just always been,

774
00:39:18,108 --> 00:39:20,151
{\an8}not just a working relationship,
but you know,

775
00:39:20,193 --> 00:39:22,987
{\an8}our friendship develops and, uh,
you're there for each other.

776
00:39:23,029 --> 00:39:25,031
- When you heard the description
was a black truck,

777
00:39:25,073 --> 00:39:26,866
did-did you suddenly have
the reaction of,

778
00:39:26,908 --> 00:39:29,077
""Oh, why did it have to be
a black truck?""

779
00:39:29,119 --> 00:39:30,495
- I mean, everybody's
focusing on it now,

780
00:39:30,537 --> 00:39:32,789
but you know, I got people,
oh, there's a black truck

781
00:39:32,831 --> 00:39:34,791
and I'm going,
the funny part about it,

782
00:39:34,833 --> 00:39:36,501
when I first got here
on the scene,

783
00:39:36,543 --> 00:39:38,461
the first thing
Saturday afternoon,

784
00:39:38,503 --> 00:39:40,755
there's cops all over here.

785
00:39:40,797 --> 00:39:42,007
And I'm never once questioned.

786
00:39:42,048 --> 00:39:44,718
I'm never once
asked about my black truck,

787
00:39:44,759 --> 00:39:48,096
never,
until sometime late Sunday.

788
00:39:48,138 --> 00:39:50,348
- Mike Thompson
drove a delivery truck

789
00:39:50,390 --> 00:39:51,850
and delivered auto parts.

790
00:39:51,891 --> 00:39:53,935
{\an8}And every time
he made a delivery,

791
00:39:53,977 --> 00:39:55,645
{\an8}there was a time stamp.

792
00:39:55,687 --> 00:39:58,189
{\an8}And on January the 13th,

793
00:39:58,231 --> 00:40:02,527
{\an8}he was 30 minutes,
45 minutes away.

794
00:40:02,569 --> 00:40:03,987
The other part about it was,

795
00:40:04,029 --> 00:40:06,364
Mike Thompson
was friends with Richard.

796
00:40:06,406 --> 00:40:08,533
If he wanted to get Amber
in the car with him,

797
00:40:08,575 --> 00:40:11,995
all he had to do would've been
just pull up and ask her.

798
00:40:12,037 --> 00:40:14,372
- Had it been someone
that she knew,

799
00:40:14,414 --> 00:40:16,458
why do the blitz attack?

800
00:40:16,499 --> 00:40:20,378
There was no attempt at all
to engage Amber in conversation

801
00:40:20,420 --> 00:40:22,255
according to Jimmie Kevil.

802
00:40:22,297 --> 00:40:25,383
That's another reason
why we believe that

803
00:40:25,425 --> 00:40:26,343
it was a stranger,

804
00:40:26,384 --> 00:40:28,720
someone that was
unknown to Amber.

805
00:40:28,762 --> 00:40:31,056
This type of
abduction is rare.

806
00:40:31,097 --> 00:40:34,601
And of course, on one hand
that's good because, you know,

807
00:40:34,642 --> 00:40:36,770
it means the community's
a little safer.

808
00:40:36,811 --> 00:40:40,774
On the other hand,
the case incensed the community.

809
00:40:40,815 --> 00:40:43,485
{\an8}- This took over
pretty much every aspect

810
00:40:43,526 --> 00:40:44,986
{\an8}of the city and community.

811
00:40:45,028 --> 00:40:47,572
{\an8}It was all about Amber.

812
00:40:47,614 --> 00:40:49,783
It wasn't just
her neighborhood.

813
00:40:49,824 --> 00:40:53,495
It was the entire city
just covered in pink bows.

814
00:40:53,536 --> 00:40:56,831
You saw them all over trees
and street signs.

815
00:40:56,873 --> 00:40:59,584
It was all anyone
could talk about.

816
00:40:59,626 --> 00:41:02,962
- The community really
cared about my little girl

817
00:41:03,004 --> 00:41:05,757
and what happened to her.

818
00:41:05,799 --> 00:41:07,008
The waiting's
really killing me.

819
00:41:07,050 --> 00:41:08,968
It's hard to wait.

820
00:41:09,010 --> 00:41:12,347
But I know I have to keep strong
for my little girl.

821
00:41:12,389 --> 00:41:16,434
- I just hope she's okay and
she can come back real soon.

822
00:41:16,476 --> 00:41:18,770
We-we all miss her a lot.

823
00:41:18,812 --> 00:41:20,105
- How could they not
see something?

824
00:41:20,146 --> 00:41:24,067
Look how busy this street is!

825
00:41:24,109 --> 00:41:28,363
{\an8}- You see the fear in their eyes
and as a detective,

826
00:41:28,405 --> 00:41:31,116
{\an8}as an investigator,
as a police officer,

827
00:41:31,157 --> 00:41:32,992
{\an8}it's very frustrating

828
00:41:33,034 --> 00:41:36,454
{\an8}because you want to be able
to take that fear way.

829
00:41:36,496 --> 00:41:40,500
{\an8}You want to be able
to solve that crime.

830
00:41:43,545 --> 00:41:46,297
{\an8}- We knew that a task force
needed to be formed

831
00:41:46,339 --> 00:41:49,134
{\an8}that could control
the leads and tips

832
00:41:49,175 --> 00:41:51,761
{\an8}as far as making sure that
each one was looked at.

833
00:41:51,803 --> 00:41:54,139
{\an8}But again,
not doubling the effort.

834
00:41:54,180 --> 00:41:56,099
- We were a freestanding
task force.

835
00:41:56,141 --> 00:41:59,060
We had 15 detectives
that they had dedicated to us.

836
00:41:59,102 --> 00:42:01,312
I needed people
who were very good

837
00:42:01,354 --> 00:42:03,815
at interview
and interrogation,

838
00:42:03,857 --> 00:42:07,068
who had a very strong
attention to detail.

839
00:42:07,110 --> 00:42:09,320
They didn't let little things
slip by them.

840
00:42:09,362 --> 00:42:11,656
And I needed people
that did not know

841
00:42:11,698 --> 00:42:13,324
the meaning of the word quit.

842
00:42:13,366 --> 00:42:15,160
- While we were still
looking for Amber,

843
00:42:15,201 --> 00:42:17,245
these teams of detectives
and FBI agents

844
00:42:17,287 --> 00:42:21,124
were going out contacting
registered sex offenders.

845
00:42:21,166 --> 00:42:22,876
- This unit
that has come to town

846
00:42:22,917 --> 00:42:25,712
{\an8}has a tremendous amount
of expertise

847
00:42:25,754 --> 00:42:28,840
{\an8}in child abduction cases
and that is why they're here.

848
00:42:28,882 --> 00:42:32,552
{\an8}- We assume that
because she was 9 years old

849
00:42:32,594 --> 00:42:33,970
and it was a female

850
00:42:34,012 --> 00:42:36,389
that there's a sexual
component to this,

851
00:42:36,431 --> 00:42:41,019
and it's what drove
the investigation.

852
00:42:41,061 --> 00:42:42,645
- We started looking at
sex offenders

853
00:42:42,687 --> 00:42:46,691
who had offended against girls
in the age range of seven to 12

854
00:42:46,733 --> 00:42:49,069
and then you expand out
from there.

855
00:42:52,405 --> 00:42:54,532
- We actually mapped this out
on a grid to make sure that

856
00:42:54,574 --> 00:42:58,495
we had contacted
every resident, if possible.

857
00:42:58,536 --> 00:43:00,705
When we interviewed people,
we'd find out,

858
00:43:00,747 --> 00:43:02,499
did they live there
with a family?

859
00:43:02,540 --> 00:43:05,043
Is it a single male
that lives there alone

860
00:43:05,085 --> 00:43:07,796
that could potentially
be a suspect?

861
00:43:07,837 --> 00:43:09,297
- We have every reason
to believe that

862
00:43:09,339 --> 00:43:12,926
this individual may have
committed this crime before.

863
00:43:12,967 --> 00:43:15,553
- You have a high risk grab
right there

864
00:43:15,595 --> 00:43:17,806
in the middle of
that parking lot, you know,

865
00:43:17,847 --> 00:43:19,265
in my mind
I just kind of felt like

866
00:43:19,307 --> 00:43:21,476
maybe he had done this before.

867
00:43:21,518 --> 00:43:23,561
And, of course,
it was also a concern

868
00:43:23,603 --> 00:43:26,481
that he might do it again
in the future.

869
00:43:30,944 --> 00:43:32,487
- We're just trying not to
give up hope

870
00:43:32,529 --> 00:43:34,823
and trying to be strong
for Amber.

871
00:43:34,864 --> 00:43:36,032
Arlington Police...

872
00:43:36,074 --> 00:43:38,493
- Would she be willing to
talk to me?

873
00:43:38,535 --> 00:43:42,372
{\an8}- You don't have the-the luxury
of dismissing anything.

874
00:43:42,414 --> 00:43:44,958
{\an8}Every lead had to be looked at,
no matter how far-fetched

875
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:48,503
{\an8}or improbable that it was.

876
00:43:49,504 --> 00:43:51,297
{\an8}- I remember
helicopters overhead,

877
00:43:51,339 --> 00:43:53,633
{\an8}and I remember officers
with dogs

878
00:43:53,675 --> 00:43:55,218
{\an8}going through the park.

879
00:43:55,260 --> 00:43:56,761
{\an8}Every time they got
one of those tips

880
00:43:56,803 --> 00:43:57,637
{\an8}and they went out,
you were like,

881
00:43:57,679 --> 00:43:58,930
{\an8}""Okay, is this it?

882
00:43:58,972 --> 00:44:01,433
{\an8}Are they finally
going to find her?""

883
00:44:01,474 --> 00:44:03,727
- I think they're working
as hard as they can

884
00:44:03,768 --> 00:44:07,397
and I think they're doing
all they can to get Amber home.

885
00:44:09,566 --> 00:44:12,610
Give them peace.

886
00:44:12,652 --> 00:44:18,658
Give them hope that
it will end in a happy reunion.

887
00:44:20,660 --> 00:44:22,120
I didn't know what to do.

888
00:44:22,162 --> 00:44:26,791
All I knew I wanted to do
is get my little girl home.

889
00:44:26,833 --> 00:44:29,252
I worried about her
the whole time.

890
00:44:29,294 --> 00:44:30,462
You know,
is she going to get fed?

891
00:44:30,503 --> 00:44:33,631
Is she being taken care of?
Is she warm?

892
00:44:33,673 --> 00:44:36,343
Is she cold?

893
00:44:39,763 --> 00:44:41,348
- The days go on,
the hours go on,

894
00:44:41,389 --> 00:44:44,059
and you don't have to know much
about child abduction statistics

895
00:44:44,100 --> 00:44:47,228
to know that every second
works against you.

896
00:44:47,270 --> 00:44:49,147
Not just every minute
or every hour,

897
00:44:49,189 --> 00:44:51,316
but every second
works against you.

898
00:44:51,358 --> 00:44:53,485
The chances of
finding a child alive

899
00:44:53,526 --> 00:44:56,905
diminish dramatically
as time goes on.

900
00:45:09,417 --> 00:45:11,169
{\an8}**

901
00:45:16,257 --> 00:45:19,177
{\an8}- Wednesday evening,
this spring-like thunderstorm

902
00:45:19,219 --> 00:45:21,012
{\an8}came through and
dropped the temperature.

903
00:45:21,054 --> 00:45:23,473
{\an8}I mean for as warm as it was,
it turned off

904
00:45:23,515 --> 00:45:25,350
{\an8}just bitterly cold
out of the north.

905
00:45:25,392 --> 00:45:27,477
{\an8}But as the front moved through,
which it does

906
00:45:27,519 --> 00:45:30,146
{\an8}typically in Texas
when cold air meets warm air,

907
00:45:30,188 --> 00:45:33,191
{\an8}we have bad, bad storms.

908
00:46:04,806 --> 00:46:07,600
{\an8}- I received a phone call
at about 11:30 at night

909
00:46:07,642 --> 00:46:08,893
{\an8}at my residence.

910
00:46:08,935 --> 00:46:12,897
{\an8}Dispatch informed me that
a body had been found

911
00:46:12,939 --> 00:46:16,526
{\an8}in Arlington.

912
00:46:20,488 --> 00:46:22,866
I was the first
investigative person

913
00:46:22,907 --> 00:46:24,117
that was on the scene.

914
00:46:24,159 --> 00:46:27,954
Patrol was there,
and crime scene was there.

915
00:46:27,996 --> 00:46:29,372
{\an8}- We don't know that much
at this point

916
00:46:29,414 --> 00:46:32,125
{\an8}and we want to be very,
very cautious about

917
00:46:32,167 --> 00:46:34,544
{\an8}the information
that we're putting out.

918
00:46:36,546 --> 00:46:39,382
{\an8}- I walked down to the creek bed
and I noticed

919
00:46:39,424 --> 00:46:43,386
{\an8}a young white female's body
that was floating,

920
00:46:43,428 --> 00:46:46,723
{\an8}but was caught up
in the brush.

921
00:46:46,765 --> 00:46:49,267
{\an8}- The police are saying
it's too hard to tell,

922
00:46:49,309 --> 00:46:51,603
{\an8}you know, who it is.

923
00:46:51,644 --> 00:46:54,105
{\an8}- My husband
said it was a female.

924
00:46:54,147 --> 00:46:55,940
{\an8}She's buck-naked.
She's face down.

925
00:46:55,982 --> 00:47:00,487
{\an8}He said it was a female.

926
00:47:00,528 --> 00:47:02,614
{\an8}- Why has the lead investigator
on the Amber Hagerman case

927
00:47:02,655 --> 00:47:04,199
{\an8}been called here?

928
00:47:04,240 --> 00:47:06,409
{\an8}- Well, I mean, he's one of
our lead homicide investigators

929
00:47:06,451 --> 00:47:08,578
{\an8}and, you know,
we're certainly,

930
00:47:08,620 --> 00:47:11,289
{\an8}we're certainly sensitive
to the fact that

931
00:47:11,331 --> 00:47:14,751
{\an8}we've located a body
that needs to be identified.

932
00:47:14,793 --> 00:47:17,337
I mean, I don't want to
alarm anyone at this point,

933
00:47:17,379 --> 00:47:19,089
but we're certainly sensitive
to the fact that--

934
00:47:19,130 --> 00:47:20,298
that it could be Amber

935
00:47:20,340 --> 00:47:22,258
and we're just not
in a position to say yet.

936
00:47:22,300 --> 00:47:25,136
- Has the family been notified
in any way?

937
00:47:25,178 --> 00:47:27,097
- Uh, we have people en route
over to the--

938
00:47:27,138 --> 00:47:29,099
to the residence
now to notify them

939
00:47:29,140 --> 00:47:32,394
that we have located a-a body.

940
00:47:35,605 --> 00:47:37,524
- My name is
Derrelynn Perryman,

941
00:47:37,565 --> 00:47:40,151
{\an8}and I was the Victim
Assistance Coordinator

942
00:47:40,193 --> 00:47:41,486
{\an8}for the Arlington
Police Department

943
00:47:41,528 --> 00:47:43,780
{\an8}during the Amber case.

944
00:47:43,822 --> 00:47:46,950
I go into the house
and touch base with the family.

945
00:47:46,991 --> 00:47:50,620
I had been given instructions
that we weren't going to be able

946
00:47:50,662 --> 00:47:53,331
to positively identify
the child that was found

947
00:47:53,373 --> 00:47:58,503
until they completed
the crime scene investigation.

948
00:47:58,545 --> 00:48:00,171
{\an8}- I had been with the family
all day

949
00:48:00,213 --> 00:48:01,256
{\an8}and I got in bed

950
00:48:01,297 --> 00:48:03,967
{\an8}and I had hardly
touched the sheets

951
00:48:04,009 --> 00:48:05,885
{\an8}before the phone rang.

952
00:48:05,927 --> 00:48:07,095
{\an8}And I picked up the phone

953
00:48:07,137 --> 00:48:09,180
{\an8}and it was my assistant
news director.

954
00:48:09,222 --> 00:48:14,602
{\an8}And he said, Pam,
they found a body.

955
00:48:14,644 --> 00:48:17,605
{\an8}So I immediately headed
back to the house,

956
00:48:17,647 --> 00:48:22,235
{\an8}and went straight in
with my photographer.

957
00:48:26,281 --> 00:48:27,949
{\an8}- We were all really
watching the news,

958
00:48:27,991 --> 00:48:32,328
{\an8}and they kept talking about
this little body they found.

959
00:48:32,370 --> 00:48:34,122
- So Edie Kocher
and her husband

960
00:48:34,164 --> 00:48:36,207
who found the body,
Stuart Kocher,

961
00:48:36,249 --> 00:48:37,625
are at least themselves
convinced that

962
00:48:37,667 --> 00:48:40,628
what he saw was the body
of a young girl.

963
00:48:40,670 --> 00:48:42,505
Police are not so convinced.

964
00:48:42,547 --> 00:48:48,053
- So we sat in their living room
and they had the news on

965
00:48:48,094 --> 00:48:50,722
all night long.

966
00:48:50,764 --> 00:48:52,891
- It was over and over
and over,

967
00:48:52,932 --> 00:48:54,142
a child's body has been found.

968
00:48:54,184 --> 00:48:56,227
It's probably Amber.
It's probably Amber.

969
00:48:56,269 --> 00:48:58,521
And so, you can imagine
how agonizing

970
00:48:58,563 --> 00:49:02,359
that was to just sit there
and listen to that.

971
00:49:02,400 --> 00:49:07,238
[indistinct TV chatter]

972
00:49:07,280 --> 00:49:10,909
- News 8 Now,
the spirit of Texas.

973
00:49:10,950 --> 00:49:12,160
- We interrupt this program
to bring you

974
00:49:12,202 --> 00:49:16,164
the following News 8
Special Report.

975
00:49:16,206 --> 00:49:18,667
- Arlington Police Department
came to the house this evening

976
00:49:18,708 --> 00:49:21,836
to tell the family that
a body had been found.

977
00:49:21,878 --> 00:49:24,464
Amber's father also is here
at the house with the family.

978
00:49:24,506 --> 00:49:26,424
- I was watching this
on the news

979
00:49:26,466 --> 00:49:28,968
in my parents' home
with my parents.

980
00:49:29,010 --> 00:49:32,013
And that was hard.

981
00:49:34,516 --> 00:49:36,267
- ...family friend
who has been here

982
00:49:36,309 --> 00:49:37,769
throughout the whole ordeal,

983
00:49:37,811 --> 00:49:40,772
as well as Amber's mother,
who is looking quite distraught.

984
00:49:40,814 --> 00:49:44,109
- It was
an excruciating night.

985
00:49:44,150 --> 00:49:46,277
And no,
I wasn't her family.

986
00:49:46,319 --> 00:49:48,905
I felt like I understood,

987
00:49:48,947 --> 00:49:52,200
and I was having
some of those same emotions.

988
00:49:52,242 --> 00:49:56,705
I didn't want it to be her.
Nobody did.

989
00:49:56,746 --> 00:49:58,707
- ...saw a little girl
riding her bike

990
00:49:58,748 --> 00:50:01,501
and then a black pickup
pulled up next to her

991
00:50:01,543 --> 00:50:03,837
and yanked her off that bike.

992
00:50:03,878 --> 00:50:05,797
- I was in contact
with Mike Simonds,

993
00:50:05,839 --> 00:50:08,925
and he said it was
probably Amber,

994
00:50:08,967 --> 00:50:11,720
but we needed to be sure,
and we didn't want to tell them

995
00:50:11,761 --> 00:50:15,640
until we had confirmed that
it was actually her.

996
00:50:15,682 --> 00:50:20,395
So, I talked with the family.
I explained that to them.

997
00:50:20,437 --> 00:50:21,604
At this point I'm told

998
00:50:21,646 --> 00:50:22,897
you've got a couple hours
to rest

999
00:50:22,939 --> 00:50:24,649
if you can even
just close your eyes

1000
00:50:24,691 --> 00:50:29,029
for a couple of minutes.
It's gonna help a little bit.

1001
00:50:34,367 --> 00:50:38,413
- I was there for several hours
and then my pager went off

1002
00:50:38,455 --> 00:50:39,664
and I went out to the car.

1003
00:50:39,706 --> 00:50:42,500
I did have a cell phone,
and Mike Simonds said,

1004
00:50:42,542 --> 00:50:45,253
Yes, you know,
we've identified it's her.

1005
00:50:45,295 --> 00:50:48,840
Um, they identified
some birthmarks.

1006
00:50:48,882 --> 00:50:50,967
And then he said,
""And you have five minutes

1007
00:50:51,009 --> 00:50:54,512
to tell the family before
we announce it to the media.

1008
00:51:04,564 --> 00:51:07,859
[distant screaming]

1009
00:51:11,279 --> 00:51:13,406
- There was a-a scream
and a cry

1010
00:51:13,448 --> 00:51:15,867
that I will never forget.

1011
00:51:17,369 --> 00:51:23,458
[sobbing softly]

1012
00:51:29,673 --> 00:51:32,842
- That was really,
really hard.

1013
00:51:32,884 --> 00:51:36,179
You know,
just my mom and my dad crying

1014
00:51:36,221 --> 00:51:40,892
and my dad never cries.

1015
00:51:46,731 --> 00:51:49,567
- From all visual
that we can see,

1016
00:51:49,609 --> 00:51:51,778
from the description
that we've got

1017
00:51:51,820 --> 00:51:53,905
and from the photographs
that we've seen,

1018
00:51:53,947 --> 00:51:57,117
we feel that this tentatively
is going to be

1019
00:51:57,158 --> 00:51:59,661
the body of Amber Hagerman.

1020
00:51:59,703 --> 00:52:03,081
- We are in the process
of notifying the family as such.

1021
00:52:03,123 --> 00:52:06,001
We are stressing to them and
I want to stress to all of you,

1022
00:52:06,042 --> 00:52:08,545
that a positive identification
will be made

1023
00:52:08,586 --> 00:52:09,963
by the Medical
Examiner's Office...

1024
00:52:10,005 --> 00:52:14,426
- Just the agony of knowing
that yes, that was her

1025
00:52:14,467 --> 00:52:16,720
and she was gone.

1026
00:52:16,761 --> 00:52:19,431
You just can't
even describe it.

1027
00:52:19,472 --> 00:52:20,849
[sobbing]

1028
00:52:20,890 --> 00:52:22,183
- You know, very little
to go on

1029
00:52:27,147 --> 00:52:31,151
{\an8}**

1030
00:52:36,239 --> 00:52:39,284
{\an8}- We decided pretty early on
that we're gonna have to

1031
00:52:39,325 --> 00:52:41,703
{\an8}not air
the welfare documentary,

1032
00:52:41,745 --> 00:52:44,039
{\an8}which was
due to air on Thursday.

1033
00:52:44,080 --> 00:52:49,586
{\an8}And actually, that was the day
we found out she was found.

1034
00:52:53,923 --> 00:52:56,718
{\an8}- When they confirmed
it was Amber's body,

1035
00:52:56,760 --> 00:52:58,720
{\an8}and, you know,
it's everybody's screaming

1036
00:52:58,762 --> 00:53:01,556
{\an8}and crying and
news media is everywhere.

1037
00:53:01,598 --> 00:53:03,433
{\an8}The police had put
the yellow tape

1038
00:53:03,475 --> 00:53:06,895
{\an8}around my parents' front yard.

1039
00:53:06,936 --> 00:53:10,648
{\an8}It was horrible that day.

1040
00:53:11,775 --> 00:53:15,945
And still I'm in denial.
No, this is not my baby.

1041
00:53:15,987 --> 00:53:18,865
I want to see my baby
from my own eyes.

1042
00:53:18,907 --> 00:53:22,744
I wanted to touch my baby.
I wanted to talk to my baby.

1043
00:53:22,786 --> 00:53:27,123
And I did not--
no I did not believe it.

1044
00:53:30,418 --> 00:53:32,921
{\an8}Immediately, of course,

1045
00:53:32,962 --> 00:53:36,091
{\an8}Donna wanted to go
and be with Amber,

1046
00:53:36,132 --> 00:53:37,175
{\an8}and as a mom,

1047
00:53:37,217 --> 00:53:39,219
{\an8}I could certainly
identify with that.

1048
00:53:39,260 --> 00:53:41,846
{\an8}If I hadn't been able to
put my hands on my child

1049
00:53:41,888 --> 00:53:44,182
{\an8}for several days because
they were missing,

1050
00:53:44,224 --> 00:53:46,685
{\an8}that would be the first thing
I would want to do too.

1051
00:53:46,726 --> 00:53:48,353
The Tarrant County
Medical Examiner's Office

1052
00:53:48,395 --> 00:53:50,105
doesn't allow people to visit.

1053
00:53:50,146 --> 00:53:52,273
We contacted
the medical examiner's office,

1054
00:53:52,315 --> 00:53:53,316
and of course,

1055
00:53:53,358 --> 00:53:55,610
they-they did
the autopsy priority

1056
00:53:55,652 --> 00:53:58,029
because we knew that
it was just urgent.

1057
00:53:58,071 --> 00:54:02,742
You know, she really,
really needed to be with Amber.

1058
00:54:11,626 --> 00:54:14,129
{\an8}Now we have a homicide.

1059
00:54:14,170 --> 00:54:17,132
{\an8}First order of business
is you shift into high gear

1060
00:54:17,173 --> 00:54:19,300
{\an8}thinking,
""Okay, what have we got?""

1061
00:54:19,342 --> 00:54:21,594
{\an8}It started off Saturday.

1062
00:54:21,636 --> 00:54:23,471
{\an8}Now we're over here
on Thursday.

1063
00:54:23,513 --> 00:54:27,976
{\an8}We found Amber dead
in this creek three miles away.

1064
00:54:28,018 --> 00:54:31,354
{\an8}Why?

1065
00:54:35,108 --> 00:54:36,526
{\an8}- So right now,
we're pulling into

1066
00:54:36,568 --> 00:54:40,989
{\an8}the apartment complex and
we're going towards the creek

1067
00:54:41,031 --> 00:54:43,867
{\an8}that runs north and south
along the west side

1068
00:54:43,908 --> 00:54:47,662
{\an8}of the apartment complex.

1069
00:54:47,704 --> 00:54:50,040
The first time
that I came out here,

1070
00:54:50,081 --> 00:54:53,501
it made me realize that
the suspect must have known

1071
00:54:53,543 --> 00:54:58,381
that this apartment complex
and the creek were here.

1072
00:54:58,423 --> 00:55:01,676
It just doesn't seem likely
that a suspect

1073
00:55:01,718 --> 00:55:04,846
would just randomly
drive into this complex

1074
00:55:04,888 --> 00:55:07,390
and then just
happen upon a creek

1075
00:55:07,432 --> 00:55:10,852
to leave her body in.

1076
00:55:10,894 --> 00:55:13,396
- The night that
Amber's body was found,

1077
00:55:13,438 --> 00:55:16,024
there were thousands and
thousands of gallons of water

1078
00:55:16,066 --> 00:55:19,027
that washed over her body.

1079
00:55:19,069 --> 00:55:21,279
Based on the condition
of her body,

1080
00:55:21,321 --> 00:55:23,698
we think that
she was put in very close to

1081
00:55:23,740 --> 00:55:26,910
if not exactly
where her body was found.

1082
00:55:26,951 --> 00:55:29,871
There were not injuries
or anything like that

1083
00:55:29,913 --> 00:55:33,208
that would be indicative of
her traveling a long way

1084
00:55:33,249 --> 00:55:36,711
in the water, hitting rocks,
hitting branches,

1085
00:55:36,753 --> 00:55:38,922
and all the things
that you would expect to see

1086
00:55:38,963 --> 00:55:40,799
if she had been
put in the water

1087
00:55:40,840 --> 00:55:44,719
a long ways from
where she was found.

1088
00:55:44,761 --> 00:55:46,471
- It was a large
apartment complex

1089
00:55:46,513 --> 00:55:48,723
and there was a main gate.

1090
00:55:48,765 --> 00:55:53,770
To the west of that main gate,
there was another entrance.

1091
00:55:53,812 --> 00:55:55,897
It, too, had a gate.

1092
00:55:55,939 --> 00:55:59,275
At the time of Amber's
abduction and her recovery,

1093
00:55:59,317 --> 00:56:00,777
that gate was broken.

1094
00:56:00,819 --> 00:56:03,321
So there was unfettered access
into and out of

1095
00:56:03,363 --> 00:56:06,825
the apartment complex
through that gate.

1096
00:56:06,866 --> 00:56:10,412
There was a video camera
at the main entrance.

1097
00:56:10,453 --> 00:56:12,831
On the night that
Amber's body was recovered,

1098
00:56:12,872 --> 00:56:16,251
the wind and the rain,
it was shaking the camera

1099
00:56:16,292 --> 00:56:21,047
and it took visibility down to
where we couldn't see very well.

1100
00:56:21,089 --> 00:56:23,383
- You can see vehicles
coming and going,

1101
00:56:23,425 --> 00:56:27,762
and you do see a dark truck
that enters the complex,

1102
00:56:27,804 --> 00:56:30,265
but the video
just wasn't clear enough

1103
00:56:30,306 --> 00:56:31,933
to be able to determine
whether or not

1104
00:56:31,975 --> 00:56:34,644
that was the suspect vehicle.

1105
00:56:34,686 --> 00:56:36,771
- There was nothing
on that video

1106
00:56:36,813 --> 00:56:39,274
that we could use to
identify a suspect.

1107
00:56:39,315 --> 00:56:42,569
One of our beliefs was that
the suspect was familiar with

1108
00:56:42,610 --> 00:56:47,115
not only the abduction site
but the disposal site as well.

1109
00:56:47,157 --> 00:56:48,575
And that's another one
of the reasons

1110
00:56:48,616 --> 00:56:52,495
why we believed that he was
probably a local resident.

1111
00:56:57,000 --> 00:56:58,543
{\an8}- Only portion
that was submerged

1112
00:56:58,585 --> 00:57:04,883
{\an8}was from her shoulders up.
And maybe-maybe an arm.

1113
00:57:04,924 --> 00:57:06,343
{\an8}And so I ran back to the house,

1114
00:57:06,384 --> 00:57:08,303
{\an8}and, uh, went through
the front door,

1115
00:57:08,345 --> 00:57:11,306
{\an8}a-and yelled at my wife Edie,
I found her.

1116
00:57:11,348 --> 00:57:13,266
{\an8}I found Amber.

1117
00:57:13,308 --> 00:57:15,310
{\an8}- Stuart Kocher
was the witness

1118
00:57:15,352 --> 00:57:19,814
{\an8}that found Amber's body
that night.

1119
00:57:19,856 --> 00:57:22,150
{\an8}His statement was that
after the storm

1120
00:57:22,192 --> 00:57:23,693
{\an8}had passed through the area

1121
00:57:23,735 --> 00:57:25,987
{\an8}that he took his dog
out for a walk.

1122
00:57:26,029 --> 00:57:27,614
His dog went down
to the creek bed area

1123
00:57:27,655 --> 00:57:29,824
and began barking.

1124
00:57:29,866 --> 00:57:33,995
Then he saw Amber's body.

1125
00:57:34,037 --> 00:57:36,539
- And because there'd been
so much coverage

1126
00:57:36,581 --> 00:57:40,460
of Amber being missing and
everybody trying to find her,

1127
00:57:40,502 --> 00:57:44,089
his immediate thought was,
That's probably her.

1128
00:57:46,132 --> 00:57:48,510
- You ask
all sorts of questions like

1129
00:57:48,551 --> 00:57:50,553
""Did you talk to anybody
while you were going out

1130
00:57:50,595 --> 00:57:52,889
to go on this walk?
What'd you do before that?""

1131
00:57:52,931 --> 00:57:55,684
If he was involved in it,
then obviously,

1132
00:57:55,725 --> 00:57:57,143
you're worried about
what happened

1133
00:57:57,185 --> 00:58:01,690
from the abduction time
to the discovery of the body.

1134
00:58:01,731 --> 00:58:03,942
There wasn't anything
in his story

1135
00:58:03,983 --> 00:58:07,112
that was inconsistent.

1136
00:58:07,153 --> 00:58:11,032
He was finally eliminated
by a polygraph.

1137
00:58:12,325 --> 00:58:13,535
- We're just going to
question people

1138
00:58:13,576 --> 00:58:16,788
to see what they saw
and what they observed.

1139
00:58:16,830 --> 00:58:20,417
- We began a canvas,
multiple FBI agents,

1140
00:58:20,458 --> 00:58:25,338
and we had multiple
Arlington PD detectives there.

1141
00:58:25,380 --> 00:58:27,382
- We want to know
who the maintenance people are.

1142
00:58:27,424 --> 00:58:30,385
Who is doing the landscaping
at the apartments?

1143
00:58:30,427 --> 00:58:33,847
What independent
contractors they have.

1144
00:58:33,888 --> 00:58:35,724
We went door to door.

1145
00:58:35,765 --> 00:58:38,768
Before it was over with
we were at

1146
00:58:38,810 --> 00:58:42,564
every single apartment
in that complex.

1147
00:58:42,605 --> 00:58:45,316
- We didn't find
any additional witnesses.

1148
00:58:45,358 --> 00:58:48,236
No one admitted to seeing
anyone parking

1149
00:58:48,278 --> 00:58:51,906
and carrying anything down
through the playground

1150
00:58:51,948 --> 00:58:54,784
into the culvert area
either that night

1151
00:58:54,826 --> 00:58:59,289
or any of the days
leading up to that.

1152
00:59:08,465 --> 00:59:10,592
- I didn't believe that
that was Amber.

1153
00:59:10,633 --> 00:59:14,054
I said that's not my baby.
My baby's not dead.

1154
00:59:14,095 --> 00:59:16,306
You know, I want to
go see my daughter.

1155
00:59:16,348 --> 00:59:20,060
Take me to my little girl.
I want to hold my little girl.

1156
00:59:20,101 --> 00:59:23,063
I want to see for myself,
with my own eyes,

1157
00:59:23,104 --> 00:59:25,357
that this is my little girl.

1158
00:59:25,398 --> 00:59:27,359
And they kept telling me,
no I can't

1159
00:59:27,400 --> 00:59:29,527
'cause they had to
do the autopsy

1160
00:59:29,569 --> 00:59:33,948
and that she was so disfigured
so they had to

1161
00:59:33,990 --> 00:59:37,243
cover her wounds up
so I wouldn't see that.

1162
00:59:37,285 --> 00:59:40,246
And they said I didn't want to
see her the way she was.

1163
00:59:40,288 --> 00:59:41,623
And I told them,
you know, I don't care.

1164
00:59:41,664 --> 00:59:43,041
I want to see my little girl.

1165
00:59:43,083 --> 00:59:44,292
I want to hold my little girl.

1166
00:59:44,334 --> 00:59:47,962
So I didn't get to
see her or hold her,

1167
00:59:48,004 --> 00:59:49,964
until the next day.

1168
00:59:50,006 --> 00:59:52,384
And they took me
to the funeral home

1169
00:59:52,425 --> 00:59:55,345
and I got to kiss her
and hold her hand

1170
00:59:55,387 --> 00:59:57,681
and told her
that everything's okay,

1171
00:59:57,722 --> 00:59:59,974
you know, Mommy's here.

1172
01:00:00,016 --> 01:00:02,435
So they told me
I could hold her hands

1173
01:00:02,477 --> 01:00:06,106
and touch her little face
and that was it.

1174
01:00:06,147 --> 01:00:08,024
But I so wanted to,
you know,

1175
01:00:08,066 --> 01:00:10,568
pick her up
and hold her and...

1176
01:00:10,610 --> 01:00:14,656
[crying]

1177
01:00:14,698 --> 01:00:16,408
Yeah.

1178
01:00:25,375 --> 01:00:31,631
- Amber had
a very severe laceration

1179
01:00:31,673 --> 01:00:35,176
to her throat from one side
to the other.

1180
01:00:35,218 --> 01:00:40,640
Um, it was a--
a very severe cut,

1181
01:00:40,682 --> 01:00:42,308
very violent cut.

1182
01:00:43,560 --> 01:00:46,312
- You've got
all this damage

1183
01:00:46,354 --> 01:00:47,689
to her throat
and neck area

1184
01:00:47,731 --> 01:00:50,108
but not necessarily
a tremendous amount of damage

1185
01:00:50,150 --> 01:00:51,609
elsewhere
on the body.

1186
01:00:51,651 --> 01:00:54,529
- One of the things
that we saw right away

1187
01:00:54,571 --> 01:00:56,197
was that there was
no indication

1188
01:00:56,239 --> 01:01:00,201
of a sexual assault
to Amber's body.

1189
01:01:00,243 --> 01:01:03,371
Just because there's not
evidence of a sexual assault

1190
01:01:03,413 --> 01:01:07,334
doesn't mean that there was
not a sexual component to it.

1191
01:01:07,375 --> 01:01:10,337
- You can't escape
at least the theory

1192
01:01:10,378 --> 01:01:13,298
that the act of killing Amber
was what provided

1193
01:01:13,340 --> 01:01:14,966
a sexual release
for the suspect.

1194
01:01:15,008 --> 01:01:17,552
- There were some
very, very early signs

1195
01:01:17,594 --> 01:01:20,221
of decomposition
that were identified

1196
01:01:20,263 --> 01:01:23,516
that would be more
consistent with the idea

1197
01:01:23,558 --> 01:01:26,936
of her being killed Tuesday
going into Wednesday.

1198
01:01:26,978 --> 01:01:29,105
- There was
no signs of torture.

1199
01:01:29,147 --> 01:01:30,607
There was no signs
of restraint.

1200
01:01:30,648 --> 01:01:33,318
No defensive wounds
that we could see.

1201
01:01:33,360 --> 01:01:35,403
The question now becomes,
all right,

1202
01:01:35,445 --> 01:01:37,489
where was she
being kept alive,

1203
01:01:37,530 --> 01:01:40,158
who did this,
how did he hang on to her?

1204
01:01:41,951 --> 01:01:45,372
[church bells ringing]

1205
01:01:48,458 --> 01:01:53,088
{\an8}- We wonder
what kind of monster

1206
01:01:53,129 --> 01:01:57,384
{\an8}could commit
such a horrible deed.

1207
01:01:57,425 --> 01:02:02,472
- Well over 2,000 people
showed up to her funeral.

1208
01:02:02,514 --> 01:02:05,183
- It was
standing room only.

1209
01:02:05,225 --> 01:02:07,310
There were so many
people there.

1210
01:02:07,352 --> 01:02:09,938
Because this had just
touched a community

1211
01:02:09,979 --> 01:02:12,315
like you can
only imagine.

1212
01:02:12,357 --> 01:02:14,442
- And it's just
so overwhelming.

1213
01:02:14,484 --> 01:02:17,153
And, and as a mom
you're trying to grieve

1214
01:02:17,195 --> 01:02:18,988
{\an8}for your little girl.

1215
01:02:19,030 --> 01:02:28,873
{\an8}**

1216
01:02:28,915 --> 01:02:30,333
{\an8}- Really the last
thing I remember

1217
01:02:30,375 --> 01:02:33,503
{\an8}is just the funeral.

1218
01:02:33,545 --> 01:02:36,297
{\an8}Not really
when they found her body.

1219
01:02:36,339 --> 01:02:38,466
{\an8}Just-- I just remember
the funeral.

1220
01:02:40,593 --> 01:02:44,180
At 5 years old
I didn't know what death was.

1221
01:02:44,222 --> 01:02:47,684
I was telling her,
Wake up, Sissy, wake up.

1222
01:02:47,726 --> 01:02:49,185
It's time to get up.

1223
01:02:52,022 --> 01:02:55,275
- To me, I just wanted
to take my baby and just run.

1224
01:02:55,316 --> 01:02:57,068
You know, I got my kids.

1225
01:02:57,110 --> 01:03:00,113
You know, it--
that little part of me

1226
01:03:00,155 --> 01:03:01,406
wanted to do that.

1227
01:03:07,203 --> 01:03:09,205
{\an8}I attended the funeral.

1228
01:03:09,247 --> 01:03:12,167
{\an8}It was to go to observe
the participants

1229
01:03:12,208 --> 01:03:13,668
{\an8}and see if anything
looked unusual,

1230
01:03:13,710 --> 01:03:15,754
{\an8}if anyone acted
inappropriately,

1231
01:03:15,795 --> 01:03:19,841
{\an8}if someone just looked
out of place.

1232
01:03:19,883 --> 01:03:22,552
- Sometimes a suspect will want
to go to the funeral

1233
01:03:22,594 --> 01:03:24,346
just to see
what's going on.

1234
01:03:24,387 --> 01:03:26,681
Of course the issue
with Amber's funeral

1235
01:03:26,723 --> 01:03:30,018
is there were
lots of people there.

1236
01:03:30,060 --> 01:03:32,395
This wasn't a family affair.

1237
01:03:32,437 --> 01:03:35,357
We put surveillance inside

1238
01:03:35,398 --> 01:03:37,692
and at the graveside
during the services,

1239
01:03:37,734 --> 01:03:40,737
and then we also had people
surveilling

1240
01:03:40,779 --> 01:03:43,698
the outer perimeter
around the area

1241
01:03:43,740 --> 01:03:45,658
to see if someone
was on the outskirts,

1242
01:03:45,700 --> 01:03:47,911
possibly observing
from a distance.

1243
01:03:49,954 --> 01:03:53,583
- We felt like we had to do
anything and everything

1244
01:03:53,625 --> 01:03:56,711
that could possibly
provide new information

1245
01:03:56,753 --> 01:03:58,838
and lead to the suspect
that killed Amber.

1246
01:04:09,557 --> 01:04:23,780
{\an8}**

1247
01:04:23,822 --> 01:04:27,117
{\an8}- My parents were,
with every newscast,

1248
01:04:27,158 --> 01:04:29,244
{\an8}asking for help,
putting out information

1249
01:04:29,285 --> 01:04:31,454
{\an8}to bring justice
to their daughter.

1250
01:04:38,461 --> 01:04:39,671
{\an8}- It makes me mad
because I don't know.

1251
01:04:39,713 --> 01:04:42,424
{\an8}I want to know.
I want to know now.

1252
01:04:42,465 --> 01:04:47,387
{\an8}- Donna had been on camera
with us for a while

1253
01:04:47,429 --> 01:04:50,306
but there was a change
in her demeanor

1254
01:04:50,348 --> 01:04:52,434
as the days wore on.

1255
01:04:52,475 --> 01:04:55,020
- I'm just slowly,
surely losing all my hope

1256
01:04:55,061 --> 01:04:56,604
that they're gonna
find him.

1257
01:05:02,527 --> 01:05:04,029
- We were hopeful
early on of course

1258
01:05:04,070 --> 01:05:05,155
that there were
more witnesses

1259
01:05:05,196 --> 01:05:06,781
and that people
would come forward.

1260
01:05:06,823 --> 01:05:08,450
And we've just been
tremendously frustrated

1261
01:05:08,491 --> 01:05:10,577
by that fact that this,
this abduction

1262
01:05:10,618 --> 01:05:12,454
occurred in broad daylight
on a very busy street

1263
01:05:12,495 --> 01:05:15,915
on a Saturday afternoon
and no one saw anything.

1264
01:05:15,957 --> 01:05:18,293
{\an8}- We would hold two briefings
daily for the press

1265
01:05:18,335 --> 01:05:20,003
{\an8}to keep the information
flowing.

1266
01:05:20,045 --> 01:05:21,171
{\an8}And there were
many times

1267
01:05:21,212 --> 01:05:22,464
{\an8}I didn't haven't
anything new to say

1268
01:05:22,505 --> 01:05:25,050
{\an8}but I went in there
and did it anyway.

1269
01:05:25,091 --> 01:05:27,552
- Okay, describe
the truck to me.

1270
01:05:27,594 --> 01:05:30,638
- We certainly felt like
we had to keep this,

1271
01:05:30,680 --> 01:05:33,475
this case, of all cases,
in the public eye.

1272
01:05:33,516 --> 01:05:35,393
We followed
thousands of leads.

1273
01:05:35,435 --> 01:05:36,936
Not just hundreds
but thousands.

1274
01:05:41,358 --> 01:05:44,361
- We've got a couple
of tips that, uh,

1275
01:05:44,402 --> 01:05:47,072
on vehicular traffic
and some people

1276
01:05:47,113 --> 01:05:49,366
that were seen
in the area.

1277
01:05:49,407 --> 01:05:52,243
- There were calls coming in
on a regular basis

1278
01:05:52,285 --> 01:05:53,495
of people that thought
they'd seen her,

1279
01:05:53,536 --> 01:05:55,663
thought they'd
seen the suspect.

1280
01:05:55,705 --> 01:05:57,499
{\an8}- Now those leads ranged
from everything

1281
01:05:57,540 --> 01:05:59,084
{\an8}from I saw a black pickup

1282
01:05:59,125 --> 01:06:03,254
{\an8}to specific suspects
that were named right away.

1283
01:06:03,296 --> 01:06:06,633
- There was a woman
that came forward

1284
01:06:06,675 --> 01:06:11,179
and said that she had seen
the entire abduction.

1285
01:06:11,221 --> 01:06:14,808
- The witness went so far
as to describe the Ford Splash

1286
01:06:14,849 --> 01:06:17,477
as well as a partial
license plate number

1287
01:06:17,519 --> 01:06:19,187
that she thought
she remembered.

1288
01:06:19,229 --> 01:06:21,356
And she saw Amber

1289
01:06:21,398 --> 01:06:24,401
in the passenger seat
of this truck,

1290
01:06:24,442 --> 01:06:26,528
and Amber was banging
on the back window

1291
01:06:32,992 --> 01:06:33,243
{\an8}**

1292
01:06:37,622 --> 01:06:40,458
{\an8}- We really hadn't had
any good leads

1293
01:06:40,500 --> 01:06:43,461
{\an8}and a woman came forward
though at that point

1294
01:06:43,503 --> 01:06:46,965
{\an8}and said she had
a partial license tag.

1295
01:06:47,007 --> 01:06:48,591
{\an8}- Because she gave a much more
specific description

1296
01:06:48,633 --> 01:06:49,926
{\an8}of the pickup truck,

1297
01:06:49,968 --> 01:06:52,595
{\an8}we developed a whole
investigative strategy

1298
01:06:52,637 --> 01:06:55,974
{\an8}that was kind of based
around what she said.

1299
01:06:56,016 --> 01:06:58,268
{\an8}- Everybody on
the task force is excited.

1300
01:06:58,309 --> 01:07:03,064
{\an8}We finally got the detail that
will lead us to the suspect.

1301
01:07:03,106 --> 01:07:04,774
{\an8}- At that point in time,
we had been working

1302
01:07:04,816 --> 01:07:06,818
{\an8}with the Ford
Motor Company,

1303
01:07:06,860 --> 01:07:10,030
{\an8}and they came up with a list
of potential trucks

1304
01:07:10,071 --> 01:07:12,741
{\an8}with a partial plate
that had been sold

1305
01:07:12,782 --> 01:07:14,617
{\an8}in this geographic area
that matched

1306
01:07:14,659 --> 01:07:18,580
{\an8}that general description
of that truck.

1307
01:07:18,621 --> 01:07:20,832
{\an8}- Detectives end up finding
a potential suspect,

1308
01:07:20,874 --> 01:07:22,667
{\an8}and he actually lives
in Arlington

1309
01:07:22,709 --> 01:07:24,377
{\an8}within the range

1310
01:07:24,419 --> 01:07:27,505
{\an8}of where the suspect
would have gone.

1311
01:07:27,547 --> 01:07:28,923
{\an8}- My hopes
were really up high

1312
01:07:28,965 --> 01:07:31,468
{\an8}and finally we're going
to get justice for Amber

1313
01:07:31,509 --> 01:07:33,011
{\an8}and we can
close this chapter

1314
01:07:33,053 --> 01:07:35,555
{\an8}and it's all
going to be done with.

1315
01:07:39,142 --> 01:07:44,230
- Now we think we've finally
got the break that we need.

1316
01:07:44,731 --> 01:07:46,399
The man cooperated

1317
01:07:46,441 --> 01:07:50,737
and let detectives
search his house

1318
01:07:50,779 --> 01:07:53,823
and there was nothing
whatsoever to indicate

1319
01:07:53,865 --> 01:07:55,575
that he was
a suspect in it.

1320
01:07:57,827 --> 01:08:00,747
After this happened,
the detectives went back

1321
01:08:00,789 --> 01:08:02,832
to contact the witness

1322
01:08:02,874 --> 01:08:05,126
and basically go over
the whole story

1323
01:08:05,168 --> 01:08:07,128
again with her.

1324
01:08:07,170 --> 01:08:09,923
And they started putting
two and two together,

1325
01:08:09,964 --> 01:08:11,675
and it just
wasn't adding up.

1326
01:08:11,716 --> 01:08:13,718
The information that
she was providing us

1327
01:08:13,760 --> 01:08:14,886
really wasn't matching

1328
01:08:14,928 --> 01:08:18,431
what we had been able
to corroborate.

1329
01:08:18,473 --> 01:08:20,392
We interviewed
her again,

1330
01:08:20,433 --> 01:08:22,310
and then she finally
admits to us

1331
01:08:22,352 --> 01:08:23,520
that she didn't
know anything

1332
01:08:23,561 --> 01:08:26,898
and she just made it up.

1333
01:08:26,940 --> 01:08:28,566
She made the story up

1334
01:08:28,608 --> 01:08:30,735
because she felt
so bad for Donna

1335
01:08:30,777 --> 01:08:32,946
and the lack of a break
in the case

1336
01:08:32,987 --> 01:08:35,281
that she just wanted
to do anything

1337
01:08:35,323 --> 01:08:36,908
that she could
to help her.

1338
01:08:36,950 --> 01:08:40,745
And I know how that sounds,
but for some reason,

1339
01:08:40,787 --> 01:08:43,540
this lady thought that this
would be helpful to Donna

1340
01:08:43,581 --> 01:08:45,917
and make Donna
more hopeful

1341
01:08:45,959 --> 01:08:48,336
that a suspect was
gonna be found.

1342
01:08:48,378 --> 01:08:51,756
- She thought that giving us
that type of information

1343
01:08:51,798 --> 01:08:55,802
might spur us on
some sort of renewed energy

1344
01:08:55,844 --> 01:08:57,220
into the investigation.

1345
01:08:57,262 --> 01:08:59,556
But instead what she did
was she cost us time

1346
01:08:59,597 --> 01:09:01,599
and she cost us
man-hours.

1347
01:09:01,641 --> 01:09:03,685
And quite frankly,
she pissed me off.

1348
01:09:06,730 --> 01:09:08,523
We had a lot of people

1349
01:09:08,565 --> 01:09:10,984
that would come up
with false information

1350
01:09:11,026 --> 01:09:14,112
just to bring Amber's
case back up.

1351
01:09:14,154 --> 01:09:17,198
It was very frustrating,
not just for me,

1352
01:09:17,240 --> 01:09:19,075
for the police
as well.

1353
01:09:19,117 --> 01:09:21,619
- Prosecuting her
for making a false statement

1354
01:09:21,661 --> 01:09:23,329
wasn't going to
help us any.

1355
01:09:23,371 --> 01:09:27,792
I wanted to keep everybody
focused on Amber.

1356
01:09:27,834 --> 01:09:30,128
{\an8}- We felt
very early on

1357
01:09:30,170 --> 01:09:31,629
{\an8}that it was
a stranger abduction.

1358
01:09:31,671 --> 01:09:33,465
{\an8}You know, every sign
pointed to that.

1359
01:09:33,506 --> 01:09:36,009
{\an8}We'd beg for someone to come
forward that knew anything.

1360
01:09:36,051 --> 01:09:37,886
{\an8}Just another tool
in the toolbox

1361
01:09:37,927 --> 01:09:41,222
{\an8}trying to use it
to get some help.

1362
01:09:41,264 --> 01:09:42,766
Everything that happened
along the way

1363
01:09:42,807 --> 01:09:44,893
was just a step-by-step
situation

1364
01:09:44,934 --> 01:09:48,521
where we were just
frustrated at every turn.

1365
01:09:48,563 --> 01:09:50,815
And it-it was tough.
It was very tough.

1366
01:09:53,651 --> 01:09:56,738
- A couple of weeks
after I buried Amber,

1367
01:09:56,780 --> 01:09:59,366
I just assumed, you know,
You're the police.

1368
01:09:59,407 --> 01:10:00,867
You're going
to solve this.

1369
01:10:00,909 --> 01:10:03,119
You're going to be able
to come and tell me

1370
01:10:03,161 --> 01:10:06,790
who murdered--
who butchered my little girl.

1371
01:10:06,831 --> 01:10:09,793
And there was
just no evidence.

1372
01:10:21,471 --> 01:10:22,597
- How do you feel
about the fact

1373
01:10:22,639 --> 01:10:24,849
that they haven't
found somebody?

1374
01:10:24,891 --> 01:10:27,727
- I'm frustrated.
Angry.

1375
01:10:27,769 --> 01:10:29,437
You know, why can't
they find this man?

1376
01:10:29,479 --> 01:10:32,816
How hard can this be,
you know?

1377
01:10:32,857 --> 01:10:34,275
'Course I was
frustrated, angry,

1378
01:10:34,317 --> 01:10:36,027
'cause they couldn't
find my little girl.

1379
01:10:36,069 --> 01:10:38,363
And, now I'm frustrated
and angry

1380
01:10:38,405 --> 01:10:42,200
'cause they can't find him
that did this to her.

1381
01:10:42,242 --> 01:10:47,205
- Donna became convinced
that whoever took Amber

1382
01:10:47,247 --> 01:10:52,168
had done something like this
or similar to this before.

1383
01:10:52,210 --> 01:10:56,089
And it just angered her
that they were still out there

1384
01:10:56,131 --> 01:11:01,094
and that they could
have done it again.

1385
01:11:01,136 --> 01:11:03,388
- From the moment
that Amber was abducted

1386
01:11:03,430 --> 01:11:06,433
and the anguish Donna
was going through,

1387
01:11:06,474 --> 01:11:08,018
over the course of time,

1388
01:11:08,059 --> 01:11:10,729
she turned that
into a drive,

1389
01:11:10,770 --> 01:11:13,148
a sense to make
a difference

1390
01:11:13,189 --> 01:11:15,150
and to give the police
greater tools.

1391
01:11:17,277 --> 01:11:21,448
{\an8}Not every family
that has an abducted child

1392
01:11:21,489 --> 01:11:24,951
{\an8}will then turn their energy
into advocacy.

1393
01:11:24,993 --> 01:11:27,954
Donna was going
to fight for Amber

1394
01:11:27,996 --> 01:11:29,956
and she was going
to make sure

1395
01:11:29,998 --> 01:11:34,461
that this would not happen
to any other child.

1396
01:11:34,502 --> 01:11:37,255
{\an8}- City council meetings
were all about Amber.

1397
01:11:37,297 --> 01:11:39,090
{\an8}You would have
hundreds of people

1398
01:11:39,132 --> 01:11:41,009
{\an8}going up there
wanting to talk.

1399
01:11:41,051 --> 01:11:44,262
School board meetings,
the same thing.

1400
01:11:44,304 --> 01:11:46,264
- There are 77 million
parents out there

1401
01:11:46,306 --> 01:11:48,725
who want their children
to be safe.

1402
01:11:48,767 --> 01:11:50,143
All we have to do
is organize.

1403
01:11:50,185 --> 01:11:51,895
All we have to do
is work together.

1404
01:11:51,936 --> 01:11:54,689
All we have to do
is send a message.

1405
01:11:54,731 --> 01:11:57,317
- Donna, her life
is open to the public,

1406
01:11:57,359 --> 01:12:00,111
period, at this point,
because of what happened.

1407
01:12:12,665 --> 01:12:15,043
The important thing

1408
01:12:15,085 --> 01:12:16,836
as we followed
this path

1409
01:12:16,878 --> 01:12:18,463
that really had been
set out for us

1410
01:12:18,505 --> 01:12:22,801
was that we tell what
it was really like

1411
01:12:22,842 --> 01:12:25,887
to live through
something like this.

1412
01:12:25,929 --> 01:12:27,305
It's usually very personal

1413
01:12:27,347 --> 01:12:30,266
but Donna was willing
to share that with everybody.

1414
01:12:39,192 --> 01:12:41,111
- This is
Donna Whitson.

1415
01:12:53,206 --> 01:12:55,250
- When Amber
was abducted,

1416
01:12:55,291 --> 01:12:58,003
I was still going
to medical school

1417
01:12:58,044 --> 01:13:00,046
so I took a leave
of absence.

1418
01:13:04,592 --> 01:13:06,928
I had to finish for her.

1419
01:13:06,970 --> 01:13:10,265
And I did.

1420
01:13:10,306 --> 01:13:13,059
- You see her going
from devastating grief

1421
01:13:13,101 --> 01:13:16,604
of losing that child
and dealing with that reality

1422
01:13:16,646 --> 01:13:18,398
to the other end
of the spectrum

1423
01:13:18,440 --> 01:13:21,985
and was able to
continue on for Amber.

1424
01:13:27,115 --> 01:13:29,117
Why is it taking so long?

1425
01:13:29,159 --> 01:13:31,202
It shouldn't take that long,
you know?

1426
01:13:31,244 --> 01:13:33,413
Why can't you find
this black truck?

1427
01:13:33,455 --> 01:13:35,290
Why can't you find
this monster?

1428
01:13:55,143 --> 01:13:56,936
- The whole room
was just packed full

1429
01:13:56,978 --> 01:13:59,606
of all this stuff
about Amber's case.

1430
01:13:59,647 --> 01:14:02,609
And it was like, wow,
this is overwhelming.

1431
01:14:12,327 --> 01:14:14,412
- When Amber was taken
a lot of people said

1432
01:14:14,454 --> 01:14:16,581
if we could have just
gotten the word out

1433
01:14:16,623 --> 01:14:18,249
there would probably be
a better chance

1434
01:14:18,291 --> 01:14:20,377
that she could have
been found.

1435
01:14:20,418 --> 01:14:24,589
- It is the desperate search
for this little 9 year old

1436
01:14:24,631 --> 01:14:26,424
and time
is of the essence.

1437
01:14:26,466 --> 01:14:30,136
And so, tell everybody in
the community this has happened,

1438
01:14:30,178 --> 01:14:33,098
give them information,
the photographs, the video,

1439
01:14:33,139 --> 01:14:35,767
here's the suspect vehicle

1440
01:14:35,809 --> 01:14:41,356
and then really engage to get
everybody to help search.

1441
01:14:41,398 --> 01:14:43,942
- I think that was in
a lot of peoples' minds

1442
01:14:43,983 --> 01:14:46,820
is, Can we do this?
How can we do this,

1443
01:14:46,861 --> 01:14:50,281
and how can we put that
into action?

1444
01:14:50,323 --> 01:14:53,201
Diana Simone was one of those
people who could see that

1445
01:14:53,243 --> 01:14:55,912
that was a good
possibility.

1446
01:14:55,954 --> 01:14:57,122
{\an8}I am Diana Simone,

1447
01:14:57,163 --> 01:15:00,291
{\an8}and I am resident
of Fort Worth, Texas.

1448
01:15:00,333 --> 01:15:02,544
I rarely, if ever,
watched the news.

1449
01:15:02,585 --> 01:15:06,631
But the TV was on,
and as I passed by it,

1450
01:15:06,673 --> 01:15:11,011
I noticed what appeared to be
somebody's home video was on.

1451
01:15:11,052 --> 01:15:13,138
There's such a different
emotional reaction

1452
01:15:13,179 --> 01:15:15,432
when you see a child
opening presents

1453
01:15:15,473 --> 01:15:18,393
and riding a bike
and waving and smiling

1454
01:15:18,435 --> 01:15:21,146
than you do
just a flat picture.

1455
01:15:21,187 --> 01:15:24,649
This child becomes
very real to you.

1456
01:15:24,691 --> 01:15:28,319
Then to hear this horrifying
situation had taken place,

1457
01:15:28,361 --> 01:15:29,362
you just immediately think

1458
01:15:29,404 --> 01:15:31,239
what her mother
must be feeling.

1459
01:15:35,618 --> 01:15:38,830
In Amber's case,
she was taken around 4:00.

1460
01:15:38,872 --> 01:15:40,457
It was 6:00 or 6:30
when I saw it.

1461
01:15:40,498 --> 01:15:43,168
So two and half hours
had already passed

1462
01:15:43,209 --> 01:15:46,254
before the public became aware
of what was going on.

1463
01:15:46,296 --> 01:15:48,548
I called the radio station
and I said,

1464
01:15:48,590 --> 01:15:50,425
""I'm calling about
the Amber Hagerman case.""

1465
01:15:50,467 --> 01:15:52,844
And she said,
""Do you have any information?""

1466
01:15:52,886 --> 01:15:55,388
And I said, ""No, I don't,
but I do have an idea.""

1467
01:15:58,350 --> 01:15:59,893
- So often when children
were being taken

1468
01:15:59,934 --> 01:16:02,354
it was by a suspect
in a vehicle,

1469
01:16:02,395 --> 01:16:04,689
put the child in a vehicle,
they drive off.

1470
01:16:04,731 --> 01:16:06,858
{\an8}So wouldn't it be great
if there was a way

1471
01:16:06,900 --> 01:16:08,735
{\an8}to let everybody
know about it,

1472
01:16:08,777 --> 01:16:11,780
{\an8}so that they could be your
eyes and ears on the street

1473
01:16:11,821 --> 01:16:13,323
{\an8}looking for that
suspect vehicle.

1474
01:16:13,365 --> 01:16:17,702
Looking for that suspect.
Looking for that child.

1475
01:16:17,744 --> 01:16:20,747
Arlington Police and this group
of radio station managers

1476
01:16:20,789 --> 01:16:24,125
ended up getting together,
and formulating this plan

1477
01:16:24,167 --> 01:16:26,002
for this
emergency broadcast alert

1478
01:16:26,044 --> 01:16:27,504
that they would put out.

1479
01:16:27,545 --> 01:16:29,631
And it would have a loud,
obnoxious sound.

1480
01:16:29,673 --> 01:16:32,300
It was gonna go out
on the radio stations

1481
01:16:32,342 --> 01:16:35,220
and would alert people that
there'd been a child abduction,

1482
01:16:35,261 --> 01:16:37,889
give them information
like where did it happen,

1483
01:16:37,931 --> 01:16:39,224
what does the suspect
look like,

1484
01:16:39,265 --> 01:16:41,559
what is the suspect driving.

1485
01:16:41,601 --> 01:16:43,103
{\an8}- It's so simple,
it's brilliant,

1486
01:16:43,144 --> 01:16:44,729
{\an8}because the whole idea
is to be able

1487
01:16:44,771 --> 01:16:47,774
{\an8}to get out to the public
information that they can use

1488
01:16:47,816 --> 01:16:51,152
{\an8}to provide us
with actionable intelligence.

1489
01:16:51,194 --> 01:16:52,362
{\an8}A description of suspect.

1490
01:16:52,404 --> 01:16:54,906
{\an8}Description of vehicle.
License plate.

1491
01:16:54,948 --> 01:16:57,701
{\an8}Something that
they could work with.

1492
01:16:57,742 --> 01:16:59,452
{\an8}- It's a real partnership.
It's a partnership

1493
01:16:59,494 --> 01:17:01,996
{\an8}between law enforcement
and broadcasters

1494
01:17:02,038 --> 01:17:05,083
{\an8}to work together
when time is critical

1495
01:17:05,125 --> 01:17:06,668
{\an8}on a serious
child abduction case.

1496
01:17:09,170 --> 01:17:10,964
- Today we're unveiling
the Amber Plan.

1497
01:17:11,006 --> 01:17:13,842
[applause]

1498
01:17:13,883 --> 01:17:18,096
- I encourage all radio stations
to participate in this

1499
01:17:18,138 --> 01:17:20,223
because it is
a great idea

1500
01:17:20,265 --> 01:17:22,517
and it will get information out
that we need

1501
01:17:22,559 --> 01:17:26,229
to get a little girl
or a little boy home.

1502
01:17:26,271 --> 01:17:28,481
{\an8}- Some staggering
percentage of people

1503
01:17:28,523 --> 01:17:30,608
{\an8}had their radio on
when they were in the car.

1504
01:17:30,650 --> 01:17:31,860
{\an8}And so we thought
if we could get it across

1505
01:17:31,901 --> 01:17:34,112
{\an8}all the radio stations
in Dallas-Fort Worth,

1506
01:17:34,154 --> 01:17:37,365
just think how many eyes we'd
have out looking for the kids.

1507
01:17:37,407 --> 01:17:38,450
And so it just worked
like a charm

1508
01:17:38,491 --> 01:17:40,577
as far as getting people
to say, Yes.

1509
01:17:40,618 --> 01:17:42,829
And then Rae-Leigh Bradbury
comes along.

1510
01:17:48,376 --> 01:17:50,795
{\an8}- We got a call that
there was a missing baby

1511
01:17:50,837 --> 01:17:53,131
{\an8}by the name
of Rae-Leigh.

1512
01:17:53,173 --> 01:17:57,052
{\an8}- We were living in Arlington
throughout my whole pregnancy.

1513
01:17:57,093 --> 01:17:58,636
{\an8}I knew everybody.

1514
01:17:58,678 --> 01:18:00,096
{\an8}I loved everybody.

1515
01:18:00,138 --> 01:18:02,349
{\an8}And I had this little lady,
she's as cute as could be.

1516
01:18:02,390 --> 01:18:04,809
Her name was
Sandra Fallis.

1517
01:18:04,851 --> 01:18:06,936
I thought of her
as a friend.

1518
01:18:06,978 --> 01:18:08,313
And I trusted her.

1519
01:18:08,355 --> 01:18:11,274
So that's why I felt like
that it was a good choice

1520
01:18:11,316 --> 01:18:16,488
that I let her
become my babysitter.

1521
01:18:16,529 --> 01:18:20,241
- I drop her off that morning
in a little onesie nighty.

1522
01:18:20,283 --> 01:18:22,660
And then
her diaper bag full.

1523
01:18:22,702 --> 01:18:27,123
And then just
do a normal 8-hour workday.

1524
01:18:27,165 --> 01:18:29,501
- And then when evening
came time

1525
01:18:29,542 --> 01:18:31,294
and the babysitter was
supposed to show up with her,

1526
01:18:31,336 --> 01:18:32,587
she-- they didn't show up.

1527
01:18:36,591 --> 01:18:37,801
- I didn't think
she was kidnapped.

1528
01:18:37,842 --> 01:18:39,803
That's not a word
that I would even associate.

1529
01:18:42,555 --> 01:18:45,266
No local hospitals
had heard of any wrecks

1530
01:18:45,308 --> 01:18:46,935
or anything like that.

1531
01:18:46,976 --> 01:18:49,896
And then finally I just
decided to call 9-1-1.

1532
01:18:49,938 --> 01:18:54,609
I'm like, ""My babysitter
hasn't brought my baby home.""

1533
01:18:54,651 --> 01:18:56,611
Basically a policeman
came up

1534
01:18:56,653 --> 01:18:59,489
and he was like taking
the report and stuff.

1535
01:18:59,531 --> 01:19:00,907
- And we started
talking about,

1536
01:19:00,949 --> 01:19:02,659
""Well is this, is this the time
we should do this?""

1537
01:19:02,701 --> 01:19:04,494
We felt like, Okay, you know,
something's got to happen.

1538
01:19:04,536 --> 01:19:07,122
We've got to get
this baby back.

1539
01:19:07,163 --> 01:19:08,623
I remember calling
the police chief,

1540
01:19:08,665 --> 01:19:10,375
I'm getting ready
to do this.

1541
01:19:10,417 --> 01:19:11,793
- They were like,
""We're going to use this thing

1542
01:19:11,835 --> 01:19:13,003
called the Amber Alert.""

1543
01:19:17,757 --> 01:19:19,884
- This is an activation
of the Amber Alert system

1544
01:19:19,926 --> 01:19:23,096
at the request of
the Arlington Police Department.

1545
01:19:23,138 --> 01:19:24,973
Arlington Police
say a child,

1546
01:19:25,015 --> 01:19:28,393
a 2-month-old white female baby
has been kidnapped.

1547
01:19:28,435 --> 01:19:31,146
The baby's name is
Rae-Leigh Ann Bradbury.

1548
01:19:31,187 --> 01:19:34,065
Police believe the victim was
abducted by her babysitter,

1549
01:19:34,107 --> 01:19:36,192
Sandra Joyce Fallis,
a white female,

1550
01:19:36,234 --> 01:19:39,863
42 years of age,
5'3"", 135 pounds,

1551
01:19:39,904 --> 01:19:42,699
with black hair, brown eyes
and driving a turquoise

1552
01:19:42,741 --> 01:19:46,369
1993 Ford Ranger Splash
pickup truck.

1553
01:19:46,411 --> 01:19:48,079
- It literally
was like 30 minutes.

1554
01:19:59,007 --> 01:20:13,563
**

1555
01:20:18,651 --> 01:20:20,070
- Guy driving down the highway
next to her,

1556
01:20:20,111 --> 01:20:21,488
{\an8}looking in the vehicle,

1557
01:20:21,529 --> 01:20:23,907
{\an8}""I see the baby sitting
on the front seat!

1558
01:20:23,948 --> 01:20:25,075
{\an8}""In her car seat.""

1559
01:20:27,577 --> 01:20:29,454
- So we got a patrol officer
out there.

1560
01:20:29,496 --> 01:20:30,955
Pulled her over,
got the baby.

1561
01:20:38,630 --> 01:20:41,966
{\an8}- I was in the car driving home
and I was elated.

1562
01:20:42,008 --> 01:20:44,678
{\an8}I was absolutely elated.

1563
01:20:44,719 --> 01:20:47,722
{\an8}I mean there were just,
there are no words, you know.

1564
01:20:47,764 --> 01:20:50,517
{\an8}Because you're just like,
""Oh, my God, it's working.

1565
01:20:50,558 --> 01:20:52,769
{\an8}""It's absolutely working.""

1566
01:20:52,811 --> 01:20:54,354
{\an8}- When I was finally able
to hold her,

1567
01:20:54,396 --> 01:20:55,814
{\an8}it was a relief.

1568
01:20:55,855 --> 01:20:59,818
{\an8}It was just
an overwhelming relief.

1569
01:20:59,859 --> 01:21:01,611
{\an8}I didn't want
to let her go.

1570
01:21:01,653 --> 01:21:04,823
{\an8}I was not going
to let her go.

1571
01:21:04,864 --> 01:21:06,408
{\an8}- It couldn't have happened
any better.

1572
01:21:06,449 --> 01:21:08,451
{\an8}So yeah,
a happy ending

1573
01:21:08,493 --> 01:21:12,747
{\an8}to a thing rooted
in a terrible tragedy.

1574
01:21:12,789 --> 01:21:14,666
{\an8}- That was awesome.
Me and my mom,

1575
01:21:14,708 --> 01:21:17,377
{\an8}we just kinda looked up
in heaven and said,

1576
01:21:17,419 --> 01:21:18,962
{\an8}""You did it, girl.""

1577
01:21:20,505 --> 01:21:21,548
{\an8}I've said how much

1578
01:21:21,589 --> 01:21:23,633
{\an8}Amber Hagerman
has meant to me.

1579
01:21:23,675 --> 01:21:25,593
{\an8}And it's true
to this day,

1580
01:21:25,635 --> 01:21:27,303
{\an8}I wouldn't be here
without her.

1581
01:21:27,345 --> 01:21:30,056
{\an8}I used to call her
my guardian angel.

1582
01:21:30,098 --> 01:21:32,767
{\an8}I used to pray to her,
just like little prayers

1583
01:21:32,809 --> 01:21:34,477
{\an8}like, ""Thank you
for this day"",

1584
01:21:34,519 --> 01:21:37,355
{\an8}like, ""Thanks for
watching over me.""

1585
01:21:37,397 --> 01:21:38,773
{\an8}- Every time I hear
a Amber Alert,

1586
01:21:38,815 --> 01:21:41,609
{\an8}I say to myself,
""It's time to go to work, Sis.

1587
01:21:41,651 --> 01:21:43,486
{\an8}""Do your thing.""

1588
01:21:43,528 --> 01:21:44,696
{\an8}I just wish that

1589
01:21:44,738 --> 01:21:48,283
{\an8}Amber had something
in place at the time.

1590
01:21:48,324 --> 01:21:49,826
{\an8}It's bittersweet.

1591
01:21:49,868 --> 01:21:53,204
{\an8}What if we had a Amber Alert
when Amber was missing?

1592
01:21:53,246 --> 01:21:55,081
{\an8}Could it have
saved her life?

1593
01:21:58,626 --> 01:22:00,962
{\an8}- Once other areas
across the country

1594
01:22:01,004 --> 01:22:04,507
{\an8}heard about the program,
they said,

1595
01:22:04,549 --> 01:22:07,385
{\an8}""We're going to set one up
in our town.""

1596
01:22:07,427 --> 01:22:11,639
{\an8}- Within weeks of us
activating Amber,

1597
01:22:11,681 --> 01:22:13,183
I was receiving calls

1598
01:22:13,224 --> 01:22:16,770
and other people were receiving
calls from around Texas

1599
01:22:16,811 --> 01:22:19,647
and from around
the United States on,

1600
01:22:19,689 --> 01:22:21,608
""Okay, how do you
do this?""

1601
01:22:21,649 --> 01:22:23,651
I would walk them
through the process

1602
01:22:23,693 --> 01:22:26,071
that we went through
in developing

1603
01:22:26,112 --> 01:22:29,699
the relationships
with their radio stations,

1604
01:22:29,741 --> 01:22:32,327
and actually putting it
in place

1605
01:22:32,369 --> 01:22:35,080
and getting it up
and running.

1606
01:22:35,121 --> 01:22:37,040
We have a critical time

1607
01:22:37,082 --> 01:22:38,792
that we have to
get this information out

1608
01:22:38,833 --> 01:22:41,503
to galvanize the community,

1609
01:22:41,544 --> 01:22:45,340
to get their ears and eyes
looking everywhere

1610
01:22:45,382 --> 01:22:47,926
for the child,
for the vehicle.

1611
01:22:47,967 --> 01:22:51,179
It was exciting to see
the programs popping up

1612
01:22:51,221 --> 01:22:52,555
around the country,

1613
01:22:52,597 --> 01:22:54,891
and it was
in 2000

1614
01:22:54,933 --> 01:22:57,852
that the National Center for
Missing and Exploited Children

1615
01:22:57,894 --> 01:23:02,065
said, ""You know what,
we should take this national.""

1616
01:23:02,107 --> 01:23:04,693
- And then to just see it
just explode.

1617
01:23:04,734 --> 01:23:08,071
It just becomes this
phenomenon and it works.

1618
01:23:13,576 --> 01:23:14,703
{\an8}Ladies and Gentlemen,

1619
01:23:14,744 --> 01:23:17,706
{\an8}the President
of the United States.

1620
01:23:17,747 --> 01:23:19,374
{\an8}- President Bush
signed on

1621
01:23:19,416 --> 01:23:22,002
{\an8}and said, you know,
""I support this.""

1622
01:23:22,043 --> 01:23:27,674
{\an8}And he designated a National
Amber Alert Coordinator

1623
01:23:27,716 --> 01:23:31,177
{\an8}at the Department
of Justice.

1624
01:23:31,219 --> 01:23:35,223
{\an8}- Amber Hagerman,
whose mom is with us today,

1625
01:23:35,265 --> 01:23:36,933
{\an8}a good Texan
I might add...

1626
01:23:36,975 --> 01:23:41,521
{\an8}[applause]

1627
01:23:41,563 --> 01:23:42,897
{\an8}Was 9 years old

1628
01:23:42,939 --> 01:23:45,942
{\an8}when she was taken away
from her parents.

1629
01:23:45,984 --> 01:23:49,237
{\an8}We are acting today
in her memory

1630
01:23:49,279 --> 01:23:51,614
{\an8}and in the memory of so many
other girls and boys

1631
01:23:51,656 --> 01:23:53,241
{\an8}who lost their lives
and innocence

1632
01:23:53,283 --> 01:23:55,118
{\an8}in acts of cruelty.

1633
01:23:55,160 --> 01:23:56,578
{\an8}And now it is my honor

1634
01:23:56,619 --> 01:24:01,583
{\an8}to sign the Protect Act
of 2003.

1635
01:24:01,624 --> 01:24:04,210
{\an8}- That was sort of
the crowning moment,

1636
01:24:04,252 --> 01:24:05,503
{\an8}and I get chills,

1637
01:24:05,545 --> 01:24:09,674
{\an8}because everybody's work
had paid off.

1638
01:24:09,716 --> 01:24:14,429
{\an8}[applause]

1639
01:24:14,471 --> 01:24:17,057
{\an8}- It was nerve-wracking,
but I was still really proud

1640
01:24:17,098 --> 01:24:20,727
{\an8}because the President is
talking about my little girl.

1641
01:24:20,769 --> 01:24:22,062
{\an8}And I was able
to talk to him

1642
01:24:22,103 --> 01:24:24,064
about my little girl
and what happened to her.

1643
01:24:27,984 --> 01:24:30,987
Donna really evolved.

1644
01:24:31,029 --> 01:24:33,615
She turned her grief
and anger

1645
01:24:33,656 --> 01:24:36,785
into advocacy.

1646
01:24:36,826 --> 01:24:40,288
She's been a champion
of the Amber Alert program

1647
01:24:40,330 --> 01:24:42,123
the entire time

1648
01:24:42,165 --> 01:24:44,292
and she knows that,

1649
01:24:44,334 --> 01:24:46,670
you know, this is
her daughter's legacy.

1650
01:24:55,553 --> 01:24:57,514
- Tragedy struck
this community

1651
01:24:57,555 --> 01:25:01,142
{\an8}January 13, 1996.

1652
01:25:01,184 --> 01:25:03,728
{\an8}Our resolve
to solve this case

1653
01:25:03,770 --> 01:25:06,981
{\an8}has not wavered.

1654
01:25:07,023 --> 01:25:09,984
{\an8}- Anytime there's an anniversary
of her abduction and murder,

1655
01:25:10,026 --> 01:25:13,697
{\an8}and there's a press conference
or a memorial,

1656
01:25:13,738 --> 01:25:16,116
{\an8}we have a bunch
of community members

1657
01:25:16,157 --> 01:25:19,494
{\an8}come out in support
of the family.

1658
01:25:19,536 --> 01:25:21,121
- This case
is personal to me

1659
01:25:21,162 --> 01:25:23,039
because I've been
involved in some aspect

1660
01:25:23,081 --> 01:25:25,917
since the day
that Amber was abducted.

1661
01:25:25,959 --> 01:25:28,795
In 2010, I became
the lead detective.

1662
01:25:28,837 --> 01:25:31,840
And I had the case
from then until 2018

1663
01:25:31,881 --> 01:25:33,717
when I promoted
to Sergeant.

1664
01:25:33,758 --> 01:25:35,885
At that time
Detective Grant Gildon

1665
01:25:35,927 --> 01:25:37,929
{\an8}took over
as the lead detective.

1666
01:25:37,971 --> 01:25:40,765
{\an8}- Actually, I was a sophomore
in high school

1667
01:25:40,807 --> 01:25:42,684
{\an8}when, when this case
happened.

1668
01:25:42,726 --> 01:25:44,227
{\an8}And I remember hearing
of the Amber Alert

1669
01:25:44,269 --> 01:25:46,062
{\an8}and that it was named
after a young girl

1670
01:25:46,104 --> 01:25:48,690
{\an8}that was kidnapped
and murdered.

1671
01:25:48,732 --> 01:25:51,693
It wasn't until
I was applying

1672
01:25:51,735 --> 01:25:53,570
with the Arlington
Police Department

1673
01:25:53,611 --> 01:25:55,613
that I became
aware that

1674
01:25:55,655 --> 01:25:58,700
the case originated
in Arlington, Texas.

1675
01:25:58,742 --> 01:26:00,702
I saw just how
passionate they were

1676
01:26:00,744 --> 01:26:02,871
about trying to solve
Amber's case.

1677
01:26:02,912 --> 01:26:05,206
Then it,
it really struck me that

1678
01:26:05,248 --> 01:26:08,043
that was something I wanted
to help contribute to.

1679
01:26:08,084 --> 01:26:10,211
The figure we gave
of 5,500.

1680
01:26:10,253 --> 01:26:13,548
That's the number of leads
the Amber Hagerman Task Force

1681
01:26:13,590 --> 01:26:16,551
investigated between
February of '96

1682
01:26:16,593 --> 01:26:18,178
and June of '97.

1683
01:26:18,219 --> 01:26:22,891
Current to date,
we've investigated over 7,000.

1684
01:26:22,932 --> 01:26:26,061
{\an8}- The 25th year anniversary
is just another year with,

1685
01:26:26,102 --> 01:26:29,564
{\an8}with no answers, no justice,
and we want that to change.

1686
01:26:29,606 --> 01:26:31,941
{\an8}We want justice.
That's our goal.

1687
01:26:31,983 --> 01:26:35,236
{\an8}That's-that's what we need.
Our family needs closure.

1688
01:26:35,278 --> 01:26:38,990
- One of the major, um,
issues with a case

1689
01:26:39,032 --> 01:26:41,910
that is a long-term case
like this

1690
01:26:41,951 --> 01:26:44,704
is that, you know,
people forget about it.

1691
01:26:44,746 --> 01:26:48,124
But Amber's killer
is out there somewhere.

1692
01:26:48,166 --> 01:27:03,264
**

1693
01:27:06,017 --> 01:27:09,562
- After 25 years, of course it
gets frustrating at times

1694
01:27:09,604 --> 01:27:11,690
because we want
to solve the case

1695
01:27:11,731 --> 01:27:15,110
and we want answers
for Amber's family.

1696
01:27:15,151 --> 01:27:18,321
But as homicide
detectives

1697
01:27:18,363 --> 01:27:20,990
we never let
that frustration get to us

1698
01:27:21,032 --> 01:27:23,493
to the point
of quitting.

1699
01:27:23,535 --> 01:27:27,789
{\an8}- Recently, there was
some new technology

1700
01:27:27,831 --> 01:27:29,332
{\an8}that I became aware of

1701
01:27:29,374 --> 01:27:33,920
{\an8}that we thought was relevant
to some of the evidence

1702
01:27:33,962 --> 01:27:36,840
{\an8}that we've maintained
in this case.

1703
01:27:36,881 --> 01:27:40,093
We've started to discuss
the possibility

1704
01:27:40,135 --> 01:27:42,345
of testing some
of the evidence we have

1705
01:27:42,387 --> 01:27:46,599
that we hope can
produce DNA in this case.

1706
01:27:46,641 --> 01:27:47,851
With Amber,

1707
01:27:47,892 --> 01:27:52,022
there is just not much
trace evidence at all.

1708
01:27:52,063 --> 01:27:53,606
- The main question
when determining

1709
01:27:53,648 --> 01:27:54,816
what evidence to test

1710
01:27:54,858 --> 01:27:57,235
and what kind
of testing to do

1711
01:27:57,277 --> 01:28:00,739
is thinking about the quantity
of the evidence

1712
01:28:00,780 --> 01:28:02,824
and whether or not
you're going to use up

1713
01:28:02,866 --> 01:28:06,745
or consume
all of the potential DNA

1714
01:28:06,786 --> 01:28:08,705
while doing the testing.

1715
01:28:08,747 --> 01:28:11,875
- Is it worth the risk
of destroying all the evidence

1716
01:28:11,916 --> 01:28:14,127
in the testing process?

1717
01:28:14,169 --> 01:28:19,132
Or is it something we should
wait a few months to test

1718
01:28:19,174 --> 01:28:21,843
because of the advancements
in the technology

1719
01:28:21,885 --> 01:28:25,096
that are taking place
very rapidly?

1720
01:28:25,138 --> 01:28:29,434
- The motivating factor for me
is thinking of Amber's mother

1721
01:28:29,476 --> 01:28:34,314
and also Amber's brother and-
and how he has grown up

1722
01:28:34,356 --> 01:28:38,234
and just wanting answers
from that day.

1723
01:28:38,276 --> 01:28:41,196
I believe that the person
who kidnapped

1724
01:28:41,237 --> 01:28:44,366
and murdered Amber Hagerman
is still alive.

1725
01:28:44,407 --> 01:28:46,910
If we continue
to work this case,

1726
01:28:46,951 --> 01:28:49,454
we will be able
to bring them to justice.

1727
01:28:49,496 --> 01:28:52,207
I also believe there are
people out there

1728
01:28:52,248 --> 01:28:55,001
who know the details
about what happened.

1729
01:28:55,043 --> 01:28:56,878
That's why continue
to take every lead

1730
01:28:56,920 --> 01:28:59,881
and investigate it
as thoroughly as possible

1731
01:28:59,923 --> 01:29:02,217
in hopes that
one of these leads

1732
01:29:02,258 --> 01:29:05,261
will eventually
lead us to the killer.

1733
01:29:14,979 --> 01:29:16,690
Hold me up, Daddy.

1734
01:29:16,731 --> 01:29:19,067
Here we go.

1735
01:29:19,109 --> 01:29:21,277
Aw, don't cry.

1736
01:29:21,319 --> 01:29:22,904
Aw.

1737
01:29:22,946 --> 01:29:27,075
Hi baby, hello.

1738
01:29:27,117 --> 01:29:31,079
- This is my daughter
little Gracie Rene Hagerman.

1739
01:29:31,121 --> 01:29:34,624
So we gave her Amber's
middle name, Rene.

1740
01:29:34,666 --> 01:29:39,087
She was actually born
on the same day as Amber,

1741
01:29:39,129 --> 01:29:42,590
November 25th,
and in the same hour.

1742
01:29:46,803 --> 01:29:48,263
My son is happy.

1743
01:29:48,304 --> 01:29:49,973
I want to cry every time
I see my son

1744
01:29:50,015 --> 01:29:51,933
because he is so happy.

1745
01:29:51,975 --> 01:29:54,185
He is in a good place now.

1746
01:29:54,227 --> 01:30:00,567
Makes my heart good
to see him happy.

1747
01:30:01,151 --> 01:30:03,194
So life is okay now.

1748
01:30:09,784 --> 01:30:12,287
- Oh, my gosh.
How are you doing?

1749
01:30:16,750 --> 01:30:17,625
- It's so good
to see you.

1750
01:30:17,667 --> 01:30:19,961
- It's good
to see you, too.

1751
01:30:20,003 --> 01:30:21,504
There was a little bit
of nervousness

1752
01:30:21,546 --> 01:30:24,799
about how she would feel
and I would feel

1753
01:30:24,841 --> 01:30:27,677
after so long a time.

1754
01:30:27,719 --> 01:30:30,805
But when I saw her
it was one of those situations

1755
01:30:30,847 --> 01:30:34,351
where you felt like no time
had passed away at all.

1756
01:30:37,520 --> 01:30:39,564
It's such an honor
to have been a part

1757
01:30:39,606 --> 01:30:43,360
of what happened
and where we are today.

1758
01:30:43,401 --> 01:30:48,031
And I know that
Donna wants to continue

1759
01:30:48,073 --> 01:30:51,368
to look at that
every time a child is saved,

1760
01:30:51,409 --> 01:30:53,495
that that makes
a difference to her.

1761
01:30:53,536 --> 01:30:55,455
And it makes
a difference to me, too.

1762
01:30:59,542 --> 01:31:02,420
- The main reason why I'm doing
this documentary today

1763
01:31:02,462 --> 01:31:04,172
is to kind of
let people know

1764
01:31:04,214 --> 01:31:06,549
what kind of
little girl Amber was.

1765
01:31:06,591 --> 01:31:09,177
She's always helping
other little children

1766
01:31:09,219 --> 01:31:12,180
and, and taking care
of children.

1767
01:31:12,222 --> 01:31:14,474
And she always took care
of her little brother.

1768
01:31:14,516 --> 01:31:17,435
So this is just another way
for her to do that.

1769
01:31:17,477 --> 01:31:19,813
She's still doing
what she loved.

1770
01:31:23,233 --> 01:31:26,695
She was not just a victim.
She was my daughter.

1771
01:31:26,736 --> 01:31:29,948
She was somebody.
She is somebody still today.

1772
01:31:29,989 --> 01:31:45,255

What happens when
12 strangers chasing fame

61
00:03:08,927 --> 00:03:11,234
quarantine together
during a pandemic?

62
00:03:12,453 --> 00:03:15,238
I'm your host, Paris Hilton,
and I'm so excited to present

63
00:03:15,369 --> 00:03:18,633
""Trap Stars,"" the hottest
new show on television.

64
00:03:18,763 --> 00:03:19,982
What's up, Trap Stars?

65
00:03:22,114 --> 00:03:23,464
Welcome to the Trap House.

66
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:27,816
There's only one rule
at the Trap House,

67
00:03:27,946 --> 00:03:31,950
Trap Stars must isolate and
can't leave the mansion.

68
00:03:32,081 --> 00:03:33,909
Sounds simple enough, right?

69
00:03:34,039 --> 00:03:35,476
I mean, there's worse places

70
00:03:35,606 --> 00:03:37,086
to be quarantining, you know?

71
00:03:37,217 --> 00:03:40,611
I'm used to going
out and partying and doing

72
00:03:40,742 --> 00:03:42,918
all that fun shit, and
I just really hate being

73
00:03:43,048 --> 00:03:44,093
stuck in the house.

74
00:03:45,790 --> 00:03:47,750
I'm just having fun,
I'm here to do my...

75
00:04:01,937 --> 00:04:03,199
Fuck you.

76
00:04:07,551 --> 00:04:08,639
Bitch.

77
00:04:45,154 --> 00:04:46,547
Hey, I'm Lauren.

78
00:04:46,677 --> 00:04:47,983
Mind if I take this off?

79
00:04:49,898 --> 00:04:51,508
Yeah, you're good.

80
00:04:52,988 --> 00:04:54,555
Come on inside.

81
00:05:02,214 --> 00:05:04,149
You know, I don't
usually do this dating app

82
00:05:04,173 --> 00:05:07,002
thing and go over to
random guys' houses.

83
00:05:07,132 --> 00:05:08,786
You're not nervous, are you?

84
00:05:08,917 --> 00:05:10,179
Nervous?

85
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:11,310
Nervous, yes.

86
00:05:16,838 --> 00:05:22,147
♪ La-la, la-la.

87
00:05:22,278 --> 00:05:27,805
♪ La-la, la-la.

88
00:05:27,936 --> 00:05:33,420
♪ La-la, la-la...

89
00:05:33,550 --> 00:05:34,910
It's nice to meet you, Tom.

90
00:05:36,597 --> 00:05:37,835
And it's nice to
meet you too, Lauren.

91
00:05:37,859 --> 00:05:39,121
Mm-hmm.

92
00:05:47,216 --> 00:05:48,304
Wait.

93
00:05:49,610 --> 00:05:50,804
But I don't like to wait.

94
00:05:50,828 --> 00:05:52,308
Mm-hmm.

95
00:05:52,439 --> 00:05:54,179
But get comfortable.

96
00:05:54,310 --> 00:05:55,311
Yes, ma'am.

97
00:05:55,442 --> 00:05:56,530
I'll be back.

98
00:05:57,966 --> 00:06:00,360
Okay, I'll, I'll do just that.

99
00:06:29,867 --> 00:06:30,867
Hello.

100
00:06:32,479 --> 00:06:33,479
Hello?

101
00:06:35,264 --> 00:06:36,264
Yo, who is this?

102
00:06:37,353 --> 00:06:38,353
Hello!

103
00:06:42,576 --> 00:06:43,577
Hello?

104
00:06:46,449 --> 00:06:47,449
Is somebody here?

105
00:06:50,540 --> 00:06:52,890
Yo, Lauren, you all right
in there?

106
00:06:53,021 --> 00:06:54,501
Yeah, I'll be out in a minute!

107
00:06:59,027 --> 00:07:00,027
Hello?

108
00:07:09,646 --> 00:07:11,387
Lauren, lock the fucking door!

109
00:07:20,875 --> 00:07:22,311
Come out, you pussy!

110
00:07:22,442 --> 00:07:23,921
God, dude!

111
00:07:53,821 --> 00:07:55,344
Tom?

112
00:07:55,475 --> 00:07:57,041
Tom, stop fucking around.

113
00:08:05,049 --> 00:08:06,442
What the fuck?

114
00:08:30,901 --> 00:08:32,163
Yo, dude!

115
00:08:38,126 --> 00:08:39,910
What's up, dude?

116
00:08:40,041 --> 00:08:41,825
You have to drive,
I'm too hung over.

117
00:08:41,956 --> 00:08:42,739
Are you fucking serious?

118
00:08:42,870 --> 00:08:43,740
Yeah, man.

119
00:08:43,871 --> 00:08:44,959
Oh my God.

120
00:08:50,355 --> 00:08:51,922
I'm so fucking nauseous.

121
00:08:53,358 --> 00:08:54,882
And I'm sorry for
making you isolate.

122
00:08:55,012 --> 00:08:56,927
My roommates are mad
paranoid about COVID.

123
00:08:57,058 --> 00:08:58,581
It's only a week, though.

124
00:08:58,712 --> 00:08:59,993
No, I get it, I mean,
I just came from New York.

125
00:09:00,017 --> 00:09:01,889
It's like fucking
Chernobyl over there.

126
00:09:02,019 --> 00:09:04,195
Hey, let's just get
this out of the way.

127
00:09:04,326 --> 00:09:06,241
I feel really responsible
for your break-up.

128
00:09:06,371 --> 00:09:07,982
No, babe, please don't.

129
00:09:08,112 --> 00:09:09,786
No, honestly, I mean,
if I had known your boyfriend

130
00:09:09,810 --> 00:09:12,029
would just break up with
you and throw you out for

131
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:14,399
webcamming, I mean, I would
have never told you about it.

132
00:09:14,423 --> 00:09:16,294
No, babe, honestly,
it's not your fault.

133
00:09:16,425 --> 00:09:18,079
He's literally trash.

134
00:09:18,209 --> 00:09:20,100
Look, I was broke and you gave
me a solution, so I'm over it.

135
00:09:20,124 --> 00:09:21,124
You know what?

136
00:09:21,212 --> 00:09:22,692
That's the right mindset, babe.

137
00:09:22,823 --> 00:09:24,191
Plus it was kind of
fun, fulfilling fantasies.

138
00:09:24,215 --> 00:09:26,478
You remember my
roommate Desi, you know,

139
00:09:26,609 --> 00:09:27,689
the one from freshman year?

140
00:09:27,784 --> 00:09:29,046
Uh-huh.

141
00:09:29,177 --> 00:09:30,894
Okay, I heard
that she's on 18 &amp; Over.

142
00:09:30,918 --> 00:09:31,918
She's webcamming?

143
00:09:31,962 --> 00:09:33,137
Yeah, man.

144
00:09:33,268 --> 00:09:35,313
She was on that shit
fingering herself,

145
00:09:35,444 --> 00:09:37,378
making out with her roommate,
taking naked showers,

146
00:09:37,402 --> 00:09:39,100
doing tons of crazy shit.

147
00:09:39,230 --> 00:09:41,624
Anyways, that bitch is making
$40K a month doing that shit.

148
00:09:41,755 --> 00:09:43,365
$40K?

149
00:09:43,495 --> 00:09:45,299
Dude, I can't just go on there
and do crazy shit like that,

150
00:09:45,323 --> 00:09:46,803
do you know what I mean?

151
00:09:46,934 --> 00:09:48,934
Like, I usually just fucking
lay around in lingerie

152
00:09:48,979 --> 00:09:50,198
and try and look sexy.

153
00:09:50,328 --> 00:09:51,479
Just get a little naked,

154
00:09:51,503 --> 00:09:52,635
show a little bit of ass.

155
00:09:52,766 --> 00:09:53,941
I mean, you have nice tits.

156
00:09:54,071 --> 00:09:55,116
It's a no-brainer.

157
00:09:56,465 --> 00:09:57,901
You know what?

158
00:09:58,032 --> 00:09:59,966
You're right, I'm just going
to spend the next week

159
00:09:59,990 --> 00:10:02,210
webcamming and making some
money so I don't have

160
00:10:02,340 --> 00:10:03,690
to keep couch surfing.

161
00:10:05,474 --> 00:10:07,476
Aw, he's so cute.

162
00:10:07,607 --> 00:10:09,696
That's the neighbors' kids.

163
00:10:09,826 --> 00:10:12,046
You're definitely not
in New York anymore.

164
00:10:31,065 --> 00:10:32,608
My grandfather was
really into hunting,

165
00:10:32,632 --> 00:10:33,720
in case you can't tell.

166
00:10:36,940 --> 00:10:39,290
It's definitely a vibe.

167
00:10:39,421 --> 00:10:41,741
All right, here's some
numbers you're going to need.

168
00:10:44,078 --> 00:10:46,428
Sheriff Rodgers,
she's really nice.

169
00:10:46,558 --> 00:10:48,449
She's actually really cool,
I hope you get to meet her.

170
00:10:48,473 --> 00:10:50,258
But I hope you never
have to meet her,

171
00:10:50,388 --> 00:10:51,388
you know what I mean?

172
00:10:52,826 --> 00:10:54,325
Okay, you're a
fucking idiot, continue.

173
00:10:54,349 --> 00:10:57,308
Okay, all right,
second, Kim and Max Daniels.

174
00:10:57,439 --> 00:10:58,721
They live next door,
they're really cool,

175
00:10:58,745 --> 00:11:01,225
young couple, whatever.

176
00:11:01,356 --> 00:11:02,966
You saw their kids earlier.

177
00:11:03,097 --> 00:11:05,055
And like I said, they're
your only neighbors

178
00:11:05,186 --> 00:11:07,144
for like 17 miles,
there's nobody here.

179
00:11:08,972 --> 00:11:10,191
Call me if you need anything.

180
00:11:10,321 --> 00:11:11,321
I will.

181
00:11:11,409 --> 00:11:12,193
See you in a week.

182
00:11:12,323 --> 00:11:13,323
Bye, dude.

183
00:11:50,013 --> 00:11:51,817
Meanwhile, on the other
side of the mansion...

184
00:11:51,841 --> 00:11:54,037
But yeah, he just did not
want to fucking commit to me.

185
00:11:54,061 --> 00:11:56,101
Like, I'm like, yo, I love
you, do you love me back?

186
00:11:56,150 --> 00:11:58,239
The fight over the
video games was crazy.

187
00:11:58,369 --> 00:12:01,155
We're all just
partying, having fun.

188
00:12:01,285 --> 00:12:04,201
Spence walks in trying to,
like, get her attention.

189
00:12:04,332 --> 00:12:05,768
It's, it's between us.

190
00:12:05,899 --> 00:12:06,682
Come take a shot,
come do a shot!

191
00:12:06,813 --> 00:12:07,901
It's just...

192
00:12:08,031 --> 00:12:09,052
This, like, pissy fucking mood.

193
00:12:09,076 --> 00:12:10,076
Really?

194
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:13,099
What! What the
fuck is wrong with you?

195
00:12:13,123 --> 00:12:14,448
You turned off my
PlayStation, didn't you?

196
00:12:14,472 --> 00:12:15,038
Hitting me in front of everyone?

197
00:12:15,169 --> 00:12:15,996
Are you serious?

198
00:12:16,126 --> 00:12:17,824
That was so beyond!

199
00:12:17,954 --> 00:12:19,477
Just go, just go!

200
00:12:19,608 --> 00:12:20,783
I'm out of here!

201
00:12:20,914 --> 00:12:21,914
The fuck!

202
00:12:21,958 --> 00:12:23,438
Oh my God.

203
00:12:23,568 --> 00:12:24,308
Did you really turn his
PlayStation off, though?

204
00:12:24,439 --> 00:12:25,701
Is that the point?

205
00:12:25,832 --> 00:12:26,939
No, I'm just saying,
I'm just saying!

206
00:12:26,963 --> 00:12:28,243
Is that literally the point?

207
00:12:28,312 --> 00:12:29,507
Why don't you go
fucking join him?

208
00:12:29,531 --> 00:12:30,750
Just join him.

209
00:12:35,406 --> 00:12:37,234
What a fucking moron.

210
00:12:37,365 --> 00:12:39,497
Oh my gosh, what is
wrong with these men!

211
00:12:39,628 --> 00:12:41,282
Are you kidding me?

212
00:12:44,415 --> 00:12:45,677
Shit!

213
00:12:57,167 --> 00:12:58,473
Fuck me.

214
00:13:56,009 --> 00:13:57,271
So, I love Lindsey.

215
00:14:00,230 --> 00:14:01,797
Right now...

216
00:14:01,928 --> 00:14:04,191
I would say Shannon.

217
00:14:04,321 --> 00:14:05,453
I...

218
00:14:16,768 --> 00:14:18,596
Hey, what's your name?

219
00:14:21,643 --> 00:14:22,905
Take your top off.

220
00:14:25,690 --> 00:14:26,691
You're so beautiful.

221
00:14:30,391 --> 00:14:33,481
Oh my God, you are worth
every fucking dollar.

222
00:14:36,397 --> 00:14:37,833
I, I love you in that wig.

223
00:14:40,662 --> 00:14:42,582
I want to get to know you,
like, in a real way.

224
00:14:45,754 --> 00:14:47,016
How did you get that body?

225
00:14:49,801 --> 00:14:51,107
You're so special.

226
00:14:54,981 --> 00:14:58,462
Babe, I want to see your tits
so fucking bad, please.

227
00:15:17,612 --> 00:15:19,005
Hello?

228
00:15:19,135 --> 00:15:21,137
So, you survived
your first night?

229
00:15:21,268 --> 00:15:22,660
Ugh, barely.

230
00:15:22,791 --> 00:15:24,401
I literally feel like
I'm losing my mind.

231
00:15:24,532 --> 00:15:26,316
And you just got there, relax.

232
00:15:26,447 --> 00:15:27,839
So, what are you up to?

233
00:15:27,970 --> 00:15:29,972
Oh, you know,
just been webcamming.

234
00:15:31,843 --> 00:15:32,843
I just got another one.

235
00:15:33,845 --> 00:15:35,673
Ugh, God, it's that tape guy.

236
00:15:35,804 --> 00:15:37,477
Do you remember I was
telling you about him?

237
00:15:37,501 --> 00:15:39,523
Yeah, that weirdo who
puts tape before his camera?

238
00:15:39,547 --> 00:15:41,201
Freak.

239
00:15:41,331 --> 00:15:43,005
God, I don't know if I
can deal with him right now.

240
00:15:43,029 --> 00:15:44,429
Isn't he your biggest client?

241
00:15:44,465 --> 00:15:45,814
Suck it up.

242
00:15:45,945 --> 00:15:47,816
He kind of went
crazy on me last time.

243
00:15:47,947 --> 00:15:50,297
He takes this role playing
shit way too serious.

244
00:15:50,427 --> 00:15:52,212
Whatever, who gives a shit.

245
00:15:52,342 --> 00:15:54,342
It's not like you're going
to ever meet him anyway.

246
00:16:05,442 --> 00:16:07,749
Baby, I thought I'd
never see you again.

247
00:16:07,879 --> 00:16:10,273
Sorry about last time.

248
00:16:10,404 --> 00:16:13,059
I g-got a little carried away.

249
00:16:13,189 --> 00:16:15,409
You just felt so distant.

250
00:16:15,539 --> 00:16:17,367
I'm sorry, daddy.

251
00:16:17,498 --> 00:16:20,370
I need to be able to trust you.

252
00:16:20,501 --> 00:16:22,024
How can I make it up to you?

253
00:16:23,199 --> 00:16:24,374
Tell wifey.

254
00:16:36,169 --> 00:16:38,084
Oh my God.

255
00:16:39,520 --> 00:16:40,782
I got you a ring.

256
00:16:40,912 --> 00:16:43,002
I want you all to myself.

257
00:16:43,132 --> 00:16:44,772
Put your money
where your mouth is.

258
00:16:45,917 --> 00:16:48,398
I love pleasuring my husband.

259
00:16:50,487 --> 00:16:52,968
I love it when
you call me your husband,

260
00:16:53,099 --> 00:16:55,014
but now I need you to prove it.

261
00:16:55,144 --> 00:16:57,929
Make me a video, just for me.

262
00:16:58,060 --> 00:16:59,060
I'd love to.

263
00:17:19,603 --> 00:17:21,214
Follow me, I love my followers.

264
00:17:21,344 --> 00:17:23,433
Make sure you follow me
on social media @ben.

265
00:17:23,564 --> 00:17:24,695
Let's go!

266
00:17:24,826 --> 00:17:25,914
Don't vote me out.

267
00:17:27,916 --> 00:17:29,309
America, what's good?

268
00:17:33,052 --> 00:17:35,663
I take this quarantine
really, really seriously,

269
00:17:35,793 --> 00:17:38,840
so I'm just trying to set
the tone and, you know,

270
00:17:38,970 --> 00:17:40,755
be a good example.

271
00:17:44,759 --> 00:17:45,847

276
00:19:09,844 --> 00:19:11,038

00:19:11,062 --> 00:19:12,716
mind-blowing sex
with your boyfriend?

278
00:19:12,847 --> 00:19:14,979
You lucky bitch.

279
00:19:15,110 --> 00:19:18,331
I'm here all alone without
any Wi-Fi and I'm starting

280
00:19:18,461 --> 00:19:19,984
to get really fucking horny.

281
00:19:29,777 --> 00:19:31,217

Hey, do you want
some coffee or anything?

285
00:20:12,602 --> 00:20:14,482
Oh, I'm all right,
sweetie, thank you.

286
00:20:15,431 --> 00:20:16,431
Appreciate it, though.

287
00:20:20,001 --> 00:20:22,786
Are you, you all alone up here?

288
00:20:22,917 --> 00:20:25,528
Yeah, unfortunately.

289
00:20:29,837 --> 00:20:31,230
Must get lonely, huh?

290
00:20:34,668 --> 00:20:35,843
So, where are you from?

291
00:20:35,973 --> 00:20:37,323
Near here.

292
00:20:37,453 --> 00:20:38,628
Really?

293
00:20:38,759 --> 00:20:40,500
You don't look like
you're from here.

294
00:20:40,630 --> 00:20:42,217
Well, I mean, I've
been living in New York

295
00:20:42,241 --> 00:20:43,111
the last couple of years.

296
00:20:43,242 --> 00:20:44,504
Oh, cool.

297
00:20:44,634 --> 00:20:46,593
So, it looks like your
cable got cut here.

298
00:20:46,723 --> 00:20:48,440
I'm going to have to come back
in a couple of days,

299
00:20:48,464 --> 00:20:49,770
run some wire.

300
00:20:49,900 --> 00:20:51,641
I put these temporary
guys in here,

301
00:20:51,772 --> 00:20:53,339
it should help with
your Wi-Fi for now.

302
00:20:53,469 --> 00:20:55,079
Wait, okay,
so, the line got cut.

303
00:20:55,210 --> 00:20:56,994
Does that mean that
someone did that or...

304
00:20:57,125 --> 00:20:58,431
Around here?

305
00:20:58,561 --> 00:21:01,999
No, no, it was probably
just some curious animal

306
00:21:02,130 --> 00:21:03,262
or something, you know?

307
00:21:06,656 --> 00:21:08,310
Lot of creatures around here.

308
00:21:10,443 --> 00:21:12,203
Anyway, we'll get you
set up, you'll be fine.

309
00:21:12,227 --> 00:21:13,227
Okay.

310
00:21:30,332 --> 00:21:32,203
So, uh...

311
00:21:32,334 --> 00:21:33,814
you want anything else?

312
00:21:35,424 --> 00:21:37,731
No, just want to get that fixed.

313
00:21:41,648 --> 00:21:42,968
Well, I'll see you soon.

314
00:21:48,872 --> 00:21:50,613
I think Lucas is cute.

315
00:21:50,744 --> 00:21:53,224
A slick back, and he can dress!

316
00:21:53,355 --> 00:21:54,898
If I had to guess
who has a crush on me,

317
00:21:54,922 --> 00:21:57,054
maybe it might be Deadass?

318
00:21:57,185 --> 00:21:59,230
I feel like
making my move on Lindsey.

319
00:21:59,361 --> 00:22:02,408
He does look
over at me pretty often,

320
00:22:02,538 --> 00:22:04,255
and every time I go to the
bathroom he's kind of,

321
00:22:04,279 --> 00:22:05,715
like, within 20 feet.

322
00:22:05,846 --> 00:22:07,126
I think he likes to hear me pee.

323
00:22:10,633 --> 00:22:12,896
I've been working
on a piece all day.

324
00:22:13,027 --> 00:22:14,985
Oh yeah, anything good?

325
00:22:15,116 --> 00:22:17,292
Yeah, um...

326
00:22:18,902 --> 00:22:21,122
actually, I've been
making stuff about you.

327
00:22:21,252 --> 00:22:23,298
How, how old are you, anyway?

328
00:22:23,429 --> 00:22:25,779
I look older without
my glasses on, but, you know,

329
00:22:25,909 --> 00:22:27,520
I kind of look young right now.

330
00:22:27,650 --> 00:22:28,970
Oh really?
Yeah.

331
00:22:29,086 --> 00:22:30,629
You look older
without your glasses on.

332
00:22:30,653 --> 00:22:32,525
I'll take them off.

333
00:22:32,655 --> 00:22:34,483
I kind of want
to kiss you right now.

334
00:22:47,888 --> 00:22:49,411
I just made out with Deadass,

335
00:22:49,542 --> 00:22:53,197
and it wasn't as bad as
I thought it would be.

336
00:22:53,328 --> 00:22:56,375
He was a little smaller
and I wasn't used to it,

337
00:22:56,505 --> 00:22:58,028
but he wasn't bad.

338
00:22:58,159 --> 00:22:59,571
I know she's in love with me.

339
00:22:59,595 --> 00:23:01,115
Wait, you forgot your glasses.

340
00:23:14,131 --> 00:23:17,396
Vicky, Vicky, my love!

341
00:23:17,526 --> 00:23:18,658
Jazzy!

342
00:23:19,963 --> 00:23:21,203
Oh, thank you for the donation.

343
00:23:21,269 --> 00:23:22,836
So, how are you?
How's the wife?

344
00:23:22,966 --> 00:23:24,944
Well, I got to tell
you, be honest with you,

345
00:23:24,968 --> 00:23:26,608
I mean, this whole
isolation trip, I mean,

346
00:23:26,666 --> 00:23:28,798
we've been fighting
all the time, man.

347
00:23:28,929 --> 00:23:31,192
I mean, I don't even
know what to do anymore.

348
00:23:31,322 --> 00:23:33,281
I mean, I feel invisible here.

349
00:23:33,412 --> 00:23:34,717
It's going to work out.

350
00:23:34,848 --> 00:23:36,478
People are going crazy
in quarantine right now.

351
00:23:36,502 --> 00:23:38,025
And you know why
she'll come around?

352
00:23:38,155 --> 00:23:42,116
Because look at you, you
are one handsome man.

353
00:23:42,246 --> 00:23:45,336
Oh, come on, you
didn't have to say that.

354
00:23:45,467 --> 00:23:48,775
But enough about me, I want to
know what's going on with you.

355
00:23:48,905 --> 00:23:52,909
I'm fine, just want
this year to be over.

356
00:23:53,040 --> 00:23:54,440
So, so, did you move out?

357
00:23:54,563 --> 00:23:55,869
Yeah, I moved home.

358
00:23:55,999 --> 00:23:57,479
Well, I'm really sorry.

359
00:23:57,610 --> 00:23:59,220
It hurts me to see you sad.

360
00:23:59,350 --> 00:24:01,222
You know I'm a fan, right?

361
00:24:01,352 --> 00:24:02,615
Or a friend.

362
00:24:04,530 --> 00:24:06,850
Listen, I got to start dinner
because my wife doesn't cook.

363
00:24:06,923 --> 00:24:08,490
I'll see you later.

364
00:24:50,010 --> 00:24:51,315
I want you so bad.

365
00:25:32,356 --> 00:25:33,356
Yo.

366
00:25:34,184 --> 00:25:35,446
Sorry about that.

367
00:25:35,577 --> 00:25:36,902
Oh, Jesus fucking Christ,

368
00:25:36,926 --> 00:25:38,537
you scared the shit out of me.

369
00:25:38,667 --> 00:25:39,929
Sorry.

370
00:25:40,060 --> 00:25:42,105
It's, it's
going to be $21.50.

371
00:25:42,236 --> 00:25:43,280
All right.

372
00:25:44,847 --> 00:25:46,172
You know what, just,
here, keep the change.

373
00:25:46,196 --> 00:25:47,716
Thanks for coming
all the way out here.

374
00:25:48,242 --> 00:25:50,157
Say, I kind
of got to take a leak,

375
00:25:50,287 --> 00:25:51,375
you know what I mean?

376
00:25:51,506 --> 00:25:53,290
You mind if I use your bathroom?

377
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:56,859
Dude, come on, can't
you just piss in the woods?

378
00:25:58,034 --> 00:25:59,601
Can I piss in the woods?

379
00:25:59,732 --> 00:26:02,169
Do I look like an animal to you?

380
00:26:04,084 --> 00:26:05,724
You know what,
fine, just hurry up.

381
00:26:19,273 --> 00:26:20,337
Hey, you know,
I think I've heard

382
00:26:20,361 --> 00:26:22,015
about this place before.

383
00:26:22,145 --> 00:26:23,843
What?

384
00:26:29,109 --> 00:26:32,112
Yeah, this is
definitely the place.

385
00:26:34,810 --> 00:26:36,420
Okay, what are
you talking about?

386
00:26:43,123 --> 00:26:44,472
Do you mind?

387
00:26:50,217 --> 00:26:52,567
Mm, you don't
have COVID, do you?

388
00:26:52,698 --> 00:26:53,873
Dude, no.

389
00:27:00,096 --> 00:27:02,316
Oh, yeah.

390
00:27:02,446 --> 00:27:03,622
Oh yeah.

391
00:27:05,188 --> 00:27:09,149
Rumor has it, about 20 years
ago a guy marches into town,

392
00:27:09,279 --> 00:27:12,152
breaks into this very
house and tortures

393
00:27:12,282 --> 00:27:15,416
this fucking family
for about two weeks.

394
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:19,594
He was playing mind games,
tormenting them.

395
00:27:19,725 --> 00:27:21,640
Real sick individual, you know?

396
00:27:21,770 --> 00:27:24,773
Finally, once he gets
his rocks off,

397
00:27:24,904 --> 00:27:27,733
he sits the parents down
and forces them to watch

398
00:27:27,863 --> 00:27:32,041
as he chops up the little
kids into bits and pieces.

399
00:27:32,172 --> 00:27:35,262
I mean, some real fucking
Buffalo Bill shit.

400
00:27:35,392 --> 00:27:38,395
I mean, I'm surprised you
haven't heard about it.

401
00:27:38,526 --> 00:27:40,571
Are you sure it was this house?

402
00:27:40,702 --> 00:27:42,530
My friend's family
has had this place...

403
00:27:48,318 --> 00:27:50,843
Hello, Sorriso's Pizza.

404
00:27:50,973 --> 00:27:52,975
Oh yeah, Mr. Burns,
I'm already in the car.

405
00:27:53,106 --> 00:27:54,455
I'll see you soon.

406
00:27:54,585 --> 00:27:57,371
I got to split, but thanks
for the hospitality.

407
00:27:59,025 --> 00:28:00,655
Hey, are you
sure it was this house

408
00:28:00,679 --> 00:28:01,680
the family was killed in?

409
00:28:04,639 --> 00:28:07,773
Hmm, it might
have been a few towns over.

410
00:28:07,903 --> 00:28:08,991
Thanks for the tip.

411
00:28:17,086 --> 00:28:18,827
Yeah, I'm on the way, man.

412
00:28:18,958 --> 00:28:21,351
I told you, 30 minutes
or less, I promise.

413
00:28:21,482 --> 00:28:23,005
Bye-bye.

414
00:28:23,136 --> 00:28:24,703
This fucking guy.

415
00:28:30,796 --> 00:28:32,623
What the fuck is that?

416
00:29:24,458 --> 00:29:25,807
Whoa!

417
00:29:25,938 --> 00:29:27,940
What the hell, dude,
what are you doing?

418
00:29:28,070 --> 00:29:32,379
Sorry, didn't mean to scare you.

419
00:29:32,509 --> 00:29:35,034
I was calling after you and
you had that shit in your ears,

420
00:29:35,164 --> 00:29:36,209
you couldn't hear me.

421
00:29:36,339 --> 00:29:37,471
Jesus Christ.

422
00:29:39,081 --> 00:29:42,824
I'm Sheriff Rodgers and this
is my nephew, Deputy Wayne.

423
00:29:42,955 --> 00:29:43,999
Ma'am.

424
00:29:44,130 --> 00:29:45,392
He's a rookie cookie.

425
00:29:45,522 --> 00:29:46,915
He's just in training.

426
00:29:47,046 --> 00:29:49,483
So, what are you doing
up here in these parts?

427
00:29:49,613 --> 00:29:51,006
Do you know the Stewarts?

428
00:29:51,137 --> 00:29:52,878
Yeah, I'm staying
there for the week.

429
00:29:53,008 --> 00:29:55,228
What are you guys
doing out here?

430
00:29:55,358 --> 00:29:56,988
Well, we were heading
over to the neighbors

431
00:29:57,012 --> 00:30:01,321
and saw you running like
a God damn gazelle.

432
00:30:01,451 --> 00:30:03,771
Just wanted to make sure you're
not running from something.

433
00:30:05,151 --> 00:30:06,591
Getting eaten alive out here.

434
00:30:06,674 --> 00:30:08,241
Is, are the neighbors okay?

435
00:30:08,371 --> 00:30:10,175
You know, we're going
to check on the neighbors

436
00:30:10,199 --> 00:30:11,766
because their relatives
were calling us

437
00:30:11,897 --> 00:30:13,457
saying they couldn't
get a hold of them.

438
00:30:13,550 --> 00:30:15,552
So, just checking in.

439
00:30:15,683 --> 00:30:17,641
All right, well,
I hope everyone's okay.

440
00:30:17,772 --> 00:30:19,228
You know, we should
probably get you back.

441
00:30:19,252 --> 00:30:20,340
We'll drive you.

442
00:30:21,254 --> 00:30:22,254
Getting dark.

443
00:30:30,741 --> 00:30:32,371
You know, they recently
found a young girl's body

444
00:30:32,395 --> 00:30:34,180
not too far from here.

445
00:30:34,310 --> 00:30:38,358
They found a dozen other bodies
killed the same exact way

446
00:30:38,488 --> 00:30:40,012
all across the country.

447
00:30:41,752 --> 00:30:43,580
Real gruesome.

448
00:30:43,711 --> 00:30:46,192
They're calling him
the Crowbar Killer.

449
00:30:46,322 --> 00:30:49,021
And all his victims were young
females around your age.

450
00:30:49,151 --> 00:30:50,849
First he kills
everyone around her,

451
00:30:50,979 --> 00:30:53,112
then he saves her for last.

452
00:30:53,242 --> 00:30:54,698
Well, actually, I think
we're dealing with

453
00:30:54,722 --> 00:30:56,245
a classic serial killer.

454
00:30:56,376 --> 00:30:57,616
Would you cut that out?

455
00:30:57,681 --> 00:30:59,814
You're scaring the
bejesus out of her!

456
00:30:59,945 --> 00:31:02,208
Wait, wait, wait,
why is my door open?

457
00:31:03,992 --> 00:31:05,272
You two stay in the car.

458
00:31:39,593 --> 00:31:41,508
Wait, did you hear that?

459
00:31:41,638 --> 00:31:43,466
Whatever,
she said stay in the car.

460
00:31:48,863 --> 00:31:50,821
Hey, where the fuck
are you going?

461
00:31:50,952 --> 00:31:52,669
Dude, if she's in
trouble, we have to help her.

462
00:31:52,693 --> 00:31:53,694
Come on!

463
00:31:59,482 --> 00:32:00,875
Do you have a gun?

464
00:32:01,006 --> 00:32:02,592
Fuck no, they
don't give me that shit.

465
00:32:02,616 --> 00:32:03,617
Fuck!

466
00:32:18,110 --> 00:32:19,720
Come on.

467
00:32:28,990 --> 00:32:30,209
Sheriff?

468
00:32:46,703 --> 00:32:48,116
Fuck this shit,
I'm getting out of here.

469
00:32:48,140 --> 00:32:49,576
Oh!

470
00:32:49,706 --> 00:32:51,186
Oh shit!

471
00:32:52,405 --> 00:32:53,710
Relax, it's me!

472
00:32:53,841 --> 00:32:55,190
That is so not funny.

473
00:32:55,321 --> 00:32:57,121
Oh, come on,
come on, that was funny.

474
00:32:57,192 --> 00:32:59,629
Jesus Christ, you
nearly scared my sac off!

475
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:01,042
Yeah, I should
have listened to your mom,

476
00:33:01,066 --> 00:33:02,226
you are not cut out for this.

477
00:33:02,328 --> 00:33:03,416
Okay, stop!

478
00:33:03,546 --> 00:33:05,287
Who was in my house?

479
00:33:05,418 --> 00:33:07,378
I checked the house,
the house is secure.

480
00:33:08,725 --> 00:33:10,805
I think your door just blew
open from a gust of wind.

481
00:33:10,858 --> 00:33:12,773
Oh, that's real comforting.

482
00:33:12,903 --> 00:33:14,446
I mean, your lock's pretty old.

483
00:33:14,470 --> 00:33:15,776
Let's go.

484
00:33:18,909 --> 00:33:20,781
Happy Halloween.

485
00:33:20,911 --> 00:33:22,609
Make sure you
get that door fixed.

486
00:33:31,574 --> 00:33:32,880
Here we go!

487
00:33:33,011 --> 00:33:34,379
Do I just start
going back and forth?

488
00:33:34,403 --> 00:33:36,014
Jazzy: You go
back a little bit,

489
00:33:36,144 --> 00:33:37,406
you go forward a little bit.

490
00:33:37,537 --> 00:33:38,538
Like this?

491
00:33:38,668 --> 00:33:39,868
Turn to your right.

492
00:33:39,930 --> 00:33:41,541
Beautiful!

493
00:33:41,671 --> 00:33:42,671
Is that it?

494
00:33:42,716 --> 00:33:43,916
Now you're talking.

495
00:33:44,892 --> 00:33:46,502
You're really good!

496
00:33:46,633 --> 00:33:48,089
And now get ready,
make believe you're holding

497
00:33:48,113 --> 00:33:49,375
my hand right here.

498
00:33:49,505 --> 00:33:50,917
Okay, but don't
drop me, all right?

499
00:33:50,941 --> 00:33:52,006
Turn to your right!

500
00:33:52,030 --> 00:33:53,901
Yes.

501
00:33:54,032 --> 00:33:56,469
It's all hips, all
hips, all hips.

502
00:33:58,210 --> 00:33:59,820
There you go.

503
00:33:59,950 --> 00:34:03,911
Um, hey, Lou, I had a
blast, but I have to go, okay?

504
00:34:04,042 --> 00:34:05,541
Okay, but I'm
going to keep dancing,

505
00:34:05,565 --> 00:34:09,569
because once Jazzy is
lit, I'm good to go.

506
00:34:09,699 --> 00:34:11,266
All right, bye.

507
00:34:11,397 --> 00:34:12,441
Peace!

508
00:34:18,143 --> 00:34:19,796
Hey, baby.

509
00:34:19,927 --> 00:34:23,626
Just give me two seconds, I'm
going to go get ready for you.

510
00:34:23,757 --> 00:34:28,327
Hurry up, your
husband's in a spending mood.

511
00:34:47,085 --> 00:34:49,739
Oh my God.

512
00:34:54,135 --> 00:34:55,832
You're so beautiful.

513
00:34:59,445 --> 00:35:02,230
I n-n-need you to
make me another video.

514
00:35:02,361 --> 00:35:04,102
Did you like my last video?

515
00:35:04,232 --> 00:35:05,712
Or was the mask too much?

516
00:35:05,842 --> 00:35:09,585
I n-need you to
do it again, without the mask.

517
00:35:09,716 --> 00:35:13,415
I need to see your eyes when
you tell me you love me.

518
00:35:13,546 --> 00:35:15,113
But you already know that.

519
00:35:15,243 --> 00:35:17,550
I love my future husband.

520
00:35:17,680 --> 00:35:18,986
Show me.

521
00:35:20,379 --> 00:35:22,207
Put your money
where your mouth is.

522
00:35:22,337 --> 00:35:25,514
How much will
it take to make you mine?

523
00:35:25,645 --> 00:35:26,950
Mm...

524
00:35:28,822 --> 00:35:30,171
This much?

525
00:35:30,302 --> 00:35:31,782
I can't wait
to put this ring on yo...

526
00:35:32,652 --> 00:35:33,914
Fuck!

527
00:36:06,381 --> 00:36:07,469
Fuck!

528
00:36:13,083 --> 00:36:14,998
Sheriff, it's me, Vicky.

529
00:36:15,129 --> 00:36:16,391
You were in my cabin earlier?

530
00:36:16,522 --> 00:36:18,132
There's someone
outside of my house.

531
00:36:18,263 --> 00:36:19,960
Okay, go hide somewhere safe.

532
00:36:20,090 --> 00:36:21,483
I'm headed over.

533
00:36:21,614 --> 00:36:22,852
Okay, but how long
is this going to take?

534
00:36:22,876 --> 00:36:24,399
About 30 minutes, go hide.

535
00:36:24,530 --> 00:36:25,930
Please, please, please hurry!

536
00:36:27,924 --> 00:36:28,969
Hey.

537
00:36:30,231 --> 00:36:31,319
Fuck, what the fuck!

538
00:36:31,450 --> 00:36:32,538
Who are you?

539
00:36:32,668 --> 00:36:33,906
I could ask you the same thing!

540
00:36:33,930 --> 00:36:35,802
I said, who the fuck are you!

541
00:36:35,932 --> 00:36:38,457
I'm their neighbor,
okay, Max Daniels.

542
00:36:43,375 --> 00:36:45,899
Oh my God, you're the neighbor.

543
00:36:46,029 --> 00:36:47,509
Max...

544
00:36:47,640 --> 00:36:48,945
I am so sorry.

545
00:36:49,076 --> 00:36:50,425
You were in the house...

546
00:36:50,556 --> 00:36:51,663
I'm sorry, the door was open,

547
00:36:51,687 --> 00:36:52,775
I thought they were here.

548
00:36:52,906 --> 00:36:53,994
I...

549
00:36:54,124 --> 00:36:55,691
oh my God.

550
00:36:55,822 --> 00:36:58,346
I was hunting yesterday,
I heard music coming

551
00:36:58,477 --> 00:36:59,739
from the cabin.

552
00:36:59,869 --> 00:37:02,698
I just figured that
Stacy was in town and...

553
00:37:02,829 --> 00:37:07,137
Actually, that's why I came.

554
00:37:09,357 --> 00:37:10,706
We like to smoke together.

555
00:37:11,664 --> 00:37:12,664
Don't judge.

556
00:37:14,362 --> 00:37:16,522
Well, I could definitely
use a joint after that.

557
00:37:19,759 --> 00:37:22,892
Oh my God, oh my God,
I am so sorry.

558
00:37:23,023 --> 00:37:26,635
I'll, I'll r-roll one up
while you get changed.

559
00:37:26,766 --> 00:37:27,810
Okay.

560
00:37:29,116 --> 00:37:31,031
Really sorry about that, Max.

561
00:37:31,161 --> 00:37:32,772
I'll get something for that cut.

562
00:37:32,902 --> 00:37:33,947
Shit!

563
00:37:47,352 --> 00:37:48,352
Hey.

564
00:37:50,485 --> 00:37:51,485
All right.

565
00:37:54,141 --> 00:37:55,882
Let's get that cleaned up.

566
00:38:04,325 --> 00:38:05,544
I know, I know, I know.

567
00:38:05,674 --> 00:38:07,110
It's almost over, I'm sorry!

568
00:38:14,074 --> 00:38:15,423
There, is that better?

569
00:38:16,772 --> 00:38:17,860
Yeah.

570
00:38:19,122 --> 00:38:20,448
I'm sorry for
slashing your face.

571
00:38:20,472 --> 00:38:21,603
It's okay.

572
00:38:21,734 --> 00:38:23,257
Ugh, I've just been paranoid.

573
00:38:23,388 --> 00:38:24,930
I mean, I met these cops
earlier today and they were

574
00:38:24,954 --> 00:38:26,913
telling me about that
girl who got killed

575
00:38:27,043 --> 00:38:28,262
not too far from here.

576
00:38:28,393 --> 00:38:30,743
You know, the Crowbar Killer?

577
00:38:30,873 --> 00:38:33,615
Oh yeah, is that what
they're calling him now?

578
00:38:33,746 --> 00:38:35,095
Yeah, I guess.

579
00:38:35,225 --> 00:38:36,357
I hope they find him.

580
00:38:36,488 --> 00:38:39,186
This year can't get any crazier.

581
00:38:41,188 --> 00:38:42,188
I hear that.

582
00:38:55,768 --> 00:38:57,160
Because they're out of control.

583
00:39:00,338 --> 00:39:01,948
The pool guy has drowned!

584
00:39:02,078 --> 00:39:03,645
Oh my gosh, oh my
gosh, oh my gosh.

585
00:39:03,776 --> 00:39:05,865
I couldn't give him CPR.

586
00:39:05,995 --> 00:39:07,635
He goes to a lot of pools,
I don't know if

587
00:39:07,736 --> 00:39:08,607
he has COVID or not.

588
00:39:08,737 --> 00:39:10,130
Is this real?

589
00:39:10,260 --> 00:39:13,046
Yes, and I'm, like,
the biggest fan of it.

590
00:39:14,961 --> 00:39:17,180
Hey, I saw your kids
the other day.

591
00:39:17,311 --> 00:39:19,202
They were really cute in their
little Halloween costumes.

592
00:39:19,226 --> 00:39:20,662
Yeah.

593
00:39:20,793 --> 00:39:22,621
Unfortunately, they're gone.

594
00:39:22,751 --> 00:39:24,144
Gone?

595
00:39:24,274 --> 00:39:26,451
Yeah, my ex has them
for the next two weeks.

596
00:39:26,581 --> 00:39:28,975
Oh, right.

597
00:39:29,105 --> 00:39:33,893
We split up
about six months ago.

598
00:39:34,023 --> 00:39:35,590
I'm sorry.

599
00:39:37,070 --> 00:39:39,855
Oh God, I'm killing the mood.

600
00:39:41,770 --> 00:39:43,337
Oh, fuck.

601
00:39:44,599 --> 00:39:45,600
I have to handle that.

602
00:39:53,521 --> 00:39:55,262
Everything okay, ma'am?

603
00:39:55,393 --> 00:39:57,046
Yeah, yeah, everything is fine.

604
00:39:57,177 --> 00:39:58,657
Sorry for the false alarm.

605
00:39:58,787 --> 00:40:00,286
You sounded pretty
scared on the phone.

606
00:40:00,310 --> 00:40:03,139
No, no, no,
I know, umm, I'm fine.

607
00:40:03,270 --> 00:40:05,098
Mind if we take a look around?

608
00:40:05,228 --> 00:40:06,668
I've actually, I have company.

609
00:40:06,795 --> 00:40:08,144
You have company.

610
00:40:08,275 --> 00:40:10,843
I don't see any cars out here.

611
00:40:14,063 --> 00:40:16,370
Wait, are you
fucking the neighbor?

612
00:40:18,154 --> 00:40:19,654
Look, you guys, I,
I'm really sorry for making

613
00:40:19,678 --> 00:40:21,288
you come all the way up here.

614
00:40:21,419 --> 00:40:23,725
Well, you tell your
friend to call his family.

615
00:40:23,856 --> 00:40:25,205
They're worried about him.

616
00:40:25,335 --> 00:40:26,641
Yeah, of course.

617
00:40:26,772 --> 00:40:27,773
Bye.

618
00:40:27,903 --> 00:40:28,904
Home wrecker.

619
00:40:33,169 --> 00:40:34,432
Everything okay?

620
00:40:34,562 --> 00:40:36,346
Yeah, yeah, everything's fine.

621
00:40:36,477 --> 00:40:39,437
I just panicked earlier
and called the cops.

622
00:40:39,567 --> 00:40:41,787
But they're gone now, so.

623
00:40:41,917 --> 00:40:43,832
Well, it's getting late,

624
00:40:43,963 --> 00:40:45,617
I should probably
be heading back.

625
00:40:45,747 --> 00:40:47,009
Got to feed the doggo.

626
00:40:47,140 --> 00:40:48,620
Oh.

627
00:40:48,750 --> 00:40:50,535
Okay.

628
00:40:54,408 --> 00:40:55,453
Thanks for the hang.

629
00:40:57,629 --> 00:40:58,629
Have a good night.

630
00:41:05,811 --> 00:41:07,136
I was so nervous
when Paris called

631
00:41:07,160 --> 00:41:08,770
the meeting for the house.

632
00:41:08,901 --> 00:41:09,554
Hey, guys.

633
00:41:09,684 --> 00:41:11,164
All: Hi!

634
00:41:11,469 --> 00:41:13,403
I bet you guys are
wondering what I'm doing here.

635
00:41:13,427 --> 00:41:14,820
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

636
00:41:14,950 --> 00:41:16,667
Lindsey's boyfriend
just got released early

637
00:41:16,691 --> 00:41:20,478
from prison because of COVID and
he will be joining our cast.

638
00:41:20,608 --> 00:41:21,957
Lindsey has a boyfriend?

639
00:41:22,088 --> 00:41:23,248
Lindsey has a boyfriend?

640
00:41:25,483 --> 00:41:26,895
Why is he smashing
that ass, then?

641
00:41:26,919 --> 00:41:28,050
Baby!

642
00:41:28,181 --> 00:41:30,879
Oh, I'm so happy
you're out of prison!

643
00:41:31,010 --> 00:41:33,012
I'm a little bit worried
about what might happen

644
00:41:33,142 --> 00:41:35,493
between Deadass
and my boyfriend.

645
00:41:35,623 --> 00:41:37,669

646
00:41:39,540 --> 00:41:40,820

You want ice?

681
00:43:42,750 --> 00:43:44,709
No, I'm good.

682
00:43:44,839 --> 00:43:47,233
You know, I feel like
such a bad influence,

683
00:43:47,363 --> 00:43:50,584
first with the weed,
now with the booze.

684
00:43:52,978 --> 00:43:54,675
It's a stiff one.

685
00:43:55,545 --> 00:43:57,286
I can take it.

686
00:44:00,812 --> 00:44:03,771
Wow, this is delicious,
what is this?

687
00:44:03,902 --> 00:44:07,296
Well, since the split,
I've really got into

688
00:44:07,427 --> 00:44:09,821
different craft drinks.

689
00:44:09,951 --> 00:44:14,260
I'm no mixologist, but thanks
for being my test dummy.

690
00:44:15,783 --> 00:44:17,002
It's called a Downhill Daring.

691
00:44:19,395 --> 00:44:22,442
Hey, think fast.

692
00:44:27,012 --> 00:44:29,144
Buddy, I thought that
you played football.

693
00:44:29,275 --> 00:44:31,669
I did, I was the kicker.

694
00:44:31,799 --> 00:44:34,106
Ah, got it.

695
00:44:36,195 --> 00:44:37,457
Feeling tense, huh?

696
00:44:39,372 --> 00:44:41,591
I honestly can't believe
that you watch this.

697
00:44:41,722 --> 00:44:43,855
Ever since you showed me,
I've been hooked.

698
00:44:43,985 --> 00:44:45,552
I mean, these people
are so insane.

699
00:44:45,683 --> 00:44:46,803
I know, I'm addicted.

700
00:44:47,597 --> 00:44:48,337
Hey.

701
00:44:48,468 --> 00:44:49,774
That's a good boy.

702
00:44:49,904 --> 00:44:50,688
Come on, get out of
here, leave her alone.

703
00:44:50,818 --> 00:44:51,645
Go, go, go.

704
00:44:51,776 --> 00:44:52,776
Aw, he's so sweet.

705
00:44:52,820 --> 00:44:53,952
He is.

706
00:45:05,877 --> 00:45:07,748
Wait, who is
this with your kids?

707
00:45:10,925 --> 00:45:15,451
That is my ex and the man
who is now sleeping with her.

708
00:45:15,582 --> 00:45:18,672
I'm sorry, I'm being nosy.

709
00:45:18,803 --> 00:45:20,500
No, no, it's okay.

710
00:45:20,630 --> 00:45:22,850
I leave it out for when
the kids come to visit.

711
00:45:22,981 --> 00:45:27,246
You know, I want them to think
that we're all okay, you know,

712
00:45:27,376 --> 00:45:30,597
that I'm happy for their
mom and her new boyfriend,

713
00:45:30,728 --> 00:45:32,251
when I'm really not.

714
00:45:34,427 --> 00:45:36,472
Son of a bitch took
my wife, my kids.

715
00:45:36,603 --> 00:45:40,172
That's why I got Jason,
so I wouldn't be alone.

716
00:45:40,302 --> 00:45:43,828
And I'm not trying to
be insensitive by any means,

717
00:45:43,958 --> 00:45:47,962
but just, six months to already
have a new boyfriend, it's...

718
00:45:48,093 --> 00:45:51,096
Well, she signed
the papers six months ago.

719
00:45:51,226 --> 00:45:53,446
This nightmare has been
going on much, much longer.

720
00:45:53,576 --> 00:45:56,405
Can we not talk about my ex?

721
00:45:56,536 --> 00:45:59,365
I'm sorry, I'm being
totally fucking annoying.

722
00:45:59,495 --> 00:46:00,670
It's okay.

723
00:46:00,801 --> 00:46:01,976
I'm a little drunk.

724
00:46:02,107 --> 00:46:06,415
I just want to say
that I hear you.

725
00:46:08,417 --> 00:46:11,638
My ex and I, we recently
split, as well.

726
00:46:11,769 --> 00:46:17,035
And on top of all of that, he
kicked me out of our place, so.

727
00:46:17,165 --> 00:46:18,297
Wow.

728
00:46:20,081 --> 00:46:21,169
You want to talk about it?

729
00:46:23,737 --> 00:46:24,956
No, definitely not.

730
00:46:25,086 --> 00:46:26,174
Okay.

731
00:46:28,220 --> 00:46:30,744
So...

732
00:46:30,875 --> 00:46:32,311
what do you want
to talk about then?

733
00:46:37,359 --> 00:46:40,536
It's just been so weird
with Corona and quarantine

734
00:46:40,667 --> 00:46:43,931
and moving from New York,
going through a break-up.

735
00:46:44,062 --> 00:46:47,805
I just feel like my
life is falling apart.

736
00:46:53,332 --> 00:46:56,030
But now I'm finally starting
to feel like myself again.

737
00:46:58,641 --> 00:46:59,686
Amen to that.

738
00:47:11,785 --> 00:47:14,222
I can't.

739
00:47:14,353 --> 00:47:15,789
It's too soon.

740
00:47:26,713 --> 00:47:28,280
Sorry if I made it
awkward back there.

741
00:47:31,152 --> 00:47:32,501
I think you're really beautiful.

742
00:47:35,200 --> 00:47:36,680
I think you're really handsome.

743
00:47:42,729 --> 00:47:43,904
That was fun.

744
00:47:44,035 --> 00:47:45,340
Yeah.

745
00:47:45,471 --> 00:47:46,646
It was.

746
00:47:50,693 --> 00:47:51,693
Good night.

747
00:47:51,781 --> 00:47:52,870
Bye, good night.

748
00:48:36,348 --> 00:48:38,437
Ahh! Ahh!

749
00:48:39,438 --> 00:48:40,918
Hey, hey, whoa, hey!

750
00:48:41,048 --> 00:48:41,614
Don't come any closer,
I'll fucking kill you!

751
00:48:41,744 --> 00:48:42,615
Chill!

752
00:48:42,745 --> 00:48:44,051
I said, step back!

753
00:48:44,399 --> 00:48:45,855
I think there's been
a little misunderstanding.

754
00:48:45,879 --> 00:48:47,272
Why are you at my cabin?

755
00:48:48,099 --> 00:48:49,709
It's my uncle's
fucking cabin, man.

756
00:48:49,839 --> 00:48:51,450
What fucking uncle?

757
00:48:51,580 --> 00:48:53,940
Look, you must be friends
with my cousin Stacy, right.

758
00:48:53,974 --> 00:48:55,778
You can't fucking
prove that, do better!

759
00:48:55,802 --> 00:48:56,802
Oh, come on!

760
00:48:56,846 --> 00:48:58,152
Do better!

761
00:48:58,283 --> 00:49:00,043
When we were 12, I
accidentally pushed her

762
00:49:00,067 --> 00:49:02,548
off the porch steps, that's why
she has that scar on her nose.

763
00:49:02,678 --> 00:49:07,292
Look, I'm a truck driver, I work
for a fucking carrier service.

764
00:49:07,422 --> 00:49:09,270
Been on the road for the past
three days, I got tired.

765
00:49:09,294 --> 00:49:11,252
I usually crash here if
I'm working the coast.

766
00:49:11,383 --> 00:49:13,187
If you're a truck
driver, where's your truck?

767
00:49:13,211 --> 00:49:15,058
It doesn't make it up
these roads, it's too muddy.

768
00:49:15,082 --> 00:49:17,041
It's down the road.

769
00:49:21,784 --> 00:49:23,351
Fucking-a.

770
00:49:23,482 --> 00:49:24,787
You scared the shit out of me!

771
00:49:26,224 --> 00:49:28,313
I fucking pissed myself.

772
00:49:28,443 --> 00:49:30,924
Fuck it, whatever, I'm
going back to the cabin.

773
00:49:50,944 --> 00:49:52,144
I'm sorry about earlier.

774
00:49:53,860 --> 00:49:55,253
No, I'm sorry.

775
00:49:55,383 --> 00:49:57,603
I almost took your fucking
head off with that bat.

776
00:50:01,041 --> 00:50:02,651
It's my bad.

777
00:50:02,782 --> 00:50:05,263
You don't have COVID or
anything like that, do you?

778
00:50:05,393 --> 00:50:09,484
No, I got tested before
I hit the road, so.

779
00:50:09,615 --> 00:50:12,055
You're kind of the first person
I've talked to in like a week.

780
00:50:14,707 --> 00:50:17,275
Cool.

781
00:50:20,365 --> 00:50:21,845
How did you walk all
the way out here?

782
00:50:21,888 --> 00:50:24,064
I mean, it's kind of far
from the main road.

783
00:50:24,195 --> 00:50:25,674
I hiked in.

784
00:50:25,805 --> 00:50:27,937
I know these woods like
the back of my hand.

785
00:50:28,068 --> 00:50:30,288
Been coming here since
I was a little kid.

786
00:50:30,418 --> 00:50:32,899
So, you just truck
up and down the coast?

787
00:50:33,030 --> 00:50:34,770
You have, like, no
family or anything?

788
00:50:35,902 --> 00:50:38,296
I'm a little bit of a loner.

789
00:50:38,426 --> 00:50:41,212
I got something for you.

790
00:50:49,916 --> 00:50:51,483
Sorry.

791
00:50:51,918 --> 00:50:53,920
Sorry, I didn't mean
to scare you, I just...

792
00:50:56,183 --> 00:51:00,318
See, that's me and that's
Stacy when we were kids.

793
00:51:00,448 --> 00:51:01,710
All right?

794
00:51:03,321 --> 00:51:05,975
I'm not some fucking lunatic
that's going to kill you

795
00:51:06,106 --> 00:51:07,325
while you're sleeping.

796
00:51:09,022 --> 00:51:10,067
Yeah.

797
00:51:12,243 --> 00:51:13,655
If you don't mind me,
I think I'm just going

798
00:51:13,679 --> 00:51:19,076
to crawl back into my
little imagination here.

799
00:51:40,749 --> 00:51:42,055
What do you got here?

800
00:51:42,186 --> 00:51:43,752
DMT and salvia.

801
00:51:43,883 --> 00:51:46,451
Stacy, like, scored it off
some Silicon Valley dude.

802
00:51:46,581 --> 00:51:48,105
Hmm.

803
00:51:48,235 --> 00:51:50,716
Fuck it, let's smoke them
both at the same time.

804
00:51:53,806 --> 00:51:55,000
Okay, so, what's
the difference between

805
00:51:55,024 --> 00:51:56,548
DMT and salvia?

806
00:51:56,678 --> 00:51:58,352
You've never smoked
this shit before?

807
00:51:58,376 --> 00:51:59,376
No.

808
00:52:00,856 --> 00:52:01,988
All right.

809
00:52:04,033 --> 00:52:07,298
So, both, you know, they're
both pretty fucking awesome.

810
00:52:07,428 --> 00:52:12,303
But with salvia, you can
experience cartoon-like visuals,

811
00:52:12,433 --> 00:52:15,523
uncontrollable laughter,
feeling of being stretched

812
00:52:15,654 --> 00:52:19,048
or twisted and, my personal
favorite, believing that

813
00:52:19,179 --> 00:52:21,442
you're in more than once
place at the same time.

814
00:52:21,573 --> 00:52:23,096
Holy shit.

815
00:52:23,227 --> 00:52:24,706
Yeah.

816
00:52:24,837 --> 00:52:26,665
Okay, what about DMT?

817
00:52:26,795 --> 00:52:27,796
Okay.

818
00:52:29,233 --> 00:52:30,756
Now, with DMT, the
hallucinations are

819
00:52:30,886 --> 00:52:32,236
a little more visual.

820
00:52:32,366 --> 00:52:35,064
So, objects can sometimes
turn into animals.

821
00:52:35,195 --> 00:52:37,545
And...

822
00:52:37,676 --> 00:52:41,158
the trip is really short, but
sometimes it can feel like it

823
00:52:41,288 --> 00:52:44,161
lasts forever, even longer.

824
00:52:45,684 --> 00:52:46,772
Well, fuck.

825
00:52:46,902 --> 00:52:48,687
Um...

826
00:52:48,817 --> 00:52:51,820
all right, let's
flip a coin for it.

827
00:52:53,518 --> 00:52:54,954
Good song.

828
00:52:55,084 --> 00:53:00,438
Heads I do DMT, tails
salvia, vice versa.

829
00:53:00,568 --> 00:53:01,569
Okay.

830
00:53:03,397 --> 00:53:05,791
Fuck, I'm doing DMT.

831
00:53:05,921 --> 00:53:07,445
All right.

832
00:53:07,575 --> 00:53:08,837
I'm scared!

833
00:53:08,968 --> 00:53:10,448
Why, come on, don't be scared.

834
00:53:10,578 --> 00:53:13,320
Come on, we'll do them at
the same time, all right?

835
00:53:16,149 --> 00:53:21,023
So, you really don't
need too much.

836
00:53:22,982 --> 00:53:24,940
Go on, get in there.

837
00:53:25,071 --> 00:53:26,638
Oh my God.

838
00:53:26,768 --> 00:53:27,987
All right.

839
00:53:28,117 --> 00:53:29,117
On the count of three.

840
00:53:29,206 --> 00:53:29,989
Okay.

841
00:53:30,119 --> 00:53:31,382
One...

842
00:53:33,340 --> 00:53:34,340
two...

843
00:53:36,082 --> 00:53:37,083
three.

844
00:53:43,089 --> 00:53:44,351
Hold it in.

845
00:53:44,482 --> 00:53:45,961
Hold that shit in.

846
00:53:53,273 --> 00:53:57,538

866

Oh, could COVID
just be over already?

867
00:55:32,459 --> 00:55:35,810
Us being restricted in this
house and not being able

868
00:55:35,941 --> 00:55:38,770
to go out and do anything, I
feel like it's so ridiculous.

869
00:55:38,900 --> 00:55:40,946
If I had anything to say
to America right now,

870
00:55:41,076 --> 00:55:43,340
I would just say, like,
you don't even understand

871
00:55:43,470 --> 00:55:45,037
how hard this has been for us.

872
00:55:45,167 --> 00:55:46,386
Like, you don't understand.

873
00:55:47,909 --> 00:55:49,302
Yo, Lindsey.

874
00:55:50,434 --> 00:55:51,609
Where you going, man?

875
00:55:51,739 --> 00:55:52,803
I'm just going to go to bed.

876
00:55:52,827 --> 00:55:53,891
Why don't you sleep down here?

877
00:55:53,915 --> 00:55:55,264
Sleep down here?

878
00:55:55,395 --> 00:55:56,851
Yeah, why don't
you sleep down here,

879
00:55:56,875 --> 00:55:58,311
there's another room for you.

880
00:55:58,790 --> 00:56:02,446
To America, I just want
to say wear your masks,

881
00:56:02,576 --> 00:56:07,407
stay home, stay safe, and
just do your part, okay?

882
00:56:08,800 --> 00:56:10,279
Woo!

883
00:56:12,064 --> 00:56:14,109
I cannot believe
that she just did that.

884
00:56:55,629 --> 00:56:56,761
Jake?

885
00:57:12,864 --> 00:57:13,908
Oof.

886
00:57:14,039 --> 00:57:15,388
What the fuck?

887
00:57:15,519 --> 00:57:17,319
Sorry, I didn't
mean to startle you.

888
00:57:19,174 --> 00:57:22,830
I just, I got an early start,
so I didn't want to wake you up.

889
00:57:22,961 --> 00:57:28,575
But, oh yeah, sorry about
the blood on the porch.

890
00:57:28,706 --> 00:57:31,448
There was a deer in the middle
of the road this morning,

891
00:57:31,578 --> 00:57:34,059
so I had to pull the fella off.

892
00:57:34,189 --> 00:57:37,323
Anyway, I changed
out the old wires,

893
00:57:37,454 --> 00:57:40,369
and your Wi-Fi
should be good to go.

894
00:57:40,500 --> 00:57:42,807
So, all I need is
your Hancock here.

895
00:57:44,330 --> 00:57:45,829
Did you just see
a guy here earlier?

896
00:57:45,853 --> 00:57:46,985
He has long hair.

897
00:57:49,814 --> 00:57:51,555
No, no, it's just you and me.

898
00:57:57,082 --> 00:57:58,562
All right.

899
00:57:58,692 --> 00:57:59,867
You have a good one.

900
00:57:59,998 --> 00:58:00,998
Yeah.

901
00:58:17,494 --> 00:58:18,495
Shit.

902
00:58:46,131 --> 00:58:47,524
You're not Sheriff Rodgers.

903
00:59:12,723 --> 00:59:17,162
Oh my God, you look
so pretty, look at you!

904
00:59:18,903 --> 00:59:20,513
Do you really think so?

905
00:59:20,644 --> 00:59:22,491
I mean, I can put this wig
on if you want me to.

906
00:59:22,515 --> 00:59:25,823
No, no, no, I love
you just the way you are.

907
00:59:25,953 --> 00:59:28,652
Hey, you never going to
believe what happened

908
00:59:28,782 --> 00:59:31,350
after the night that
we were dancing.

909
00:59:31,480 --> 00:59:34,179
My wife, she heard the music,
she came upstairs,

910
00:59:34,309 --> 00:59:36,311
we danced all night!

911
00:59:36,442 --> 00:59:38,966
I didn't know my girl was
so much into Marc Anthony.

912
00:59:39,097 --> 00:59:40,925
See, what did I tell you?

913
00:59:41,055 --> 00:59:42,883
I'm happy for you guys.

914
00:59:43,014 --> 00:59:44,102
All night.

915
00:59:44,232 --> 00:59:46,844
Oh yeah, I think we in love.

916
00:59:52,458 --> 00:59:53,633
Uh-oh.

917
00:59:55,156 --> 00:59:56,375
What happened?

918
01:00:06,037 --> 01:00:08,779
I'm sorry, I'm
just, I'm really tired.

919
01:00:08,909 --> 01:00:10,998
But I'm happy for you.

920
01:00:11,129 --> 01:00:12,565
You deserve something real.

921
01:00:26,361 --> 01:00:27,711
Hi, hubby.

922
01:00:27,841 --> 01:00:30,191
You lying, cheating little slut.

923
01:00:30,322 --> 01:00:31,922
Please don't
talk to me like that.

924
01:00:32,019 --> 01:00:33,717
I can't believe
I've been saving myself

925
01:00:33,847 --> 01:00:35,240
for a whore!

926
01:00:35,370 --> 01:00:37,010
I said, don't talk
to me like that!

927
01:00:38,547 --> 01:00:39,940
Okay, wifey!

928
01:01:31,557 --> 01:01:32,906
Is someone there?

929
01:01:51,795 --> 01:01:52,795
Hey.

930
01:01:53,710 --> 01:01:55,363
What are you doing?

931
01:01:56,625 --> 01:01:57,733
Why are you chasing me?

932
01:01:57,757 --> 01:01:58,627
Chasing you?

933
01:01:58,758 --> 01:02:00,020
Why are you running from me?

934
01:02:01,282 --> 01:02:02,501
Have you seen Jake?

935
01:02:02,631 --> 01:02:03,632
Who?

936
01:02:03,763 --> 01:02:04,895
Stacy's cousin.

937
01:02:05,025 --> 01:02:06,070
No.

938
01:02:06,200 --> 01:02:07,245
Are you sure you're okay?

939
01:02:08,855 --> 01:02:10,117
What were you digging?

940
01:02:11,466 --> 01:02:12,598
A grave.

941
01:02:12,729 --> 01:02:14,339
What?

942
01:02:14,469 --> 01:02:16,428
I found a deer on
the side of the road.

943
01:02:16,558 --> 01:02:21,476
The odor of a decomposing
carcass tends to attract bears.

944
01:02:21,607 --> 01:02:23,696
Poor thing.

945
01:02:23,827 --> 01:02:25,132
Mind helping?

946
01:02:36,404 --> 01:02:38,624
So, how was the
rest of your night?

947
01:02:41,496 --> 01:02:43,716
I was with you last night.

948
01:02:43,847 --> 01:02:47,198
No, I mean after
I dropped you off.

949
01:02:50,027 --> 01:02:52,769
After you left,
Stacy's cousin came over

950
01:02:52,899 --> 01:02:56,294
and we just hung out.

951
01:02:58,557 --> 01:03:00,080
Oh.

952
01:03:00,211 --> 01:03:01,473
Fun.

953
01:03:10,656 --> 01:03:12,571
It's a sin to leave the
dead without a grave.

954
01:03:19,970 --> 01:03:21,580
Hey, would you grab my smokes?

955
01:03:23,451 --> 01:03:24,626
Yeah, sure.

956
01:03:26,019 --> 01:03:27,194
Where are they?

957
01:03:27,325 --> 01:03:28,848
On the bag.

958
01:03:29,544 --> 01:03:32,199
Right next to you.

959
01:03:41,774 --> 01:03:43,863
Oh my God, are you okay?

960
01:03:43,994 --> 01:03:45,952
My ankle!

961
01:03:54,874 --> 01:03:56,223
Would you give me a hand?

962
01:04:01,794 --> 01:04:02,839
Please?

963
01:04:21,031 --> 01:04:22,293
Thanks.

964
01:04:22,423 --> 01:04:23,555
Here you go.

965
01:04:33,565 --> 01:04:36,873
I don't know about you,
but I'm starving.

966
01:04:39,440 --> 01:04:40,746
How about I cook us dinner?

967
01:04:43,227 --> 01:04:45,185
Come on, you're, you're hurt.

968
01:04:47,753 --> 01:04:49,537
I'm used to being hurt.

969
01:04:54,673 --> 01:05:00,157
Is there a sweater or a
blanket that I could borrow?

970
01:05:00,287 --> 01:05:02,028
Sorry, I'm just freezing.

971
01:05:02,159 --> 01:05:03,812
Yeah, go upstairs.

972
01:05:03,943 --> 01:05:05,423
A bunch of my ex's
stuff in the room.

973
01:05:05,553 --> 01:05:07,773
I'll fire up the stove.

974
01:05:10,341 --> 01:05:11,341
Okay.

975
01:05:13,300 --> 01:05:14,300
Sorry.

976
01:05:14,345 --> 01:05:15,476
Sorry!

977
01:05:50,207 --> 01:05:51,904
Fuck!

978
01:07:06,326 --> 01:07:08,285
I think you're really beautiful.

979
01:07:10,374 --> 01:07:11,462
Mmm.

980
01:07:19,122 --> 01:07:21,080
Kim and Max Daniels.

981
01:07:21,211 --> 01:07:24,388
They live next door, they're
really cool, young couple.

982
01:07:24,518 --> 01:07:26,738
Unfortunately, they're gone.

983
01:07:26,868 --> 01:07:28,044
Gone?

984
01:07:40,752 --> 01:07:42,493
Dinner's ready.

985
01:07:58,378 --> 01:08:02,078
So, tell me more
about you, Vicky.

986
01:08:04,993 --> 01:08:07,953
Not to pry, but when I was at
your place the other night

987
01:08:08,084 --> 01:08:11,435
I noticed you had a
webcam site open.

988
01:08:13,350 --> 01:08:17,223
If you don't mind me asking,
what do you do on there?

989
01:08:20,531 --> 01:08:22,446
It's not a big deal.

990
01:08:22,576 --> 01:08:24,143
It's like, umm...

991
01:08:26,667 --> 01:08:27,886
Sharing content.

992
01:08:33,326 --> 01:08:34,501
Stuff like that.

993
01:08:36,024 --> 01:08:37,113
Uh-huh.

994
01:08:39,767 --> 01:08:40,899
Hmm.

995
01:08:43,467 --> 01:08:46,557
18 &amp; Over, that's
what you're on, right?

996
01:08:46,687 --> 01:08:48,950
Mm-hmm.

997
01:08:49,081 --> 01:08:52,389
I've heard that site's
become such a popular hub

998
01:08:52,519 --> 01:08:56,306
for sex workers that it's
saturated the market.

999
01:08:56,436 --> 01:08:59,483
I didn't even know
that was possible,

1000
01:08:59,613 --> 01:09:01,615
oversaturating the
world sex market.

1001
01:09:07,360 --> 01:09:10,233
What a world we live in!

1002
01:09:10,363 --> 01:09:12,060
Those poor suckers.

1003
01:09:19,938 --> 01:09:25,770
Can you believe there's
whores tricking men into

1004
01:09:25,900 --> 01:09:28,425
falling in love with
them for money!

1005
01:09:36,476 --> 01:09:38,522
What did you put in my drink?

1006
01:09:38,652 --> 01:09:41,133
Promises, promises.

1007
01:09:41,264 --> 01:09:45,137
All I hear is false promises.

1008
01:09:45,268 --> 01:09:48,401
But you're all the
f-f-fucking same.

1009
01:09:50,273 --> 01:09:52,362
Every...

1010
01:09:52,492 --> 01:09:54,581
last...

1011
01:09:54,712 --> 01:09:55,930
one of you.

1012
01:10:02,546 --> 01:10:05,418
Guys, I have some bad news.

1013
01:10:05,549 --> 01:10:08,204
One of you will be going home.

1014
01:10:09,901 --> 01:10:12,469
One of you was beyond
and put us all at risk.

1015
01:10:16,342 --> 01:10:19,215
Kim, you're going home.

1016
01:10:19,345 --> 01:10:21,521
Really, after all that?

1017
01:10:21,652 --> 01:10:23,741
I was at a protest!

1018
01:10:23,871 --> 01:10:26,309
No, bitch, you were at a party.

1019
01:10:26,439 --> 01:10:28,789
The fuck was she
thinking, going to a party?

1020
01:10:28,920 --> 01:10:30,593
She's literally
the one that always has

1021
01:10:30,617 --> 01:10:32,532
a visor on her face!

1022
01:10:32,663 --> 01:10:33,863
It's just not fair, okay!

1023
01:10:33,968 --> 01:10:35,274
Bye.

1024
01:10:35,405 --> 01:10:36,860
It's okay, it's all right,
it's all right.

1025
01:10:36,884 --> 01:10:38,364
Come on, then, it's fine.

1026
01:10:38,495 --> 01:10:39,757
It's so sad.

1027
01:10:41,237 --> 01:10:43,021
Oh my God, get away!
Get out!

1028
01:10:43,151 --> 01:10:44,311
I don't think it's fair.

1029
01:10:44,370 --> 01:10:45,545
Like, give me a warning.

1030
01:10:45,676 --> 01:10:47,504
I'll take another COVID test!

1031
01:10:47,634 --> 01:10:49,046
So, that's what happens when you

1032
01:10:49,070 --> 01:10:50,594
don't follow the rules.

1033
01:10:50,724 --> 01:10:52,813
Actually, it was just one rule.

1034
01:10:52,944 --> 01:10:56,077
All you guys had to do
is stay in this mansion.

1035
01:10:56,208 --> 01:10:59,298
Believe me, life could be worse.

1036
01:10:59,429 --> 01:11:02,301
Everyone in America is doing
the same thing right now.

1037
01:11:02,432 --> 01:11:06,523
You're all very lucky to
be here, so act like it.

1038
01:11:15,575 --> 01:11:17,360
Hi, sleeping beauty.

1039
01:11:21,407 --> 01:11:22,800
What did you do to me?

1040
01:11:25,411 --> 01:11:26,693
Please, please, get me
out of this.

1041
01:11:26,717 --> 01:11:27,848
Why would you do this?

1042
01:11:27,979 --> 01:11:30,460
Are you really asking me why?

1043
01:11:30,590 --> 01:11:36,727
Do you have any idea what
I've d-done to be with you?

1044
01:11:36,857 --> 01:11:39,207
Please, please, you
don't have to do this!

1045
01:11:39,338 --> 01:11:43,211
You said you wanted to marry me.

1046
01:11:43,690 --> 01:11:46,824
You said you wanted a ring.

1047
01:11:46,954 --> 01:11:48,565
I got you a ring.

1048
01:11:53,744 --> 01:11:59,880
I want you to put your money
where your mouth is...

1049
01:12:02,666 --> 01:12:03,797
wifey.

1050
01:12:19,596 --> 01:12:21,859
Baby, did you really
do this all for me?

1051
01:12:25,166 --> 01:12:27,125
Why don't you uncuff me first?

1052
01:12:29,780 --> 01:12:32,478
If you want to propose to me...

1053
01:12:32,609 --> 01:12:34,872
I want you to do it right.

1054
01:12:40,356 --> 01:12:42,445
How can you love me
if you don't trust me?

1055
01:12:44,838 --> 01:12:46,144
Trust is important.

1056
01:13:02,421 --> 01:13:05,424
This was my grandmother's.

1057
01:13:05,555 --> 01:13:11,822
I told my mom all about you,
and she gave it to me for you.

1058
01:13:14,477 --> 01:13:16,261
It's beautiful.

1059
01:13:16,392 --> 01:13:20,439
Vicky, will you m-m...

1060
01:13:20,570 --> 01:13:22,441
marry me?

1061
01:13:22,572 --> 01:13:24,051
Yes.

1062
01:13:31,972 --> 01:13:32,972
Holy shit.

1063
01:13:36,847 --> 01:13:38,718
She, she said yes.

1064
01:13:38,849 --> 01:13:41,547
She said yes.

1065
01:13:41,678 --> 01:13:42,983
She said yes.

1066
01:13:59,522 --> 01:14:00,827
You're a fucking liar.

1067
01:14:03,700 --> 01:14:05,049
You're just trying to use me.

1068
01:14:13,013 --> 01:14:14,754
Am I?

1069
01:14:14,885 --> 01:14:16,364
Oh my God.

1070
01:14:35,166 --> 01:14:37,734
I've always wanted
you to be my husband.

1071
01:14:45,132 --> 01:14:47,265
Baby, close your eyes.

1072
01:14:50,355 --> 01:14:53,532
Because I'm going to blow
your fucking mind.

1073
01:14:59,756 --> 01:15:00,756
Fuck you!

1074
01:16:24,188 --> 01:16:25,406
Ahh!

1075
01:16:26,669 --> 01:16:27,757
No, no, no!

1076
01:16:27,887 --> 01:16:28,714
Hey, hey, hey! Vicky!

1077
01:16:28,845 --> 01:16:29,933
No!

1078
01:16:30,063 --> 01:16:31,084
Vicky, Vicky, hey, hey, hey!

1079
01:16:31,108 --> 01:16:32,108
It's me, it's me.

1080
01:16:32,196 --> 01:16:33,240
Jake, Jake!

1081
01:16:33,371 --> 01:16:34,391
Come here, come here.

1082
01:16:34,415 --> 01:16:35,547
Jake!

1083
01:16:35,678 --> 01:16:36,829
What happened, are you okay?

1084
01:16:36,853 --> 01:16:38,506
No, he's going to kill me!

1085
01:16:38,637 --> 01:16:39,507
Who's going to kill you?
No, we don't have time!

1086
01:16:39,638 --> 01:16:41,031
Who's going to kill you?

1087
01:16:41,161 --> 01:16:42,356
Jake, please,
listen to me, he's not Max.

1088
01:16:42,380 --> 01:16:43,749
He killed the whole
family, come on!

1089
01:16:43,773 --> 01:16:44,904
Come here, talk to me!

1090
01:16:45,035 --> 01:16:46,514
Stop, shh!

1091
01:16:48,125 --> 01:16:49,213
He's here.

1092
01:16:52,042 --> 01:16:53,086
Come on, Jake.

1093
01:16:53,217 --> 01:16:54,348
Who is that?

1094
01:16:54,479 --> 01:16:55,349
Please, trust me, we have to go!

1095
01:16:55,480 --> 01:16:56,786
Jake!

1096
01:16:56,916 --> 01:16:59,005
Go, go, go, now,
go, get out of here, go!

1097
01:17:12,453 --> 01:17:14,673
Who's there?

1098
01:17:20,026 --> 01:17:21,985
Where the fuck are you?

1099
01:17:22,115 --> 01:17:24,204
Where the fuck are you?

1100
01:17:24,988 --> 01:17:26,293
Come on!

1101
01:17:26,424 --> 01:17:28,426
Let's fucking go, huh!

1102
01:17:31,516 --> 01:17:34,650
Where the fuck are you,
you fucking... Ah, fuck!

1103
01:17:42,570 --> 01:17:44,181
Ahh, fuck!

1104
01:17:45,573 --> 01:17:46,618
Hiya, Jake.

1105
01:17:46,749 --> 01:17:47,750
What the fuck!

1106
01:17:52,319 --> 01:17:53,514
Sheriff, it's me, Vicky.

1107
01:17:53,538 --> 01:17:55,061
The Crowbar Killer, he's here!

1108
01:17:55,192 --> 01:17:56,832
Please, please, you have
to come here now!

1109
01:17:56,889 --> 01:17:59,544
Please help me, please!

1110
01:17:59,675 --> 01:18:00,806
Can you hear me?

1111
01:18:00,937 --> 01:18:02,155
Help, please!

1112
01:18:04,897 --> 01:18:05,985
Lou.

1113
01:18:06,116 --> 01:18:07,552
Hey, Vi...

1114
01:18:07,683 --> 01:18:09,356
I'm at 56 Woodland Drive
in Weed, California.

1115
01:18:09,380 --> 01:18:11,314
There's someone trying to
kill me, please, please,

1116
01:18:11,338 --> 01:18:12,905
call for help!

1117
01:18:13,036 --> 01:18:15,156
I'm calling them
now, I'm calling them now.

1118
01:18:25,091 --> 01:18:26,919
Honey...

1119
01:18:27,050 --> 01:18:28,312
I'm home.

1120
01:18:36,712 --> 01:18:39,671
I know I'm not the most...

1121
01:18:39,802 --> 01:18:41,238
traditional guy.

1122
01:18:42,674 --> 01:18:43,980
But I...

1123
01:18:47,157 --> 01:18:51,988
do expect to be with my future
wife the night we got engaged.

1124
01:18:55,643 --> 01:18:57,907
Can we just talk about it?

1125
01:19:04,870 --> 01:19:06,089
What the fuck!

1126
01:19:06,219 --> 01:19:07,394
You fucking touch her!

1127
01:19:07,525 --> 01:19:09,005
I'll come find you!

1128
01:19:09,135 --> 01:19:11,485
I just called the cops,
you crazy son of a bitch!

1129
01:19:11,616 --> 01:19:12,616
Ahh!

1130
01:19:23,671 --> 01:19:26,805
I killed that ungrateful
boyfriend of yours.

1131
01:19:26,936 --> 01:19:29,373
You know he wasn't
right for you.

1132
01:19:29,503 --> 01:19:31,462
You should be thanking me,
you know.

1133
01:19:33,899 --> 01:19:37,903
What else do I have to do
to prove my love to you?

1134
01:19:38,034 --> 01:19:39,209
Tell me!

1135
01:19:53,049 --> 01:19:54,615
That wasn't very nice.

1136
01:20:07,498 --> 01:20:10,414
Got to tell you, honey,
you have been just as

1137
01:20:10,544 --> 01:20:14,244
disappointing as the rest
of those lying bitches.

1138
01:20:26,952 --> 01:20:28,084
Vicky!

1139
01:20:30,347 --> 01:20:32,175
Are you fucking
kidding me right now?

1140
01:20:32,915 --> 01:20:34,220
Let's go, mother fucker.

1141
01:20:35,918 --> 01:20:36,962
Come on.

1142
01:20:41,097 --> 01:20:43,099
God damn it!

1143
01:21:09,516 --> 01:21:11,170
Sorry, buddy...

1144
01:21:11,301 --> 01:21:13,738
nobody likes a third wheel.

1145
01:21:24,923 --> 01:21:27,273
No!

1146
01:21:59,653 --> 01:22:03,353
I always knew you'd stab me
in the back, you b-b-bitch.

1147
01:22:06,486 --> 01:22:07,748
Fuck you!

1148
01:22:34,427 --> 01:22:35,994
It's over.

1149
01:22:53,316 --> 01:22:55,100
I can't watch, I can't...

1150
01:23:09,027 --> 01:23:10,027
Oh my God, girl, just...

1151
01:23:10,115 --> 01:23:11,377
Yeah, right?

1152
01:23:11,508 --> 01:23:12,659
I knew it was
him the whole time.

1153
01:23:12,683 --> 01:23:13,703
I knew it was him
the whole time!

1154
01:23:13,727 --> 01:23:14,772
You did not, you did not!

1155
01:23:14,902 --> 01:23:16,426
Listen to what he's saying!

1156
01:23:16,556 --> 01:23:17,794
Max, Max, Max, I knew
it was him the whole time.

1157
01:23:17,818 --> 01:23:19,178
Why did, how did you know?

1158
01:23:19,255 --> 01:23:20,082
Literally why are
you throwing popcorn?

1159
01:23:20,212 --> 01:23:21,518
It's already a mess in here.

1160
01:23:21,648 --> 01:23:23,408
Hey, yo, who
was the Crowbar Killer?

1161
01:23:24,347 --> 01:23:25,587
Max, you fucking idiot.

1162
01:23:27,219 --> 01:23:28,916
But I thought for sure
it was Jake.

1163
01:23:29,047 --> 01:23:31,832
Like, literally, he was too good
to be true, too nice, too much.

1164
01:23:31,963 --> 01:23:34,096
Have you ever
webcammed, yes or no?

1165
01:23:34,618 --> 01:23:38,361
Of course, of course,
newsflash, look it, look it.

1166
01:23:38,491 --> 01:23:39,840
Of course.

1167
01:23:39,971 --> 01:23:41,340
Nobody asked you,
you analytical asshole.

1168
01:23:41,364 --> 01:23:43,204
I can't believe
that we're in a movie.

1169
01:23:43,235 --> 01:23:44,584
A freaking movie!

1170
01:23:44,715 --> 01:23:46,195
Seriously, though?

1171
01:23:46,325 --> 01:23:47,433
Aren't you guys seeing
what I'm seeing here.

1172
01:23:47,457 --> 01:23:49,285
They're exploiting all of us.

1173
01:23:49,415 --> 01:23:50,982
They're exploiting us!

1174
01:23:51,113 --> 01:23:52,220
I think you're
being overdramatic.

1175
01:23:52,244 --> 01:23:53,289
Uh-uh...

1176
01:23:53,419 --> 01:23:54,419
You're so loud!

1177
01:23:54,507 --> 01:23:55,291
Your face is loud!

1178
01:23:55,421 --> 01:23:56,553
Oh!

1179
01:23:56,683 --> 01:23:58,043
That's right, you heard me.

1180
01:23:59,556 --> 01:24:00,576
And, girl, you're laughing!

1181
01:24:00,600 --> 01:24:01,862
You're laughing!

1182
01:24:01,993 --> 01:24:03,473
And you better shut up.

1183
01:24:03,603 --> 01:24:05,214
Eat your cereal.

1184
01:24:05,344 --> 01:24:07,346
Eat your cereal and shut
up, please, thank you.

1185
01:24:07,477 --> 01:24:08,695
Thank you!

1186
01:24:08,826 --> 01:24:10,567
You know what, fuck
you guys, I'm done.

1187
01:24:10,697 --> 01:24:11,481
Do it again!

1188
01:24:11,611 --> 01:24:12,699
Bye!

1189
01:24:12,830 --> 01:24:13,981
This is why nobody likes you!

1190
01:24:14,005 --> 01:24:14,745
All right, you know what...

1191
01:24:14,875 --> 01:24:15,876
Fuck you!

1192
01:24:16,007 --> 01:24:16,834
It's just a stupid movie.

1193
01:24:16,964 --> 01:24:18,531
Let's just get a drink...

1194
01:24:18,662 --> 01:24:20,118

reason why I'm not joining

18 &amp; Over.

1196
01:24:35,896 --> 01:24:37,898
I wonder if they do a sequel

1197
01:24:38,029 --> 01:24:39,900
if they'll bring us back.

1198
01:24:53,827 --> 01:24:54,872

Get ready, number three.

We're coming over to you in five seconds.

6
00:02:12,471 --> 00:02:13,887
Excuse me, sir.

7
00:02:37,932 --> 00:02:39,012
Yes, what is it?

8
00:02:39,013 --> 00:02:40,845
The CT wants you in his office, sir.

00:02:40,846 --> 00:02:41,678
Oh.

10
00:02:41,679 --> 00:02:42,554
Take over, Bill, will you?

11
00:02:42,555 --> 00:02:43,471
The CT wants me.

12
00:02:43,472 --> 00:02:45,095
Okay.

13
00:02:45,096 --> 00:02:46,845
And now would you show us, in close up,

14
00:02:46,846 --> 00:02:48,470
what you are going to demonstrate.

15
00:02:48,471 --> 00:02:50,053
When the camera's in close up.

16
00:02:50,054 --> 00:02:52,178
This is the tawny, or brown owl.

17
00:02:52,179 --> 00:02:54,511
The kind we get in the London parks,

18
00:02:54,512 --> 00:02:55,595
and a very useful.

19
00:02:55,596 --> 00:02:58,845
Oh, oh, no, no, no, no.

20
00:02:58,846 --> 00:03:00,303
First of all, the wings,

21
00:03:00,304 --> 00:03:01,845
well, just like that.

22
00:03:01,846 --> 00:03:02,928
I hope that comes off.

23
00:03:02,929 --> 00:03:05,136
- The beak and the...
- Excuse me, sir,

24
00:03:05,137 --> 00:03:06,386
the CT wants you.

25
00:03:06,387 --> 00:03:07,636
Right.

26
00:03:07,637 --> 00:03:09,345
The CT wants you in his office.

27
00:03:09,346 --> 00:03:10,346
Oh, dear.

28
00:03:15,418 --> 00:03:16,678
- Hello there.
- Hi.

29
00:03:16,679 --> 00:03:17,512
What's all this in aid of?

30
00:03:17,513 --> 00:03:19,345
Prentice has an idea
for a new programme,

31
00:03:19,346 --> 00:03:21,053
another spelling bee,
I shouldn't surprised.

32
00:03:21,054 --> 00:03:22,095
That takes me out.

33
00:03:22,096 --> 00:03:23,836
I can't spell my own name.

34
00:03:25,887 --> 00:03:27,553
Ah, gentlemen, come in.

35
00:03:27,554 --> 00:03:28,803
Sit down, won't you?

36
00:03:28,804 --> 00:03:30,304
I won't keep you long.

37
00:03:31,356 --> 00:03:33,636
Well, I've called you here together

38
00:03:33,637 --> 00:03:35,428
to discuss a rather interesting proposal

39
00:03:35,429 --> 00:03:37,289
put out by Mr. Prentice here.

40
00:03:37,290 --> 00:03:39,803
You know, those of us
who've been in television

41
00:03:39,804 --> 00:03:42,053
since the beginning realise
that nothing succeeds

42
00:03:42,054 --> 00:03:44,386
like a series or a serial.

43
00:03:44,387 --> 00:03:47,262
I almost said nothing
succeeds like excess.

44
00:03:48,887 --> 00:03:50,553
Rather like advertising.

45
00:03:50,554 --> 00:03:51,803
Repeat a thing often enough

46
00:03:51,804 --> 00:03:52,928
and everybody has to buy it,

47
00:03:52,929 --> 00:03:55,303
whether they really like it or not.

48
00:03:55,304 --> 00:03:58,803
In fact, the DG sometimes
says, jokingly of course,

49
00:03:58,804 --> 00:04:00,970
that if one televised a few pages

50
00:04:00,971 --> 00:04:02,595
of the London telephone directory

51
00:04:02,596 --> 00:04:04,678
regularly for five or six weeks,

52
00:04:04,679 --> 00:04:08,345
one would gain an average
audience of over 10 million,

53
00:04:08,346 --> 00:04:10,386
which brings us to Mr. Prentice.

54
00:04:10,387 --> 00:04:12,678
All right, David, tell us your idea.

55
00:04:12,679 --> 00:04:14,095
Thank you, sir.

56
00:04:14,096 --> 00:04:16,053
Would you mind if I took off my coat, sir?

57
00:04:16,054 --> 00:04:17,720
Why, is it hot in here?

58
00:04:17,721 --> 00:04:19,928
No, but I always think
better with it off.

59
00:04:19,929 --> 00:04:21,470
Remove it, by all means.

60
00:04:21,471 --> 00:04:22,845
Thank you, sir.

61
00:04:22,846 --> 00:04:24,886
Well now, my plan, in a nutshell,

62
00:04:24,887 --> 00:04:28,011
is to put on every evening
at a peak viewing hour

63
00:04:28,012 --> 00:04:31,303
a programme that will, well,
that will mirror the lives

64
00:04:31,304 --> 00:04:34,428
of an ordinary, happily
married husband and wife.

65
00:04:34,429 --> 00:04:36,095
We show their ups and downs,

66
00:04:36,096 --> 00:04:38,720
their, well, the fun they get out of life,

67
00:04:38,721 --> 00:04:41,845
the minor tragedies that
inevitably creep in their lives,

68
00:04:41,846 --> 00:04:44,053
their hobbies, what they're talking about,

69
00:04:44,054 --> 00:04:46,636
thinking, reading, and
so on, so on, and so on.

70
00:04:46,637 --> 00:04:49,178
A sort of ""Mrs. Dale's Diary,"" in fact.

71
00:04:49,179 --> 00:04:50,720
Oh no, no, nothing like that.

72
00:04:50,721 --> 00:04:53,095
We want an actual real-life couple

73
00:04:53,096 --> 00:04:55,678
with genuine glamour and
excitement in their lives.

74
00:04:55,679 --> 00:04:58,220
And whose fundamental interest
is a contented home life.

75
00:04:58,221 --> 00:04:59,054
Exactly.

76
00:04:59,055 --> 00:05:00,511
You'll never find them, old boy.

77
00:05:00,512 --> 00:05:01,678
Why not?

78
00:05:01,679 --> 00:05:03,428
I mean, we can pick a well
known actor and actress

79
00:05:03,429 --> 00:05:04,886
who also happen to be married.

80
00:05:04,887 --> 00:05:06,053
And how do you know they still will be

81
00:05:06,054 --> 00:05:07,970
by the time you get to
the second programme?

82
00:05:07,971 --> 00:05:09,803
That's a sound point, Johnson.

83
00:05:09,804 --> 00:05:10,928
But there are several of them

84
00:05:10,929 --> 00:05:12,720
that have been happily married for years.

85
00:05:12,721 --> 00:05:13,928
Such as?

86
00:05:13,929 --> 00:05:15,511
The Attenboroughs.

87
00:05:15,512 --> 00:05:16,553
The Oliviers.

88
00:05:16,554 --> 00:05:17,720
I think we can do better than that.

89
00:05:17,721 --> 00:05:19,678
What about the Fosters?

90
00:05:19,679 --> 00:05:20,512
Hmm.

91
00:05:20,513 --> 00:05:21,928
They've been married for years.

92
00:05:21,929 --> 00:05:22,887
Both of them have been stars

93
00:05:22,888 --> 00:05:24,095
for as long as I can remember.

94
00:05:24,096 --> 00:05:26,916
And, sir, absolutely
devoted to one another.

95
00:05:28,554 --> 00:05:30,095
Just a minute, Laura!

96
00:05:30,096 --> 00:05:31,096

97
00:05:31,804 --> 00:05:32,804

00:05:38,179 --> 00:05:39,553

Not till you apologise!

101
00:05:40,887 --> 00:05:42,053
I'll break it down first!

102
00:05:42,054 --> 00:05:43,261
Just you try!

103
00:05:43,262 --> 00:05:44,199
Cad!

104
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:45,137
Slut!

105
00:05:45,138 --> 00:05:46,761
- Beast!
- Trollop!

106
00:05:46,762 --> 00:05:47,595
Ooh!

107
00:05:47,596 --> 00:05:48,429
You called, sir?

108
00:05:48,430 --> 00:05:49,470
Simon!

109
00:05:49,471 --> 00:05:51,220
I was addressing my wife.

110
00:05:51,221 --> 00:05:53,303
- I'll make lunch.
- Open this door!

111
00:05:53,304 --> 00:05:54,221
You know

112
00:05:54,222 --> 00:05:55,261
- what happened last time!
- Wilson?

113
00:05:55,262 --> 00:05:56,095
Sir?

114
00:05:56,096 --> 00:05:56,929
- I'll call the police!
- What time is the next

115
00:05:56,930 --> 00:05:58,095
presentable train for Leicester?

116
00:05:58,096 --> 00:05:59,345
Discriminating travellers

117
00:05:59,346 --> 00:06:02,053
speak very highly of the 1:25, sir.

118
00:06:02,054 --> 00:06:02,887
Good.

119
00:06:02,888 --> 00:06:03,970
Now, nip around to Cook's
and get me a ticket.

120
00:06:03,971 --> 00:06:06,178
- One, sir?
- One, single.

121
00:06:06,179 --> 00:06:08,179
Try and get me a corner seat.

122
00:06:09,538 --> 00:06:10,678
What do you want?

123
00:06:10,679 --> 00:06:11,512
Money, sir.

124
00:06:11,513 --> 00:06:12,553
I am temporarily embarrassed.

125
00:06:12,554 --> 00:06:14,595
Well, take it out of
the housekeeping money.

126
00:06:14,596 --> 00:06:16,345
The housekeeping is
also embarrassed, sir.

127
00:06:16,346 --> 00:06:17,179
Well, scrape it up somehow.

128
00:06:17,180 --> 00:06:18,012
Excuse me, sir.

129
00:06:18,013 --> 00:06:20,345
Someone seems to be knocking, sir.

130
00:06:20,346 --> 00:06:23,136
- Open this!
- All right, well answer it.

131
00:06:23,137 --> 00:06:24,303
There's the key.

132
00:06:24,304 --> 00:06:26,136
Thank you very much, sir.

133
00:06:26,137 --> 00:06:28,304
Will you open this door?

134
00:06:29,512 --> 00:06:30,512
Simon!

135
00:06:31,221 --> 00:06:32,804
You nasty old hand!

136
00:06:34,346 --> 00:06:37,636
You!

137
00:06:37,637 --> 00:06:39,428
Thank you, Wilson.

138
00:06:39,429 --> 00:06:40,629
A pleasure, madam.

139
00:06:41,512 --> 00:06:42,512
Hello?

140
00:06:42,513 --> 00:06:45,595
May I speak to Mr. Burton, please?

141
00:06:45,596 --> 00:06:46,429
Don't give me that.

142
00:06:46,430 --> 00:06:48,595
Bertie hasn't made a round
of the studios for 20 years.

143
00:06:48,596 --> 00:06:50,996
Tell him I'll be there in 10 minutes.

144
00:06:54,471 --> 00:06:55,720
Wilson!

145
00:06:55,721 --> 00:06:56,845
Bring me a suitcase.

146
00:06:56,846 --> 00:06:58,136
- I have it here, sir.
- Good.

147
00:06:58,137 --> 00:06:59,877
And your clean shirts, sir.

148
00:07:08,429 --> 00:07:11,220
Are you, um, planning to go somewhere?

149
00:07:11,221 --> 00:07:12,553
Yes, home to Mother.

150
00:07:12,554 --> 00:07:13,470
For long?

151
00:07:13,471 --> 00:07:14,387
For good.

152
00:07:14,388 --> 00:07:15,845
Then you'd better take this scarf.

153
00:07:15,846 --> 00:07:17,345
You'll probably need it.

154
00:07:17,346 --> 00:07:19,595
Your mother's house gets
very damp in the winter.

155
00:07:19,596 --> 00:07:20,720
Where did you get this?

156
00:07:20,721 --> 00:07:22,303
In your golf jacket.

157
00:07:22,304 --> 00:07:24,884
No wonder your handicap's gone up to 20.

158
00:07:24,885 --> 00:07:26,928
Laura, I've asked you
not to go through my things

159
00:07:26,929 --> 00:07:28,178
like a customs official.

160
00:07:28,179 --> 00:07:30,886
Hmm, I can well understand why.

161
00:07:30,887 --> 00:07:33,428
These I found in your golfing trousers.

162
00:07:33,429 --> 00:07:34,262
What are they?

163
00:07:34,263 --> 00:07:37,095
Their two tees, a hair
grip and an earring, sir.

164
00:07:37,096 --> 00:07:40,396
Ladies day at Sunningdale
must be quite an occasion.

165
00:07:40,397 --> 00:07:42,220
Wilson, I asked you to
go and get me a ticket.

166
00:07:42,221 --> 00:07:43,261
Yes, sir, at once, sir.

167
00:07:43,262 --> 00:07:45,178
It's just that I find the rapier thrusts

168
00:07:45,179 --> 00:07:48,928
of madam's conversation highly
stimulating, sir.

169
00:07:48,929 --> 00:07:49,929
Simon.

170
00:07:51,637 --> 00:07:55,095
Before you go, I, I just
want to say one thing.

171
00:07:55,096 --> 00:07:57,886
You left me permanently for
your mother's five times

172
00:07:57,887 --> 00:07:59,678
in the last three years.

173
00:07:59,679 --> 00:08:02,428
The average length of absence
has been about 10 weeks.

174
00:08:02,429 --> 00:08:04,428
Then you've appeared in that doorway

175
00:08:04,429 --> 00:08:06,428
with a nauseating smirk on your face

176
00:08:06,429 --> 00:08:08,678
and two dozen roses in your hand.

177
00:08:08,679 --> 00:08:10,636
And I, heaven forgive me, have said,

178
00:08:10,637 --> 00:08:13,011
""All right, come in.""

179
00:08:13,012 --> 00:08:14,845
Well, understand this, Simon.

180
00:08:14,846 --> 00:08:17,095
This time I'm not saying come in.

181
00:08:17,096 --> 00:08:19,636
And this time I'm not
wasting my money on roses.

182
00:08:19,637 --> 00:08:21,011
You didn't the last two times.

183
00:08:21,012 --> 00:08:23,803
The bill came in for the
florist, and I paid it.

184
00:08:23,804 --> 00:08:24,824
12, 15, 17, 19.

185
00:08:29,012 --> 00:08:30,303
22, 23.

186
00:08:30,304 --> 00:08:32,095
Hmm, still not enough.

187
00:08:32,096 --> 00:08:34,428
The governor'll never travel third class.

188
00:08:34,429 --> 00:08:36,829
Well, bang goes the bread money again.

189
00:08:36,830 --> 00:08:39,386
You must be philosophical
about it, Jessie.

190
00:08:39,387 --> 00:08:41,667
Well, I only hope the baker will be.

191
00:08:46,846 --> 00:08:48,803
Oh, very pretty.

192
00:08:48,804 --> 00:08:50,386
And where are you off to now?

193
00:08:50,387 --> 00:08:51,262
I'm going to see my agent.

194
00:08:51,263 --> 00:08:53,678
Remind him if he's drawing
up any sort of a settlement

195
00:08:53,679 --> 00:08:55,970
that the furniture's mine and paid for.

196
00:08:55,971 --> 00:08:56,803
And the house is mine.

197
00:08:56,804 --> 00:08:57,762
You mean the mortgage on it is,

198
00:08:57,763 --> 00:09:00,470
and the payments are 18 months in arrears.

199
00:09:00,471 --> 00:09:02,511
Now, what will you do, my darling,

200
00:09:02,512 --> 00:09:03,803
when you get to Leicester?

201
00:09:03,804 --> 00:09:06,136
Is there a repertory
theatre you could join?

202
00:09:06,137 --> 00:09:07,054
Repertory?

203
00:09:07,055 --> 00:09:10,011
They'd probably welcome an
older man with your experience.

204
00:09:10,012 --> 00:09:11,595
Very interesting life, too.

205
00:09:11,596 --> 00:09:13,345
""Streetcar Named Desire"" one week,

206
00:09:13,346 --> 00:09:15,470
""Lace on Her Petticoat"" the next.

207
00:09:15,471 --> 00:09:17,053
I'm sorry, the idea
doesn't appeal to me.

208
00:09:17,054 --> 00:09:17,887
Oh, pity.

209
00:09:17,888 --> 00:09:19,470
It uh, might get rid of some of those

210
00:09:19,471 --> 00:09:22,345
irritating mannerisms of yours.

211
00:09:22,346 --> 00:09:23,179
Mannerisms.

212
00:09:23,180 --> 00:09:24,803
You can't do double takes

213
00:09:24,804 --> 00:09:27,428
52 weeks in a year even in Leicester.

214
00:09:27,429 --> 00:09:28,720
At the end of the second month,

215
00:09:28,721 --> 00:09:30,970
the people will begin to think
you had a permanent twitch.

216
00:09:30,971 --> 00:09:33,178
Might I remind you that
you were carrying entrees

217
00:09:33,179 --> 00:09:34,595
when I was already a leading man?

218
00:09:34,596 --> 00:09:36,095
Might I remind you
that you haven't worked

219
00:09:36,096 --> 00:09:38,053
for the last 11 months,

220
00:09:38,054 --> 00:09:41,011
and I very much doubt if
you'll work for another 11.

221
00:09:41,012 --> 00:09:43,636
The skids are well and
truly under you, Simon,

222
00:09:43,637 --> 00:09:46,303
only you're too pigheaded to admit it.

223
00:09:46,304 --> 00:09:47,845
Thank you very much.

224
00:09:47,846 --> 00:09:50,366
Your great faith in me is most touching.

225
00:09:59,137 --> 00:10:02,179
Wait here a minute, will you, please?

226
00:10:06,096 --> 00:10:07,096
Morning.

227
00:10:07,097 --> 00:10:08,178
Mr. Burton's expecting me.

228
00:10:08,179 --> 00:10:09,678
- I'm sorry, but...
- Oh, pay off my taxi,

229
00:10:09,679 --> 00:10:10,595
will you, darling?

230
00:10:10,596 --> 00:10:11,512
I haven't any change.

231
00:10:11,513 --> 00:10:13,345
Know more after I've
been in touch with Binkie.

232
00:10:13,346 --> 00:10:14,678
- Yours faithfully.
- Good morning, Bertie.

233
00:10:14,679 --> 00:10:15,512
Good morning, Miss Jones.

234
00:10:15,513 --> 00:10:16,636
I don't see anything good about it.

235
00:10:16,637 --> 00:10:17,512
I know, you're busy.

236
00:10:17,513 --> 00:10:18,346
So am I.

237
00:10:18,347 --> 00:10:20,303
I called in for a check, not a chat.

238
00:10:20,304 --> 00:10:21,137
50 pounds will do.

239
00:10:21,138 --> 00:10:23,136
Now, why should I give you 50 pounds?

240
00:10:23,137 --> 00:10:24,136
As an advance.

241
00:10:24,137 --> 00:10:25,054
An advance against what?

242
00:10:25,055 --> 00:10:26,553
Now don't be silly, Bertie,

243
00:10:26,554 --> 00:10:28,928
against my next salary check.

244
00:10:28,929 --> 00:10:30,470
And when will that come?

245
00:10:30,471 --> 00:10:32,428
Well, you oughta know,
you're my agent, aren't you?

246
00:10:32,429 --> 00:10:33,887
Unfortunately, yes.

247
00:10:35,054 --> 00:10:37,454
I'd like to ask you something, Simon.

248
00:10:37,676 --> 00:10:40,136
Just what do you think an agent is for?

249
00:10:40,137 --> 00:10:42,053
Ah, that's something we've all wondered

250
00:10:42,054 --> 00:10:43,053
from time to time.

251
00:10:43,054 --> 00:10:43,887
Now, now, now, don't banter.

252
00:10:43,888 --> 00:10:44,721
I'll tell you.

253
00:10:44,722 --> 00:10:46,761
To get you jobs and take
10% of the money you make.

254
00:10:46,762 --> 00:10:47,596
- Exactly.
- Now I'll tell you

255
00:10:47,597 --> 00:10:48,429
what he's not for.

256
00:10:48,430 --> 00:10:50,845
He's not for settling your income tax.

257
00:10:50,846 --> 00:10:52,803
He's not for settling your gambling debts.

258
00:10:52,804 --> 00:10:55,053
Nor for cabling you your
return fair from Monte Carlo

259
00:10:55,054 --> 00:10:56,720
when you're cleaned out at the tables.

260
00:10:56,721 --> 00:10:57,803
Well, you enjoy a flutter yourself.

261
00:10:57,804 --> 00:10:58,886
Certainly I do.

262
00:10:58,887 --> 00:11:00,386
But when I lose, I don't come to you

263
00:11:00,387 --> 00:11:01,595
and ask you to pay my bookmaker.

264
00:11:01,596 --> 00:11:02,428
Neither do I.

265
00:11:02,429 --> 00:11:03,262
No, but it comes to the same thing

266
00:11:03,263 --> 00:11:04,096
when you expect me to advance you

267
00:11:04,097 --> 00:11:05,845
10% of some other actor's salary

268
00:11:05,846 --> 00:11:08,345
when you've neither of
you worked for a year!

269
00:11:08,346 --> 00:11:09,179
Well, I must admit,

270
00:11:09,180 --> 00:11:10,803
for an agent you've been very generous.

271
00:11:10,804 --> 00:11:11,970
Oh, well, thank you.

272
00:11:11,971 --> 00:11:12,804
That's big of you.

273
00:11:12,805 --> 00:11:14,470
That's very big of you.

274
00:11:14,471 --> 00:11:16,553
On the other hand, if you got me a job,

275
00:11:16,554 --> 00:11:18,761
I wouldn't have been
out of work for a year.

276
00:11:18,762 --> 00:11:21,012
Now, now, let's not be sordid.

277
00:11:21,846 --> 00:11:22,846
Excuse me.

278
00:11:24,762 --> 00:11:25,762
Yes?

279
00:11:25,763 --> 00:11:27,261
Miss Drake's still waiting
to see you, Mr. Burton.

280
00:11:27,262 --> 00:11:28,303
Oh good heavens, don't keep her waiting.

281
00:11:28,304 --> 00:11:29,970
Send her in.

282
00:11:29,971 --> 00:11:31,261
Give him a check, give him the cash box,

283
00:11:31,262 --> 00:11:32,803
give him the keys to the safe.

284
00:11:32,804 --> 00:11:33,637
- Hello!
- Darling,

285
00:11:33,638 --> 00:11:35,053
nobody told me you were here, mwah.

286
00:11:35,054 --> 00:11:36,428
- Do you now Simon Foster?
- How do you do?

287
00:11:36,429 --> 00:11:37,928
I'm still not absolutely convinced

288
00:11:37,929 --> 00:11:40,095
that I'm doing the right thing.

289
00:11:40,096 --> 00:11:41,303
I tell you what I will do.

290
00:11:41,304 --> 00:11:43,095
I'll agree to a four-weeks trial.

291
00:11:43,096 --> 00:11:43,929
How's that?

292
00:11:43,930 --> 00:11:45,303
I'm sure you won't regret it, sir.

293
00:11:45,304 --> 00:11:46,470
And I can contact the Fosters?

294
00:11:46,471 --> 00:11:47,595
Yes, if they're agreeable,

295
00:11:47,596 --> 00:11:49,470
you can go ahead with
the preliminary plans.

296
00:11:49,471 --> 00:11:50,886
Oh, and see that the script

297
00:11:50,887 --> 00:11:53,386
stresses the solidarity of the home.

298
00:11:53,387 --> 00:11:55,761
Peaceful, happy atmosphere
of marital bliss.

299
00:11:55,762 --> 00:11:57,261
It's very important.

300
00:11:57,262 --> 00:11:58,761
Who were you thinking of for the writer?

301
00:11:58,762 --> 00:12:02,053
Well, I thought of Janet Honeyman, sir.

302
00:12:02,054 --> 00:12:02,887
You mean the girl

303
00:12:02,888 --> 00:12:05,095
who's doing ""Insect
Life in British Ponds""?

304
00:12:05,096 --> 00:12:07,053
Oh, but she did do the ""Darby
and Joan"" programme, too, sir.

305
00:12:07,054 --> 00:12:08,970
All right, I'll leave it to you.

306
00:12:08,971 --> 00:12:10,595
Thank you, sir.

307
00:12:10,596 --> 00:12:13,011
There's one thing
you've forgotten, Mr. Prentice.

308
00:12:13,012 --> 00:12:14,178
Sir?

309
00:12:14,179 --> 00:12:15,970
Your coat.

310
00:12:15,971 --> 00:12:17,220
Oh.

311
00:12:17,221 --> 00:12:18,262
Thank you, sir.

312
00:12:36,581 --> 00:12:37,721
Your ticket, sir.

313
00:12:37,722 --> 00:12:39,162
Oh, thank you, Wilson.

314
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:42,220
Here's a couple of pounds.

315
00:12:42,221 --> 00:12:43,054
Keep the change.

316
00:12:43,055 --> 00:12:44,178
Oh, thank you, sir.

317
00:12:44,179 --> 00:12:45,929
Now, before I go, wages.

318
00:12:46,453 --> 00:12:50,053
No, on second thought, I'll
give you and Jessie a check.

319
00:12:50,054 --> 00:12:50,887
I shouldn't bother, sir.

320
00:12:50,888 --> 00:12:52,303
It only causes embarrassment.

321
00:12:52,304 --> 00:12:54,344
No, I'll write you one at once.

322
00:12:58,377 --> 00:12:59,637
What are you doing?

323
00:12:59,638 --> 00:13:02,386
There's no need to add
kleptomania to your other failings.

324
00:13:02,387 --> 00:13:03,470
You put those back at once.

325
00:13:03,471 --> 00:13:04,429
They happen to be mine.

326
00:13:04,430 --> 00:13:05,803
They most certainly are not.

327
00:13:05,804 --> 00:13:06,637
They were presented to me

328
00:13:06,638 --> 00:13:08,220
by the cast on the 300th performance

329
00:13:08,221 --> 00:13:09,511
of ""Marriage in Mayfair"".

330
00:13:09,512 --> 00:13:11,511
I seem to remember that
on the 300th performance

331
00:13:11,512 --> 00:13:14,554
you were on holiday in
Paris with Sybil Hunter.

332
00:13:15,429 --> 00:13:17,053
Laura, before I leave,

333
00:13:17,054 --> 00:13:18,803
I want you to know,

334
00:13:18,804 --> 00:13:20,928
I forgive you for all your insults,

335
00:13:20,929 --> 00:13:21,762
including that last one.

336
00:13:21,763 --> 00:13:22,762
My insults?

337
00:13:23,554 --> 00:13:25,720
Ooh ha, ha, that's rich.

338
00:13:25,721 --> 00:13:28,595
Who started that sordid
brawl this morning?

339
00:13:28,596 --> 00:13:29,928
The same person who usually does.

340
00:13:29,929 --> 00:13:31,928
The reason was
cigarette ends in teacups.

341
00:13:31,929 --> 00:13:32,845
It was nothing of the sort.

342
00:13:32,846 --> 00:13:33,846
It was a...
If there's one thing

343
00:13:33,847 --> 00:13:36,136
I abominate, it's a filthy wet mess

344
00:13:36,137 --> 00:13:37,345
of loose tobacco swimming

345
00:13:37,346 --> 00:13:38,428
- about amongst the tea things!
- I merely happened

346
00:13:38,429 --> 00:13:39,429
to mention.

347
00:13:39,971 --> 00:13:42,011
As I was saying when you slammed

348
00:13:42,012 --> 00:13:42,846
the door in my face...

349
00:13:42,847 --> 00:13:44,178
There are seven ashtrays placed

350
00:13:44,179 --> 00:13:47,261
in strategic positions
all around the room.

351
00:13:47,262 --> 00:13:48,428
Now, do you ever use one?

352
00:13:48,429 --> 00:13:49,346
Oh, no.

353
00:13:49,347 --> 00:13:50,886
If you can't find a teacup handy,

354
00:13:50,887 --> 00:13:52,470
your beastly cigarettes get stamped

355
00:13:52,471 --> 00:13:54,011
out on my dressing table,

356
00:13:54,012 --> 00:13:56,261
in the rose bowl or down the sink.

357
00:13:56,262 --> 00:13:57,720
I go around cleaning up after you

358
00:13:57,721 --> 00:13:59,178
like an attendant at the zoo.

359
00:13:59,179 --> 00:14:00,054
Have you finished?

360
00:14:00,055 --> 00:14:01,678
For the time being, yes.

361
00:14:01,679 --> 00:14:02,886
One of the most tragic fates

362
00:14:02,887 --> 00:14:05,345
a man can suffer is to
be saddled to a nag.

363
00:14:05,346 --> 00:14:06,179
Saddled to a what?

364
00:14:06,180 --> 00:14:07,261
A nag.

365
00:14:07,262 --> 00:14:08,179
And no matter how much you think

366
00:14:08,180 --> 00:14:09,636
my education has been neglected,

367
00:14:09,637 --> 00:14:12,303
the equestrian phraseology
was intentional.

368
00:14:12,304 --> 00:14:14,053
You know, you really shouldn't

369
00:14:14,054 --> 00:14:14,887
try and talk like Wilson.

370
00:14:14,888 --> 00:14:17,386
You just haven't got the
presence to get away with it.

371
00:14:17,387 --> 00:14:19,095
This morning, on
looking through the back

372
00:14:19,096 --> 00:14:20,012
page of the daily paper,

373
00:14:20,013 --> 00:14:21,220
I merely happened to mention

374
00:14:21,221 --> 00:14:22,428
that the lady in the divorce case

375
00:14:22,429 --> 00:14:23,511
had remarkably good legs.

376
00:14:23,512 --> 00:14:24,636
- I remember perfectly...
- Seven minutes later,

377
00:14:24,637 --> 00:14:26,428
after you'd twisted that remark,

378
00:14:26,429 --> 00:14:28,345
you'd practically made
me the co-respondent.

379
00:14:28,346 --> 00:14:29,221
Well, what do you expect

380
00:14:29,222 --> 00:14:32,462
if you will be seen going
around with Sybil Hunter.

381
00:14:32,463 --> 00:14:35,345
Sybil Hunter happens to
be a patron of the arts.

382
00:14:35,346 --> 00:14:36,386
Uh, bunk.

383
00:14:36,387 --> 00:14:37,720
She's a patron of one thing

384
00:14:37,721 --> 00:14:39,761
and one thing only, men.

385
00:14:39,762 --> 00:14:40,886
And in her declining years,

386
00:14:40,887 --> 00:14:43,095
she's getting less and
less choosy what men.

387
00:14:43,096 --> 00:14:45,386
Mm, Gerald Baxter to you.

388
00:14:45,387 --> 00:14:46,886
And what is the matter
with Gerald Baxter?

389
00:14:46,887 --> 00:14:48,261
He's made some excellent pictures

390
00:14:48,262 --> 00:14:49,096
in these last two years.

391
00:14:49,097 --> 00:14:51,428
And he's made some
excellent passes at you,

392
00:14:51,429 --> 00:14:53,553
and you've encouraged him.

393
00:14:53,554 --> 00:14:55,220
How dare you!

394
00:14:55,221 --> 00:14:56,428
You take that back at once.

395
00:14:56,429 --> 00:14:57,261
I will not.

396
00:14:57,262 --> 00:14:58,398
I called you a trollop,

397
00:14:58,399 --> 00:14:59,536
and I meant a trollop.

398
00:14:59,887 --> 00:15:00,887
Ooh.

399
00:15:03,554 --> 00:15:04,554
Trollop!

400
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,220
After due consideration, we decided

401
00:15:09,221 --> 00:15:11,636
that the Fosters were the ideal couple.

402
00:15:11,637 --> 00:15:12,717
What do you say?

403
00:15:13,446 --> 00:15:14,886
Oh, I beg your pardon.

404
00:15:14,887 --> 00:15:15,804
When do you want to start?

405
00:15:15,805 --> 00:15:16,637
Right away.

406
00:15:16,638 --> 00:15:19,928
Ooh, ooh, I'm afraid that's
extremely dodgy, old boy.

407
00:15:19,929 --> 00:15:21,636
Three different studios
want 'em for a picture.

408
00:15:21,637 --> 00:15:23,303
Simon has an offer to a play,

409
00:15:23,304 --> 00:15:24,803
and Laura's more or less promised

410
00:15:24,804 --> 00:15:26,886
to take a real big part on Broadway.

411
00:15:26,887 --> 00:15:27,845
Oh.

412
00:15:27,846 --> 00:15:28,678
Oh, I see.

413
00:15:28,679 --> 00:15:29,512
It's all those dollars.

414
00:15:29,513 --> 00:15:30,346
You know how it is.

415
00:15:30,347 --> 00:15:31,928
They sound so much more than pounds,

416
00:15:31,929 --> 00:15:33,386
particularly BBC pounds,

417
00:15:33,387 --> 00:15:35,386
if you don't mind my saying so.

418
00:15:35,387 --> 00:15:36,553
Oh, dear.

419
00:15:36,554 --> 00:15:39,428
Oh, well, I suppose I
better try the Oliviers.

420
00:15:39,429 --> 00:15:40,845
No, no, don't do that!

421
00:15:40,846 --> 00:15:42,928
I mean, I just hate to let you down.

422
00:15:42,929 --> 00:15:44,011
I tell you what I'll do,

423
00:15:44,012 --> 00:15:45,386
I'll get them on the phone

424
00:15:45,387 --> 00:15:47,428
and see if I can bring a
little pressure to bear.

425
00:15:47,429 --> 00:15:48,262
Oh.

426
00:15:48,263 --> 00:15:50,220
Oh, well, that'd be
awfully kind of you, sir.

427
00:15:50,221 --> 00:15:51,053
Not at all.

428
00:15:51,054 --> 00:15:51,887
Yes, Mr. Burton.

429
00:15:51,888 --> 00:15:55,428
Miss Jones, put a call through
to the Fosters, will you?

430
00:16:01,721 --> 00:16:03,053
Hello.

431
00:16:03,054 --> 00:16:04,074
Oh, Mr. Burton.

432
00:16:04,887 --> 00:16:07,886
No, I'm afraid Mr. Foster's not at home.

433
00:16:07,887 --> 00:16:09,553
No, sir, madam's resting.

434
00:16:09,554 --> 00:16:10,387
He's just left.

435
00:16:10,388 --> 00:16:12,928
He's catching the 1:25 to Leicester.

436
00:16:12,929 --> 00:16:16,095
I believe...

437
00:16:16,096 --> 00:16:17,637
No manners.

438
00:16:26,096 --> 00:16:27,470
Where to, sir?

439
00:16:27,471 --> 00:16:28,803
Leicester, the 1:25.

440
00:16:28,804 --> 00:16:29,804
Right.

441
00:16:36,429 --> 00:16:39,095
The 1:25 train to Bransford

442
00:16:39,096 --> 00:16:41,928
leaves from platform three.

443
00:16:41,929 --> 00:16:45,179
Calling in Leicester, Trent, Chesterfield,

444
00:16:46,596 --> 00:16:49,096
Sheffield, Leeds and...
Simon!

445
00:16:50,721 --> 00:16:52,095
Simon!

446
00:16:52,096 --> 00:16:53,220
Hello, Bertie.

447
00:16:53,221 --> 00:16:54,054
Come over here.

448
00:16:54,055 --> 00:16:57,970
I want to talk to you!

449
00:16:57,971 --> 00:16:58,804
What's the matter?

450
00:16:58,805 --> 00:16:59,845
Now, what's all this nonsense

451
00:16:59,846 --> 00:17:00,679
about you going to Leicester?

452
00:17:00,680 --> 00:17:01,512
It is not nonsense.

453
00:17:01,513 --> 00:17:02,845
I am going home to Mother.

454
00:17:02,846 --> 00:17:03,846
I've left Laura.

455
00:17:03,847 --> 00:17:04,679
Left Laura?

456
00:17:04,680 --> 00:17:05,845
Don't be silly, you can't do that.

457
00:17:05,846 --> 00:17:08,246
Not now, not when I have work for you.

458
00:17:08,804 --> 00:17:10,553
What did you say, dear boy?

459
00:17:10,554 --> 00:17:11,386
Work!

460
00:17:11,387 --> 00:17:12,304
Yes, it is extraordinary, isn't it?

461
00:17:12,305 --> 00:17:13,803
Look, we can't talk here.

462
00:17:13,804 --> 00:17:14,762
Let's go and have a drink.

463
00:17:14,763 --> 00:17:17,011
All right.

464
00:17:17,012 --> 00:17:17,928
Come on.

465
00:17:17,929 --> 00:17:18,846
Now.

466
00:17:24,022 --> 00:17:25,762
Two scotches, miss, please.

467
00:17:25,763 --> 00:17:27,011
Large ones.

468
00:17:27,012 --> 00:17:28,553
Now, Bertie, what's
all this about a job?

469
00:17:28,554 --> 00:17:31,053
Simon, I think I
deserve a pat on the back.

470
00:17:31,054 --> 00:17:32,428
I've landed you something every actor

471
00:17:32,429 --> 00:17:33,387
in this country would
give his eye teeth for.

472
00:17:33,388 --> 00:17:34,928
What, in the theatre?

473
00:17:34,929 --> 00:17:35,762
The theatre?

474
00:17:35,763 --> 00:17:37,845
Oh, don't be silly, old
boy, the theater's had it.

475
00:17:37,846 --> 00:17:38,804
Is something the matter?

476
00:17:38,805 --> 00:17:39,928
No, I'm sorry, no.

477
00:17:39,929 --> 00:17:40,762
Do forgive me.

478
00:17:40,763 --> 00:17:41,595
Don't mind me.

479
00:17:41,596 --> 00:17:42,429
But you know, just for a moment,

480
00:17:42,430 --> 00:17:44,761
I thought you were Simon Foster.

481
00:17:44,762 --> 00:17:47,303
But of course, I see
you're very much older.

482
00:17:47,304 --> 00:17:48,304
Thank you.

483
00:17:48,961 --> 00:17:50,221
What is it, a film?

484
00:17:50,222 --> 00:17:51,054
Films?

485
00:17:51,055 --> 00:17:52,428
By the time they've made up their mind

486
00:17:52,429 --> 00:17:53,595
what size and shape they're gonna be,

487
00:17:53,596 --> 00:17:54,429
they'll be through.

488
00:17:54,430 --> 00:17:56,886
3-D, 4-D, curved screen, cinerama,

489
00:17:56,887 --> 00:17:58,095
who cares if the story's no good.

490
00:17:58,096 --> 00:17:59,511
Don't spoil it.

491
00:17:59,512 --> 00:18:01,595
Bertie, I've already
made it crystal clear,

492
00:18:01,596 --> 00:18:03,178
I cannot skate.

493
00:18:03,179 --> 00:18:04,303
My dear fellow, I wouldn't dream

494
00:18:04,304 --> 00:18:05,595
of putting you on ice.

495
00:18:05,596 --> 00:18:07,179
Well, what is it?

496
00:18:09,804 --> 00:18:11,678
Television.

497
00:18:11,679 --> 00:18:13,095
Television?

498
00:18:13,096 --> 00:18:14,845
And you call that a wonderful job?

499
00:18:14,846 --> 00:18:15,679
But of course.

500
00:18:15,680 --> 00:18:16,970
Three weeks rehearsal,

501
00:18:16,971 --> 00:18:18,970
hardly enough money for
your fair to the studio,

502
00:18:18,971 --> 00:18:21,178
a technical breakdown in the
middle of your big scene,

503
00:18:21,179 --> 00:18:22,303
and no repeat performance.

504
00:18:22,304 --> 00:18:23,137
No, thank you.

505
00:18:23,138 --> 00:18:25,220
But, Simon, this is gonna be
something entirely different,

506
00:18:25,221 --> 00:18:26,928
something that may well put you and Laura

507
00:18:26,929 --> 00:18:28,178
right back...
Laura, is she in it?

508
00:18:28,179 --> 00:18:29,220
But of course!

509
00:18:29,221 --> 00:18:30,345
What's one without the other?

510
00:18:30,346 --> 00:18:32,553
Romeo and Juliet, Swan & Edgar,

511
00:18:32,554 --> 00:18:33,886
scotch and soda, Simon and Laura.

512
00:18:33,887 --> 00:18:34,804
Now, just a minute.

513
00:18:34,805 --> 00:18:36,761
In the first place, I have no intention

514
00:18:36,762 --> 00:18:37,637
of appearing on television,

515
00:18:37,638 --> 00:18:39,220
and in the second place,

516
00:18:39,221 --> 00:18:40,781
Laura and I are parting.

517
00:18:41,693 --> 00:18:43,553
I'm going home to Mother's,

518
00:18:43,554 --> 00:18:44,471
and that is final.

519
00:18:44,472 --> 00:18:46,220
Now, Simon, look, be sensible.

520
00:18:46,221 --> 00:18:47,470
Uh, excuse me!

521
00:18:47,471 --> 00:18:49,387
Nine shillings, please.

522
00:18:51,810 --> 00:18:53,970
Bertie, you're wasting your time.

523
00:18:53,971 --> 00:18:56,428
Nothing could persuade me
to work with Laura anymore.

524
00:18:56,429 --> 00:18:58,720
But you know you're
marvellous when you're together.

525
00:18:58,721 --> 00:19:00,470
Mm, if you'd seen what
went on this morning,

526
00:19:00,471 --> 00:19:01,387
you wouldn't be too sure.

527
00:19:01,388 --> 00:19:02,304
Leave it Bertie.

528
00:19:02,305 --> 00:19:03,345
I'll fix all that.

529
00:19:03,346 --> 00:19:05,720
Look, it'd take more than
one piffling TV engagement

530
00:19:05,721 --> 00:19:06,596
to bring us together again.

531
00:19:06,597 --> 00:19:07,970
This isn't one engagement, you clod,

532
00:19:07,971 --> 00:19:09,053
it's for every day!

533
00:19:09,054 --> 00:19:09,887
What do you mean every day?

534
00:19:09,888 --> 00:19:11,261
Five days a week, 52 weeks of the year.

535
00:19:11,262 --> 00:19:13,595
In three months, you'll
be a national figure.

536
00:19:13,596 --> 00:19:15,553
Ah, there's David Prentice now.

537
00:19:15,554 --> 00:19:17,553
Arriving together, that's a good omen.

538
00:19:17,554 --> 00:19:19,054
I'm glad you think so.

539
00:19:30,929 --> 00:19:32,345
David, dear boy.

540
00:19:32,346 --> 00:19:33,886
This is Simon Foster.

541
00:19:33,887 --> 00:19:34,928
How do you do?

542
00:19:34,929 --> 00:19:36,189
How do you do, sir?

543
00:19:37,762 --> 00:19:40,262
Well, come along in.

544
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:44,220
Good afternoon, Wilson.

545
00:19:44,221 --> 00:19:45,054
- Good afternoon.
- Where's your mistress,

546
00:19:45,055 --> 00:19:45,886
Wilson?

547
00:19:45,887 --> 00:19:46,721
Upstairs, sir.

548
00:19:46,722 --> 00:19:47,845
Will you tell her Mr. Burton's here

549
00:19:47,846 --> 00:19:49,261
on business with a producer.

550
00:19:49,262 --> 00:19:50,262
Yes, sir.

551
00:19:55,471 --> 00:19:57,553
Oh, you must forgive my staring.

552
00:19:57,554 --> 00:19:58,803
It's disconcerting, I know,

553
00:19:58,804 --> 00:20:01,220
but nowadays, I see
everything in terms of angles.

554
00:20:01,221 --> 00:20:02,720
That must make it a bit tricky

555
00:20:02,721 --> 00:20:03,928
when you're addressing a golf ball.

556
00:20:03,929 --> 00:20:05,303
Oh, I don't play golf.

557
00:20:05,304 --> 00:20:07,224
No, I didn't think you would.

558
00:20:07,666 --> 00:20:09,886
Yes, yours is a face with problems.

559
00:20:09,887 --> 00:20:12,220
You, to coin a phrase, are telling me.

560
00:20:12,221 --> 00:20:13,553
No, I mean camera problems,

561
00:20:13,554 --> 00:20:15,386
but a lot, of course, can
be done with lighting.

562
00:20:15,387 --> 00:20:17,303
Yes, or you could
put it behind the sofa.

563
00:20:17,304 --> 00:20:18,345
Do come in.

564
00:20:18,346 --> 00:20:19,346
Oh, thank you.

565
00:20:20,387 --> 00:20:22,261
Ah, this is a good room.

566
00:20:22,262 --> 00:20:24,678
Oh, do you think it has
a spiritual atmosphere?

567
00:20:24,679 --> 00:20:26,839
No, I mean from our point of view.

568
00:20:27,591 --> 00:20:29,511
Madam presents her compliments

569
00:20:29,512 --> 00:20:30,928
and asks me to assure you

570
00:20:30,929 --> 00:20:32,220
she'll be with you immediately.

571
00:20:32,221 --> 00:20:34,021
Thank you very much, Wilson.

572
00:20:35,512 --> 00:20:37,136
Was that your manservant?

573
00:20:37,137 --> 00:20:38,054
Oh, Wilson, yes.

574
00:20:38,055 --> 00:20:39,595
He was an actor, and he was my dresser...

575
00:20:39,596 --> 00:20:40,678
Ah, an actor.

576
00:20:40,679 --> 00:20:41,512
Ah yes, I thought so.

577
00:20:41,513 --> 00:20:43,136
He's a natural.

578
00:20:43,137 --> 00:20:44,577
He moves, doesn't he?

579
00:20:45,429 --> 00:20:46,929
From time to time, yes.

580
00:20:49,971 --> 00:20:50,971
Aha!

581
00:20:51,637 --> 00:20:53,553
Laura, darling.

582
00:20:53,554 --> 00:20:54,386
Bertie!

583
00:20:54,387 --> 00:20:55,221
Laura, I want you to meet

584
00:20:55,222 --> 00:20:58,386
a very brilliant young
producer, David Prentice.

585
00:20:58,387 --> 00:20:59,387
Hello!

586
00:21:00,554 --> 00:21:01,845
Uh h-hello.

587
00:21:01,846 --> 00:21:05,221
David, what on earth are you doing here?

588
00:21:05,426 --> 00:21:07,346
Well, if you come and sit down

589
00:21:07,347 --> 00:21:08,886
and relax, he'll probably tell you.

590
00:21:08,887 --> 00:21:10,803
I thought you were on
your way to Leicester.

591
00:21:10,804 --> 00:21:11,637
I'm getting a later train.

592
00:21:11,638 --> 00:21:12,720
Don't miss it, dear.

593
00:21:12,721 --> 00:21:13,553
Don't worry.

594
00:21:13,554 --> 00:21:16,134
If I do, I'll sleep in the waiting room.

595
00:21:16,135 --> 00:21:17,261
Isn't it absurd?

596
00:21:17,262 --> 00:21:19,636
Always pretending to be
fighting, such children.

597
00:21:19,637 --> 00:21:21,595
David, come and sit here by me

598
00:21:21,596 --> 00:21:23,095
and tell me what it's all about.

599
00:21:23,096 --> 00:21:25,053
Oh, um, well, do you mind

600
00:21:25,054 --> 00:21:26,928
if I sort of wonder about a bit?

601
00:21:26,929 --> 00:21:27,762
Oh, please do?

602
00:21:27,763 --> 00:21:29,345
May I slip my jacket off?

603
00:21:29,346 --> 00:21:30,386
Is it hot in here?

604
00:21:30,387 --> 00:21:33,678
Well, no, but I always
think better with it off.

605
00:21:33,679 --> 00:21:36,595
Well, I am here because CT.

606
00:21:36,596 --> 00:21:37,429
CT?

607
00:21:37,430 --> 00:21:39,345
Oh, he's the controller of television

608
00:21:39,346 --> 00:21:43,011
and DTD, he's the director
of television drama,

609
00:21:43,012 --> 00:21:45,053
well, they have given me the go-ahead

610
00:21:45,054 --> 00:21:47,428
on a new programme which
deals with the private life

611
00:21:47,429 --> 00:21:50,849
of a celebrated couple who
are really happily married.

612
00:21:55,054 --> 00:21:56,054
Who was that?

613
00:21:56,055 --> 00:21:57,178
Well, the governor's come back.

614
00:21:57,179 --> 00:21:59,011
I hope he doesn't want his lunch.

615
00:21:59,012 --> 00:21:59,846
Why?

616
00:21:59,847 --> 00:22:01,347
Because I've eaten it.

617
00:22:02,471 --> 00:22:03,471
Pardon.

618
00:22:03,472 --> 00:22:05,678
They're doing the same
thing in America, you know.

619
00:22:05,679 --> 00:22:07,470
Oh yes, and with great success.

620
00:22:07,471 --> 00:22:09,470
You probably read recently, Mrs. Foster,

621
00:22:09,471 --> 00:22:10,429
the nationwide interest over there

622
00:22:10,430 --> 00:22:13,511
when the wife in their
programme had a baby on TV.

623
00:22:13,512 --> 00:22:16,428
I hope you're not suggesting
I should do the same.

624
00:22:16,429 --> 00:22:18,636
Well, it's not absolutely essential.

625
00:22:18,637 --> 00:22:20,803
I'm so glad.

626
00:22:20,804 --> 00:22:22,553
Well, anyway, we feel,

627
00:22:22,554 --> 00:22:24,928
we feel that it is essential
that everything else

628
00:22:24,929 --> 00:22:27,720
should be as authentic as we can make it.

629
00:22:27,721 --> 00:22:30,511
You know, sort of a, well, an EWA.

630
00:22:30,512 --> 00:22:31,678
A sort of what?

631
00:22:31,679 --> 00:22:34,678
Oh, an eyewitness account.

632
00:22:34,679 --> 00:22:36,261
- Oh.
- But that.

633
00:22:36,262 --> 00:22:38,511
- I do beg your pardon, sir.
- I'm terribly sorry.

634
00:22:38,512 --> 00:22:41,220
But that is why our
couple should be not only

635
00:22:41,221 --> 00:22:44,136
well known as actors
but as a genuinely happy

636
00:22:44,137 --> 00:22:45,277
husband and wife.

637
00:22:46,258 --> 00:22:49,678
Frankly, well, it rested
between you and the Oliviers.

638
00:22:49,679 --> 00:22:52,303
But both CT and DT plumped for you.

639
00:22:52,304 --> 00:22:53,179
Oh, why?

640
00:22:53,180 --> 00:22:56,300
Because you've been
married so very much longer.

641
00:22:59,512 --> 00:23:01,804
Well, what do you say?

642
00:23:02,637 --> 00:23:03,637
No.

643
00:23:03,638 --> 00:23:05,053
Sorry, old boy, it's
out of the question.

644
00:23:05,054 --> 00:23:05,887
Simon!

645
00:23:05,888 --> 00:23:06,720
Laura!

646
00:23:06,721 --> 00:23:07,553
Are you mad?

647
00:23:07,554 --> 00:23:08,387
Don't be ridiculous, Bertie.

648
00:23:08,388 --> 00:23:10,303
Mr. Prentice had better know immediately

649
00:23:10,304 --> 00:23:11,720
that Simon and I...
Have arranged.

650
00:23:11,721 --> 00:23:12,803
Ah, Prentice, old man,

651
00:23:12,804 --> 00:23:14,636
would you mind awfully
waiting till this evening

652
00:23:14,637 --> 00:23:15,470
for an answer?

653
00:23:15,471 --> 00:23:16,366
- Oh, not at all.
- Good.

654
00:23:16,367 --> 00:23:17,262
Everything will be all right.

655
00:23:17,263 --> 00:23:18,470
Just leave it to Uncle Bertie.

656
00:23:18,471 --> 00:23:19,636
Don't you worry.

657
00:23:19,637 --> 00:23:21,303
Don't forget your briefcase.

658
00:23:21,304 --> 00:23:23,636
Naturally, a thing like
this needs thinking over.

659
00:23:23,637 --> 00:23:24,845
They have so many offers,

660
00:23:24,846 --> 00:23:26,011
so much to consider.

661
00:23:26,012 --> 00:23:26,846
You know how it is,

662
00:23:26,847 --> 00:23:28,095
inclined to make them a bit.

663
00:23:28,096 --> 00:23:28,929
- Yeah.
- Oh.

664
00:23:28,930 --> 00:23:30,053
Now, I tell you what,

665
00:23:30,054 --> 00:23:32,553
suppose we dine together
this evening at Mario's?

666
00:23:32,554 --> 00:23:33,970
Oh, that would be splendid.

667
00:23:33,971 --> 00:23:34,804
About eight o'clock?

668
00:23:34,805 --> 00:23:36,136
Might I bring my
script writer along too?

669
00:23:36,137 --> 00:23:38,053
Bring your, oh my dear
boy, bring everybody,

670
00:23:38,054 --> 00:23:39,614
CT, DDT, DTs, everybody.

671
00:23:40,909 --> 00:23:41,835
Yes, thank you.

672
00:23:41,836 --> 00:23:42,762
Mr. Prentice!

673
00:23:42,763 --> 00:23:43,596
Sir?

674
00:23:43,597 --> 00:23:45,220
You've forgotten something.

675
00:23:45,221 --> 00:23:46,053
Oh.

676
00:23:46,054 --> 00:23:46,970
Yes, put your coat on.

677
00:23:46,971 --> 00:23:47,887
You'll catch cold.

678
00:23:47,888 --> 00:23:48,970
Oh, thank you so much.

679
00:23:48,971 --> 00:23:49,887
Until eight o'clock then.

680
00:23:49,888 --> 00:23:50,887
Yes.

681
00:23:50,888 --> 00:23:52,803
Well, uh, au revoir.

682
00:23:52,804 --> 00:23:53,636
Au revoir.

683
00:23:53,637 --> 00:23:54,471
Auf wiedersehen.

684
00:23:54,472 --> 00:23:55,929
Take care of yourself.

685
00:23:57,765 --> 00:24:00,345
What on earth is the matter with you two?

686
00:24:00,346 --> 00:24:01,346
Have you taken leave of your senses?

687
00:24:01,347 --> 00:24:03,053
I've taken leave of Laura, that's all.

688
00:24:03,054 --> 00:24:05,136
And not a moment too soon.

689
00:24:05,137 --> 00:24:05,971
I'm sorry, Bertie.

690
00:24:05,972 --> 00:24:07,303
Better luck next time.

691
00:24:07,304 --> 00:24:09,220
There isn't going to be a next time.

692
00:24:09,221 --> 00:24:10,386
May I remind you

693
00:24:10,387 --> 00:24:15,011
that between you you owe me
1,647 pounds, 18 shillings.

694
00:24:15,012 --> 00:24:16,595
You're lucky.

695
00:24:16,596 --> 00:24:18,303
You should see what I owe my bookmaker.

696
00:24:18,304 --> 00:24:19,137
Now, I'm warning you, both of you,

697
00:24:19,138 --> 00:24:21,011
that if you turn this down,

698
00:24:21,012 --> 00:24:22,761
I cannot afford to go on taking 10 percent

699
00:24:22,762 --> 00:24:23,595
of your earnings.

700
00:24:23,596 --> 00:24:24,429
It's too expensive.

701
00:24:24,430 --> 00:24:26,386
Cheers.

702
00:24:26,387 --> 00:24:28,678
I suppose it would be
quite an opportunity.

703
00:24:28,679 --> 00:24:30,720
It could lead anywhere, Laura, anywhere.

704
00:24:30,721 --> 00:24:32,511
Is the, uh, money good?

705
00:24:32,512 --> 00:24:34,678
All money's good when you
haven't been making any.

706
00:24:34,679 --> 00:24:37,929
And this will be coming
in regularly every Friday.

707
00:24:37,930 --> 00:24:41,011
Do you suppose we could
come to some arrangement?

708
00:24:41,012 --> 00:24:42,511
Not with you in Leicester.

709
00:24:42,512 --> 00:24:44,612
What if I don't go to Leicester?

710
00:24:44,929 --> 00:24:46,845
I suppose we could,

711
00:24:46,846 --> 00:24:50,011
but it would have to be
purely a business arrangement.

712
00:24:50,012 --> 00:24:51,636
Everything I said this morning stands.

713
00:24:51,637 --> 00:24:52,637
Naturally.

714
00:24:54,762 --> 00:24:56,220
All right.

715
00:24:56,221 --> 00:24:57,553
Ring for Wilson, and tell him to put

716
00:24:57,554 --> 00:24:58,803
your things in the spare room.

717
00:24:58,804 --> 00:25:00,178
That's my Laura.

718
00:25:00,179 --> 00:25:01,428
By the way, Laura, where did you meet

719
00:25:01,429 --> 00:25:03,470
that ghastly young man?

720
00:25:03,471 --> 00:25:05,261
At the Baxter's.

721
00:25:05,262 --> 00:25:06,970
And he's not ghastly.

722
00:25:06,971 --> 00:25:08,053
He's sweet.

723
00:25:08,054 --> 00:25:08,929
At the Baxter's.

724
00:25:08,930 --> 00:25:10,095
- Yes.
- Now, now, you two.

725
00:25:10,096 --> 00:25:10,949
- The night...
- May I suggest

726
00:25:10,950 --> 00:25:11,804
that you take a little rest,

727
00:25:11,805 --> 00:25:13,011
just relax, while I go and talk

728
00:25:13,012 --> 00:25:14,720
to the BBC contract's department.

729
00:25:14,721 --> 00:25:15,970
Don't let them do you down, Bertie.

730
00:25:15,971 --> 00:25:17,220
Ha ha, do me down?

731
00:25:17,221 --> 00:25:19,053
Darling, don't be absurd.

732
00:25:19,054 --> 00:25:21,011
Christopher Marley, head of BBC contracts

733
00:25:21,012 --> 00:25:22,720
used to be my fag at Eton.

734
00:25:22,721 --> 00:25:23,887
Till tonight.

735
00:25:25,742 --> 00:25:26,762
Not be worried.

736
00:25:26,763 --> 00:25:29,011
Nobody is to worry about a thing.

737
00:25:29,012 --> 00:25:29,845
Here's to it.

738
00:25:29,846 --> 00:25:30,721
- Here's to it.
- Here's to it.

739
00:25:30,722 --> 00:25:31,803
Indeed.

740
00:25:31,804 --> 00:25:34,928
I can't tell you how
glad I am that you agreed.

741
00:25:34,929 --> 00:25:36,928
You know, I've been a
fan of yours for years.

742
00:25:36,929 --> 00:25:37,887
Why don't you tell her how you played

743
00:25:37,888 --> 00:25:40,948
truant from school to
catch one of her matinees?

744
00:25:41,296 --> 00:25:43,636
It's very funny you should say that,

745
00:25:43,637 --> 00:25:44,471
because as a matter of fact,

746
00:25:44,472 --> 00:25:45,761
I did play truant once.

747
00:25:45,762 --> 00:25:47,136
But that was to see you.

748
00:25:47,137 --> 00:25:49,511
From prep school, I take it.

749
00:25:49,512 --> 00:25:52,761
You know, I simply adore

750
00:25:52,762 --> 00:25:54,095
the delightful air of banter

751
00:25:54,096 --> 00:25:55,553
that exists between you two.

752
00:25:55,554 --> 00:25:56,511
Banter?

753
00:25:56,512 --> 00:25:57,346
Yes, there's a sort of,

754
00:25:57,347 --> 00:26:00,053
well, a brittle superficial
thrust and parry.

755
00:26:00,054 --> 00:26:03,178
And yet, beneath it, once
can sense a true bond.

756
00:26:03,179 --> 00:26:04,054
- Can one?
- Can one?

757
00:26:04,055 --> 00:26:05,595
Of course one can.

758
00:26:05,596 --> 00:26:07,303
And it's exactly what
we want to emphasise

759
00:26:07,304 --> 00:26:08,553
in this programme.

760
00:26:08,554 --> 00:26:09,886
Ooh, that reminds me.

761
00:26:09,887 --> 00:26:11,553
If I may, I'd like to
bring my art director

762
00:26:11,554 --> 00:26:12,636
round to your house.

763
00:26:12,637 --> 00:26:14,261
We're going to make an exact copy of it

764
00:26:14,262 --> 00:26:15,845
in the studio so that you'll feel

765
00:26:15,846 --> 00:26:17,803
perfectly at ease and be able to behave

766
00:26:17,804 --> 00:26:19,220
exactly as if you were at home.

767
00:26:19,221 --> 00:26:21,803
Oh, that'll be fun.

768
00:26:21,804 --> 00:26:24,304
Ah, here's our scriptwriter.

769
00:26:25,762 --> 00:26:26,762
Janet.

770
00:26:27,596 --> 00:26:28,595
Simon!

771
00:26:28,596 --> 00:26:29,596
Janet.

772
00:26:29,597 --> 00:26:30,803
Janet Honeyman.

773
00:26:30,804 --> 00:26:32,178
By all that's wonderful.

774
00:26:32,179 --> 00:26:33,636
- Hello, darling, how are you?
- Simon, dear.

775
00:26:33,637 --> 00:26:34,928
I'm fine.

776
00:26:34,929 --> 00:26:37,136
I take it you two have met before?

777
00:26:37,137 --> 00:26:39,178
Yes, at one of Sybil Hunter's parties.

778
00:26:39,179 --> 00:26:40,179
Really?

779
00:26:40,180 --> 00:26:42,553
How do you do, Miss Honeyman?

780
00:26:42,554 --> 00:26:44,220
I, um, think I ought to tell you

781
00:26:44,221 --> 00:26:47,970
that in this programme, I play the wife.

782
00:26:47,971 --> 00:26:49,053
Hello.

783
00:26:49,054 --> 00:26:50,012
I'm so sorry.

784
00:26:50,013 --> 00:26:51,386
I didn't see you sitting there.

785
00:26:51,387 --> 00:26:53,178
Ah, well, let's hope the viewers

786
00:26:53,179 --> 00:26:54,636
will be more fortunate.

787
00:26:54,637 --> 00:26:56,678
Shall we go in?

788
00:26:56,679 --> 00:26:57,929
Yes, shall we?

789
00:27:04,226 --> 00:27:06,386
I suppose it never occurred to you

790
00:27:06,387 --> 00:27:08,678
that I might be using that newspaper.

791
00:27:08,679 --> 00:27:09,512
Gilbert.

792
00:27:09,513 --> 00:27:11,095
You're the very man I wanted to see.

793
00:27:11,096 --> 00:27:13,345
Oh, Simon, my dear boy, Simon.

794
00:27:13,346 --> 00:27:15,303
Arthur, Arthur, bring Mr. Foster

795
00:27:15,304 --> 00:27:16,553
a whiskey a water.

796
00:27:16,554 --> 00:27:17,428
Thanks.

797
00:27:17,429 --> 00:27:18,387
I need your help, Gilbert.

798
00:27:18,388 --> 00:27:20,053
I'm on the brink of a television series.

799
00:27:20,054 --> 00:27:22,053
Oh, better make that
a large whiskey, Arthur.

800
00:27:22,054 --> 00:27:23,345
Done.

801
00:27:23,346 --> 00:27:24,179
A weekly series?

802
00:27:24,180 --> 00:27:25,012
No, daily.

803
00:27:25,013 --> 00:27:26,136
Oh, no, no.

804
00:27:26,137 --> 00:27:27,178
You better bring the whole bottle.

805
00:27:27,179 --> 00:27:28,470
Yes, sir.

806
00:27:28,471 --> 00:27:31,428
My poor friend, my poor Simon.

807
00:27:31,429 --> 00:27:32,262
Do you know what happens to you

808
00:27:32,263 --> 00:27:34,386
when you allow yourself to be regularly

809
00:27:34,387 --> 00:27:37,345
exhibited in that glass rectangle?

810
00:27:37,346 --> 00:27:39,303
- No, not really, I, I...
- Well, I'll tell you.

811
00:27:39,304 --> 00:27:41,044
You become public property.

812
00:27:41,846 --> 00:27:44,636
Your face, electronically distorted,

813
00:27:44,637 --> 00:27:47,595
is huddled round and
gawped at by three quarters

814
00:27:47,596 --> 00:27:49,553
of the population of the United Kingdom.

815
00:27:49,554 --> 00:27:52,595
And within a month, every wrinkle,

816
00:27:52,596 --> 00:27:56,053
every wart and pustule has become part

817
00:27:56,054 --> 00:27:57,794
of our British way of life.

818
00:27:57,795 --> 00:28:00,011
- Well, I hardly think...
- Start speaking your mind,

819
00:28:00,012 --> 00:28:02,386
and they'll say you're rude and offensive.

820
00:28:02,387 --> 00:28:03,803
Stop speaking your mind,

821
00:28:03,804 --> 00:28:06,678
well, you're namby-pamby,
and you're slipping.

822
00:28:06,679 --> 00:28:08,220
- Yes, but they tell me that...
- Mind you, mind you,

823
00:28:08,221 --> 00:28:09,553
I'm not saying the British public

824
00:28:09,554 --> 00:28:11,553
isn't warm-hearted and generous.

825
00:28:11,554 --> 00:28:12,636
They are.

826
00:28:12,637 --> 00:28:14,303
Terrifyingly so.

827
00:28:14,304 --> 00:28:16,386
You have but to clear your throat,

828
00:28:16,387 --> 00:28:18,303
And the following day you'll be inundated

829
00:28:18,304 --> 00:28:22,553
with lintesses and
pastilles, pills and potions

830
00:28:22,554 --> 00:28:24,834
and fryers and every kind of balsam.

831
00:28:26,346 --> 00:28:28,178
Thank you, Gilbert.

832
00:28:28,179 --> 00:28:29,928
I say your tips have
been very encouraging.

833
00:28:29,929 --> 00:28:32,095
Oh, with pleasure.

834
00:28:32,096 --> 00:28:33,511
Are you finished with
these, Lady Barnett?

835
00:28:33,512 --> 00:28:35,386
Yes, thank you so much.

836
00:28:35,387 --> 00:28:36,511
Isabelle.

837
00:28:36,512 --> 00:28:37,886
Laura, my dear, how nice to see you.

838
00:28:37,887 --> 00:28:39,303
I'm so glad I've run into you.

839
00:28:39,304 --> 00:28:41,720
Listen, they want me to
do a television series.

840
00:28:41,721 --> 00:28:42,553
Good for you.

841
00:28:42,554 --> 00:28:43,387
Well, that's just it.

842
00:28:43,388 --> 00:28:44,221
I mean, is it?

843
00:28:44,222 --> 00:28:46,011
You see, it's a daily series.

844
00:28:46,012 --> 00:28:46,846
- Daily?
- Hmm.

845
00:28:46,847 --> 00:28:49,011
There aren't that number
of earrings in the world.

846
00:28:49,012 --> 00:28:50,386
Earrings?

847
00:28:50,387 --> 00:28:51,678
My dear, for a woman on television,

848
00:28:51,679 --> 00:28:53,470
only three things really matter,

849
00:28:53,471 --> 00:28:55,761
hair, jewellery, clothes.

850
00:28:55,762 --> 00:28:57,178
Ah, now what about clothes?

851
00:28:57,179 --> 00:28:59,928
Does one plunge or does
one come up to here?

852
00:28:59,929 --> 00:29:03,261
Um, sort of happy medium,
you know, about there.

853
00:29:03,262 --> 00:29:06,386
Actually, there is a
regulation BBC plimsoll line.

854
00:29:06,387 --> 00:29:07,346
If you sink below it,

855
00:29:07,347 --> 00:29:10,053
they come along and pin
a bit of sacking across.

856
00:29:10,054 --> 00:29:10,887
Ooh, dear.

857
00:29:10,888 --> 00:29:12,136
Well, in that case, Raymond,

858
00:29:12,137 --> 00:29:14,053
I think I better have
my regular appointments

859
00:29:14,054 --> 00:29:15,970
for Mondays and Wednesdays.

860
00:29:15,971 --> 00:29:18,053
Wednesday's out of
the question, Duchess.

861
00:29:18,054 --> 00:29:20,220
I'm sorry, Mrs. Foster.

862
00:29:20,221 --> 00:29:22,762
That's the day when I'm on TV.

863
00:29:29,133 --> 00:29:31,053
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

864
00:29:31,054 --> 00:29:32,428
Mr. and Mrs. Foster are expecting us.

865
00:29:32,429 --> 00:29:33,303
Oh, come in.

866
00:29:33,304 --> 00:29:34,179
Thank you.

867
00:29:34,180 --> 00:29:35,636
Are you from the BBC?

868
00:29:35,637 --> 00:29:36,553
That's right.

869
00:29:36,554 --> 00:29:37,471
Oh, in there.

870
00:29:38,054 --> 00:29:39,032
Thank you.

871
00:29:39,033 --> 00:29:40,012
David!

872
00:29:40,013 --> 00:29:41,678
W... wait a minute.

873
00:29:41,679 --> 00:29:43,136
What's your name?

874
00:29:43,137 --> 00:29:43,970
Jessie.

875
00:29:43,971 --> 00:29:44,804
Why?

876
00:29:44,805 --> 00:29:46,845
David, we simply must use her.

877
00:29:46,846 --> 00:29:48,346
She's absolute heaven.

878
00:29:48,523 --> 00:29:50,803
But I've never seen a face like it.

879
00:29:50,804 --> 00:29:51,721
Here, that's enough of that.

880
00:29:51,722 --> 00:29:52,553
It's all right.

881
00:29:52,554 --> 00:29:53,387
He's only suggesting that you should

882
00:29:53,388 --> 00:29:54,304
appear in the television show

883
00:29:54,305 --> 00:29:55,470
with Mr. and Mrs. Foster.

884
00:29:55,471 --> 00:29:58,553
She'd be sensational.

885
00:29:58,554 --> 00:29:59,554
What do you say?

886
00:29:59,555 --> 00:30:01,511
Well, I'd have to ask the master first.

887
00:30:01,512 --> 00:30:02,678
We'll ask him now.

888
00:30:02,679 --> 00:30:03,679
Yes.

889
00:30:04,637 --> 00:30:07,220
Good morning.

890
00:30:07,221 --> 00:30:08,096
Um, this is Adrian Lee,

891
00:30:08,097 --> 00:30:09,345
who's going to design our sets,

892
00:30:09,346 --> 00:30:10,179
Mr. and Mrs. Foster.

893
00:30:10,180 --> 00:30:11,428
- How do you do?
- Hello.

894
00:30:11,429 --> 00:30:14,095
My dears, what a divine room.

895
00:30:14,096 --> 00:30:15,220
It's absolutely you.

896
00:30:15,221 --> 00:30:17,553
Your personalities are
simply stamped all over it.

897
00:30:17,554 --> 00:30:20,553
You know, nobody could possibly
invent anything like this.

898
00:30:20,554 --> 00:30:22,511
Do you think I might browse around a bit?

899
00:30:22,512 --> 00:30:23,512
Oh, please do.

900
00:30:24,637 --> 00:30:25,837
All right, Jessie.

901
00:30:26,887 --> 00:30:27,887
Oh, um.

902
00:30:27,888 --> 00:30:29,261
I was going to ask you.

903
00:30:29,262 --> 00:30:30,221
I think it would be rather fun

904
00:30:30,222 --> 00:30:32,011
if Jessie and Wilson
appeared in the series,

905
00:30:32,012 --> 00:30:33,470
as themselves, you know.

906
00:30:33,471 --> 00:30:34,304
Do you mind?

907
00:30:34,305 --> 00:30:35,511
Not if you don't.

908
00:30:35,512 --> 00:30:37,553
Well, I think it would be
more true to life, don't you?

909
00:30:37,554 --> 00:30:40,095
Fancy me an actress.

910
00:30:40,096 --> 00:30:41,012
I should be like that maid

911
00:30:41,013 --> 00:30:42,803
with ""Life with the Lyons,"" shan't I?

912
00:30:42,804 --> 00:30:43,637
In a way.

913
00:30:43,638 --> 00:30:45,798
Only I don't talk with an accent.

914
00:30:46,304 --> 00:30:47,324
All right then.

915
00:30:48,304 --> 00:30:52,137
Ooh, as long as you don't
expect me to be funny.

916
00:30:52,988 --> 00:30:55,928
You know it's funny
she should have mentioned

917
00:30:55,929 --> 00:30:57,220
""Life with the Lyons""

918
00:30:57,221 --> 00:31:00,053
because that's the one thing
that DTD had against you two.

919
00:31:00,054 --> 00:31:00,887
- Oh?
- What was?

920
00:31:00,888 --> 00:31:02,345
Well, the fact that you've no children,

921
00:31:02,346 --> 00:31:04,303
you know, to complete
the popular conception

922
00:31:04,304 --> 00:31:06,178
of real domestic bliss.

923
00:31:06,179 --> 00:31:07,845
Still, you never know, do you,

924
00:31:07,846 --> 00:31:10,845
if we are a success
and we run long enough.

925
00:31:10,846 --> 00:31:11,762
Well now.

926
00:31:11,763 --> 00:31:13,595
First of all, we've got to have a title.

927
00:31:13,596 --> 00:31:14,512
That's equally important.

928
00:31:14,513 --> 00:31:17,261
We want something, well,
short, simple and effective.

929
00:31:17,262 --> 00:31:19,428
Oh, and if possible,
bringing in your name.

930
00:31:19,429 --> 00:31:20,761
""The Foster Family.""

931
00:31:20,762 --> 00:31:23,386
Oh no, no, no, too
ordinary, too hackneyed.

932
00:31:23,387 --> 00:31:24,221
Anyway, as I've just said,

933
00:31:24,222 --> 00:31:26,428
it's not factually
accurate, is it, not yet.

934
00:31:26,429 --> 00:31:27,429
I understood we were being engaged

935
00:31:27,430 --> 00:31:30,428
for a television series,
not to boost the birthrate.

936
00:31:30,429 --> 00:31:33,053
How about ""Foster Frolics?""

937
00:31:33,054 --> 00:31:34,636
It sounds like the falderals.

938
00:31:34,637 --> 00:31:36,220
""Fade in the Fosters,"" do you think?

939
00:31:36,221 --> 00:31:38,303
Hmm hmm, I can imagine what the critics

940
00:31:38,304 --> 00:31:39,684
would do to that one.

941
00:31:40,226 --> 00:31:42,386
""Foster Parents"" wouldn't be bad,

942
00:31:42,387 --> 00:31:44,553
if only, uh...

943
00:31:44,554 --> 00:31:46,303
Oh, I'm so sorry.

944
00:31:46,304 --> 00:31:47,636
""Follow the Fosters.""

945
00:31:47,637 --> 00:31:49,011
Where to?

946
00:31:49,012 --> 00:31:50,761
I'm only throwing out ideas.

947
00:31:50,762 --> 00:31:52,803
Well, you better throw that
one right out, hadn't you?

948
00:31:52,804 --> 00:31:54,636
""The Foster Formula.""

949
00:31:54,637 --> 00:31:55,928
Oh, there's no need to make it sound

950
00:31:55,929 --> 00:31:57,803
like a patent medicine, is there?

951
00:31:57,804 --> 00:31:59,845
How about ""Fostering Goodwill?""

952
00:31:59,846 --> 00:32:01,303
Why?

953
00:32:01,304 --> 00:32:06,136
Well, it's a play on words,
Foster, fostering goodwill.

954
00:32:06,137 --> 00:32:08,777
Oddly enough, even
I had understood that.

955
00:32:08,778 --> 00:32:11,636
Why not call it ""Festering
Sores"" and be done with it.

956
00:32:11,637 --> 00:32:12,470
Simon!

957
00:32:12,471 --> 00:32:13,303
Laura!

958
00:32:13,304 --> 00:32:14,137
That's it!

959
00:32:14,138 --> 00:32:14,970
That's it.

960
00:32:14,971 --> 00:32:15,803
""Simon and Laura.""

961
00:32:15,804 --> 00:32:16,762
Absolutely straightforward,

962
00:32:16,763 --> 00:32:17,596
absolutely simple.

963
00:32:17,597 --> 00:32:19,053
It's just what we want.

964
00:32:19,054 --> 00:32:21,136
Oh, as long as CT approves.

965
00:32:21,137 --> 00:32:22,303
Of course.

966
00:32:22,304 --> 00:32:24,011
Miss Honeyman.

967
00:32:24,012 --> 00:32:24,846
- Ah, good morning, Janet.
- Morning.

968
00:32:24,847 --> 00:32:25,679
Good morning.

969
00:32:25,680 --> 00:32:26,720
Come in, darling.

970
00:32:26,721 --> 00:32:27,596
Hello.

971
00:32:27,597 --> 00:32:28,636
The first instalment.

972
00:32:28,637 --> 00:32:30,761
- Oh, good.
- Oh, splendid.

973
00:32:30,762 --> 00:32:31,721
- For you.
- Thank you.

974
00:32:31,722 --> 00:32:33,636
What on earth do you think you're doing?

975
00:32:33,637 --> 00:32:35,803
Just you think, all
those millions of people

976
00:32:35,804 --> 00:32:37,636
when they switch on their tellies,

977
00:32:37,637 --> 00:32:38,928
and what are they going to see?

978
00:32:38,929 --> 00:32:39,762
Hmm.

979
00:32:39,763 --> 00:32:41,178
Me.

980
00:32:41,179 --> 00:32:42,137
Makes your stomach turn over

981
00:32:42,138 --> 00:32:43,303
when you think of it, doesn't it?

982
00:32:43,304 --> 00:32:44,137
Yes, it does rather.

983
00:32:44,138 --> 00:32:47,470
But never mind, the makeup
department can do wonders.

984
00:32:47,471 --> 00:32:48,387
Oh, well, it's all right for you.

985
00:32:48,388 --> 00:32:49,470
You've been on the stage before.

986
00:32:49,471 --> 00:32:50,678
That was different.

987
00:32:50,679 --> 00:32:52,303
I was legitimate.

988
00:32:52,304 --> 00:32:53,595
Now, that's enough of that.

989
00:32:53,596 --> 00:32:54,928
My parents were married before I was born,

990
00:32:54,929 --> 00:32:57,553
and I've got the lines to prove it.

991
00:32:57,554 --> 00:32:58,595
The only lines that need worry you

992
00:32:58,596 --> 00:33:00,053
are the ones in the script.

993
00:33:00,054 --> 00:33:00,887
Yes, I know.

994
00:33:00,888 --> 00:33:02,261
I don't know how I'm going
to remember all those words.

995
00:33:02,262 --> 00:33:04,636
You know, you could give me a few tips.

996
00:33:04,637 --> 00:33:06,595
You've been in the entertainment business.

997
00:33:06,596 --> 00:33:07,596
This isn't entertainment.

998
00:33:07,597 --> 00:33:08,856
This is television.

999
00:33:09,618 --> 00:33:12,678
Well, let's read straight
through it, shall we,

1000
00:33:12,679 --> 00:33:14,539
and we'll see how it sounds.

1001
00:33:15,137 --> 00:33:16,345
Allow me.

1002
00:33:16,346 --> 00:33:17,346
Oh.

1003
00:33:18,679 --> 00:33:21,845
Now then, um, the scene is this lounge.

1004
00:33:21,846 --> 00:33:24,261
Your off upstairs, Laura.

1005
00:33:24,262 --> 00:33:28,136
Simon, we pick you up in the hall.

1006
00:33:28,137 --> 00:33:30,761
Hang up your hat, come in,

1007
00:33:30,762 --> 00:33:33,261
and cross to about here.

1008
00:33:33,262 --> 00:33:34,345
Right.

1009
00:33:34,346 --> 00:33:36,146
All right, up you go, Laura.

1010
00:33:37,498 --> 00:33:39,178
When you're ready, Simon.

1011
00:33:39,179 --> 00:33:40,179
Hat.

1012
00:33:43,304 --> 00:33:44,304
Darling.

1013
00:33:44,305 --> 00:33:46,803
Now, you come down eagerly.

1014
00:33:46,804 --> 00:33:49,136
Thank heavens I'm
supposed to be an actress.

1015
00:33:49,137 --> 00:33:50,074
Simon.

1016
00:33:50,075 --> 00:33:51,012
Laura.

1017
00:33:52,446 --> 00:33:53,886
How did rehearsals go?

1018
00:33:53,887 --> 00:33:55,678
Well enough, but I missed you.

1019
00:33:55,679 --> 00:33:58,136
I can't be in every
scene you're in, darling.

1020
00:33:58,137 --> 00:33:59,428
Why not?

1021
00:33:59,429 --> 00:34:00,387
Part of the play is supposed

1022
00:34:00,388 --> 00:34:01,970
to take place in a monastery.

1023
00:34:01,971 --> 00:34:03,761
That comes out in episode three.

1024
00:34:03,762 --> 00:34:04,596
- Oh.
- Oh.

1025
00:34:04,597 --> 00:34:06,762
Right, over to the sofa.

1026
00:34:07,804 --> 00:34:10,845
It's so late, and you look so tired.

1027
00:34:10,846 --> 00:34:13,678
Well, I had to wait a
long time for the bus.

1028
00:34:13,679 --> 00:34:17,386
Imagine Simon using a bus.

1029
00:34:17,387 --> 00:34:20,220
We have to avoid any snob element.

1030
00:34:20,221 --> 00:34:21,929
Poor sweet, sit down.

1031
00:34:23,304 --> 00:34:24,304
There.

1032
00:34:25,881 --> 00:34:28,761
Besides, I stopped
somewhere on the way home.

1033
00:34:28,762 --> 00:34:30,428
That's the first ring of
truth in the script too.

1034
00:34:30,429 --> 00:34:33,970
To buy you a little
something for our anniversary.

1035
00:34:33,971 --> 00:34:35,553
So you didn't forget?

1036
00:34:35,554 --> 00:34:38,734
Something you've had your
eye on for a long time.

1037
00:34:44,346 --> 00:34:45,761
The necklace!

1038
00:34:45,762 --> 00:34:47,595
Oh, Simon, put it on for me.

1039
00:34:47,596 --> 00:34:48,616
Round the back.

1040
00:34:49,721 --> 00:34:50,721
All right.

1041
00:34:52,679 --> 00:34:55,019
Is this table gonna be here, old boy?

1042
00:35:09,081 --> 00:35:10,761
Simon, they're beautiful.

1043
00:35:10,762 --> 00:35:13,042
Lucky pearls to be around your neck.

1044
00:35:13,043 --> 00:35:15,428
Let's dine somewhere very special tonight

1045
00:35:15,429 --> 00:35:16,761
as a celebration, right?

1046
00:35:16,762 --> 00:35:17,721
Darling, don't you think a quiet

1047
00:35:17,722 --> 00:35:20,136
little dinner at home would be much nicer,

1048
00:35:20,137 --> 00:35:21,470
just the two of us?

1049
00:35:21,471 --> 00:35:23,136
When's the boxing coming on?

1050
00:35:23,137 --> 00:35:24,970
Not till after this muck.

1051
00:35:24,971 --> 00:35:26,178
Well, when's the panel game?

1052
00:35:26,179 --> 00:35:27,970
Oh, it's been on, Gran.

1053
00:35:27,971 --> 00:35:30,136
- Why didn't you nudge me?
- We did.

1054
00:35:30,137 --> 00:35:32,957
Well, nudge me when
the boxing's coming on.

1055
00:35:34,054 --> 00:35:35,386
Ah, look at that.

1056
00:35:35,387 --> 00:35:37,511
That's the Thompson's blasted car again.

1057
00:35:37,512 --> 00:35:38,346
Is it the boxing?

1058
00:35:38,347 --> 00:35:39,720
No.

1059
00:35:39,721 --> 00:35:40,721
Oh.

1060
00:35:43,512 --> 00:35:45,511
There you are.

1061
00:35:45,512 --> 00:35:47,220
My darling, a toast.

1062
00:35:47,221 --> 00:35:48,221
To us.

1063
00:35:50,805 --> 00:35:54,345
Excuse me, sir, there's a
police constable in the hall.

1064
00:35:54,346 --> 00:35:55,845
A police constable?

1065
00:35:55,846 --> 00:35:57,845
A very tough customer, sir.

1066
00:35:57,846 --> 00:35:59,136
Oh, well, show him in.

1067
00:35:59,137 --> 00:36:00,012
Yes, sir.

1068
00:36:00,013 --> 00:36:02,261
Oh, darling, what can he want?

1069
00:36:02,262 --> 00:36:04,678
Did you remember to
take out the TV last night?

1070
00:36:04,679 --> 00:36:06,178
But, Simon
darling, I thought that you...

1071
00:36:06,179 --> 00:36:07,303
But, angel, I thought that you.

1072
00:36:07,304 --> 00:36:09,637
Will you come this way, please?

1073
00:36:11,637 --> 00:36:14,845
The police tonight of all nights!

1074
00:36:14,846 --> 00:36:17,726
Perhaps he's only
selling tickets for the...

1075
00:36:20,304 --> 00:36:21,553
Mr. Foster?

1076
00:36:21,554 --> 00:36:22,387
Yes.

1077
00:36:22,388 --> 00:36:24,761
Don't you remember me, sir?

1078
00:36:24,762 --> 00:36:26,220
Coka!

1079
00:36:26,221 --> 00:36:28,095
Dear old Coka.

1080
00:36:28,096 --> 00:36:29,636
We were together in the war, darling.

1081
00:36:29,637 --> 00:36:30,470
I know.

1082
00:36:30,471 --> 00:36:31,303
Elsie, look.

1083
00:36:31,304 --> 00:36:32,137
Who does he remind you of?

1084
00:36:32,138 --> 00:36:33,511
Nobody I care to remember.

1085
00:36:33,512 --> 00:36:35,261
Well, he's the spittin'
image of old Dusty Miller.

1086
00:36:35,262 --> 00:36:36,303
Served with me in Italy.

1087
00:36:36,304 --> 00:36:37,886
Well, you needn't think
you're gonna bring him home.

1088
00:36:37,887 --> 00:36:41,007
We don't know your army
friends here, thank you.

1089
00:36:41,762 --> 00:36:45,095
# They say there's a troop
ship just leaving Bombay #

1090
00:36:45,096 --> 00:36:48,386
# Bound for old blighty shore #

1091
00:36:48,387 --> 00:36:51,845
# Heavily laden with time-expired men #

1092
00:36:51,846 --> 00:36:54,761
# Bound for the land they adore #

1093
00:36:54,762 --> 00:36:58,053
# There's many an airman
just finishing his time #

1094
00:36:58,054 --> 00:37:01,261
# There's many a twerp signing on #

1095
00:37:01,262 --> 00:37:04,428
# You'll get no promotion
this side of the ocean #

1096
00:37:04,429 --> 00:37:08,053
# So cheer up my lads, bless 'em all #

1097
00:37:08,054 --> 00:37:11,636
# Bless 'em all, bless 'em all #

1098
00:37:11,637 --> 00:37:14,928
# The long and the short and the tall #

1099
00:37:14,929 --> 00:37:17,970
# Bless all the #

1100
00:37:17,971 --> 00:37:19,845
Elsie, I've gone deaf.

1101
00:37:19,846 --> 00:37:20,679
Oh, it's all right, Gran.

1102
00:37:20,680 --> 00:37:21,845
The sound's packed up.

1103
00:37:21,846 --> 00:37:22,679
I'll do it!

1104
00:37:22,680 --> 00:37:24,780
You keep your hands off that set.

1105
00:37:26,165 --> 00:37:27,845
Cost me 90 quid, that did.

1106
00:37:27,846 --> 00:37:28,679
It's not a toy.

1107
00:37:28,680 --> 00:37:30,303
It's a very delicate instrument.

1108
00:37:30,304 --> 00:37:31,553
# The war #

1109
00:37:31,554 --> 00:37:35,011
# You'll get no promotion
this side of the ocean #

1110
00:37:35,012 --> 00:37:39,429
# So cheer up my lads, bless 'em all #

1111
00:37:56,406 --> 00:37:57,846
- Darling.
- Oh, David,

1112
00:37:57,847 --> 00:37:58,636
were we all right?

1113
00:37:58,637 --> 00:37:59,637
Oh, honey, you were wonderful.

1114
00:37:59,638 --> 00:38:03,511
- Oh, you were both so good!
- We loved every minute of it.

1115
00:38:03,512 --> 00:38:05,679
Let's hope the press liked it.

1116
00:38:47,105 --> 00:38:48,845
Not a hope, my dear fellow.

1117
00:38:48,846 --> 00:38:50,886
Simon and Laura aren't free.

1118
00:38:50,887 --> 00:38:53,136
No, not for months, years perhaps.

1119
00:38:53,137 --> 00:38:55,220
They're working, working.

1120
00:38:55,221 --> 00:38:56,511
Working.

1121
00:38:56,512 --> 00:38:57,866
Mom!

1122
00:38:57,867 --> 00:38:59,220
Elsie!

1123
00:38:59,221 --> 00:39:00,054
Come on, you two!

1124
00:39:00,055 --> 00:39:01,721
They're just starting.

1125
00:39:04,429 --> 00:39:07,636
Oh, Simon, just look at this hole.

1126
00:39:07,637 --> 00:39:09,636
How on earth do you manage to do it?

1127
00:39:09,637 --> 00:39:11,557
Well, it's quite easy really.

1128
00:39:14,096 --> 00:39:15,428
Ah, tea.

1129
00:39:15,429 --> 00:39:17,345
Jessie, what a lovely cake.

1130
00:39:17,346 --> 00:39:18,387
Madam made it.

1131
00:39:24,382 --> 00:39:25,488
It's well-produced.

1132
00:39:25,489 --> 00:39:26,596
It's well-acted.

1133
00:39:26,597 --> 00:39:27,970
It's good up to a point.

1134
00:39:27,971 --> 00:39:29,595
But it just misses.

1135
00:39:29,596 --> 00:39:31,553
Oh, well, do you really think so, sir?

1136
00:39:31,554 --> 00:39:32,428
I do.

1137
00:39:32,429 --> 00:39:33,304
And shall I tell you why?

1138
00:39:33,305 --> 00:39:36,928
Because family life is not
family life without children.

1139
00:39:36,929 --> 00:39:38,720
But surely, sir, Simon
and Laura are different.

1140
00:39:38,721 --> 00:39:39,554
They are.

1141
00:39:39,555 --> 00:39:40,678
They haven't got any children.

1142
00:39:40,679 --> 00:39:42,553
If you'd followed my
idea in the first place...

1143
00:39:42,554 --> 00:39:45,303
I did try, sir, but, well,
they just wouldn't hear of it.

1144
00:39:45,304 --> 00:39:46,137
They're under contract, aren't they?

1145
00:39:46,138 --> 00:39:47,511
Well, of course, sir.

1146
00:39:47,512 --> 00:39:48,761
Well then, what are you waiting for?

1147
00:39:48,762 --> 00:39:50,928
Tell Mrs. Honeyman to get
busy on a new instalment

1148
00:39:50,929 --> 00:39:52,249
using my suggestion.

1149
00:39:53,554 --> 00:39:54,574
All right, sir.

1150
00:39:57,054 --> 00:39:59,886
Laura, have you read episode 68?

1151
00:39:59,887 --> 00:40:01,011
No, why?

1152
00:40:01,012 --> 00:40:03,678
Well, they've introduced a blasted kid.

1153
00:40:03,679 --> 00:40:04,512
Well, they can't.

1154
00:40:04,513 --> 00:40:05,678
Everybody knows we haven't got one.

1155
00:40:05,679 --> 00:40:07,428
Well, it's a cousin
or a nephew or something

1156
00:40:07,429 --> 00:40:08,261
come on a visit.

1157
00:40:08,262 --> 00:40:09,096
Oh, that's not so bad.

1158
00:40:09,097 --> 00:40:09,929
Not so bad?

1159
00:40:09,930 --> 00:40:12,595
He's got all the best
lines and the fade out.

1160
00:40:12,596 --> 00:40:13,449
Good grief.

1161
00:40:13,450 --> 00:40:14,303
Now what?

1162
00:40:14,304 --> 00:40:15,137
It's quite a visit.

1163
00:40:15,138 --> 00:40:16,878
He's in 69 and 70 as well.

1164
00:40:18,578 --> 00:40:20,678
Camera three by the fire shooting

1165
00:40:20,679 --> 00:40:25,553
onto the settee, and camera
four out in the hall.

1166
00:40:25,554 --> 00:40:26,886
Where do you want that?

1167
00:40:26,887 --> 00:40:28,053
Um, well look, I'll show you.

1168
00:40:28,054 --> 00:40:28,887
Morning.

1169
00:40:28,888 --> 00:40:30,636
- Just about here, all right?
- Hello, boys and girls.

1170
00:40:30,637 --> 00:40:31,720
All right, quiet every one!

1171
00:40:31,721 --> 00:40:33,761
Now, let's run through
episode 68, shall we?

1172
00:40:33,762 --> 00:40:34,721
- Good morning, darling.
- Morning.

1173
00:40:34,722 --> 00:40:35,554
- How are you?
- Fine.

1174
00:40:35,555 --> 00:40:36,636
Good.

1175
00:40:36,637 --> 00:40:37,637
Timothy?

1176
00:40:38,762 --> 00:40:40,178
Now where's Timothy?

1177
00:40:40,179 --> 00:40:41,179
Here I am.

1178
00:40:41,180 --> 00:40:42,553
Ah.

1179
00:40:42,554 --> 00:40:45,220
Simon, Laura, I want you to meet Timothy.

1180
00:40:45,221 --> 00:40:46,136
Hello.

1181
00:40:46,137 --> 00:40:47,137
How do you do, sir?

1182
00:40:47,138 --> 00:40:47,970
How do you do?

1183
00:40:47,971 --> 00:40:48,887
- Ah!
- Ha ha, caught you.

1184
00:40:48,888 --> 00:40:49,804
It's electronic.

1185
00:40:49,805 --> 00:40:50,637
Charming.

1186
00:40:50,638 --> 00:40:52,386
All right, Timothy, now that's enough

1187
00:40:52,387 --> 00:40:53,221
fun and games for one day.

1188
00:40:53,222 --> 00:40:54,542
You go and sit down.

1189
00:40:55,541 --> 00:40:57,761
Well now, Simon, you're discovered

1190
00:40:57,762 --> 00:41:00,178
sitting on the sofa talking to Timothy.

1191
00:41:00,179 --> 00:41:01,470
To Timothy.

1192
00:41:01,471 --> 00:41:02,971
Darling.

1193
00:41:06,887 --> 00:41:08,053
Here you go.

1194
00:41:08,054 --> 00:41:09,136
Right.

1195
00:41:09,137 --> 00:41:11,053
That's right.

1196
00:41:11,054 --> 00:41:13,303
Now, Timothy, what have
you and Auntie Laura

1197
00:41:13,304 --> 00:41:14,304
been doing all day?

1198
00:41:14,305 --> 00:41:15,761
Don't tell me, let me guess.

1199
00:41:15,762 --> 00:41:16,595
Excuse me.

1200
00:41:16,596 --> 00:41:17,428
Shh, shh, shh.

1201
00:41:17,429 --> 00:41:18,262
Excuse me.

1202
00:41:18,263 --> 00:41:19,511
Well, what is it?

1203
00:41:19,512 --> 00:41:20,636
You're sitting on my choc ice.

1204
00:41:20,637 --> 00:41:21,637
Timothy!

1205
00:41:24,073 --> 00:41:27,553
Ooh, Miss Honeyman, can I
have a word with you, please?

1206
00:41:27,554 --> 00:41:29,095
Well, yes, Jessie, of course.

1207
00:41:29,096 --> 00:41:29,929
What is it?

1208
00:41:29,930 --> 00:41:31,470
Well, it's about the series.

1209
00:41:31,471 --> 00:41:34,845
I don't feel that my character
is sufficiently established.

1210
00:41:34,846 --> 00:41:35,721
Oh, you don't?

1211
00:41:35,722 --> 00:41:37,053
No, I mean, all the programme,

1212
00:41:37,054 --> 00:41:38,803
all I've done is to open and shut doors

1213
00:41:38,804 --> 00:41:40,386
and carry trays on and off.

1214
00:41:40,387 --> 00:41:42,553
I've had quite a lot of
letters from viewers about it.

1215
00:41:42,554 --> 00:41:44,553
Oh, how is your fan mail these days?

1216
00:41:44,554 --> 00:41:47,178
42 letters last week and
a proposal of marriage.

1217
00:41:47,179 --> 00:41:48,345
Oh, who from?

1218
00:41:48,346 --> 00:41:50,011
Well, it was written
on prison notepaper,

1219
00:41:50,012 --> 00:41:51,261
but you could tell it was a gentleman.

1220
00:41:51,262 --> 00:41:52,720
Oh, I'm sure.

1221
00:41:52,721 --> 00:41:54,053
Well, what do you want me to do about it?

1222
00:41:54,054 --> 00:41:57,595
Well, I thought, couldn't
I have a few love scenes?

1223
00:41:57,596 --> 00:41:58,886
Who with, Wilson?

1224
00:41:58,887 --> 00:41:59,721
Oh, no.

1225
00:41:59,722 --> 00:42:00,845
I haven't got down to that.

1226
00:42:00,846 --> 00:42:03,845
No, couldn't I have a bit
of a crush on the master?

1227
00:42:03,846 --> 00:42:05,095
On Simon?

1228
00:42:05,096 --> 00:42:06,261
On Mr. Foster?

1229
00:42:06,262 --> 00:42:07,845
Oh, a hopeless one, of course.

1230
00:42:07,846 --> 00:42:10,595
You know, like Pagliacci.

1231
00:42:10,596 --> 00:42:11,429
Uh, yes.

1232
00:42:11,430 --> 00:42:14,010
Well, I'll, I'll think it over, Jessie.

1233
00:42:14,512 --> 00:42:16,511
Yes, I think you better had.

1234
00:42:16,512 --> 00:42:17,345
You're late.

1235
00:42:17,346 --> 00:42:18,179
Now, where have you been?

1236
00:42:18,180 --> 00:42:20,053
To a lecture on electro-chemistry.

1237
00:42:20,054 --> 00:42:21,136
That was this morning.

1238
00:42:21,137 --> 00:42:23,220
Then I had an interview
with a film producer.

1239
00:42:23,221 --> 00:42:24,054
When?

1240
00:42:24,055 --> 00:42:25,428
Immediately after lunch.

1241
00:42:25,429 --> 00:42:27,595
It is now 5:30.

1242
00:42:27,596 --> 00:42:30,386
Immediately after his lunch not mine.

1243
00:42:30,387 --> 00:42:32,678
Ooh, by the way, am I to be a permanent

1244
00:42:32,679 --> 00:42:33,803
character in this thing?

1245
00:42:33,804 --> 00:42:34,886
Maybe.

1246
00:42:34,887 --> 00:42:37,053
I'm only signed up
for six more programmes,

1247
00:42:37,054 --> 00:42:38,012
and if I do the film,

1248
00:42:38,013 --> 00:42:39,386
I have to have my hair dyed.

1249
00:42:39,387 --> 00:42:40,511
Well, it all depends on how

1250
00:42:40,512 --> 00:42:42,261
good Mr. Prentice thinks you are.

1251
00:42:42,262 --> 00:42:43,303
You can hardly win an Oscar

1252
00:42:43,304 --> 00:42:45,761
with the kind of gaff you give me to say.

1253
00:42:45,762 --> 00:42:46,762
Thank you, dear.

1254
00:42:46,763 --> 00:42:49,763
Ask the makeup girl to
do both your heads, hmm?

1255
00:42:55,721 --> 00:42:58,001
Hello, Uncle, know your lines today?

1256
00:43:20,429 --> 00:43:21,928
Hello.

1257
00:43:21,929 --> 00:43:23,011
For you, Miss Honeyman.

1258
00:43:23,012 --> 00:43:24,179
Oh, thank you.

1259
00:43:26,096 --> 00:43:27,303
Yes?

1260
00:43:27,304 --> 00:43:28,984
Oh, Laura, hello, darling.

1261
00:43:29,804 --> 00:43:30,804
Is it urgent?

1262
00:43:32,346 --> 00:43:35,226
Oh, in that case, I'll
come over right away.

1263
00:43:36,804 --> 00:43:37,803
Trouble.

1264
00:43:37,804 --> 00:43:38,721
They've just ready 108.

1265
00:43:38,722 --> 00:43:40,720
Now, don't let them change a thing.

1266
00:43:40,721 --> 00:43:41,861
I'll do my best.

1267
00:43:44,012 --> 00:43:45,012
Come in.

1268
00:43:46,543 --> 00:43:49,303
Could I have a word
with you, Mr. Prentice?

1269
00:43:49,304 --> 00:43:50,761
Oh hello, Wilson.

1270
00:43:50,762 --> 00:43:51,886
Don't tell me you want a love interest

1271
00:43:51,887 --> 00:43:53,136
written in for you and Mrs. Foster.

1272
00:43:53,137 --> 00:43:54,636
Oh, no, no.

1273
00:43:54,637 --> 00:43:56,011
What's the trouble?

1274
00:43:56,012 --> 00:43:57,886
It's my nose.

1275
00:43:57,887 --> 00:43:58,721
Your nose?

1276
00:43:58,722 --> 00:44:00,053
Mm, apparently the makeup girl

1277
00:44:00,054 --> 00:44:02,595
doesn't bring out its finer points.

1278
00:44:02,596 --> 00:44:03,428
Oh.

1279
00:44:03,429 --> 00:44:04,262
My sister-in-law phoned to tell me

1280
00:44:04,263 --> 00:44:06,011
that during the past week it's looked

1281
00:44:06,012 --> 00:44:07,845
nothing more or less than a blob.

1282
00:44:07,846 --> 00:44:09,220
Well, it's probably her set.

1283
00:44:09,221 --> 00:44:11,761
No, no, a brand new 17 incher.

1284
00:44:11,762 --> 00:44:14,303
And she's not the only
one who's noticed it.

1285
00:44:14,304 --> 00:44:16,428
There was a letter from
a lady in Lancastershire.

1286
00:44:16,429 --> 00:44:17,928
Look, Wilson, what with Jessie

1287
00:44:17,929 --> 00:44:19,178
wanting her part sexed up,

1288
00:44:19,179 --> 00:44:20,636
Timothy wanting to dye his hair,

1289
00:44:20,637 --> 00:44:21,970
and the censor cutting every other word,

1290
00:44:21,971 --> 00:44:23,470
I have no time to do anything now.

1291
00:44:23,471 --> 00:44:26,178
But I promise you, I will look
at it very carefully tonight.

1292
00:44:26,179 --> 00:44:27,386
Yes.

1293
00:44:27,387 --> 00:44:29,261
- Now, Laura, please.
- Oh, are you suggesting

1294
00:44:29,262 --> 00:44:30,720
that we put up with that little rat

1295
00:44:30,721 --> 00:44:32,511
for the rest of our television lives?

1296
00:44:32,512 --> 00:44:33,761
Well, we can settle that later.

1297
00:44:33,762 --> 00:44:34,596
- Ha, ha, ha.
- But look what I have

1298
00:44:34,597 --> 00:44:36,928
to say, with a knowing smile, mark you.

1299
00:44:36,929 --> 00:44:39,386
Timothy goes back to
Shropshire on Saturday.

1300
00:44:39,387 --> 00:44:40,262
Well, that's a hell of a line.

1301
00:44:40,263 --> 00:44:41,096
You can't even say it.

1302
00:44:41,097 --> 00:44:44,303
And then what would you say,
Laura, if he didn't go back?

1303
00:44:44,304 --> 00:44:46,970
If he stayed here with us for always?

1304
00:44:46,971 --> 00:44:48,928
Note that little word always.

1305
00:44:48,929 --> 00:44:51,303
And then there is a
moment of absolute silence.

1306
00:44:51,304 --> 00:44:53,261
We see Laura's face in close up,

1307
00:44:53,262 --> 00:44:54,678
radiant with happiness.

1308
00:44:54,679 --> 00:44:55,512
Uh.

1309
00:44:55,513 --> 00:44:56,803
Now listen, Janet, I have acted

1310
00:44:56,804 --> 00:44:59,011
with octogenarians, dipsomaniacs,

1311
00:44:59,012 --> 00:45:02,220
dope fiends, amnesiacs, and veteran cars,

1312
00:45:02,221 --> 00:45:04,011
but I have no intention of trying to keep

1313
00:45:04,012 --> 00:45:06,636
my end up with a child actor
with a face like Timothy's!

1314
00:45:06,637 --> 00:45:07,637
The next thing you'll introduce

1315
00:45:07,638 --> 00:45:08,678
to keep us happy is a spaniel.

1316
00:45:08,679 --> 00:45:11,178
I know every two artists
should welcome competition,

1317
00:45:11,179 --> 00:45:12,012
but this little...
yes, but acting

1318
00:45:12,013 --> 00:45:14,303
with dogs and children is
not competition, it's murder.

1319
00:45:14,304 --> 00:45:15,136
And we won't do it.

1320
00:45:15,137 --> 00:45:16,053
- No, we won't.
- We won't, we won't,

1321
00:45:16,054 --> 00:45:16,971
- we won't.
- We won't, we won't,

1322
00:45:16,972 --> 00:45:17,804
we won't!

1323
00:45:17,805 --> 00:45:20,386
Timothy, darling, can
you give me Miss Bones,

1324
00:45:20,387 --> 00:45:21,970
the butcher's daughter?

1325
00:45:21,971 --> 00:45:23,470
No, Auntie.

1326
00:45:23,471 --> 00:45:25,970
But could you give me Mr. Bones

1327
00:45:25,971 --> 00:45:27,761
and Master Bun the baker's son?

1328
00:45:27,762 --> 00:45:28,762
Ooh.

1329
00:45:31,554 --> 00:45:33,714
And Mrs. Pots the painter's wife?

1330
00:45:36,054 --> 00:45:40,595
Now, Uncle, I'd like Miss Bones.

1331
00:45:40,596 --> 00:45:42,429
And Mr. and Mrs. Mug.

1332
00:45:43,304 --> 00:45:48,011
Oh, Timothy's so good at
making happy families, isn't he?

1333
00:45:48,012 --> 00:45:49,179
Happy families.

1334
00:45:49,818 --> 00:45:51,678
Shall we tell him now, Laura?

1335
00:45:51,679 --> 00:45:52,970
Yes, darling.

1336
00:45:52,971 --> 00:45:56,053
Timothy, we've had a letter from a lawyer.

1337
00:45:56,054 --> 00:45:57,886
And from now on, you can call us

1338
00:45:57,887 --> 00:46:00,887
- Mummy and Daddy.
- Mummy and Daddy.

1339
00:46:04,054 --> 00:46:05,928
Okay, cut.

1340
00:46:05,929 --> 00:46:07,849
I think I'm going to be sick.

1341
00:46:13,179 --> 00:46:16,053
Oh, I'm so sorry, darling.

1342
00:46:16,054 --> 00:46:17,636
CT's just sent for me.

1343
00:46:17,637 --> 00:46:19,220
He's on the warpath about something.

1344
00:46:19,221 --> 00:46:20,054
Oh, don't worry about these.

1345
00:46:20,055 --> 00:46:20,929
I can manage them.

1346
00:46:20,930 --> 00:46:21,803
Oh, all right.

1347
00:46:21,804 --> 00:46:22,762
You better not keep him waiting.

1348
00:46:22,763 --> 00:46:25,220
Uh, I've got two seats for
the midnight premier tonight.

1349
00:46:25,221 --> 00:46:26,137
Want to come?

1350
00:46:26,138 --> 00:46:27,553
Oh, David, I'd love to.

1351
00:46:27,554 --> 00:46:28,387
Pick you up after the show?

1352
00:46:28,388 --> 00:46:29,470
Gorgeous!

1353
00:46:29,471 --> 00:46:30,678
That'll give us time to eat first.

1354
00:46:30,679 --> 00:46:31,511
Mm hmm.

1355
00:46:31,512 --> 00:46:32,346
Listen, I must dash.

1356
00:46:32,347 --> 00:46:33,470
- David?
- Yes?

1357
00:46:33,471 --> 00:46:34,470
Good luck.

1358
00:46:34,471 --> 00:46:35,471
Thank you.

1359
00:46:36,596 --> 00:46:38,220
- Oh.
- Oh.

1360
00:46:38,221 --> 00:46:39,429
- David?
- Yes?

1361
00:46:45,096 --> 00:46:46,096
Come in.

1362
00:46:46,836 --> 00:46:48,096
You wanted me, sir?

1363
00:46:48,097 --> 00:46:48,929
Yes.

1364
00:46:48,930 --> 00:46:51,030
You'd better take off your coat.

1365
00:46:51,031 --> 00:46:53,136
Prentice, your program's going bad on us.

1366
00:46:53,137 --> 00:46:54,636
Listen to this.

1367
00:46:54,637 --> 00:46:57,428
Divinely happy and divinely dull.

1368
00:46:57,429 --> 00:46:59,136
Simon and Laura have shown viewers

1369
00:46:59,137 --> 00:47:00,553
how sublime their marriage is.

1370
00:47:00,554 --> 00:47:01,387
They've done it well.

1371
00:47:01,388 --> 00:47:02,221
We believe them.

1372
00:47:02,222 --> 00:47:04,178
But where do we go from here?

1373
00:47:04,179 --> 00:47:05,859
I, for one, to the cinema.

1374
00:47:06,637 --> 00:47:08,011
Oh, dear.

1375
00:47:08,012 --> 00:47:11,012
And listen to this, from
a woman correspondent.

1376
00:47:11,300 --> 00:47:13,220
Too often is the screen filled

1377
00:47:13,221 --> 00:47:15,386
by the handsome profile of Simon Foster

1378
00:47:15,387 --> 00:47:18,261
murmuring sugary sentiments to his wife.

1379
00:47:18,262 --> 00:47:19,970
Thank heavens we're not
all so happily married

1380
00:47:19,971 --> 00:47:21,511
as Simon and Laura.

1381
00:47:21,512 --> 00:47:23,095
Sometimes, surely, it's the faults

1382
00:47:23,096 --> 00:47:24,656
in our men that we love.

1383
00:47:25,171 --> 00:47:27,511
But Simon's fundamentally nice, sir.

1384
00:47:27,512 --> 00:47:29,136
We can't play him against type.

1385
00:47:29,137 --> 00:47:30,553
Then play him down.

1386
00:47:30,554 --> 00:47:31,886
Cut out his profile.

1387
00:47:31,887 --> 00:47:33,428
Cut him out all together.

1388
00:47:33,429 --> 00:47:35,553
Some new blood in the
programme might help.

1389
00:47:35,554 --> 00:47:38,095
And that script needs pepping up too.

1390
00:47:38,096 --> 00:47:40,886
Tell Miss Honeyman to
read ""Forever Amber.""

1391
00:47:40,887 --> 00:47:41,887
Sir!

1392
00:47:46,179 --> 00:47:47,720
Yes?

1393
00:47:47,721 --> 00:47:48,721
Hello, David.

1394
00:47:49,405 --> 00:47:50,845
You sound very het up.

1395
00:47:50,846 --> 00:47:51,679
I am het up.

1396
00:47:51,680 --> 00:47:52,970
So would you be.

1397
00:47:52,971 --> 00:47:54,220
Look, Laura, are you alone?

1398
00:47:54,221 --> 00:47:56,803
Well, yes, quite alone.

1399
00:47:56,804 --> 00:47:59,178
What is it, something to
do with the programme?

1400
00:47:59,179 --> 00:48:01,678
Oh, don't tell me a spaniel has turned up.

1401
00:48:01,679 --> 00:48:03,053
Oh no, it's nothing like that.

1402
00:48:03,054 --> 00:48:03,929
But it's something I've got

1403
00:48:03,930 --> 00:48:06,090
to discuss with you, Laura, alone.

1404
00:48:06,512 --> 00:48:08,136
No.

1405
00:48:08,137 --> 00:48:10,595
Now look, above all, Simon mustn't know.

1406
00:48:10,596 --> 00:48:13,345
Can you have dinner with
me tonight after the show?

1407
00:48:13,346 --> 00:48:15,428
Oh, Lord, well, can't you get out of it?

1408
00:48:15,429 --> 00:48:17,769
I'm gonna have to cut a date myself.

1409
00:48:18,846 --> 00:48:20,261
That's my Laura.

1410
00:48:20,262 --> 00:48:21,553
Look, darling, we'll
go somewhere very quiet

1411
00:48:21,554 --> 00:48:24,220
where we're not likely to
run into anybody we know.

1412
00:48:24,221 --> 00:48:26,803
Yes, we don't want the tom toms to start.

1413
00:48:26,804 --> 00:48:29,636
All right, and remember,
not a word to Simon.

1414
00:48:29,637 --> 00:48:30,928
Of course not.

1415
00:48:30,929 --> 00:48:31,949
Goodbye, David.

1416
00:48:39,012 --> 00:48:40,761
Ah, there you are.

1417
00:48:40,762 --> 00:48:42,386
I've been looking for you everywhere.

1418
00:48:42,387 --> 00:48:43,428
Really?

1419
00:48:43,429 --> 00:48:45,595
Found some cheerful
music for our next episode?

1420
00:48:45,596 --> 00:48:48,345
Yes, ""March to the Scaffold.""

1421
00:48:48,346 --> 00:48:49,595
Oh.

1422
00:48:49,596 --> 00:48:53,053
Um, Janet, about our date tonight.

1423
00:48:53,054 --> 00:48:53,929
Yes?

1424
00:48:53,930 --> 00:48:55,928
I'm terribly afraid I
shan't be able to make it.

1425
00:48:55,929 --> 00:48:56,762
Why not?

1426
00:48:56,763 --> 00:48:58,470
Well, I'm working on
something for the CT.

1427
00:48:58,471 --> 00:49:00,720
Beastly nuisance, but he insisted.

1428
00:49:00,721 --> 00:49:03,011
But the premier isn't
till midnight, is it?

1429
00:49:03,012 --> 00:49:05,053
Uh, uh, no, but,

1430
00:49:05,054 --> 00:49:07,178
well, it'll probably take me all night.

1431
00:49:07,179 --> 00:49:08,928
Hmm, that's what I thought.

1432
00:49:08,929 --> 00:49:10,678
Yes, well, I shall just have to snatch

1433
00:49:10,679 --> 00:49:11,512
a sandwich and carry on.

1434
00:49:11,513 --> 00:49:14,095
But you could pull up
the stars, I take it.

1435
00:49:14,096 --> 00:49:14,929
I beg your pardon?

1436
00:49:14,930 --> 00:49:16,678
You must think I'm a clot.

1437
00:49:16,679 --> 00:49:18,720
I run your errands, I write your script,

1438
00:49:18,721 --> 00:49:20,511
I even darn your socks for you!

1439
00:49:20,512 --> 00:49:21,886
And then you stand me up for a...

1440
00:49:21,887 --> 00:49:23,261
Now, look, darling, don't get me wrong.

1441
00:49:23,262 --> 00:49:24,096
Wrong?

1442
00:49:24,097 --> 00:49:25,803
Do you think I don't know what's going on?

1443
00:49:25,804 --> 00:49:27,511
I wasn't born yesterday, you know.

1444
00:49:27,512 --> 00:49:28,636
Oh.

1445
00:49:28,637 --> 00:49:30,428
Then it must've been the day before!

1446
00:49:30,429 --> 00:49:31,429
Oh!

1447
00:49:37,762 --> 00:49:38,762
All right.

1448
00:49:39,942 --> 00:49:41,262
Have you seen Laura?

1449
00:49:41,263 --> 00:49:42,095
She's changing.

1450
00:49:42,096 --> 00:49:43,012
She won't be a minute.

1451
00:49:43,013 --> 00:49:43,929
Oh.

1452
00:49:43,930 --> 00:49:45,761
I wanted a quick word with her.

1453
00:49:45,762 --> 00:49:47,636
The CT wants her to do
an ""In Town Tonight""

1454
00:49:47,637 --> 00:49:48,470
a Saturday week.

1455
00:49:48,471 --> 00:49:49,387
Oh, Lord, do we have to?

1456
00:49:49,388 --> 00:49:51,887
Oh, well, not both of you, just Laura.

1457
00:49:52,887 --> 00:49:54,011
Why just Laura?

1458
00:49:54,012 --> 00:49:56,345
Because the winner of the
best Christmas pudding recipe

1459
00:49:56,346 --> 00:49:58,595
happens to be Laura Foster
of Newcastle-under-Lyme,

1460
00:49:58,596 --> 00:50:00,636
and the prize was a visit to the studio

1461
00:50:00,637 --> 00:50:01,761
and a meeting with a star.

1462
00:50:01,762 --> 00:50:02,596
Uh huh.

1463
00:50:02,597 --> 00:50:04,937
So naturally, she chose her namesake.

1464
00:50:04,938 --> 00:50:07,095
If Laura wants to muck up her weekend,

1465
00:50:07,096 --> 00:50:08,511
she's perfectly welcome.

1466
00:50:08,512 --> 00:50:09,346
Exactly.

1467
00:50:09,347 --> 00:50:10,886
And you can enjoy watching her

1468
00:50:10,887 --> 00:50:11,928
from your own far side.

1469
00:50:11,929 --> 00:50:13,553
We haven't got a set.

1470
00:50:13,554 --> 00:50:16,136
Good Lord, why ever not?

1471
00:50:16,137 --> 00:50:17,054
What would we do with one?

1472
00:50:17,055 --> 00:50:19,275
We can't watch our own programmes.

1473
00:50:20,804 --> 00:50:22,303
- Darling.
- Uh huh?

1474
00:50:22,304 --> 00:50:23,928
Um, I've got a splitting headache.

1475
00:50:23,929 --> 00:50:26,303
I really couldn't face going out tonight.

1476
00:50:26,304 --> 00:50:27,304
You haven't had any dinner.

1477
00:50:27,305 --> 00:50:28,970
Well, I couldn't eat a thing.

1478
00:50:28,971 --> 00:50:29,929
But you must.

1479
00:50:29,930 --> 00:50:31,053
Oh.

1480
00:50:31,054 --> 00:50:32,136
Well, if you've really got a headache.

1481
00:50:32,137 --> 00:50:33,678
Well, I can easily take

1482
00:50:33,679 --> 00:50:34,679
- a taxi home.
- No, no, no, look,

1483
00:50:34,680 --> 00:50:36,220
I'll, well, I'll drop you off.

1484
00:50:36,221 --> 00:50:37,053
I'm going that way.

1485
00:50:37,054 --> 00:50:37,887
- Would you really?
- Mm.

1486
00:50:37,888 --> 00:50:39,553
That's awfully good of you, old boy.

1487
00:50:39,554 --> 00:50:40,678
I'll have a bite at the club.

1488
00:50:40,679 --> 00:50:41,679
Fine.

1489
00:50:42,044 --> 00:50:43,303
Goodnight, my love.

1490
00:50:43,304 --> 00:50:44,137
Hope your head's better in the morning.

1491
00:50:44,138 --> 00:50:45,345
Oh, so do I,

1492
00:50:45,346 --> 00:50:47,595
but at the moment, it's
throbbing like a dynamo.

1493
00:50:47,596 --> 00:50:49,303
Lovely performance, darling.

1494
00:50:49,304 --> 00:50:50,304
Thank you.

1495
00:50:54,887 --> 00:50:57,011
Have you got a moment, Simon?

1496
00:50:57,012 --> 00:50:57,846
Ah.

1497
00:50:57,847 --> 00:51:00,607
I always have a moment
for a charming lady.

1498
00:51:01,054 --> 00:51:02,054
What's wrong?

1499
00:51:02,055 --> 00:51:03,178
Oh, there's nothing wrong.

1500
00:51:03,179 --> 00:51:05,636
I really wanted to talk
to you about your part.

1501
00:51:05,637 --> 00:51:06,471
Oh, what about it?

1502
00:51:06,472 --> 00:51:09,720
Well, I seem to have run out of ideas.

1503
00:51:09,721 --> 00:51:12,595
I wondered if you could
give me a new line to go on.

1504
00:51:12,596 --> 00:51:15,428
You know, tell me about yourself.

1505
00:51:15,429 --> 00:51:17,136
The other side of you, so to speak.

1506
00:51:17,137 --> 00:51:17,971
I'd be delighted.

1507
00:51:17,972 --> 00:51:18,804
When?

1508
00:51:18,805 --> 00:51:20,386
Well, I thought as soon as possible.

1509
00:51:20,387 --> 00:51:22,970
You see, I'm stuck already.

1510
00:51:22,971 --> 00:51:24,428
Well, what are you
doing for dinner tonight?

1511
00:51:24,429 --> 00:51:25,346
Well, I did have a date,

1512
00:51:25,347 --> 00:51:27,178
but, if you're free,
I'll break if, of course.

1513
00:51:27,179 --> 00:51:28,012
Oh no, I don't want you to do that.

1514
00:51:28,013 --> 00:51:28,846
Oh, but I must.

1515
00:51:28,847 --> 00:51:29,886
This is important.

1516
00:51:29,887 --> 00:51:33,007
I'll meet you at the main
door in three minutes.

1517
00:51:41,471 --> 00:51:42,803
Now, come on, David.

1518
00:51:42,804 --> 00:51:45,220
What did you want to talk to me about?

1519
00:51:45,221 --> 00:51:46,221
Oh.

1520
00:51:47,096 --> 00:51:48,096
Well, um.

1521
00:51:48,280 --> 00:51:51,220
It's a little difficult
to know how to begin.

1522
00:51:51,221 --> 00:51:54,970
You see, Laura, you're
such a splendid person,

1523
00:51:54,971 --> 00:51:58,720
so very loyal and very kind.

1524
00:51:58,721 --> 00:52:00,470
What I'm about to suggest,

1525
00:52:00,471 --> 00:52:03,178
I'm a little afraid is going
to make you very cross.

1526
00:52:03,179 --> 00:52:05,345
It's something to do
with Simon, isn't it?

1527
00:52:05,346 --> 00:52:06,179
How did you guess?

1528
00:52:06,180 --> 00:52:08,678
I have an intuition about these things.

1529
00:52:08,679 --> 00:52:10,345
What about him?

1530
00:52:10,346 --> 00:52:14,845
Well, dear Laura, what would you say

1531
00:52:14,846 --> 00:52:16,761
if something were to happen to him?

1532
00:52:16,762 --> 00:52:19,261
Well, you know, like having an accident

1533
00:52:19,262 --> 00:52:20,928
or something like that?

1534
00:52:20,929 --> 00:52:24,169
I mean, just suppose that
he wasn't there anymore.

1535
00:52:24,596 --> 00:52:27,428
Well, would you, would you mind awfully?

1536
00:52:27,429 --> 00:52:29,053
Mind?

1537
00:52:29,054 --> 00:52:31,261
Oh, David, of course I'd mind.

1538
00:52:31,262 --> 00:52:33,122
Then I heard the croupier say

1539
00:52:33,123 --> 00:52:34,096
I had to turn away.

1540
00:52:34,097 --> 00:52:35,178
I couldn't watch.

1541
00:52:35,179 --> 00:52:36,762
And suddenly he said...

1542
00:52:37,508 --> 00:52:39,428
And I gathered in my winnings.

1543
00:52:39,429 --> 00:52:40,928
My hands were trembling,

1544
00:52:40,929 --> 00:52:42,053
but I knew what I had to do,

1545
00:52:42,054 --> 00:52:43,220
and I did it.

1546
00:52:43,221 --> 00:52:46,053
I put it all on 17,

1547
00:52:46,054 --> 00:52:49,095
and then I waited, absolutely petrified.

1548
00:52:49,096 --> 00:52:50,179
17 came up.

1549
00:52:51,054 --> 00:52:52,636
Now came the problem.

1550
00:52:52,637 --> 00:52:54,803
According to the system,
I should put it all

1551
00:52:54,804 --> 00:52:56,220
on number seven.

1552
00:52:56,221 --> 00:52:57,636
If I lost, I'd already won enough

1553
00:52:57,637 --> 00:52:59,303
to pay my bill and get back to England.

1554
00:52:59,304 --> 00:53:01,011
But if seven came up,

1555
00:53:01,012 --> 00:53:02,636
I stood to win a fortune.

1556
00:53:02,637 --> 00:53:03,471
So what did you do?

1557
00:53:03,472 --> 00:53:06,179
I put it all on number seven.

1558
00:53:06,867 --> 00:53:07,887
And it came up?

1559
00:53:07,888 --> 00:53:08,720
No.

1560
00:53:08,721 --> 00:53:09,801
I lost the lost.

1561
00:53:10,554 --> 00:53:13,734
Now look, David, I'm very
fond of you, very fond.

1562
00:53:13,735 --> 00:53:16,053
Simon, that's something very different.

1563
00:53:16,054 --> 00:53:17,303
Yes, but, look, isn't
there just a chance

1564
00:53:17,304 --> 00:53:19,886
that if I handled it very delicately...

1565
00:53:19,887 --> 00:53:21,970
I think you'd better take me home.

1566
00:53:21,971 --> 00:53:25,136
But I haven't nearly finished
what I was going to say.

1567
00:53:25,137 --> 00:53:26,096
Oh.

1568
00:53:26,097 --> 00:53:27,720
Oh, I'm terribly.

1569
00:53:27,721 --> 00:53:29,845
Look, Laura, we can't possibly talk here.

1570
00:53:29,846 --> 00:53:31,886
Why not come back to my
flat and have a nightcap.

1571
00:53:31,887 --> 00:53:33,636
It's only in Hellum Street.

1572
00:53:33,637 --> 00:53:36,095
All right, but you've got
to promise you'll be good.

1573
00:53:36,096 --> 00:53:39,261
Well, I'll be as good as I can.

1574
00:53:39,262 --> 00:53:40,970
But how on earth did
you get back to England?

1575
00:53:40,971 --> 00:53:44,220
Well, I was forced to borrow
some money from a friend.

1576
00:53:44,221 --> 00:53:45,053
Oh, I'm sorry.

1577
00:53:45,054 --> 00:53:45,887
That's enough about me.

1578
00:53:45,888 --> 00:53:47,136
If you knew how I hated
talking about myself.

1579
00:53:47,137 --> 00:53:49,386
Oh, but it's been so exciting.

1580
00:53:49,387 --> 00:53:52,553
You've given me, oh, 100 ideas.

1581
00:53:52,554 --> 00:53:54,720
Well, you're a wonderful listener.

1582
00:53:54,721 --> 00:53:57,841
In fact, you're a wonderful
person all together.

1583
00:53:57,961 --> 00:54:01,261
Wouldn't it be marvellous
to be in Monte Carlo now?

1584
00:54:01,262 --> 00:54:02,428
Marvellous.

1585
00:54:02,429 --> 00:54:04,470
Of course, these days,
you can fly there and back

1586
00:54:04,471 --> 00:54:06,178
in no time at all.

1587
00:54:06,179 --> 00:54:09,803
I've got loads of friends who
go over just for the weekend.

1588
00:54:09,804 --> 00:54:11,220
Janet, what a wonderful idea!

1589
00:54:11,221 --> 00:54:13,386
Why don't you and I pop over next weekend.

1590
00:54:13,387 --> 00:54:15,095
Oh, Simon.

1591
00:54:15,096 --> 00:54:15,929
Oh, but Laura.

1592
00:54:15,930 --> 00:54:18,470
Well, she's tied up
with ""In Town Tonight.""

1593
00:54:18,471 --> 00:54:19,886
Wouldn't she mind?

1594
00:54:19,887 --> 00:54:20,887
Need she know?

1595
00:54:22,471 --> 00:54:25,136
Well, I'd have to think about it.

1596
00:54:25,137 --> 00:54:25,971
Say yes.

1597
00:54:25,972 --> 00:54:28,262
Then we can try out my new system.

1598
00:54:35,411 --> 00:54:37,511
Another of the interesting people

1599
00:54:37,512 --> 00:54:41,053
who is in town tonight
is Mr. Peter Harbottle.

1600
00:54:41,054 --> 00:54:42,261
Good evening, Mr. Harbottle.

1601
00:54:42,262 --> 00:54:43,221
Good evening.

1602
00:54:43,222 --> 00:54:45,678
I understand that you
came to be the first man

1603
00:54:45,679 --> 00:54:47,428
to cross the English Channel in a barrel.

1604
00:54:47,429 --> 00:54:48,262
Is that right?

1605
00:54:48,263 --> 00:54:49,428
That is correct.

1606
00:54:49,429 --> 00:54:51,511
Well, it must have been most exciting.

1607
00:54:51,512 --> 00:54:54,053
Oh, no, it was very tedious.

1608
00:54:54,054 --> 00:54:55,428
Really?

1609
00:54:55,429 --> 00:54:56,429
Oh, yes.

1610
00:54:57,137 --> 00:54:58,553
Water.

1611
00:54:58,554 --> 00:54:59,928
Water everywhere.

1612
00:54:59,929 --> 00:55:02,428
Oh, but surely it was pretty dangerous.

1613
00:55:02,429 --> 00:55:03,749
Oh, yes, definitely.

1614
00:55:03,995 --> 00:55:06,095
When did you first get this idea?

1615
00:55:06,096 --> 00:55:08,470
Well, it wasn't my idea.

1616
00:55:08,471 --> 00:55:09,886
It was the wife's idea.

1617
00:55:09,887 --> 00:55:11,136
Oh, well, that explains every.

1618
00:55:11,137 --> 00:55:12,761
Thank you very much,
indeed, Mr. Harbottle.

1619
00:55:12,762 --> 00:55:14,178
- Thank you very much.
- Thank you.

1620
00:55:14,179 --> 00:55:15,199
Oh, I'm sorry.

1621
00:55:15,200 --> 00:55:16,929
We're very glad to welcome

1622
00:55:16,930 --> 00:55:18,386
our final guest tonight,

1623
00:55:18,387 --> 00:55:19,720
who is none other than the famous

1624
00:55:19,721 --> 00:55:22,928
stage, screen and television
star, Laura Foster.

1625
00:55:22,929 --> 00:55:24,595
Hello, Laura, nice to see you.

1626
00:55:24,596 --> 00:55:25,803
Hello, John.

1627
00:55:25,804 --> 00:55:27,095
And we'd also like to welcome

1628
00:55:27,096 --> 00:55:28,636
the other Miss Laura Foster,

1629
00:55:28,637 --> 00:55:31,178
who's come all the way
from Newcastle-under-Lyme

1630
00:55:31,179 --> 00:55:33,553
to shake her famous namesake by the hand.

1631
00:55:33,554 --> 00:55:35,261
Hello, and how do you do.

1632
00:55:35,262 --> 00:55:37,242
Pleased to meet you, I'm sure.

1633
00:55:37,570 --> 00:55:39,970
Laura, doesn't it feel rather strange

1634
00:55:39,971 --> 00:55:41,886
to be working without your famous husband?

1635
00:55:41,887 --> 00:55:43,970
Well, yes, it does, John, really.

1636
00:55:43,971 --> 00:55:46,428
But you see, Simon's away
having a change of air.

1637
00:55:46,429 --> 00:55:48,303
May I ask where he's gone?

1638
00:55:48,304 --> 00:55:50,595
Between ourselves, to
his mother's in Leicester.

1639
00:55:50,596 --> 00:55:51,720
Oh.

1640
00:55:51,721 --> 00:55:52,803
Haven't you something rather interesting

1641
00:55:52,804 --> 00:55:54,136
to tell us about the Christmas edition

1642
00:55:54,137 --> 00:55:55,220
of ""Simon and Laura?""

1643
00:55:55,221 --> 00:55:57,720
Yes, you see, they've
decided to televise

1644
00:55:57,721 --> 00:56:00,220
it from our own home
instead of the studio.

1645
00:56:00,221 --> 00:56:01,970
There's going to be a party afterwards.

1646
00:56:01,971 --> 00:56:03,386
Oh, so the viewers
will have an opportunity

1647
00:56:03,387 --> 00:56:05,386
of meeting a lot of other famous stars.

1648
00:56:05,387 --> 00:56:06,220
That's right.

1649
00:56:06,221 --> 00:56:07,221
Laura, how do you feel about having

1650
00:56:07,222 --> 00:56:10,761
your house invaded by a
lot of TV technicians?

1651
00:56:10,762 --> 00:56:12,622
I think it'll be rather fun.

1652
00:56:14,973 --> 00:56:17,553
George, come
back as soon as you've got

1653
00:56:17,554 --> 00:56:18,387
the cable hooked up!

1654
00:56:18,388 --> 00:56:20,308
Then we'll check the link up.

1655
00:56:21,637 --> 00:56:22,761
Timothy!

1656
00:56:22,762 --> 00:56:24,261
Leave that alone!

1657
00:56:24,262 --> 00:56:25,095
Why?

1658
00:56:25,096 --> 00:56:25,929
It's jolly interesting.

1659
00:56:25,930 --> 00:56:28,220
You'd be better occupied
learning your script.

1660
00:56:28,221 --> 00:56:30,178
Yesterday, you fluffed twice.

1661
00:56:30,179 --> 00:56:32,595
Only because Daddy
gave me the wrong cues.

1662
00:56:32,596 --> 00:56:33,429
Oh, that remind me.

1663
00:56:33,430 --> 00:56:35,553
There's a change for
tonight that affects you.

1664
00:56:35,554 --> 00:56:37,011
Laura isn't allowed to say you're having

1665
00:56:37,012 --> 00:56:38,595
a lovely romp with Angela.

1666
00:56:38,596 --> 00:56:39,596
Why not?

1667
00:56:39,597 --> 00:56:41,577
Well, you see, romp can mean...

1668
00:56:41,578 --> 00:56:43,636
Oh, I'll explain when you're a bit older.

1669
00:56:43,637 --> 00:56:44,637
Come on.

1670
00:56:48,409 --> 00:56:49,429
Hello, darling.

1671
00:56:49,430 --> 00:56:50,678
I'm having such a time.

1672
00:56:50,679 --> 00:56:51,637
Jolly good.

1673
00:56:51,638 --> 00:56:52,928
Oh, Jessie, would you ask Mrs. Foster

1674
00:56:52,929 --> 00:56:54,095
if I can come up for a moment?

1675
00:56:54,096 --> 00:56:55,136
I want to go over some cuts with her.

1676
00:56:55,137 --> 00:56:56,886
And oughtn't you to be getting ready?

1677
00:56:56,887 --> 00:56:58,303
I'm not in tonight's instalment.

1678
00:56:58,304 --> 00:56:59,720
Oh no, of course not.

1679
00:56:59,721 --> 00:57:03,201
I suppose I'm too useful
makin' tea for the engineers.

1680
00:57:05,498 --> 00:57:07,178
Laura isn't here, is she?

1681
00:57:07,179 --> 00:57:08,137
No.

1682
00:57:08,138 --> 00:57:09,220
Good.

1683
00:57:09,221 --> 00:57:10,636
Why good?

1684
00:57:10,637 --> 00:57:11,803
She doesn't like me.

1685
00:57:11,804 --> 00:57:14,303
Nonsense, we're both devoted to you.

1686
00:57:14,304 --> 00:57:15,304
Well, I heard her say I was

1687
00:57:15,305 --> 00:57:18,261
the last straw that
broke the camel's back.

1688
00:57:18,262 --> 00:57:20,182
Funny how they can't take it.

1689
00:57:20,887 --> 00:57:22,220
Who, camels?

1690
00:57:22,221 --> 00:57:23,261
No, women.

1691
00:57:23,262 --> 00:57:24,470
Take what?

1692
00:57:24,471 --> 00:57:26,553
Us, child actors.

1693
00:57:26,554 --> 00:57:27,636
Men are different.

1694
00:57:27,637 --> 00:57:29,677
Men don't seem to mind so much.

1695
00:57:29,678 --> 00:57:32,303
I suppose it's 'cause they don't realise

1696
00:57:32,304 --> 00:57:34,803
we're pinching all their scenes from them.

1697
00:57:34,804 --> 00:57:36,845
They're not a bit intuitive.

1698
00:57:36,846 --> 00:57:38,053
What do you mean?

1699
00:57:38,054 --> 00:57:40,345
Well, take you.

1700
00:57:40,346 --> 00:57:41,678
You haven't noticed that the camera's

1701
00:57:41,679 --> 00:57:44,511
on Laura the whole time now.

1702
00:57:44,512 --> 00:57:46,303
Last night, you only got one close up

1703
00:57:46,304 --> 00:57:47,595
in the whole of the show.

1704
00:57:47,596 --> 00:57:48,678
Really?

1705
00:57:48,679 --> 00:57:50,386
And that was the back of your head.

1706
00:57:50,387 --> 00:57:52,803
My mother said she
could see your bald spot

1707
00:57:52,804 --> 00:57:53,970
as plain as anything.

1708
00:57:53,971 --> 00:57:56,595
I can't wait to meet your mother.

1709
00:57:56,596 --> 00:57:59,136
She's coming to the party
tonight after the show.

1710
00:57:59,137 --> 00:58:00,303
Good.

1711
00:58:00,304 --> 00:58:03,011
And another thing, why do you think

1712
00:58:03,012 --> 00:58:05,470
they've changed that opening shot?

1713
00:58:05,471 --> 00:58:07,261
In the embrace, it always used to be you

1714
00:58:07,262 --> 00:58:09,136
who were facing the camera.

1715
00:58:09,137 --> 00:58:10,262
Now it's Laura.

1716
00:58:11,304 --> 00:58:14,844
I can only assume it's
because she hasn't a bald spot.

1717
00:58:17,971 --> 00:58:20,345
Oh, Laura, it's beautiful.

1718
00:58:20,346 --> 00:58:21,803
It is nice, isn't it?

1719
00:58:21,804 --> 00:58:23,511
Tomorrow morning, alas, it goes back

1720
00:58:23,512 --> 00:58:24,346
from whence it came.

1721
00:58:24,347 --> 00:58:25,346
Oh.

1722
00:58:25,347 --> 00:58:27,386
I've come to tell you
the censors made a cut.

1723
00:58:27,387 --> 00:58:28,886
You can't use the word romp.

1724
00:58:28,887 --> 00:58:29,887
Really?

1725
00:58:30,929 --> 00:58:33,053
Ooh, that's a filthy lie.

1726
00:58:33,054 --> 00:58:34,012
What is?

1727
00:58:34,013 --> 00:58:37,804
Simon Foster gave Laura a
Parker '51 for her birthday.

1728
00:58:39,429 --> 00:58:41,553
How's then, how's Monte?

1729
00:58:41,554 --> 00:58:42,678
Monte who?

1730
00:58:42,679 --> 00:58:44,511
Monte Carlo?

1731
00:58:44,512 --> 00:58:45,595
I beg your pardon?

1732
00:58:45,596 --> 00:58:48,928
Monte Carlo, it's a seaside
resort in Southern France.

1733
00:58:48,929 --> 00:58:51,261
It has the casinos and
very accommodating hotels.

1734
00:58:51,262 --> 00:58:53,470
You flew there on Friday
after the show with Simon.

1735
00:58:53,471 --> 00:58:54,471
How was it?

1736
00:58:55,429 --> 00:58:56,429
It rained.

1737
00:58:56,430 --> 00:58:58,636
Oh, I'm so sorry.

1738
00:58:58,637 --> 00:59:01,678
And how did you find
that out, Scotland Yard?

1739
00:59:01,679 --> 00:59:02,761
The French Surety?

1740
00:59:02,762 --> 00:59:04,761
Or your own private sense of smell?

1741
00:59:04,762 --> 00:59:06,928
No, a friend of Sybil Hunter's saw you.

1742
00:59:06,929 --> 00:59:09,178
And with the loyalty
peculiar to cast offs,

1743
00:59:09,179 --> 00:59:11,339
she was on the blower like a shot.

1744
00:59:11,340 --> 00:59:13,428
Then there's no point in denying it.

1745
00:59:13,429 --> 00:59:15,011
None at all.

1746
00:59:15,012 --> 00:59:16,803
Did you know that before this programme

1747
00:59:16,804 --> 00:59:19,744
of ours started, Simon
and I were breaking up?

1748
00:59:20,262 --> 00:59:21,886
Vaguely.

1749
00:59:21,887 --> 00:59:23,553
Well, we were.

1750
00:59:23,554 --> 00:59:24,636
And because we needed the money,

1751
00:59:24,637 --> 00:59:28,345
we decided to stay put,
purely for business reasons.

1752
00:59:28,346 --> 00:59:29,179
But it worked.

1753
00:59:29,180 --> 00:59:31,303
It worked surprisingly well.

1754
00:59:31,304 --> 00:59:33,178
You don't think the scripts

1755
00:59:33,179 --> 00:59:34,116
might have had something to do with it?

1756
00:59:34,117 --> 00:59:35,054
I don't mean the damn scripts, silly,

1757
00:59:35,055 --> 00:59:37,303
I meant us, Simon and me.

1758
00:59:37,304 --> 00:59:38,137
Oh.

1759
00:59:38,138 --> 00:59:39,345
So you can imagine
that when those bright,

1760
00:59:39,346 --> 00:59:41,136
beady little eyes of yours focused

1761
00:59:41,137 --> 00:59:42,761
not on Simon but on David,

1762
00:59:42,762 --> 00:59:45,803
oh, I was very, very relieved.

1763
00:59:45,804 --> 00:59:48,720
Bright blue beady little
eyes, if you don't mind.

1764
00:59:48,721 --> 00:59:53,345
Then round about instalment
170 something happened.

1765
00:59:53,346 --> 00:59:54,886
I don't know whether you found David

1766
00:59:54,887 --> 00:59:56,678
a little dull, or you realised he was

1767
00:59:56,679 --> 00:59:58,678
really married to the BBC,

1768
00:59:58,679 --> 01:00:01,636
but those bright blue
beady little eyes of yours

1769
01:00:01,637 --> 01:00:03,428
wandered off him and onto Simon.

1770
01:00:03,429 --> 01:00:05,136
Because they realised
that David was madly

1771
01:00:05,137 --> 01:00:07,053
interested in you, and you were using

1772
01:00:07,054 --> 01:00:08,595
every trick of the trade to get him.

1773
01:00:08,596 --> 01:00:10,011
How dare you!

1774
01:00:10,012 --> 01:00:11,886
You are paid to start acting at 8:15

1775
01:00:11,887 --> 01:00:13,720
when the programme goes on the air.

1776
01:00:13,721 --> 01:00:15,428
There's no need to begin at 7:45,

1777
01:00:15,429 --> 01:00:16,689
especially with me.

1778
01:00:17,304 --> 01:00:18,720
Have another drink?

1779
01:00:18,721 --> 01:00:19,928
No, thank you.

1780
01:00:19,929 --> 01:00:20,846
Very wise.

1781
01:00:20,847 --> 01:00:22,971
One's enough before the show.

1782
01:00:24,637 --> 01:00:25,637
May I come in?

1783
01:00:25,638 --> 01:00:26,636
Yes.

1784
01:00:26,637 --> 01:00:27,637
- Hello, Janet.
- Hello.

1785
01:00:27,638 --> 01:00:29,386
Oh, darling, I forgot to ask you,

1786
01:00:29,387 --> 01:00:32,220
how was your mother's
arthritis last weekend?

1787
01:00:32,221 --> 01:00:33,054
All right, thank you.

1788
01:00:33,055 --> 01:00:35,345
Was she able to get up
from the tables all right?

1789
01:00:35,346 --> 01:00:36,179
Tables?

1790
01:00:36,180 --> 01:00:39,180
Mm hmm, the gambling
tables, dear, Monte Carlo.

1791
01:00:39,583 --> 01:00:41,803
You've had your little say, Laura.

1792
01:00:41,804 --> 01:00:43,511
Now I'll have mine.

1793
01:00:43,512 --> 01:00:45,636
In fact, I'll trade you Monte Carlo

1794
01:00:45,637 --> 01:00:47,511
- for 43A Hellum Street.
- For what?

1795
01:00:47,512 --> 01:00:51,428
43A Hellum Street,
David's flat, last Thursday,

1796
01:00:51,429 --> 01:00:52,636
headache night.

1797
01:00:52,637 --> 01:00:54,136
Remember?

1798
01:00:54,137 --> 01:00:55,012
David's flat?

1799
01:00:55,013 --> 01:00:57,845
Mm, round about the
witching hour of midnight.

1800
01:00:57,846 --> 01:00:59,220
And witching or no witching,

1801
01:00:59,221 --> 01:01:00,595
it didn't need Sybil Hunter's broomstick

1802
01:01:00,596 --> 01:01:01,554
to find that out.

1803
01:01:01,555 --> 01:01:03,179
I live at 43B.

1804
01:01:04,054 --> 01:01:05,374
Is this true, Laura?

1805
01:01:05,883 --> 01:01:07,803
We were discussing the script.

1806
01:01:07,804 --> 01:01:08,804
Huh.

1807
01:01:09,766 --> 01:01:10,846
Could I come in?

1808
01:01:10,847 --> 01:01:12,845
Why not, let 'em all come.

1809
01:01:12,846 --> 01:01:14,011
Hello, Simon.

1810
01:01:14,012 --> 01:01:14,887
Hello, Janet.

1811
01:01:14,888 --> 01:01:16,470
Hello.

1812
01:01:16,471 --> 01:01:17,553
Laura.

1813
01:01:17,554 --> 01:01:19,762
Darling, you look wonderful.

1814
01:01:23,346 --> 01:01:24,426
Happy Christmas.

1815
01:01:26,637 --> 01:01:28,095
Ah.

1816
01:01:28,096 --> 01:01:31,095
Well, it's quite an occasion, isn't it?

1817
01:01:31,096 --> 01:01:33,386
Do, um, you know who's coming out

1818
01:01:33,387 --> 01:01:34,387
to have a drink with us after the show

1819
01:01:34,388 --> 01:01:35,886
if he can get away?

1820
01:01:35,887 --> 01:01:39,678
CT.

1821
01:01:39,679 --> 01:01:41,428
Well, what's the matter?

1822
01:01:41,429 --> 01:01:42,970
Has one of the camera's gone again?

1823
01:01:42,971 --> 01:01:45,803
Prentice, did my wife
spend Thursday night

1824
01:01:45,804 --> 01:01:46,804
in your flat?

1825
01:01:48,429 --> 01:01:49,970
Part of it, yes.

1826
01:01:49,971 --> 01:01:50,971
Thank you.

1827
01:01:51,721 --> 01:01:53,304
I just wanted to know.

1828
01:01:55,596 --> 01:01:57,720
Oh, well really, Simon.

1829
01:01:57,721 --> 01:01:59,136
Well, you don't think.

1830
01:01:59,137 --> 01:02:01,386
Well, I admire you two more than any

1831
01:02:01,387 --> 01:02:02,262
other couple I know.

1832
01:02:02,263 --> 01:02:03,095
Couple?

1833
01:02:03,096 --> 01:02:03,929
I don't remember being included

1834
01:02:03,930 --> 01:02:05,095
in the invitation to Hellum Street!

1835
01:02:05,096 --> 01:02:05,929
But it's because you're so sincere

1836
01:02:05,930 --> 01:02:07,303
with each other and happy that...

1837
01:02:07,304 --> 01:02:09,011
Oh, David, for heaven's sake,

1838
01:02:09,012 --> 01:02:10,095
don't start that!

1839
01:02:10,096 --> 01:02:10,929
Hear, hear.

1840
01:02:10,930 --> 01:02:12,261
Don't start what?

1841
01:02:12,262 --> 01:02:13,470
Pretending that Simon and I are happy.

1842
01:02:13,471 --> 01:02:14,553
We're not happy!

1843
01:02:14,554 --> 01:02:15,387
We never have been happy!

1844
01:02:15,388 --> 01:02:16,428
We get on each other's nerves.

1845
01:02:16,429 --> 01:02:18,178
We scream at each other like fish wives.

1846
01:02:18,179 --> 01:02:20,136
We're a couple of actors who took on a job

1847
01:02:20,137 --> 01:02:21,595
because we needed the money!

1848
01:02:21,596 --> 01:02:23,470
And we are apparently good
enough to fool the public,

1849
01:02:23,471 --> 01:02:24,304
but please don't confuse us

1850
01:02:24,305 --> 01:02:26,345
with the Simon and Laura in the programme.

1851
01:02:26,346 --> 01:02:27,470
Unless of course you're thinking

1852
01:02:27,471 --> 01:02:29,261
of an instalment where my husband

1853
01:02:29,262 --> 01:02:32,442
goes off for a gay weekend
with your scriptwriter.

1854
01:02:32,846 --> 01:02:33,846
With Janet?

1855
01:02:35,040 --> 01:02:38,220
They're waiting for you
downstairs, Mr. Prentice.

1856
01:02:38,221 --> 01:02:39,511
And you, sir and madam.

1857
01:02:39,512 --> 01:02:41,252
You're on in five minutes.

1858
01:02:44,304 --> 01:02:46,678
Testing, 1, 2, 3, 4,

1859
01:02:46,679 --> 01:02:49,636
5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10.

1860
01:02:49,637 --> 01:02:50,886
Okay for sound.

1861
01:02:50,887 --> 01:02:52,886
- All right, tip that 39 up.
- Testing again.

1862
01:02:52,887 --> 01:02:54,053
Eeny meeny miny moe

1863
01:02:54,054 --> 01:02:55,803
catch a monkey by his toe.

1864
01:02:55,804 --> 01:02:57,971
Okay.

1865
01:03:02,182 --> 01:03:03,262
Happy Christmas.

1866
01:03:03,263 --> 01:03:05,886
- Merry Christmas, Laura.
- Jolly good luck.

1867
01:03:05,887 --> 01:03:09,067
With the compliments of
the backroom boys, Mrs. F.

1868
01:03:12,096 --> 01:03:13,762
Barney, how sweet of you.

1869
01:03:15,721 --> 01:03:19,637
Simon and Laura, peace
and goodwill, and, and...

1870
01:03:22,429 --> 01:03:24,678
Oh, blast, my makeup.

1871
01:03:24,679 --> 01:03:26,679
Here, you take, take it.

1872
01:03:29,262 --> 01:03:30,720
Anything the matter?

1873
01:03:30,721 --> 01:03:34,081
No, no, she's just touched
by this gesture of yours.

1874
01:03:34,554 --> 01:03:35,754
Thank you, Barney.

1875
01:03:36,471 --> 01:03:37,471
Thanks.

1876
01:03:40,929 --> 01:03:42,928
Give us your cue line, Harry.

1877
01:03:42,929 --> 01:03:44,886
Okay, now the other one.

1878
01:03:44,887 --> 01:03:46,761
- Fine, thanks.
- Put 79 on again, lads.

1879
01:03:46,762 --> 01:03:48,886
Any changes in the
script, Miss Honeyman?

1880
01:03:48,887 --> 01:03:50,886
Dozens, I'll give them to you.

1881
01:03:50,887 --> 01:03:52,220
If you're thinking of making any changes

1882
01:03:52,221 --> 01:03:55,041
in the scriptwriter,
I'll quite understand.

1883
01:03:56,679 --> 01:03:58,886
Give us your lights please, Harry.

1884
01:03:58,887 --> 01:04:00,053
Hold that position there, David.

1885
01:04:00,054 --> 01:04:01,678
I just want to check.

1886
01:04:01,679 --> 01:04:02,511
Okay.

1887
01:04:02,512 --> 01:04:03,346
Why didn't you tell us when we offered

1888
01:04:03,347 --> 01:04:06,845
you the job that you
weren't happily married?

1889
01:04:06,846 --> 01:04:08,095
Oh, hell.

1890
01:04:08,096 --> 01:04:09,553
Okay, Harry, save 'em.

1891
01:04:09,554 --> 01:04:10,803
Give us all your number twos.

1892
01:04:10,804 --> 01:04:12,220
I'm not at all sure that the corporation

1893
01:04:12,221 --> 01:04:13,511
hasn't got a case against you two.

1894
01:04:13,512 --> 01:04:15,053
Would you mind turning
around and smiling

1895
01:04:15,054 --> 01:04:16,674
for a second, Mr. Foster?

1896
01:04:17,804 --> 01:04:18,928
Okay, swell.

1897
01:04:18,929 --> 01:04:20,678
I don't know what to do now.

1898
01:04:20,679 --> 01:04:22,428
We can't go on in this situation.

1899
01:04:22,429 --> 01:04:23,886
Insincerity's the one thing you can't

1900
01:04:23,887 --> 01:04:25,178
get away with on TV.

1901
01:04:25,179 --> 01:04:27,761
We seemed to have managed
pretty well up till now.

1902
01:04:27,762 --> 01:04:28,721
Mr. Prentice?

1903
01:04:28,722 --> 01:04:29,554
Yes?

1904
01:04:29,555 --> 01:04:30,761
Would you mind standing
in for Mrs. Foster,

1905
01:04:30,762 --> 01:04:33,882
just for the opening shot,
you know, the embrace?

1906
01:04:34,846 --> 01:04:35,970
Oh, all right.

1907
01:04:35,971 --> 01:04:37,678
Would you mind, Mr. Foster?

1908
01:04:37,679 --> 01:04:38,721
Not at all.

1909
01:04:40,804 --> 01:04:41,762
Hello, Simon.

1910
01:04:41,763 --> 01:04:42,721
Hello, Laura.

1911
01:04:42,722 --> 01:04:44,678
You know, darling, you look
very attractive in tails.

1912
01:04:44,679 --> 01:04:47,095
You know, darling, you look
very attractive in anything.

1913
01:04:47,096 --> 01:04:47,929
Okay, that's fine.

1914
01:04:47,930 --> 01:04:48,762
Thanks a lot.

1915
01:04:48,763 --> 01:04:50,136
I need a drink.

1916
01:04:50,137 --> 01:04:51,470
Simon.

1917
01:04:51,471 --> 01:04:52,429
Save your lights, Harry.

1918
01:04:52,430 --> 01:04:53,929
On the diving board.

1919
01:04:56,151 --> 01:04:58,011
Ought you to before the show?

1920
01:04:58,012 --> 01:04:59,012
Yes.

1921
01:04:59,236 --> 01:05:01,636
Little ironical that tonight's script

1922
01:05:01,637 --> 01:05:02,970
is the first one in which you and Laura

1923
01:05:02,971 --> 01:05:05,095
are supposed to have a quarrel.

1924
01:05:05,096 --> 01:05:06,220
You won't let anything that's happened

1925
01:05:06,221 --> 01:05:07,054
affect things, will you?

1926
01:05:07,055 --> 01:05:08,553
Don't worry, we won't throw crockery

1927
01:05:08,554 --> 01:05:10,011
and four-letter words at each other

1928
01:05:10,012 --> 01:05:10,846
in front of the camera.

1929
01:05:10,847 --> 01:05:11,762
Oh.

1930
01:05:11,763 --> 01:05:14,512
I don't know whether to tell DTD or not.

1931
01:05:15,078 --> 01:05:18,678
You know what the corporation
is over anything like this.

1932
01:05:18,679 --> 01:05:20,136
He's a JP too.

1933
01:05:20,137 --> 01:05:21,303
Who is?

1934
01:05:21,304 --> 01:05:22,761
DTD.

1935
01:05:22,762 --> 01:05:24,136
Oh, is he?

1936
01:05:24,137 --> 01:05:26,636
Laura will be all right
for the show, won't she?

1937
01:05:26,637 --> 01:05:27,471
Don't worry.

1938
01:05:27,472 --> 01:05:29,136
She once played Cleopatra
with a broken ankle,

1939
01:05:29,137 --> 01:05:30,636
laryngitis, and the hiccups.

1940
01:05:30,637 --> 01:05:31,470
She'll be all right.

1941
01:05:31,471 --> 01:05:32,304
She's a very old trooper.

1942
01:05:32,305 --> 01:05:33,304
Oh, good.

1943
01:05:38,392 --> 01:05:40,012
Four minutes to go, boss.

1944
01:05:40,013 --> 01:05:41,178
Everything's
okay, Mr. Prentice.

1945
01:05:41,179 --> 01:05:42,012
There won't be any trouble tonight.

1946
01:05:42,013 --> 01:05:43,393
I hope you're right.

1947
01:05:49,137 --> 01:05:50,553
Timothy!

1948
01:05:50,554 --> 01:05:53,595
I told you before to leave that alone.

1949
01:05:53,596 --> 01:05:54,803
Now, go and see to your makeup.

1950
01:05:54,804 --> 01:05:56,178
It's terrible.

1951
01:05:56,179 --> 01:05:57,179
Go on, hop it.

1952
01:06:00,713 --> 01:06:03,053
I say, aren't you gonna get made up?

1953
01:06:03,054 --> 01:06:04,470
I am made up.

1954
01:06:04,471 --> 01:06:07,095
What are you and Laura
going to say instead of romp?

1955
01:06:07,096 --> 01:06:07,929
I don't know.

1956
01:06:07,930 --> 01:06:09,345
I expect something will occur to us.

1957
01:06:09,346 --> 01:06:12,886
Laura was at the Cafe de
Paris we him on Saturday night.

1958
01:06:13,637 --> 01:06:14,928
Him?

1959
01:06:14,929 --> 01:06:15,929
David!

1960
01:06:16,840 --> 01:06:18,220
How do you know that?

1961
01:06:18,221 --> 01:06:20,886
My mother took me to meet
an American film director.

1962
01:06:20,887 --> 01:06:22,507
They were in the balcony.

1963
01:06:23,304 --> 01:06:24,304
Is that so?

1964
01:06:24,305 --> 01:06:27,845
When the cabaret's on,
it's darker in the balcony.

1965
01:06:27,846 --> 01:06:28,721
I am perfectly well aware

1966
01:06:28,722 --> 01:06:30,636
of the lighting arrangements
at the Cafe de Paris.

1967
01:06:30,637 --> 01:06:32,011
Thank you.

1968
01:06:32,012 --> 01:06:34,511
Well, I think you should
do something about it.

1969
01:06:34,512 --> 01:06:36,192
Kick up a stink, you know.

1970
01:06:37,250 --> 01:06:39,470
Thank you, Timothy, for the benefit

1971
01:06:39,471 --> 01:06:41,970
of your experience in these matters.

1972
01:06:41,971 --> 01:06:42,803
Mr. Foster, please.

1973
01:06:42,804 --> 01:06:43,804
You're on in one minute.

1974
01:06:43,805 --> 01:06:44,804
Right.

1975
01:06:46,081 --> 01:06:47,129
Well, well, well.

1976
01:06:47,130 --> 01:06:48,179
Hello, David.

1977
01:06:48,180 --> 01:06:49,261
Many congratulations.

1978
01:06:49,262 --> 01:06:50,428
Oh, thank you, Bertie.

1979
01:06:50,429 --> 01:06:51,553
Mind if we stick around
and watch the show?

1980
01:06:51,554 --> 01:06:52,429
No, of course not,
as long as you keep out

1981
01:06:52,430 --> 01:06:54,095
of the way and stay quiet.

1982
01:06:54,096 --> 01:06:55,096
Oh, we'll be quiet as mice.

1983
01:06:55,097 --> 01:06:56,296
Won't we darling?

1984
01:07:00,156 --> 01:07:01,596
You all right, Wilson?

1985
01:07:01,597 --> 01:07:02,761
Yeah.

1986
01:07:02,762 --> 01:07:04,886
Simon, my dear fellow,
all the very best.

1987
01:07:04,887 --> 01:07:06,178
You know Miss Dowrimple?

1988
01:07:06,179 --> 01:07:07,179
Madam.

1989
01:07:08,221 --> 01:07:09,720
How many have you had?

1990
01:07:09,721 --> 01:07:10,761
48 doubles.

1991
01:07:10,762 --> 01:07:11,762
Do you mind?

1992
01:07:14,804 --> 01:07:16,428
Laura, what a vision.

1993
01:07:16,429 --> 01:07:18,178
Now, what's that you're drinking?

1994
01:07:18,179 --> 01:07:19,428
Gargle.

1995
01:07:19,429 --> 01:07:20,845
Oh, Mabel.

1996
01:07:20,846 --> 01:07:22,970
Here, take these away for heaven's sake.

1997
01:07:22,971 --> 01:07:24,470
All right, quiet everyone.

1998
01:07:24,471 --> 01:07:26,261
- Okay.
- Right, thank you, Barney.

1999
01:07:26,262 --> 01:07:29,095
Now, don't overdo the quarrel scene.

2000
01:07:29,096 --> 01:07:30,970
Just play it naturally.

2001
01:07:30,971 --> 01:07:32,886
All right, places, please,
for the opening shot.

2002
01:07:32,887 --> 01:07:33,928
Now, go and sit down.

2003
01:07:33,929 --> 01:07:35,489
Please sit down, Bertie.

2004
01:07:36,099 --> 01:07:37,179
Other way round.

2005
01:07:37,180 --> 01:07:38,220
- Why?
- Well, because David

2006
01:07:38,221 --> 01:07:39,054
wants it that way.

2007
01:07:39,055 --> 01:07:42,304
For 194 performances,
it's been this way around.

2008
01:07:43,170 --> 01:07:46,470
Why did he suddenly change
it one day last week, eh?

2009
01:07:46,471 --> 01:07:47,304
Friday, it was.

2010
01:07:47,305 --> 01:07:48,595
Friday morning rehearsal.

2011
01:07:48,596 --> 01:07:49,429
Sit down and don't butt in.

2012
01:07:49,430 --> 01:07:51,386
I think it more effective with Laura

2013
01:07:51,387 --> 01:07:52,636
facing the camera, Simon.

2014
01:07:52,637 --> 01:07:54,595
- Oh, you do, do you?
- Yes.

2015
01:07:54,596 --> 01:07:56,053
There's nothing personal about it.

2016
01:07:56,054 --> 01:07:58,928
It just, well, it makes a
better picture, that's all.

2017
01:07:58,929 --> 01:08:00,136
I see.

2018
01:08:00,137 --> 01:08:01,845
Announcement and
opening music coming up.

2019
01:08:01,846 --> 01:08:03,136
All right, quiet everyone.

2020
01:08:03,137 --> 01:08:05,597
Now, take a cue from me, Laura darling.

2021
01:08:06,804 --> 01:08:07,804
Good luck.

2022
01:08:13,461 --> 01:08:16,761
Tonight, we present the
special Christmas instalment

2023
01:08:16,762 --> 01:08:19,929
of our nightly serial, ""Simon and Laura.""

2024
01:08:22,221 --> 01:08:24,553
Hello, Simon.

2025
01:08:24,554 --> 01:08:25,721
Hello, Laura.

2026
01:08:26,812 --> 01:08:28,012
You know, darling,

2027
01:08:28,013 --> 01:08:30,053
you look very attractive in tails.

2028
01:08:30,054 --> 01:08:30,887
You know, darling,

2029
01:08:30,888 --> 01:08:32,678
you look very attractive in anything.

2030
01:08:32,679 --> 01:08:33,679
Flatterer.

2031
01:08:34,554 --> 01:08:38,636
Oh, I do hope Timothy's going
to like his Christmas tree.

2032
01:08:38,637 --> 01:08:40,720
How well I remember the first one I had

2033
01:08:40,721 --> 01:08:42,928
when I was a little girl.

2034
01:08:42,929 --> 01:08:45,511
I thought it was a magic tree.

2035
01:08:45,512 --> 01:08:49,970
How glorious is the innocent
imagination of childhood?

2036
01:08:49,971 --> 01:08:52,303
Every star seemed real,

2037
01:08:52,304 --> 01:08:54,178
the tinsel was snow,

2038
01:08:54,179 --> 01:08:57,970
the jewels were baubles
from Aladdin's cave.

2039
01:08:57,971 --> 01:08:59,345
You know, Laura
darling, sometimes I think

2040
01:08:59,346 --> 01:09:00,726
you remained a child.

2041
01:09:03,560 --> 01:09:05,720
That was a damn silly thing to do.

2042
01:09:05,721 --> 01:09:06,721
Shut up.

2043
01:09:07,554 --> 01:09:10,220
# Good King Wenceslas looked out #

2044
01:09:10,221 --> 01:09:13,553
# On the feast of Stephen #

2045
01:09:13,554 --> 01:09:14,387
Listen.

2046
01:09:14,388 --> 01:09:15,761
# When the snow lay round about #

2047
01:09:15,762 --> 01:09:17,303
How charming it is.

2048
01:09:17,304 --> 01:09:20,053
# Deep and crisp and even #

2049
01:09:20,054 --> 01:09:25,511
# And even #

2050
01:09:25,512 --> 01:09:26,346
I love the way they keep repeating

2051
01:09:26,347 --> 01:09:28,470
that little twiddly bit.

2052
01:09:28,471 --> 01:09:30,386
Darling, we must give them something.

2053
01:09:30,387 --> 01:09:33,261
# Brightly shown the moon that night #

2054
01:09:33,262 --> 01:09:36,511
# Though the frost was cruel #

2055
01:09:36,512 --> 01:09:39,970
# When the poor man came in sight #

2056
01:09:39,971 --> 01:09:42,221
# Gathering winter fuel #

2057
01:09:44,804 --> 01:09:47,928
# Hither, page, and stand by me #

2058
01:09:47,929 --> 01:09:48,762
# If thou know it telling #

2059
01:09:48,763 --> 01:09:49,596
Wilson?

2060
01:09:49,597 --> 01:09:50,845
Yes, Master Tim?

2061
01:09:50,846 --> 01:09:54,678
Are all married people as
happy as Mummy and Daddy?

2062
01:09:54,679 --> 01:09:56,303
I doubt it, Master Tim.

2063
01:09:56,304 --> 01:09:58,053
I very much doubt it.

2064
01:09:58,054 --> 01:10:01,470
I've never heard a
harsh word between them.

2065
01:10:01,471 --> 01:10:02,471
I beg pardon, madam.

2066
01:10:02,472 --> 01:10:04,212
I didn't hear you come in.

2067
01:10:04,304 --> 01:10:05,804
What have you and Daddy

2068
01:10:05,805 --> 01:10:07,303
been doing in the lounge, Mummy?

2069
01:10:07,304 --> 01:10:09,387
Ah, that would be telling.

2070
01:10:10,554 --> 01:10:12,220
Why can't I go in there?

2071
01:10:12,221 --> 01:10:14,387
A surprise, darling.

2072
01:10:14,751 --> 01:10:17,511
I wish it wasn't only
going to be grownups

2073
01:10:17,512 --> 01:10:18,553
at the party tonight.

2074
01:10:18,554 --> 01:10:19,636
Never mind.

2075
01:10:19,637 --> 01:10:21,720
Tomorrow, little Angela's coming for tea,

2076
01:10:21,721 --> 01:10:23,553
and you'll be able to
have a lovely r-romp...

2077
01:10:23,554 --> 01:10:25,470
- Game.
- Party.

2078
01:10:25,471 --> 01:10:27,387
Frolic with her.

2079
01:10:34,221 --> 01:10:35,601
The Foster residence.

2080
01:10:36,721 --> 01:10:38,386
Hold on, please, miss.

2081
01:10:38,387 --> 01:10:40,970
A Miss Mortimer to speak to you, sir.

2082
01:10:40,971 --> 01:10:41,804
Oh, thank you, Wilson.

2083
01:10:41,805 --> 01:10:43,665
I'll take it in the library.

2084
01:10:44,048 --> 01:10:45,428
Do you mind, darling?

2085
01:10:45,429 --> 01:10:46,886
Not at all.

2086
01:10:46,887 --> 01:10:47,887
It's a personal matter.

2087
01:10:47,888 --> 01:10:49,328
Hold on, please, miss.

2088
01:10:49,871 --> 01:10:52,511
Why didn't Daddy
take it in here, Mummy?

2089
01:10:52,512 --> 01:10:54,511
I don't know, dear.

2090
01:10:54,512 --> 01:10:56,720
Was it something
he didn't want you to hear?

2091
01:10:56,721 --> 01:10:58,928
I suppose it must've been, darling.

2092
01:10:58,929 --> 01:11:00,303
A secret?

2093
01:11:00,304 --> 01:11:01,928
Perhaps.

2094
01:11:01,929 --> 01:11:02,929
But I thought married people

2095
01:11:02,930 --> 01:11:04,845
never had secrets from one another.

2096
01:11:04,846 --> 01:11:06,137
Not real ones.

2097
01:11:07,173 --> 01:11:08,553
Why don't you listen

2098
01:11:08,554 --> 01:11:11,095
and find out what Daddy's secret is?

2099
01:11:11,096 --> 01:11:13,136
Because that would be deceitful, Tim,

2100
01:11:13,137 --> 01:11:15,303
and Mummy trusts Daddy.

2101
01:11:15,304 --> 01:11:16,137
Do you?

2102
01:11:16,138 --> 01:11:17,303
Implicitly.

2103
01:11:17,304 --> 01:11:20,387
Now, you run along with
Wilson like a good boy.

2104
01:11:27,679 --> 01:11:30,012
And Laura need never know.

2105
01:11:30,887 --> 01:11:32,987
All right, same time, same place.

2106
01:11:33,496 --> 01:11:34,636
Tuesday, my dear.

2107
01:11:34,637 --> 01:11:37,037
Goodbye, and bless you for everything.

2108
01:11:40,762 --> 01:11:41,761
Simon?

2109
01:11:41,762 --> 01:11:42,720
Now you're for it.

2110
01:11:42,721 --> 01:11:43,554
Right here's the missus.

2111
01:11:43,555 --> 01:11:44,429
Shh, shut up, Bert.

2112
01:11:44,430 --> 01:11:46,053
Who is Miss Mortimer?

2113
01:11:46,054 --> 01:11:47,261
No one, darling.

2114
01:11:47,262 --> 01:11:48,678
She must be someone, darling.

2115
01:11:48,679 --> 01:11:51,386
Well, nobody who need concern you.

2116
01:11:51,387 --> 01:11:53,261
This is so unlike you, Simon.

2117
01:11:53,262 --> 01:11:55,636
You're usually so frank and open.

2118
01:11:55,637 --> 01:11:57,803
You have a guilty look, darling.

2119
01:11:57,804 --> 01:11:59,220
Who is she?

2120
01:11:59,221 --> 01:12:00,720
I'm sorry, I can't tell you.

2121
01:12:00,721 --> 01:12:01,554
Why not?

2122
01:12:01,555 --> 01:12:03,345
'Cause it's something
I don't want you to know.

2123
01:12:03,346 --> 01:12:04,726
Oh, like Monte Carlo.

2124
01:12:05,592 --> 01:12:06,989
Good grief, Timothy was right.

2125
01:12:06,990 --> 01:12:08,387
What are you talking about?

2126
01:12:08,388 --> 01:12:09,678
You, nag, nag, nag.

2127
01:12:09,679 --> 01:12:10,596
Pick, pick, pick.

2128
01:12:10,597 --> 01:12:12,470
Question, question, question.

2129
01:12:12,471 --> 01:12:13,886
Worrying every possible piece of scandal

2130
01:12:13,887 --> 01:12:15,636
like a she-dog with a bone.

2131
01:12:15,637 --> 01:12:16,637
Are you calling me a...

2132
01:12:16,638 --> 01:12:18,845
Well, this time,
you won't get away with it.

2133
01:12:18,846 --> 01:12:19,761
Get away with what?

2134
01:12:19,762 --> 01:12:20,679
Acting as if you've got a halo,

2135
01:12:20,680 --> 01:12:22,678
then sneaking around to
Hellum Street behind my back.

2136
01:12:22,679 --> 01:12:23,512
Simon.

2137
01:12:23,513 --> 01:12:24,346
Shut up!

2138
01:12:24,347 --> 01:12:25,470
Monte Carlo to you!

2139
01:12:25,471 --> 01:12:27,428
And you can't ram that
down my throat, either.

2140
01:12:27,429 --> 01:12:28,928
Kneesy kneesy to you.

2141
01:12:28,929 --> 01:12:30,136
Kneesy kneesy?

2142
01:12:30,137 --> 01:12:32,970
Yes, under the table
at the Cafe de Paris.

2143
01:12:32,971 --> 01:12:34,636
Who told you that?

2144
01:12:34,637 --> 01:12:36,386
A little bird, I suppose.

2145
01:12:36,387 --> 01:12:38,303
No, a little rat!

2146
01:12:38,304 --> 01:12:39,137
You're drunk.

2147
01:12:39,138 --> 01:12:40,636
And I suppose you're not?

2148
01:12:40,637 --> 01:12:42,053
Are you suggesting that I...

2149
01:12:42,054 --> 01:12:43,803
Are sozzled, yes.

2150
01:12:43,804 --> 01:12:44,970
And squinting like mad.

2151
01:12:44,971 --> 01:12:47,011
You always squint when you're sozzled.

2152
01:12:47,012 --> 01:12:48,262
How dare you.

2153
01:12:49,221 --> 01:12:51,595
Cut it, cut it!

2154
01:12:51,596 --> 01:12:53,511
I'll show you how sober I am.

2155
01:12:53,512 --> 01:12:55,262
Aye, aye.

2156
01:12:59,429 --> 01:13:00,553
Simon, please.

2157
01:13:00,554 --> 01:13:02,261
Teach you to hit me, you...

2158
01:13:02,262 --> 01:13:03,345
Simon!

2159
01:13:03,346 --> 01:13:04,179
Go on hit him, champ!

2160
01:13:04,180 --> 01:13:05,011
Surely, man.

2161
01:13:05,012 --> 01:13:05,971
That's right, side with the man

2162
01:13:05,972 --> 01:13:06,928
which strikes his wife.

2163
01:13:06,929 --> 01:13:07,846
That's the only way to treat 'em.

2164
01:13:07,847 --> 01:13:08,846
I'd like to see you try it.

2165
01:13:08,847 --> 01:13:10,053
I will if you don't shut up!

2166
01:13:10,054 --> 01:13:11,178
For this, Simon.

2167
01:13:11,179 --> 01:13:12,928
And now you're going to get yours.

2168
01:13:12,929 --> 01:13:13,929
- Ooh.
- Ooh.

2169
01:13:22,971 --> 01:13:25,887
Don't you dare hit Simon!

2170
01:13:29,929 --> 01:13:30,929
Simon!

2171
01:13:32,262 --> 01:13:34,303
Ooh, he's drawn blood.

2172
01:13:34,304 --> 01:13:35,304
Use your left!

2173
01:13:35,305 --> 01:13:37,470
Short arm jabs, short arm jabs.

2174
01:13:37,471 --> 01:13:38,304
That's right, Gran.

2175
01:13:38,305 --> 01:13:39,553
Short arm jabs, short arm jabs.

2176
01:13:39,554 --> 01:13:40,387
You shut up, Bert.

2177
01:13:40,388 --> 01:13:41,803
Don't you come that
stuff with me, my girl,

2178
01:13:41,804 --> 01:13:42,637
or I'll one on you.

2179
01:13:42,638 --> 01:13:43,471
You try it.

2180
01:13:43,472 --> 01:13:44,511
Go on, just try it, you right lout.

2181
01:13:44,512 --> 01:13:45,886
All right, I will.

2182
01:13:45,887 --> 01:13:48,887
And you shut up too!

2183
01:13:50,721 --> 01:13:51,637
Ooh!

2184
01:13:51,638 --> 01:13:52,554
Simon!

2185
01:13:52,555 --> 01:13:54,678
# Good King Wenceslas looked out #

2186
01:13:54,679 --> 01:13:58,136
Simon
# On the feast of Stephen #

2187
01:13:58,137 --> 01:14:01,345
# When the snow lay round about #

2188
01:14:01,346 --> 01:14:04,386
# Deep and crisp and even #

2189
01:14:04,387 --> 01:14:05,387
How dare you.

2190
01:14:06,512 --> 01:14:12,303
# And even #

2191
01:14:12,304 --> 01:14:13,136
Stop!

2192
01:14:13,137 --> 01:14:20,220
# And even #

2193
01:14:20,221 --> 01:14:21,345
# And #

2194
01:14:21,346 --> 01:14:22,553
Will you two.

2195
01:14:22,554 --> 01:14:23,721
Do you mind?

2196
01:14:30,221 --> 01:14:31,221
David.

2197
01:14:32,478 --> 01:14:35,178
David, we've been on the air all the time!

2198
01:14:35,179 --> 01:14:36,063
What?

2199
01:14:36,064 --> 01:14:37,804
I'm terribly sorry, David.

2200
01:14:37,805 --> 01:14:39,886
I could have sworn we switched off.

2201
01:14:39,887 --> 01:14:42,053
Oh, forget it, Barney.

2202
01:14:42,054 --> 01:14:44,094
We're all in this together now.

2203
01:14:53,096 --> 01:14:54,096
Hello, yes.

2204
01:14:55,262 --> 01:14:56,262
Oh, yes, sir.

2205
01:14:57,346 --> 01:14:58,636
Yes, sir, one sec.

2206
01:14:58,637 --> 01:15:00,720
David, it's, it's the CT, for you.

2207
01:15:00,721 --> 01:15:02,262
Oh, my hat.

2208
01:15:05,054 --> 01:15:06,345
H... hello, sir.

2209
01:15:06,346 --> 01:15:07,970
Congratulations, my boy.

2210
01:15:07,971 --> 01:15:09,595
Wonderful stuff.

2211
01:15:09,596 --> 01:15:10,761
You see, I was right.

2212
01:15:10,762 --> 01:15:11,762
The moment you took my advice,

2213
01:15:11,763 --> 01:15:13,678
the whole thing comes to life.

2214
01:15:13,679 --> 01:15:16,220
Oh, oh, thank you very much, sir.

2215
01:15:16,221 --> 01:15:17,595
Oh, of course not, sir.

2216
01:15:17,596 --> 01:15:19,886
We think tomorrow's is better still.

2217
01:15:19,887 --> 01:15:21,595
By the way, who played that handsome,

2218
01:15:21,596 --> 01:15:24,220
rugged type who came in
and gave Simon the KO?

2219
01:15:24,221 --> 01:15:26,381
Don't remember seeing him before.

2220
01:15:27,221 --> 01:15:29,136
Oh, a new chap, sir.

2221
01:15:29,137 --> 01:15:32,511
I got him from a rep at short notice.

2222
01:15:32,512 --> 01:15:34,970
No, I'm afraid not, sir.

2223
01:15:34,971 --> 01:15:38,151
Off to the States in the
morning, films, you know.

2224
01:15:39,137 --> 01:15:40,157
Of course, sir.

2225
01:15:41,054 --> 01:15:42,554
Thank you so much, sir.

2226
01:15:43,304 --> 01:15:44,678
Goodbye, sir.

2227
01:15:44,679 --> 01:15:46,303
Are we all fired?

2228
01:15:46,304 --> 01:15:47,553
Fired?

2229
01:15:47,554 --> 01:15:48,634
He's delighted.

2230
01:15:49,554 --> 01:15:51,774
He said it was the best script yet.

2231
01:15:51,795 --> 01:15:53,595
Keep it up to that standard.

2232
01:15:53,596 --> 01:15:56,386
He wants another one
just like it tomorrow.

2233
01:15:56,387 --> 01:15:58,178
Another just like that?

2234
01:15:58,179 --> 01:15:59,636
Oh!

2235
01:15:59,637 --> 01:16:00,637
Oh.

2236
01:16:01,846 --> 01:16:02,846
Oh.

2237
01:16:11,512 --> 01:16:15,303
TV's best ever, and I wasn't in it.

2238
01:16:15,304 --> 01:16:16,886
Any sign of Mr. and Mrs. Foster yet?

2239
01:16:16,887 --> 01:16:17,721
No.

2240
01:16:17,722 --> 01:16:19,178
You've no idea where they can be?

2241
01:16:19,179 --> 01:16:20,012
None at all.

2242
01:16:20,013 --> 01:16:21,220
Madam left the house last night.

2243
01:16:21,221 --> 01:16:23,053
The master went out
first thing this morning.

2244
01:16:23,054 --> 01:16:24,303
Bet you don't turn up.

2245
01:16:24,304 --> 01:16:25,595
Am I in it today?

2246
01:16:25,596 --> 01:16:26,886
Yes, Jessie.

2247
01:16:26,887 --> 01:16:29,553
Only just.

2248
01:16:29,554 --> 01:16:33,095
Not quite as
full-blooded as last night.

2249
01:16:33,096 --> 01:16:33,929
Well, it's up to you

2250
01:16:33,930 --> 01:16:36,210
to put the blood in it again, David.

2251
01:16:36,211 --> 01:16:37,194
Any sign of them?

2252
01:16:37,195 --> 01:16:38,179
I'm afraid not.

2253
01:16:38,180 --> 01:16:39,345
Oh, this is terrible.

2254
01:16:39,346 --> 01:16:40,386
What are we going to do?

2255
01:16:40,387 --> 01:16:42,136
Hanged if I know.

2256
01:16:42,137 --> 01:16:43,886
Look, go back and tell
the rest of the cast

2257
01:16:43,887 --> 01:16:45,428
we start rehearsals in half an hour,

2258
01:16:45,429 --> 01:16:46,970
and don't let them get worried.

2259
01:16:46,971 --> 01:16:47,803
Oh, sorry.

2260
01:16:47,804 --> 01:16:48,636
Simon!

2261
01:16:48,637 --> 01:16:49,470
Where's Laura?

2262
01:16:49,471 --> 01:16:50,303
Well, isn't she with you?

2263
01:16:50,304 --> 01:16:51,136
Does it look like it?

2264
01:16:51,137 --> 01:16:51,971
We've been looking for you both.

2265
01:16:51,972 --> 01:16:53,011
Changes in the script.

2266
01:16:53,012 --> 01:16:53,971
Hang the script!

2267
01:16:53,972 --> 01:16:55,011
Laura's gone, she's vanished.

2268
01:16:55,012 --> 01:16:56,345
- What?
- I've rung the Baxter's.

2269
01:16:56,346 --> 01:16:57,178
I've rung the Hunter's.

2270
01:16:57,179 --> 01:16:58,011
I've rung everybody.

2271
01:16:58,012 --> 01:16:58,929
Well, she must be somewhere.

2272
01:16:58,930 --> 01:16:59,762
Think, man.

2273
01:16:59,763 --> 01:17:00,595
I am thinking.

2274
01:17:00,596 --> 01:17:01,429
What about tonight's show?

2275
01:17:01,430 --> 01:17:02,761
Do you think I'm going to go in front

2276
01:17:02,762 --> 01:17:04,595
of a camera with this?

2277
01:17:04,596 --> 01:17:05,429
Oh.

2278
01:17:05,430 --> 01:17:06,845
Oh, my hat.

2279
01:17:06,846 --> 01:17:08,178
Janet, write it into the script.

2280
01:17:08,179 --> 01:17:09,259
Oh well, really!

2281
01:17:10,929 --> 01:17:12,303
Hello?

2282
01:17:12,304 --> 01:17:13,595
Bertie!

2283
01:17:13,596 --> 01:17:16,595
Well, don't just stand
there, man, find Laura.

2284
01:17:16,596 --> 01:17:17,596
I'll ring my mother.

2285
01:17:17,597 --> 01:17:18,970
There's a good chance she may be there.

2286
01:17:18,971 --> 01:17:20,178
Hello, Bertie.

2287
01:17:20,179 --> 01:17:21,720
Look, Simon's just
turned up but not Laura.

2288
01:17:21,721 --> 01:17:22,554
Any news of her?

2289
01:17:22,555 --> 01:17:24,178
No, not a thing.

2290
01:17:24,179 --> 01:17:25,428
Offers have been pouring in.

2291
01:17:25,429 --> 01:17:27,553
What a show, what a performance!

2292
01:17:27,554 --> 01:17:29,137
But can I find her, no!

2293
01:17:30,096 --> 01:17:31,261
Yes.

2294
01:17:31,262 --> 01:17:33,511
David, David, you must tell me one thing.

2295
01:17:33,512 --> 01:17:34,952
Who was Miss Mortimer?

2296
01:17:35,263 --> 01:17:37,303
Look, see tonight's instalment,

2297
01:17:37,304 --> 01:17:38,137
and you'll find out.

2298
01:17:38,138 --> 01:17:38,971
Goodbye, Bertie.

2299
01:17:38,972 --> 01:17:40,595
I'm busy.

2300
01:17:40,596 --> 01:17:42,470
I'd better run through
the script with Simon.

2301
01:17:42,471 --> 01:17:44,053
Okay?

2302
01:17:44,054 --> 01:17:45,054
Yes, okay.

2303
01:17:46,798 --> 01:17:49,678
Listen, all you've
said at regular intervals

2304
01:17:49,679 --> 01:17:52,470
for the last five minutes is hold on.

2305
01:17:52,471 --> 01:17:53,970
In times of national crisis,

2306
01:17:53,971 --> 01:17:55,053
that is a remark I will take

2307
01:17:55,054 --> 01:17:57,095
From Mr. Churchill and Mr. Churchill only.

2308
01:17:57,096 --> 01:18:00,554
Now, please, get me Leicester 2874.

2309
01:18:00,555 --> 01:18:03,511
What make you think Laura's
gone to your mother's?

2310
01:18:03,512 --> 01:18:04,636
Because it's the sort of damn fool thing

2311
01:18:04,637 --> 01:18:05,532
she would do.

2312
01:18:05,533 --> 01:18:06,429
They get on well?

2313
01:18:06,430 --> 01:18:07,261
Get on well?

2314
01:18:07,262 --> 01:18:08,137
They're having the time of their lives

2315
01:18:08,138 --> 01:18:09,178
sitting halfway up the chimney

2316
01:18:09,179 --> 01:18:11,511
swilling tea and listing my misdemeanours.

2317
01:18:11,512 --> 01:18:12,346
How's the eye?

2318
01:18:12,347 --> 01:18:14,345
It's throbbing nicely, thank you.

2319
01:18:14,346 --> 01:18:16,511
I was amazed at David.

2320
01:18:16,512 --> 01:18:18,345
I was a little taken aback myself.

2321
01:18:18,346 --> 01:18:20,386
He's usually so calm.

2322
01:18:20,387 --> 01:18:22,721
And then suddenly, wham!

2323
01:18:23,762 --> 01:18:24,762
Bless him.

2324
01:18:24,763 --> 01:18:26,095
What do you mean bless him?

2325
01:18:26,096 --> 01:18:27,720
Hello?

2326
01:18:27,721 --> 01:18:29,220
Hello, Mother.

2327
01:18:29,221 --> 01:18:30,346
How are you?

2328
01:18:31,221 --> 01:18:32,471
How's your back?

2329
01:18:33,762 --> 01:18:35,471
How is your back, dear?

2330
01:18:37,354 --> 01:18:38,554
Are you all right?

2331
01:18:38,555 --> 01:18:40,175
You sound a bit peculiar.

2332
01:18:42,012 --> 01:18:43,387
Simon, dear.

2333
01:18:44,304 --> 01:18:45,304
What?

2334
01:18:45,946 --> 01:18:47,386
Oh, I beg your pardon.

2335
01:18:47,387 --> 01:18:48,803
Good day.

2336
01:18:48,804 --> 01:18:51,095
That was Chester 2874, Mrs. Grant.

2337
01:18:51,096 --> 01:18:52,553
How is her back?

2338
01:18:52,554 --> 01:18:53,928
She seemed fairly satisfied.

2339
01:18:53,929 --> 01:18:54,929
T-R-U

2340
01:18:57,721 --> 01:18:59,803
Have you got designs on David?

2341
01:18:59,804 --> 01:19:00,637
Of course.

2342
01:19:00,638 --> 01:19:03,261
There's a man from ""Woman's
Own"" to see you, sir.

2343
01:19:03,262 --> 01:19:04,678
Tell him I can't see anybody.

2344
01:19:04,679 --> 01:19:06,511
That's practically true.

2345
01:19:06,512 --> 01:19:08,303
Jessie suggests raw liver.

2346
01:19:08,304 --> 01:19:09,179
What, for lunch?

2347
01:19:09,180 --> 01:19:10,553
No, your eye, sir.

2348
01:19:10,554 --> 01:19:12,678
That would fascinate
the viewers, wouldn't it?

2349
01:19:12,679 --> 01:19:15,428
Come on, come on, come on.

2350
01:19:15,429 --> 01:19:16,511
I suppose the only reason you came

2351
01:19:16,512 --> 01:19:19,511
to Monte Carlo with me
was to make David jealous.

2352
01:19:19,512 --> 01:19:21,553
No, to try and make Laura lay off.

2353
01:19:21,554 --> 01:19:22,595
Well, you've succeeded.

2354
01:19:22,596 --> 01:19:23,845
She's laying off the lot of us.

2355
01:19:23,846 --> 01:19:26,970
Woman, I asked you for Leicester 2874.

2356
01:19:26,971 --> 01:19:28,636
I don't care if you are a different woman.

2357
01:19:28,637 --> 01:19:30,345
Prove your superiority over the other one

2358
01:19:30,346 --> 01:19:32,679
by getting me Leicester 2874.

2359
01:19:34,012 --> 01:19:35,053
Thank you.

2360
01:19:35,054 --> 01:19:35,949
What did she say?

2361
01:19:35,950 --> 01:19:36,846
Hold on again.

2362
01:19:36,847 --> 01:19:37,679
Any news?

2363
01:19:37,680 --> 01:19:38,512
- No.
- No.

2364
01:19:38,513 --> 01:19:39,636
Had a look at the new stuff yet?

2365
01:19:39,637 --> 01:19:40,471
I have not.

2366
01:19:40,472 --> 01:19:41,845
I am holding on, with difficulty.

2367
01:19:41,846 --> 01:19:43,553
You really ought to
get down to it, you know.

2368
01:19:43,554 --> 01:19:44,387
Why?

2369
01:19:44,388 --> 01:19:45,553
You've only shot the back of my head

2370
01:19:45,554 --> 01:19:46,512
for the past few weeks,

2371
01:19:46,513 --> 01:19:48,345
and I could read my lines.

2372
01:19:48,346 --> 01:19:49,470
Foster!

2373
01:19:49,471 --> 01:19:51,720
I am in no mood for another argument.

2374
01:19:51,721 --> 01:19:53,428
I've already hit you once.

2375
01:19:53,429 --> 01:19:55,886
I regret having done so,
because I'm a pacifist,

2376
01:19:55,887 --> 01:19:58,220
but if you don't stop
behaving like a tetchy

2377
01:19:58,221 --> 01:19:59,845
two year old, I shall do so again.

2378
01:19:59,846 --> 01:20:00,679
Bless you.

2379
01:20:00,680 --> 01:20:03,011
And I have few words to
say to you in a moment.

2380
01:20:03,012 --> 01:20:07,095
I am sick and tired of
star actors and actresses.

2381
01:20:07,096 --> 01:20:08,261
I can think of only one

2382
01:20:08,262 --> 01:20:09,886
in the last 30 years
with whom I'd be willing

2383
01:20:09,887 --> 01:20:11,053
to spend the rest of my days,

2384
01:20:11,054 --> 01:20:12,470
and, unfortunately, he's dead.

2385
01:20:12,471 --> 01:20:13,553
Who's that?

2386
01:20:13,554 --> 01:20:14,803
Rin-Tin-Tin.

2387
01:20:14,804 --> 01:20:15,971
Ha ha ha.

2388
01:20:17,041 --> 01:20:19,261
Oh, Mr. Prentice, can I have a word

2389
01:20:19,262 --> 01:20:20,553
with you about the script?

2390
01:20:20,554 --> 01:20:22,053
In my office in 10 minutes.

2391
01:20:22,054 --> 01:20:22,971
How's your eye, Dad?

2392
01:20:22,972 --> 01:20:24,761
I brought chorizo to put on it.

2393
01:20:24,762 --> 01:20:25,762
Get out!

2394
01:20:27,360 --> 01:20:29,220
I believed in this programme.

2395
01:20:29,221 --> 01:20:31,011
I thought we had two people in it

2396
01:20:31,012 --> 01:20:32,511
who were examples of what a decent,

2397
01:20:32,512 --> 01:20:34,011
ordinary married couple should be,

2398
01:20:34,012 --> 01:20:36,178
even if they were on the stage.

2399
01:20:36,179 --> 01:20:38,095
Yes, well, I should have checked up.

2400
01:20:38,096 --> 01:20:40,053
Unfortunately, on a BBC salary,

2401
01:20:40,054 --> 01:20:41,261
you don't eat in the restaurants

2402
01:20:41,262 --> 01:20:42,470
where you can check up
on those sort of things.

2403
01:20:42,471 --> 01:20:43,304
Yes, it's quite all right, thank you.

2404
01:20:43,305 --> 01:20:45,428
I'm listening to a talk on the BBC.

2405
01:20:45,429 --> 01:20:46,761
But I could not
believe that you could be

2406
01:20:46,762 --> 01:20:48,095
so blatantly deceitful yourself.

2407
01:20:48,096 --> 01:20:49,470
Well, now you're just being a bore!

2408
01:20:49,471 --> 01:20:50,595
There was a time when you seemed

2409
01:20:50,596 --> 01:20:52,178
willing to share my
particular brand of boredom.

2410
01:20:52,179 --> 01:20:53,761
A cracking, pompous bore!

2411
01:20:53,762 --> 01:20:55,136
Hello, Mother?

2412
01:20:55,137 --> 01:20:56,345
- How are you, dear?
- Well, at least I have

2413
01:20:56,346 --> 01:20:57,595
a few moral qualms about spending

2414
01:20:57,596 --> 01:20:59,553
an illicit weekend with a married man.

2415
01:20:59,554 --> 01:21:00,970
- I should hope so.
- How's your back?

2416
01:21:00,971 --> 01:21:02,345
- How is your back, dear?
- You condemn me

2417
01:21:02,346 --> 01:21:04,136
for having a mild flirtation with Simon.

2418
01:21:04,137 --> 01:21:06,095
- Is Laura with you?
- And yet you've been

2419
01:21:06,096 --> 01:21:06,929
doing exactly the same thing with Laura.

2420
01:21:06,930 --> 01:21:08,303
- She's not?
- Laura was in need

2421
01:21:08,304 --> 01:21:09,470
of a bit of comfort and companionship!

2422
01:21:09,471 --> 01:21:10,304
Hooey!

2423
01:21:10,305 --> 01:21:11,803
There's only one thing
Laura was in need of!

2424
01:21:11,804 --> 01:21:12,804
- Quiet!
- Oh.

2425
01:21:13,360 --> 01:21:16,720
It's all right, darling,
just some people jabbering.

2426
01:21:16,721 --> 01:21:17,554
What?

2427
01:21:17,555 --> 01:21:19,011
You didn't enjoy last night's instalment?

2428
01:21:19,012 --> 01:21:20,761
Neither did we much.

2429
01:21:20,762 --> 01:21:23,642
Look, if Laura turns
up, get her to phone me.

2430
01:21:24,387 --> 01:21:26,428
Yes, she's walked out on me.

2431
01:21:26,429 --> 01:21:27,970
Well, I.

2432
01:21:27,971 --> 01:21:29,261
Yes, dear, but.

2433
01:21:29,262 --> 01:21:31,053
Well, I know it may be my fault,

2434
01:21:31,054 --> 01:21:35,221
but I love her very, very
much, and I want her back.

2435
01:21:35,222 --> 01:21:37,054
Oh, those were three of the quickest pips

2436
01:21:37,055 --> 01:21:38,136
in the history of the Post Office.

2437
01:21:38,137 --> 01:21:39,511
No, darling, it's this exchange.

2438
01:21:39,512 --> 01:21:41,803
They've got something against me.

2439
01:21:41,804 --> 01:21:43,220
Goodbye, darling.

2440
01:21:43,221 --> 01:21:44,886
Take care of yourself.

2441
01:21:44,887 --> 01:21:46,261
Take care of your!

2442
01:21:46,262 --> 01:21:47,554
Oh, never mind.

2443
01:21:50,262 --> 01:21:51,262
Laura!

2444
01:21:53,485 --> 01:21:55,345
Where on earth have you been?

2445
01:21:55,346 --> 01:21:56,678
David, I'm sorry I'm late, but I...

2446
01:21:56,679 --> 01:21:58,720
We've been looking everywhere for you.

2447
01:21:58,721 --> 01:22:00,470
The CT wanted a lot of alterations made

2448
01:22:00,471 --> 01:22:02,053
to tonight's script.

2449
01:22:02,054 --> 01:22:04,514
I'll get Janet to bring you one along.

2450
01:22:05,378 --> 01:22:08,678
Get me Mr. Foster's dressing
room, will you please?

2451
01:22:08,679 --> 01:22:10,419
She's not at my mother's.

2452
01:22:10,971 --> 01:22:11,971
Laura!

2453
01:22:12,743 --> 01:22:14,303
Now where have you been?

2454
01:22:14,304 --> 01:22:16,386
To a solicitor and a
commissioner for oaths.

2455
01:22:16,387 --> 01:22:17,720
- Oh.
- It was the soliciting

2456
01:22:17,721 --> 01:22:20,386
side of the business I was interested in.

2457
01:22:20,387 --> 01:22:22,553
I don't think you need much
help in the matter of oaths.

2458
01:22:22,554 --> 01:22:23,387
Laura!

2459
01:22:23,388 --> 01:22:26,136
And who, might I ask, have
you been soliciting now?

2460
01:22:26,137 --> 01:22:27,637
I'm getting a divorce.

2461
01:22:27,638 --> 01:22:29,803
You ought to put something on that eye,

2462
01:22:29,804 --> 01:22:31,303
some meat of some kind.

2463
01:22:31,304 --> 01:22:33,220
But, Laura darling, you can't.

2464
01:22:33,221 --> 01:22:34,053
Can't what?

2465
01:22:34,054 --> 01:22:34,887
Get a divorce.

2466
01:22:34,888 --> 01:22:36,970
If you think there was
a shortage of evidence,

2467
01:22:36,971 --> 01:22:38,886
I can assure you that Sybil Hunter's charm

2468
01:22:38,887 --> 01:22:40,803
was both thorough and
efficient last weekend

2469
01:22:40,804 --> 01:22:41,970
at Monte Carlo.

2470
01:22:41,971 --> 01:22:44,428
But, but think of the programme.

2471
01:22:44,429 --> 01:22:45,720
The viewers would never stand for it.

2472
01:22:45,721 --> 01:22:47,387
Oh, damn the viewers!

2473
01:22:49,596 --> 01:22:51,721
What a terrible thing to say.

2474
01:22:53,429 --> 01:22:54,429
Come in.

2475
01:22:56,596 --> 01:22:57,637
Oh, it's you.

2476
01:22:59,304 --> 01:23:00,678
Yes.

2477
01:23:00,679 --> 01:23:01,761
And I've got something to say to you.

2478
01:23:01,762 --> 01:23:04,053
Janet, I, I really don't
think I want to hear it.

2479
01:23:04,054 --> 01:23:05,720
It's just that if you
think you can get a divorce

2480
01:23:05,721 --> 01:23:07,678
because of what happened in Monte Carlo,

2481
01:23:07,679 --> 01:23:09,136
you're very much mistaken.

2482
01:23:09,137 --> 01:23:11,470
My information was that you and Simon

2483
01:23:11,471 --> 01:23:13,761
had rooms 100 and 101.

2484
01:23:13,762 --> 01:23:14,679
That's right.

2485
01:23:14,680 --> 01:23:16,136
That was very convenient, wasn't it?

2486
01:23:16,137 --> 01:23:17,137
Not really.

2487
01:23:17,138 --> 01:23:19,386
Well, at least it was
adjacent, wasn't it?

2488
01:23:19,387 --> 01:23:20,387
Not even that.

2489
01:23:20,588 --> 01:23:22,928
Your informant should have checked up

2490
01:23:22,929 --> 01:23:25,511
on the layout as well as the register.

2491
01:23:25,512 --> 01:23:28,220
There are 100 rooms on each floor.

2492
01:23:28,221 --> 01:23:30,345
Room 100 is on the first floor front,

2493
01:23:30,346 --> 01:23:31,511
facing the sea.

2494
01:23:31,512 --> 01:23:34,220
Room 101 is on the second floor back,

2495
01:23:34,221 --> 01:23:36,511
facing the gasometer,
the marshalling yards,

2496
01:23:36,512 --> 01:23:40,220
and a church with jangliest
bells in Southern France.

2497
01:23:40,221 --> 01:23:42,178
I was in 101.

2498
01:23:42,179 --> 01:23:43,303
But not alone?

2499
01:23:43,304 --> 01:23:44,845
Quite alone.

2500
01:23:44,846 --> 01:23:47,053
Approximately 15 seconds after unpacking

2501
01:23:47,054 --> 01:23:49,886
his sponge bag, Simon left for the casino.

2502
01:23:49,887 --> 01:23:51,720
He came back at two in the morning.

2503
01:23:51,721 --> 01:23:55,011
He was seen heading straight
for the marshalling yards.

2504
01:23:55,012 --> 01:23:57,261
Yes, to borrow money.

2505
01:23:57,262 --> 01:23:58,761
If Sybil Hunter's private eye

2506
01:23:58,762 --> 01:24:00,178
had hovered just two minutes longer

2507
01:24:00,179 --> 01:24:01,761
in that corridor, she'd have seen him

2508
01:24:01,762 --> 01:24:03,553
streaking back to the casino at a speed

2509
01:24:03,554 --> 01:24:06,553
faster than sound with my francs.

2510
01:24:06,554 --> 01:24:08,954
He stayed there until after breakfast.

2511
01:24:08,955 --> 01:24:11,261
If you think I'm gonna believe all this

2512
01:24:11,262 --> 01:24:14,011
and say all right, let's
forget the whole thing,

2513
01:24:14,012 --> 01:24:15,720
you're very much mistaken.

2514
01:24:15,721 --> 01:24:17,636
I'm going ahead with my divorce.

2515
01:24:17,637 --> 01:24:19,095
But, Laura, think of the show.

2516
01:24:19,096 --> 01:24:19,971
I am thinking of it,

2517
01:24:19,972 --> 01:24:21,428
and if you'll leave me alone,

2518
01:24:21,429 --> 01:24:24,178
I'll get on with learning this
revolting script of yours.

2519
01:24:24,179 --> 01:24:25,511
But.

2520
01:24:25,512 --> 01:24:27,096
Oh, what's the use?

2521
01:24:31,721 --> 01:24:32,721
Tea, madam.

2522
01:24:32,722 --> 01:24:35,511
Shall I call Master
Timothy and Miss Angela?

2523
01:24:35,512 --> 01:24:36,712
Thank you, Wilson.

2524
01:24:38,554 --> 01:24:39,970
No lines again today.

2525
01:24:39,971 --> 01:24:41,428
So you see, Miss Mortimer was merely

2526
01:24:41,429 --> 01:24:42,262
an elderly masseuse.

2527
01:24:42,263 --> 01:24:44,761
A masseuse, why didn't you tell me?

2528
01:24:44,762 --> 01:24:46,678
Because I didn't want
to worry you with me.

2529
01:24:46,679 --> 01:24:48,359
Just a touch of arthritis.

2530
01:24:49,137 --> 01:24:50,470
And Monte Carlo?

2531
01:24:50,471 --> 01:24:52,553
A semi-detached villa in Kensington.

2532
01:24:52,554 --> 01:24:53,554
Darling.

2533
01:24:55,721 --> 01:24:57,845
Hello, dears, having a nice time?

2534
01:24:57,846 --> 01:24:58,804
Yes, Mummy.

2535
01:24:58,805 --> 01:24:59,886
We just had a lovely romp.

2536
01:24:59,887 --> 01:25:01,511
Er, frolic.

2537
01:25:01,512 --> 01:25:03,178
All right, half and
hour's break for tea,

2538
01:25:03,179 --> 01:25:05,279
then we'll run through it again.

2539
01:25:10,663 --> 01:25:13,303
Will you have it
here, sir or with madam?

2540
01:25:13,304 --> 01:25:14,595
Here.

2541
01:25:14,596 --> 01:25:15,796
Thank you, Wilson.

2542
01:25:18,976 --> 01:25:21,136
I suppose you could do with a cup?

2543
01:25:21,137 --> 01:25:23,554
I certainly could.

2544
01:25:26,721 --> 01:25:28,595
Shall I be mom?

2545
01:25:28,596 --> 01:25:29,916
Please do, no sugar.

2546
01:25:31,620 --> 01:25:33,720
Timothy, leave that camera alone.

2547
01:25:33,721 --> 01:25:34,928
I was only trying to...

2548
01:25:34,929 --> 01:25:36,595
Well, buzz off.

2549
01:25:36,596 --> 01:25:38,346
Come on, get going.

2550
01:25:41,179 --> 01:25:42,178
Sandwich?

2551
01:25:42,179 --> 01:25:43,011
No, thank you.

2552
01:25:43,012 --> 01:25:43,846
They're meat paste.

2553
01:25:43,847 --> 01:25:45,678
I suppose you'd like
me to put one on my eye.

2554
01:25:45,679 --> 01:25:46,845
Look, can't you forget that?

2555
01:25:46,846 --> 01:25:47,804
No, nor can I forget what happened

2556
01:25:47,805 --> 01:25:49,665
at Hellum Street on Thursday.

2557
01:25:52,054 --> 01:25:53,345
Crumpet?

2558
01:25:53,346 --> 01:25:54,966
Thanks, I'll have a bit.

2559
01:25:56,304 --> 01:25:58,678
David, what did happen at your flat?

2560
01:25:58,679 --> 01:26:00,470
Well, we had a couple of drinks.

2561
01:26:00,471 --> 01:26:01,471
And then?

2562
01:26:01,918 --> 01:26:04,678
Well then I made the
suggestion to Laura...

2563
01:26:04,679 --> 01:26:05,512
What suggestion?

2564
01:26:05,513 --> 01:26:06,636
Oh, this is awful.

2565
01:26:06,637 --> 01:26:07,596
Look, I'm terribly sorry, Simon...

2566
01:26:07,597 --> 01:26:08,429
It's too late to be sorry!

2567
01:26:08,430 --> 01:26:09,720
What suggestion?

2568
01:26:09,721 --> 01:26:13,137
That you should be taken
out of the programme.

2569
01:26:14,387 --> 01:26:15,387
What?

2570
01:26:15,388 --> 01:26:17,970
Well, there have been a
good many complaints, Simon.

2571
01:26:17,971 --> 01:26:20,511
You know, about, well, about
some of your mannerisms.

2572
01:26:20,512 --> 01:26:21,345
Mannerisms?

2573
01:26:21,346 --> 01:26:22,178
I haven't any mannerisms.

2574
01:26:22,179 --> 01:26:23,012
What was to happen to me?

2575
01:26:23,013 --> 01:26:24,761
You were to meet with an accident.

2576
01:26:24,762 --> 01:26:26,386
An accident?

2577
01:26:26,387 --> 01:26:28,428
You were to be run over.

2578
01:26:28,429 --> 01:26:29,970
Run over?

2579
01:26:29,971 --> 01:26:31,303
The idea was that you were to be

2580
01:26:31,304 --> 01:26:32,511
dangerously ill in a nursing home

2581
01:26:32,512 --> 01:26:35,971
for 12 instalments and then die.

2582
01:26:36,629 --> 01:26:38,429
We were a little bit worried

2583
01:26:38,430 --> 01:26:39,886
about your funeral because it clashed

2584
01:26:39,887 --> 01:26:41,267
with ""Radio Olympia.""

2585
01:26:42,596 --> 01:26:44,761
And Laura agreed to all this?

2586
01:26:44,762 --> 01:26:48,928
She didn't like the idea of
wearing black in the programme.

2587
01:26:48,929 --> 01:26:51,970
I promised her it would
only be for six weeks.

2588
01:26:51,971 --> 01:26:54,431
And then she was to meet Alec Guinness.

2589
01:26:55,392 --> 01:26:57,012
Are you all right, Simon?

2590
01:26:57,013 --> 01:27:00,387
Yes, I'm just trying to
visualise my funeral on TV.

2591
01:27:00,388 --> 01:27:02,595
It would be in
perfect taste, of course,

2592
01:27:02,596 --> 01:27:03,970
a real tear-jerker.

2593
01:27:03,971 --> 01:27:05,886
A procession of
broken-hearted celebrities.

2594
01:27:05,887 --> 01:27:08,678
Angel voices off, the Welsh Girl's Choir.

2595
01:27:08,679 --> 01:27:09,596
Any flowers?

2596
01:27:09,597 --> 01:27:10,678
Masses of them.

2597
01:27:10,679 --> 01:27:12,053
That's one thing you could
never complain about,

2598
01:27:12,054 --> 01:27:13,886
a sensational exit at the very peak

2599
01:27:13,887 --> 01:27:14,721
of your popularity.

2600
01:27:14,722 --> 01:27:16,136
I mean, what more could you want?

2601
01:27:16,137 --> 01:27:18,537
I'll have another cup of tea, please.

2602
01:27:26,262 --> 01:27:27,262
Hello.

2603
01:27:27,263 --> 01:27:28,429
Mrs. Foster?

2604
01:27:29,512 --> 01:27:32,178
You're wanted in room 23.

2605
01:27:32,179 --> 01:27:34,511
23 right away, please.

2606
01:27:34,512 --> 01:27:35,512
All right.

2607
01:27:41,636 --> 01:27:43,136
Miss Honeyman speaking.

2608
01:27:43,137 --> 01:27:45,970
You're wanted
in room 23, urgent, miss.

2609
01:27:45,971 --> 01:27:46,971
Okay.

2610
01:28:06,306 --> 01:28:08,886
The one thing
I simply can't understand

2611
01:28:08,887 --> 01:28:11,303
is you and Janet going off like that.

2612
01:28:11,304 --> 01:28:12,845
I've already told you, old boy.

2613
01:28:12,846 --> 01:28:13,679
It was nothing at all.

2614
01:28:13,680 --> 01:28:16,500
It was just a bit of
a flutter, that's all.

2615
01:28:23,012 --> 01:28:24,932
Yes, I've made love to Laura.

2616
01:28:25,986 --> 01:28:28,386
Oh, if you can call an occasional kiss

2617
01:28:28,387 --> 01:28:29,595
and a rather clumsy attempt to show

2618
01:28:29,596 --> 01:28:30,886
a little sympathy making love.

2619
01:28:30,887 --> 01:28:32,678
Yes, I've done that.

2620
01:28:32,679 --> 01:28:34,845
I never wanted to come between you.

2621
01:28:34,846 --> 01:28:36,303
Why, splitting up you two would be

2622
01:28:36,304 --> 01:28:38,511
like splitting up Abbott and Costello.

2623
01:28:38,512 --> 01:28:40,011
No similarity whatsoever.

2624
01:28:40,012 --> 01:28:42,220
- Did you send for me?
- Shh!

2625
01:28:42,221 --> 01:28:43,961
Are you in love with Janet?

2626
01:28:45,471 --> 01:28:46,491
I suppose I am.

2627
01:28:47,429 --> 01:28:49,829
She certainly excites me a great deal.

2628
01:28:50,423 --> 01:28:53,303
I never felt that way
about any woman before.

2629
01:28:53,304 --> 01:28:54,137
What way?

2630
01:28:54,138 --> 01:28:55,928
Well, every time I'm alone with her,

2631
01:28:55,929 --> 01:28:58,137
I feel, well, unsure of myself.

2632
01:28:59,096 --> 01:29:00,536
It's very disturbing.

2633
01:29:01,665 --> 01:29:03,345
I suppose it's glandular.

2634
01:29:03,346 --> 01:29:04,970
Well, there's no
need to go into details.

2635
01:29:04,971 --> 01:29:05,804
Glandular!

2636
01:29:05,805 --> 01:29:08,053
She's a very wonderful person.

2637
01:29:08,054 --> 01:29:09,803
Oh, but I know it would never work out.

2638
01:29:09,804 --> 01:29:10,636
Why not?

2639
01:29:10,637 --> 01:29:11,554
I'll have another cup of tea.

2640
01:29:11,555 --> 01:29:13,428
Well, obviously, she doesn't love me.

2641
01:29:13,429 --> 01:29:15,428
Oh, I know we'd never make a go of it.

2642
01:29:15,429 --> 01:29:16,928
Well, judging by the
shouting match this morning,

2643
01:29:16,929 --> 01:29:18,720
I'd say there's every chance.

2644
01:29:18,721 --> 01:29:19,721
No sugar.

2645
01:29:20,429 --> 01:29:21,928
I'm sorry.

2646
01:29:21,929 --> 01:29:24,089
I'll have another bit of crumpet.

2647
01:29:24,493 --> 01:29:27,553
You know, this has been
a bit of a facer for me.

2648
01:29:27,554 --> 01:29:29,511
It's the first time Laura's
ever walked out on me,

2649
01:29:29,512 --> 01:29:30,678
and I don't like it.

2650
01:29:30,679 --> 01:29:32,011
I wouldn't tell her this for the world,

2651
01:29:32,012 --> 01:29:33,970
but every time we've
been separated before,

2652
01:29:33,971 --> 01:29:35,636
life has been quite unbearable.

2653
01:29:35,637 --> 01:29:37,095
You really are in
love with her, old boy.

2654
01:29:37,096 --> 01:29:38,054
Of course I am!

2655
01:29:38,055 --> 01:29:41,470
She's down-to-earth and
honest and practical.

2656
01:29:41,471 --> 01:29:42,720
She's good fun.

2657
01:29:42,721 --> 01:29:44,178
She's highly decorative.

2658
01:29:44,179 --> 01:29:45,303
She's good to have around the house.

2659
01:29:45,304 --> 01:29:46,304
She's...

2660
01:29:47,221 --> 01:29:48,601
Well, she's my sort.

2661
01:29:49,086 --> 01:29:52,386
There's just one thing I
forgot to tell you, Simon.

2662
01:29:52,387 --> 01:29:54,886
She phoned me up on Friday morning

2663
01:29:54,887 --> 01:29:57,947
to say she didn't agree
to your being run over.

2664
01:30:06,679 --> 01:30:08,345
No hard feelings, eh?

2665
01:30:08,346 --> 01:30:09,929
No hard feelings.

2666
01:30:12,346 --> 01:30:13,845
David!

2667
01:30:13,846 --> 01:30:14,846
Oh!

2668
01:30:15,971 --> 01:30:16,971
Simon!

2669
01:30:19,054 --> 01:30:20,261
Simon!

2670
01:30:20,262 --> 01:30:21,636
Laura!

2671
01:30:21,637 --> 01:30:22,804
Oh, darling.

2672
01:30:27,221 --> 01:30:28,221
Okay, cut.

- No, I don't.
- Yes, you do.

of this youthful season,

these buttons wrong.

See? We're mates.
We communicate.

59
00:09:56,513 --> 00:09:59,265
Macho male bonding.
How come it didn't work for me?

60
00:09:59,390 --> 00:10:01,768
- Well, you don't care about electronics.
- Yes, I do.

61
00:10:01,893 --> 00:10:05,271
Women don't care about electronics.
That's why god created man.

62
00:10:05,396 --> 00:10:08,399
God created man
to fill the void of the phallic smartass.

you do to perfection.

Sondra, please do me a favor.

68
00:10:20,787 --> 00:10:22,956
Don't call him hal.

69
00:10:23,081 --> 00:10:24,290
Does he take offense?

70
00:10:24,999 --> 00:10:26,584
Not always, but when he does,

71
00:10:26,709 --> 00:10:29,254
he'll either shut down
or completely reset himself.

72
00:10:29,379 --> 00:10:31,422
And then you'll be in trouble.

73
00:10:32,340 --> 00:10:33,424
Typical male behavior.

74
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:37,470
Alright, after the password,
do I hit enter?

75
00:10:37,595 --> 00:10:39,514
No, hit the code.

76
00:10:39,639 --> 00:10:41,224

""Insanity"".

87
00:11:52,837 --> 00:11:55,048
Now listen, sondra.

88
00:11:56,841 --> 00:11:58,801
This is not a PlayStation.

89

This is a sophisticated computer
that controls and automates the house, ok?

Mm. I thought it was the beginning
of a beautiful relationship.

91
00:12:07,268 --> 00:12:11,898
You just treat hal with a bit of respect,
and he'll keep you safe.

92
00:12:12,023 --> 00:12:15,902
Yeah, and utterly lonely in this cold,
scary abortion of a house.

93
00:12:16,027 --> 00:12:17,403
Oh, thank you.

female like you...

96
00:12:23,409 --> 00:12:25,870
It's a compliment, ok?

97
00:12:25,995 --> 00:12:27,622
What can I say?

98
00:12:27,747 --> 00:12:29,707
I'm a sucker for the human touch.

99
00:12:31,459 --> 00:12:33,711
Oh, my sister's staying over tonight.

100
00:12:33,836 --> 00:12:35,672
Good.

101
00:12:35,797 --> 00:12:38,758

about leaving you all by yourself.

The life of a celebrated architect.

103
00:12:42,512 --> 00:12:44,597
I hate weekends.

104
00:12:49,936 --> 00:12:53,398
Hate to break it up, lovebirds, but
technically, we've already missed the plane.

105
00:12:54,148 --> 00:12:55,817
Ok.

106
00:12:55,942 --> 00:12:58,027
So, remember what the doctor said?

107
00:12:58,152 --> 00:13:00,446
No crutches, no standing whatsoever.

108
00:13:00,571 --> 00:13:02,907
I've got crutches.
I can stand if I want to.

109
00:13:03,032 --> 00:13:04,659
You are so stubborn.

110
00:13:04,784 --> 00:13:07,203
And hardheaded. And opinionated.

111
00:13:07,328 --> 00:13:09,038

- And what else?

112
00:13:09,163 --> 00:13:10,832

- Ok.

115
00:13:28,224 --> 00:13:29,976
Ah, yes.

116
00:13:30,101 --> 00:13:31,602
Thank you, francois.

117
00:13:31,728 --> 00:13:32,895
See you tomorrow?

118
00:13:33,021 --> 00:13:34,439
Alright.

119
00:13:42,697 --> 00:13:44,532
How do I do this?

120
00:14:02,175 --> 00:14:04,385
Yeah... you two behave.

121
00:14:05,511 --> 00:14:08,639
A pretty secretary's never good news.

122
00:14:09,682 --> 00:14:10,975
Alright.

- 'Hi, lover. Where've you been?'
- Shit, I knew it.

163
00:16:10,803 --> 00:16:12,513
I knew he was playing around.

164

00:16:58,476 --> 00:17:01,312
'Leave her alone.'

How'd you do that?'

'Still want to yell?'

193
00:18:00,746 --> 00:18:02,540
that was a lesson, loverboy.

194
00:18:02,665 --> 00:18:04,875
Take it and avoid the next level.

195
00:18:05,501 --> 00:18:07,420
Apologize and leave.

196
00:18:09,630 --> 00:18:11,465
'This isn't you're room, jerk.'

197
00:18:11,591 --> 00:18:13,259
every room is mine.

198
00:18:13,801 --> 00:18:15,886
I am master of the game.

199
00:18:22,351 --> 00:18:25,062
'Then go to hell
where you belong.'

200
00:18:25,187 --> 00:18:27,565
'I am in hell, pal.

00:18:27,690 --> 00:18:33,195
'As a matter of fact, for simplistic
cretins like you, I am hell.'

202
00:18:33,321 --> 00:18:34,864
yeah, sure.

203
00:18:38,409 --> 00:18:40,411
Oh, Jesus.

- Hey.
- Hey.

214
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:24,664
What's up?

215
00:19:24,789 --> 00:19:27,708
Nothing. I'm being flamed
by an online psycho.

216
00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:31,671
Jesus, you really pissed him off.

217
00:19:32,296 --> 00:19:34,256
- Fighting again?
- I wasn't fighting.

218
00:19:34,382 --> 00:19:37,802
I was just chatting when he slithered in
like some snake from hell.

219
00:19:38,678 --> 00:19:40,596
Thank god I'm just a screen name.

220
00:19:41,931 --> 00:19:44,517
You're pretending to be loverboy.

221
00:19:44,642 --> 00:19:47,937
So, what's next, check into
a virtual hotel and have cyber-sex?

222
00:19:48,062 --> 00:19:49,063
Yeah, right.

223
00:19:54,276 --> 00:19:55,861
So, who is this werther?

224
00:19:55,986 --> 00:19:58,698
Some zit-popping freak hacker.

225
00:20:00,908 --> 00:20:02,910
A kid with a goethe screen name.

226
00:20:03,035 --> 00:20:04,161
Goethe?

227
00:20:04,286 --> 00:20:07,164
You know,
Johann Wolfgang Von goethe?

228
00:20:07,289 --> 00:20:09,417
The German master of literature.
Wrote faust.

229
00:20:09,542 --> 00:20:10,960
Wanna play?

230
00:20:11,627 --> 00:20:12,628
Not really.

231
00:20:12,753 --> 00:20:15,423
Let's whip his little educated ass.
Come on.

232
00:20:16,257 --> 00:20:17,550
Hey, werther.

233
00:20:18,342 --> 00:20:20,636
My friend here says you're afraid of women.
Is that true?

234
00:20:22,304 --> 00:20:23,597
Are you sexophobic?

235
00:20:40,948 --> 00:20:43,951
You both die!

236
00:20:44,076 --> 00:20:47,204
'You both die.'

237
00:20:51,667 --> 00:20:54,754
this guy.
He's getting too creepy for me.

238
00:20:54,879 --> 00:20:57,173
- Yeah, that's enough. Turn this thing off.
- Jerk!

239
00:20:57,298 --> 00:20:59,218
Hey, hey, hey.
You're my nurse, you're my sister,

240
00:20:59,341 --> 00:21:00,718
you're not my chaperone, ok?

241
00:21:00,843 --> 00:21:02,683
- Well, turn it off.
- Nurse misty, by the way,

242
00:21:02,762 --> 00:21:05,139
I really have to go to the bathroom.
My bladder's exploding.

243
00:21:05,264 --> 00:21:06,807
- Ok, here.
- Please.

244
00:21:07,808 --> 00:21:10,853
Ok, after the bathroom,
we're doing something else.

245
00:21:10,978 --> 00:21:12,738
Don't you think
you're a little old for this?

246
00:21:40,049 --> 00:21:41,926
How very convenient.

247
00:21:43,135 --> 00:21:46,597
Two birds, one stone.

248

""Your proposal to go private

He's using Ben's screen name
to get creme brulée into a private room.

265
00:22:55,875 --> 00:22:57,293
So, he's just a kid.

266
00:22:58,127 --> 00:22:59,128

what he's doing with creme brulée.

284
00:24:13,494 --> 00:24:14,894
Having dessert.
Turn it off.

285
00:25:12,886 --> 00:25:14,388
God!

286
00:25:17,558 --> 00:25:20,060
'Game on!'

00:25:20,185 --> 00:25:21,311
jerk.

288
00:25:21,437 --> 00:25:23,355
Good. This isn't our business.

289
00:25:24,606 --> 00:25:25,733
What about that girl?

290
00:25:25,858 --> 00:25:29,069
I mean, what if that sicko
asks her out as loverboy?

291
00:25:29,194 --> 00:25:31,196
Who's gonna go out with him?
He's mental case.

'Connection
has been terminated, Ben.'

293
00:25:33,282 --> 00:25:35,868
she chatted with Ben.
What if she trusts him?

294
00:25:37,369 --> 00:25:38,537
Jesus!

295
00:25:40,247 --> 00:25:42,750
Shouldn't we report this to the service?

296
00:25:42,875 --> 00:25:44,710
And admit you've been using
Ben's screen name?

297
00:25:44,835 --> 00:25:47,546
What if he finds out?
What if they cancel it? He'll kill you.

298
00:25:47,671 --> 00:25:49,923
I guess nothing serious
can happen, right?

299
00:25:57,431 --> 00:25:59,933
Are you totally out of your mind?

300
00:26:00,059 --> 00:26:04,313
You're drop-dead gorgeous
and use the Internet to land a guy?

301
00:26:04,438 --> 00:26:07,107
Internet, sky bar,
it's all the same.

302
00:26:07,232 --> 00:26:09,443
As long as the people you're meeting
are interesting.

303
00:26:09,568 --> 00:26:10,903
And this one is.

304
00:26:11,028 --> 00:26:13,113
What if he's also a psycho?

305
00:26:13,238 --> 00:26:14,865
Oh, please, Sarah.

306
00:26:14,990 --> 00:26:16,909
I mean,
he's told me all about himself.

307
00:26:17,034 --> 00:26:19,453
- He's in his thirties...
- Mm-hmm?

308
00:26:19,578 --> 00:26:21,330
And an architect.

309
00:26:21,455 --> 00:26:23,707
And very rich.

310
00:26:24,958 --> 00:26:26,710
Sounds impressive.

311
00:26:26,835 --> 00:26:29,004
This one's mine, sweetie.

312
00:26:30,923 --> 00:26:33,217
So, my place or his?
What do you say?

313
00:26:34,218 --> 00:26:37,513
- I say the lesser of two evils.
- Ok, mine.

314
00:26:39,681 --> 00:26:41,308
Since it'll make you feel better.

315
00:26:48,816 --> 00:26:50,734
Now go.
I don't need competition.

316
00:26:52,402 --> 00:26:55,072
- Be good.
- Wouldn't count on it.

317
00:26:55,197 --> 00:26:57,199
Then be careful.

318
00:26:57,324 --> 00:27:00,410
Hey, I didn't spend all that money
on self-defense for nothing.

319
00:27:00,536 --> 00:27:03,997
If something bad happens,
just notify my next of kin.

320
00:27:04,123 --> 00:27:06,750
That's cute, Lynn. Very cute.

321
00:27:06,875 --> 00:27:09,378
Just call me and let me know
that everything's ok.

322
00:27:09,503 --> 00:27:10,796
Get out of here.

323
00:27:10,921 --> 00:27:13,173
I'm out. Bye, Arthur.

324
00:27:22,516 --> 00:27:25,269
The town itself is disagreeable.

325
00:27:27,229 --> 00:27:29,106
But on the other hand,

326
00:27:29,231 --> 00:27:34,403
there is a natural,
inexpressible beauty all around.

327
00:29:00,530 --> 00:29:03,450
'You are now connected
to American love online.'

328
00:29:14,336 --> 00:29:16,255
'Hey, Ben.

329
00:29:16,380 --> 00:29:17,756
'You there?

330
00:29:25,180 --> 00:29:27,641
'Too bad you're not watching

331
00:29:27,766 --> 00:29:30,602
'because I'm about to kill your girl.'

332
00:30:15,314 --> 00:30:17,274
Look at him.
Probably a major asshole.

333
00:30:17,399 --> 00:30:18,400
Yeah.

334
00:31:15,749 --> 00:31:17,834
'...At the hospital for sick children.

- Hello?
- The garden is a simple one.

342
00:32:18,353 --> 00:32:19,521
When the moment one enters,

343
00:32:19,646 --> 00:32:24,526
one feels that it was designed,
not by some scientific gardener,

344
00:32:24,651 --> 00:32:27,863
'but by a feeling heart
intending to take pleasure here.'

345
00:32:27,988 --> 00:32:30,073
yeah, that's very romantic,
but where are you?

346
00:32:30,198 --> 00:32:31,741
Watching you.

347
00:32:34,536 --> 00:32:36,413
Come on, Ben. You're scaring me.

348
00:32:36,538 --> 00:32:38,331
I'm just kidding.

349
00:32:38,457 --> 00:32:41,918
Um, something came up,
and I won't be able to make it.

350
00:32:42,043 --> 00:32:43,170
Not tonight, at least.

351
00:32:43,295 --> 00:32:45,338
'Sorry if I let you down.

352
00:32:45,464 --> 00:32:47,424
'I promise I'll make it
up to you next time.'

353
00:32:48,383 --> 00:32:50,361
well, I don't know
if there's going to be a next time.

354
00:32:50,385 --> 00:32:51,386
I'll call you.

355
00:32:52,304 --> 00:32:54,224
Wait a minute.
How did you get this phone number?

356
00:32:55,432 --> 00:32:58,977
Oh... the secrets we keep.

357
00:33:00,353 --> 00:33:02,189
- I gotta go.
- You sound disappointed.

358
00:33:02,314 --> 00:33:04,816
I just learned a really valuable lesson.

359
00:33:04,941 --> 00:33:07,110
Never trust a man without a face.

360
00:33:22,250 --> 00:33:25,712
Chamomile tea
will make you sleep like a baby.

361
00:33:26,796 --> 00:33:28,965
Hey, will you pass me those pills
off the counter?

362
00:33:33,762 --> 00:33:35,555
Killer meds, huh?

363
00:33:36,598 --> 00:33:38,892
- From zero to zs in thirty seconds.
- Can I have one?

364
00:33:39,017 --> 00:33:40,018
- No.
- Come on.

365
00:33:40,143 --> 00:33:41,978
No.

366
00:33:43,146 --> 00:33:45,398
- There you go. It's hot.
- Thanks.

367
00:33:49,611 --> 00:33:51,530
I'm tired.

368
00:33:51,655 --> 00:33:53,114
Yeah, it's time for bed.

369
00:33:59,746 --> 00:34:01,039
Careful.

370
00:34:01,164 --> 00:34:02,832
One, two.

371
00:34:09,005 --> 00:34:11,675
You're almost there.

372
00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:15,428
'Ooh, you have email.'

373
00:34:15,554 --> 00:34:18,682
- hey.
- 'Ooh, you have email.'

374
00:34:18,807 --> 00:34:20,868
come on, come on, come on.
I just want to see what's on the screen.

375
00:34:20,892 --> 00:34:22,310
- No, not again.
- Just one second.

376
00:34:22,435 --> 00:34:24,813
- Please?
- Just one second, come on.

377
00:34:27,649 --> 00:34:29,568
'Hey, Ben.

378
00:34:29,693 --> 00:34:31,611
- 'You there?'
- That freaks me out.

379
00:34:32,445 --> 00:34:35,490
- He's just playing games.
- No, he's not. He knows Ben's real name.

380
00:34:35,615 --> 00:34:37,867
'Too bad you're not watching

381
00:34:37,993 --> 00:34:40,704
'because I'm about to kill your girl.'

382
00:35:02,809 --> 00:35:04,561
Goodnight, drop-dead gorgeous.

383
00:35:38,470 --> 00:35:40,805
'Live from werther.'

384
00:36:00,533 --> 00:36:02,369
This can't be for real.

385
00:36:39,072 --> 00:36:41,116
He is paying creme brulée a visit.

386
00:36:42,158 --> 00:36:43,493
Save it.

387
00:36:44,577 --> 00:36:46,538
Come on, these things don't happen.
This is...

388
00:36:46,663 --> 00:36:48,707
Maybe he staged it.
Maybe it's a prank.

389
00:36:48,832 --> 00:36:50,500
His version of the Blair witch project.

390
00:36:55,505 --> 00:36:57,966
- It's 11:06.
- It's happening right now.

391
00:36:58,925 --> 00:37:00,927
He wired himself to the web
on a live feed.

392
00:37:01,803 --> 00:37:04,806
- Misty, he's gonna kill her.
- I'm calling 911.

393
00:37:05,724 --> 00:37:06,725
- Where is he?
- What?

394
00:37:06,850 --> 00:37:08,452
Where is he? Well, think about it.
Who is he?

395
00:37:08,476 --> 00:37:11,646
This is the Internet, misty.
It's not some little neighborhood.

396
00:37:11,771 --> 00:37:14,941
I mean, what are you gonna tell them,
that somewhere, in some city,

397
00:37:15,066 --> 00:37:17,110
an unknown man is killing
an unknown woman?

398
00:37:17,235 --> 00:37:20,447
- They're gonna laugh at you.
- Well, I can't just sit and watch this.

399
00:37:39,257 --> 00:37:41,801
Oh, god. Let this be a joke.

400
00:37:50,185 --> 00:37:51,978
Maybe he'll stop at that.

401
00:37:52,103 --> 00:37:54,355
Maybe he's just a copy cat
trying to scare us.

402
00:37:54,481 --> 00:37:55,815
He's doing a hell of a job.

403
00:39:02,882 --> 00:39:05,343
'Stand by for more.'

404
00:39:07,053 --> 00:39:08,471
shit!

405
00:39:09,639 --> 00:39:11,359
- I'm calling the police.
- I'm calling Ben.

406
00:39:11,933 --> 00:39:13,518
You call Ben,
then I'll call the police.

407
00:39:13,643 --> 00:39:15,353
Oh, my god.

408
00:39:15,478 --> 00:39:17,873
- This psycho's in town.
- What do you mean? How do you know that?

409
00:39:17,897 --> 00:39:20,942
- The chat room. It's only for Los Angeles.
- What?

410
00:39:21,734 --> 00:39:23,894
'The cellular subscriber you are calling

411
00:39:23,945 --> 00:39:26,030
'is temporarily
out of the service area.'

412
00:39:26,155 --> 00:39:28,032
- oh, god. Not now.
- 'Please try later.'

413
00:39:28,157 --> 00:39:29,909
shit, not now.

414
00:39:30,034 --> 00:39:32,120
- It's out of range.
- Well, the police aren't.

415
00:39:40,587 --> 00:39:42,547
'If you are trying to make a call,

416
00:39:42,672 --> 00:39:45,174
'please hang up and try again.'

Lynn.

418
00:40:05,320 --> 00:40:07,363
You look so much like lotte.

419
00:40:07,488 --> 00:40:09,407
Who's he talking about?
Who's lotte?

420
00:40:09,532 --> 00:40:11,993
Werther's eternal love.
He died for her.

421
00:40:24,339 --> 00:40:26,215
Oh, my god.

422
00:40:32,055 --> 00:40:34,265
Do women have hearts?

423
00:40:35,808 --> 00:40:37,268
What?

424
00:40:39,062 --> 00:40:41,689
What I was meaning to tell you,

425
00:40:41,814 --> 00:40:46,527
she has a great soul which gazes at one
straight through the blue eyes.

426
00:41:04,420 --> 00:41:07,131
The thunder was passing by.

427
00:41:07,256 --> 00:41:10,176
The wonderful rain
was falling on the land.

428
00:41:10,301 --> 00:41:14,806
Filling the air with
the most refreshing fragrance.

429
00:41:16,849 --> 00:41:18,810
Oh, my god! What is this?

430
00:41:18,935 --> 00:41:23,773
'If you only had seen
the adoration in those eyes.

431
00:41:24,482 --> 00:41:27,485
'Yes, women do have hearts.'

432
00:41:27,610 --> 00:41:31,572
my heart's immense and ardent feeling
for living nature...

433
00:41:33,700 --> 00:41:36,285
Which ovennhelmed me
with so great a joy

434
00:41:36,411 --> 00:41:39,414
and made the world about me
a very paradise...

435
00:41:40,873 --> 00:41:43,126
Has now become
an unbearable torment.

436
00:41:44,961 --> 00:41:50,800
A demon that goes with me everywhere,
torturing me.

437
00:42:04,939 --> 00:42:06,459
'Hello, stranger.

438
00:42:06,524 --> 00:42:08,943
'Tell me your name,
and I may pick up the phone.

but I do.

you're not picking up. I...

your place or something.

'If I don't hear from you soon,
I'm gonna come by the house.'

447
00:42:27,879 --> 00:42:30,339
no, officer.
Nothing happened to us.

448
00:42:30,465 --> 00:42:34,385
Just listen to me.
Some guy killed a girl in plain view.

449
00:42:34,510 --> 00:42:35,970
'Whose view, ma'am?'

450
00:42:36,095 --> 00:42:37,638
ours, dammit.

451
00:42:37,764 --> 00:42:40,808
'You witnessed a murder? Where?

452
00:42:40,933 --> 00:42:43,895
Well, I don't know exactly.
Somewhere in la.

453
00:42:44,020 --> 00:42:46,022
It was on the Internet.

454
00:42:46,147 --> 00:42:47,440
'I see.

455
00:42:47,565 --> 00:42:51,194
'And you're not under the influence
of an intoxicating substance, eh?'

456
00:42:51,319 --> 00:42:53,237
no, I am not.

457
00:42:53,362 --> 00:42:57,617
Some freak webcasted his crime
and we've saved the file.

458
00:42:57,742 --> 00:43:00,995
'Ma'am, I'm sure you did,
but it might have been a prank.

460
00:43:03,206 --> 00:43:06,000
'I'll give you the number of someone
who might be able to help you.'

461
00:43:06,125 --> 00:43:07,210
who, a shrink?

462
00:43:07,335 --> 00:43:09,295
'No, he's with the FBI.'

463
00:43:09,420 --> 00:43:10,880
hold on.

464
00:43:12,465 --> 00:43:14,342
Ok, what's the number?

465
00:43:14,467 --> 00:43:17,470
'Call 555-2211.'

466
00:43:18,554 --> 00:43:21,307
- thank you.
- 'Welcome.'

467
00:43:21,432 --> 00:43:23,184
I told you.

468
00:43:23,309 --> 00:43:26,187
- I hate it when you say that.
- Well, they didn't believe us.

469
00:43:26,312 --> 00:43:28,940
- No one will believe us.
- Look, I know what I saw.

470
00:43:29,065 --> 00:43:31,484
And we have it on the hard drive.

471
00:43:31,609 --> 00:43:33,402
Hey, come here.

472
00:43:33,528 --> 00:43:35,321
It's gonna be ok.

473
00:43:39,033 --> 00:43:41,994
'You have reached
a voicemail automatic system.

474
00:43:42,120 --> 00:43:44,872
'Please leave your message
at the tone.'

475
00:45:26,641 --> 00:45:28,184
Calm down, misty. He'll call.

476
00:45:38,736 --> 00:45:41,155
- Told you.
- Would you stop saying that?

477
00:45:42,949 --> 00:45:45,201
- Hello?
- Yeah, hello, this is special agent Matheson

478
00:45:45,326 --> 00:45:46,966
with the Federal Bureau of Investigation.

479
00:45:47,787 --> 00:45:49,664
Thank god you called.

480
00:46:02,176 --> 00:46:05,136
Ok. If you just click ""send"", I should
get everything from your hard drive.

481
00:46:05,972 --> 00:46:07,265
Got it.

482
00:46:07,765 --> 00:46:09,684
'Uploading information.

483
00:46:16,315 --> 00:46:17,858
'System error.'

484
00:46:22,571 --> 00:46:24,699
what's this?

485
00:46:25,992 --> 00:46:27,952
Uh, ma'am, do you see
what you're uploading?

486
00:46:28,077 --> 00:46:29,662
Yes, unfortunately.

487
00:46:29,787 --> 00:46:31,414
And this isn't a joke, is it?

488
00:46:31,539 --> 00:46:34,667
No, but somehow everything I save
turns out like a cartoon.

489
00:46:34,792 --> 00:46:35,792
'Yeah, not unusual.'

490
00:46:35,876 --> 00:46:37,962
if the guy you suspect
wants to hide the evidence,

491
00:46:38,087 --> 00:46:40,848
- he may have encrypted the material.
- ""Encrypted""? What do you mean?

492
00:46:41,507 --> 00:46:44,176
Well, encryption's a way to keep material
from being re-transmitted

493
00:46:44,302 --> 00:46:45,803
or read by an unauthorized person.

494
00:46:46,512 --> 00:46:50,057
Encryption is a way to keep material
from being re-transmitted.

495
00:46:50,599 --> 00:46:51,959
You know, you need an access code.

496
00:46:52,018 --> 00:46:53,436
Can you break the code?

497
00:46:53,561 --> 00:46:55,998
'Well frankly, we have a big back load
of de-encryption tasks.

498
00:46:56,022 --> 00:46:59,942
'With no proven crime,
it could take weeks to get to your case.'

499
00:47:00,067 --> 00:47:03,067
I'll tell you what. A skilled technician
might be able to take a look at it.

500
00:47:03,154 --> 00:47:06,034
Might even be able to crack it.
Certainly would make my job a lot easier.

501
00:47:10,953 --> 00:47:12,538
I knew it.

502
00:47:12,663 --> 00:47:14,415
You had to have voice software.

503
00:47:15,583 --> 00:47:17,460
Thank you.

504
00:47:17,585 --> 00:47:20,463
Now, let's see who's on the other end.

505
00:47:41,984 --> 00:47:45,071
He said if we find our own tech,
we'd actually stand a better chance

506
00:47:45,196 --> 00:47:47,448
of getting our file de-encrypted here.

507
00:47:48,449 --> 00:47:50,826
There's 66 in la alone.

508
00:47:50,951 --> 00:47:52,703
Just pick a cute one.

509
00:47:52,828 --> 00:47:55,873
Hackers aren't cute.
They're nerds.

510
00:47:55,998 --> 00:47:58,918
Then find a nerd with insomnia.
It's late.

511
00:48:13,099 --> 00:48:14,725
Try this.

512
00:48:21,690 --> 00:48:23,710
- 'Thanks for calling...'
- Answering machine.

513
00:48:23,734 --> 00:48:24,819
Well, leave a message.

514
00:48:25,361 --> 00:48:27,905
And say what?
""Two damsels in distress need a hacker""?

515
00:48:28,447 --> 00:48:29,615
""Hard drive preferred.""

516
00:48:29,740 --> 00:48:31,283
No innuendos.

517
00:48:31,951 --> 00:48:36,872
Hello? Uh, hi,
we're having problems with our PC

518
00:48:36,997 --> 00:48:39,667
and if you could possibly come tonight,
that would be great.

519
00:48:39,792 --> 00:48:43,671
Give us a call at 555-1087.

520
00:48:43,796 --> 00:48:45,047
Thanks.

521
00:48:46,549 --> 00:48:48,050
Didn't mention the hard drive.
Happy?

522
00:48:48,843 --> 00:48:49,927
Thrilled.

523
00:48:52,096 --> 00:48:53,806
Now... we wait.

524
00:49:35,514 --> 00:49:39,477
She looked to the heavens and at me.

525
00:49:47,151 --> 00:49:48,486
Brace yourself.

526
00:49:48,611 --> 00:49:50,446
It's going to be a long night.

527
00:49:51,197 --> 00:49:53,657
And all because I've been stupid.

528
00:49:53,782 --> 00:49:56,202
Well, that's your dumb blonde gene.

529
00:49:56,702 --> 00:49:58,078
Look who's talking.

530
00:50:02,166 --> 00:50:03,709
Here.

531
00:50:05,503 --> 00:50:09,465
- Hello?
- 'Is this 555-0187?'

532
00:50:09,590 --> 00:50:12,343
- who's this?
- 'You called PC brainiacs?'

533
00:50:12,468 --> 00:50:14,345
oh, yeah. Uh...

534
00:50:14,470 --> 00:50:17,223
Thank you for calling me.
Are you still awake?

535
00:50:17,348 --> 00:50:19,558
'I am now. What's the problem?'

536
00:50:19,683 --> 00:50:21,435
well, my hard disk,
I need to copy it.

537
00:50:21,560 --> 00:50:24,104
'Sure, no sweat.
Tomorrow after five good for you?'

538
00:50:24,230 --> 00:50:26,732
no. Actually,
it is an emergency.

539
00:50:26,857 --> 00:50:29,109
I was hoping you could
still make it tonight.

540
00:50:29,235 --> 00:50:32,279
'Ok, but it'll be 95 an hour.
Two hours minimum.'

541
00:50:32,404 --> 00:50:33,906
yeah, that's fine.

542
00:50:34,031 --> 00:50:36,325
Uh, I'll give you my address
and directions.

543
00:50:57,972 --> 00:51:00,266
- Is that him?
- I think so.

544
00:51:01,725 --> 00:51:04,019
- Yes?
- 'PC brainiacs.'

545
00:51:06,230 --> 00:51:08,148
just about time.

546
00:51:26,041 --> 00:51:27,918
That's very bram stoker.

547
00:51:30,004 --> 00:51:31,964
Be nice. He's doing us a favor.

548
00:51:32,089 --> 00:51:33,882
Yeah, for 95 an hour.

549
00:51:34,008 --> 00:51:35,384
Be nice.

550
00:51:37,219 --> 00:51:38,596
Go get him, tiger.

551
00:51:40,097 --> 00:51:41,599
You go get him.

552
00:51:42,683 --> 00:51:44,685
- We'll both go get him.
- Ok.

553
00:52:13,255 --> 00:52:14,757
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

554
00:52:15,591 --> 00:52:16,800
- Sorry.
- It's ok, it's ok.

555
00:52:16,925 --> 00:52:18,052
Are you gonna open the door?

556
00:52:19,511 --> 00:52:20,554
I'm not sure.

557
00:52:20,679 --> 00:52:22,598
Jesus.

558
00:52:24,391 --> 00:52:26,310
- Hello?
- 'hi, sorry to call so late,

559
00:52:26,435 --> 00:52:28,020
'but you said it was urgent.'

560
00:52:28,145 --> 00:52:30,731
- I did?
- 'Somebody from this number did.

561
00:52:31,398 --> 00:52:33,359
'You called PC brainiacs?'

562
00:52:33,484 --> 00:52:35,611
oh, yeah, that's right.
Your guy's already here.

563
00:52:35,736 --> 00:52:38,322
- 'My guy?'
- Your tech, he just arrived.

564
00:52:38,447 --> 00:52:42,034
'Lady, there's only one tech
working for PC brainiacs, and that's me.

565
00:52:42,159 --> 00:52:44,703
'And right now I happen to be
on sunset and teague.'

566
00:52:44,828 --> 00:52:47,539
hey, lady. Come on.
It's cold out here.

567
00:52:47,665 --> 00:52:50,209
Well, if you are who you say you are,
then who is he?

568
00:52:50,334 --> 00:52:52,378
'Beats me.
You call another company?'

569
00:52:52,503 --> 00:52:54,129
no, I didn't. I called you.

570
00:52:54,254 --> 00:52:58,467
'Then this guy hacked information from me,
or you, or both of us.'

571
00:52:59,176 --> 00:53:00,803
alright, well, um...

572
00:53:02,429 --> 00:53:04,515
I'll deal with him.
Just come as soon as you can.

573
00:53:04,640 --> 00:53:05,933
'Ok.'

574
00:53:06,058 --> 00:53:07,559
that's not the real guy.

575
00:53:09,103 --> 00:53:10,437
Couldn't be.

576
00:53:10,562 --> 00:53:13,148
He hacked our computers,
he lured a girl to her death,

577
00:53:13,273 --> 00:53:16,318
and he broadcasted the whole thing.
Why wouldn't he tap a phone?

578
00:53:20,030 --> 00:53:22,616
Thank you, uh...
We figured out the problem.

579
00:53:23,242 --> 00:53:25,244
- You can go home.
- What?

580
00:53:26,245 --> 00:53:28,163
Leave the premises
or I'm calling the cops!

581
00:53:28,288 --> 00:53:30,088
I just drove all over hell
to find this place.

582
00:53:30,165 --> 00:53:31,917
- Thank you.
- To hell with this.

583
00:53:32,459 --> 00:53:34,837
Just leave! Please.

584
00:53:35,671 --> 00:53:37,214
You women are crazy.

585
00:53:38,841 --> 00:53:40,759
You're gonna pay for this.

586
00:53:45,848 --> 00:53:47,015
He's leaving.

587
00:53:52,020 --> 00:53:53,439
Zoom in on his plates.

588
00:54:01,530 --> 00:54:03,866
Ok, 3-h-7-6-8-x-8.

589
00:54:05,617 --> 00:54:07,202
- X-8.
- X-8. Got him.

590
00:54:07,327 --> 00:54:09,246
- Ok.
- Alright, call Matheson.

591
00:54:22,843 --> 00:54:25,763
- Yello.
- 'Agent Matheson? Glad you're still there.'

592
00:54:25,888 --> 00:54:27,973
'Yeah, here till seven.
What do you got?'

593
00:54:28,098 --> 00:54:30,058
'I'm not sure.
I think our guy was here.'

594
00:54:30,809 --> 00:54:32,644
in the house? How?

595
00:54:32,770 --> 00:54:34,688
'I called a computer place
to copy my hard disk,

596
00:54:34,813 --> 00:54:38,442
'somehow he intercepted the call
and showed up impersonating a tech.

597
00:54:38,567 --> 00:54:40,819
'I managed to throw him out
and get his license.'

598
00:54:40,944 --> 00:54:42,321
'Good, give it to me.'

599
00:54:42,446 --> 00:54:45,741
'3-h-7-6-8-x-8.'

600
00:54:45,866 --> 00:54:48,160
right, look.
If anything else comes up, call me.

601
00:54:58,337 --> 00:55:01,381
- It doesn't make sense.
- Yeah, but the truth is out there.

602
00:55:03,008 --> 00:55:06,178
Spare me the Scully shit,
will you, Martha? And sit down.

603
00:55:08,722 --> 00:55:10,516
Want a sugar rush, Matheson?

604
00:55:12,059 --> 00:55:14,603
Alright, you're the hotshot around here.
I got one for ya.

605
00:55:16,897 --> 00:55:19,977
I got a woman calls me in the middle
of the night says she witnessed a murder.

606
00:55:21,193 --> 00:55:23,195
- On the Internet.
- Ok.

607
00:55:23,320 --> 00:55:25,823
What do you mean, ""ok""?
It doesn't sound like a prank to you?

608
00:55:25,948 --> 00:55:27,282
Yeah, it could be,

609
00:55:27,407 --> 00:55:29,910
but the Internet's a strange place.
Anything can happen.

610
00:55:30,035 --> 00:55:33,223
I mean, the boys in the basement believe
there exists this underbelly of the web.

611
00:55:33,247 --> 00:55:35,749
Yeah, like child porn, pedophilia.
That shit, right?

612
00:55:35,874 --> 00:55:38,418
Goes much deeper.
I'm talking snuff...

613
00:55:38,544 --> 00:55:41,129
Contracting a hit,
voodoo and satanic ritual stuff.

614
00:55:41,255 --> 00:55:42,714
You know, the bowels of the beast.

615
00:55:42,840 --> 00:55:45,360
So, your woman gets her connections
crossed, witnesses a murder.

616
00:55:45,926 --> 00:55:47,926
With computers, anything's possible.
You know that.

617
00:55:50,222 --> 00:55:52,891
You know, sometimes
I think fuck computers.

618
00:55:53,016 --> 00:55:54,096
It ain't like the old days.

619
00:55:54,184 --> 00:55:56,687
You know what the Internet is
to guys like me?

620
00:55:56,812 --> 00:55:58,689
It's a house of fucking mirrors.

621
00:55:58,814 --> 00:56:01,775
Computers haven't made my life
any fucking easier, I'll tell you that.

622
00:56:01,900 --> 00:56:04,069
You like fuck words, you know that?

623
00:56:04,194 --> 00:56:06,506
- Must come with age, huh?
- Yeah, with age comes experience.

624
00:56:06,530 --> 00:56:08,490
- Promises, promises.
- Watch it.

625
00:56:08,615 --> 00:56:11,034
I could report you for sexual harassment.

626
00:56:12,160 --> 00:56:15,581
- 'Hello, this is research.'
- Hello, Julie? Yeah, Matheson.

627
00:56:15,706 --> 00:56:18,458
Listen, do me a favor
and check these plates.

628
00:56:23,422 --> 00:56:25,757
'Accessing mainframe security.'

629
00:56:47,946 --> 00:56:50,490
Hey, can some nut track her down
and find out where she lives?

630
00:56:51,074 --> 00:56:52,951
Any 14-year-old hacker could do that.

631
00:56:54,494 --> 00:56:56,330
Am I taking this too lightly?

632
00:56:57,497 --> 00:57:00,059
Maybe I should send a couple guys
over there and make sure she's ok.

633
00:57:00,083 --> 00:57:03,211
A woman in distress,
and you're still sitting here debating it?

634
00:57:03,337 --> 00:57:04,963
Derek, that just doesn't sound like you.

635
00:57:06,965 --> 00:57:09,301
- It still doesn't make sense.
- What needs to make sense?

636
00:57:09,426 --> 00:57:10,802
Come on, let's get some action.

637
00:57:13,138 --> 00:57:15,182
No, not yet.

638
00:57:21,480 --> 00:57:24,816
Ugh, jeez,
I'll never get used to this house.

639
00:57:31,657 --> 00:57:35,661
Ooh, another gothic entrance.

640
00:57:38,705 --> 00:57:40,082
Check his ID.

641
00:57:41,959 --> 00:57:43,460
You got ID?

642
00:57:43,585 --> 00:57:45,128
'Yes, ma'am. I do.'

643
00:57:53,679 --> 00:57:55,389
'Gate opening.

644
00:58:01,770 --> 00:58:03,397
'Closing gate.'

645
00:58:08,068 --> 00:58:10,862
he better be cute.

646
00:58:10,988 --> 00:58:12,906
Better be.

647
00:58:23,917 --> 00:58:24,960
'Door opening.'

648
00:58:26,336 --> 00:58:27,462
- come on in.
- Thanks.

649
00:58:27,587 --> 00:58:28,714
'Authorized visitor.'

650
00:58:28,839 --> 00:58:31,258
- ooh, it's cold out there.
- Yeah.

651
00:58:31,383 --> 00:58:34,219
I'm sorry that we had to get you out here
in the middle of the night.

652
00:58:34,344 --> 00:58:35,721
I'm misty by the way.

653
00:58:35,846 --> 00:58:36,990
Albert.

654
00:58:37,014 --> 00:58:38,348
Oh, I hate that.

655
00:58:38,473 --> 00:58:39,641
- Static.
- Yeah.

656
00:58:39,766 --> 00:58:41,685
There's gonna be a storm.

657
00:58:41,810 --> 00:58:43,520
Looks like it.

658
00:58:43,645 --> 00:58:45,313
Come on,
I'll show you the computer.

659
00:58:45,439 --> 00:58:46,481
Thanks.

660
00:58:52,070 --> 00:58:54,406
This way.

661
00:58:56,450 --> 00:58:57,951
- Right around here.
- Thank you.

662
00:58:58,076 --> 00:58:59,327
Sondra, Albert's here.

663
00:58:59,453 --> 00:59:01,913
- Hi.
- Hi, we spoke on the phone.

664
00:59:02,039 --> 00:59:04,124
Yeah. Thanks for coming
with such short notice.

665
00:59:04,249 --> 00:59:05,667
Oh, no problem.

666
00:59:05,792 --> 00:59:08,392
It's twice the regular rate,
so I should probably be thanking you.

667
00:59:08,879 --> 00:59:10,922
- Uh, may I?
- Yeah, please.

668
00:59:12,424 --> 00:59:13,884
Just turn around.

669
00:59:21,892 --> 00:59:23,977
So, what exactly am I looking for?

670
00:59:25,145 --> 00:59:27,689
- A murder.
- A murder.

671
00:59:27,814 --> 00:59:29,191
Fine.

672
00:59:30,484 --> 00:59:32,694
- Encrypted?
- Yeah, that's what they said.

673
01:00:05,894 --> 01:00:07,979
You got it, you genius.

674
01:00:52,190 --> 01:00:53,733
Lynn!

675
01:00:55,986 --> 01:00:57,737
Lynn, it's me!

676
01:01:03,410 --> 01:01:04,828
Lynn?

677
01:01:19,217 --> 01:01:20,468
Lynn.

678
01:01:24,472 --> 01:01:25,891
Lynn?

679
01:01:33,190 --> 01:01:34,691
Would you like some coffee?

680
01:01:35,275 --> 01:01:37,736
Uh... wind and rain have passed.

681
01:01:37,861 --> 01:01:40,947
The hour of noon is clear
and the clouds are parting.

682
01:01:42,240 --> 01:01:45,202
Something I read.
It means, you may not need me anymore,

683
01:01:45,327 --> 01:01:47,996
but there's many lost souls
out there needing my help.

684
01:01:48,121 --> 01:01:50,749
- And I have to make a living.
- I understand.

685
01:01:50,874 --> 01:01:52,959
I'm sorry you had to witness
such a thing.

686
01:01:53,084 --> 01:01:54,252
Yeah.

687
01:01:54,377 --> 01:01:57,380
- Real or not.
- Yeah.

688
01:01:57,505 --> 01:01:59,216
Well, how much do we owe you?

689
01:01:59,341 --> 01:02:01,218
I'd rather send an invoice.

690
01:02:01,343 --> 01:02:03,887
It looks as though
you've got the collateral.

691
01:02:05,096 --> 01:02:06,765
- Thank you.
- It was nice meeting you.

692
01:02:06,890 --> 01:02:08,892
- You too.
- Thanks.

693
01:02:09,517 --> 01:02:12,187
'Federal Bureau of Investigation.
How may I help you?'

694
01:02:13,521 --> 01:02:14,940
Derek?

695
01:02:15,065 --> 01:02:17,859
Called you earlier, no answer.
Here's the information that you wanted.

696
01:02:17,984 --> 01:02:20,195
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

697
01:02:24,491 --> 01:02:26,534
Alright. I'd better go
and lock up behind him.

698
01:02:30,080 --> 01:02:31,456
Yes.

699
01:02:47,806 --> 01:02:49,557
- Misty?
- Yeah?

700
01:02:49,683 --> 01:02:51,142
The gate's jammed again.

701
01:02:53,478 --> 01:02:54,646
What's the code?

702
01:02:54,771 --> 01:02:56,606
Uh, 1-5-1-9.

703
01:02:57,857 --> 01:02:59,776
1-5-1-9. Got it.

704
01:02:59,901 --> 01:03:01,403
'Door open.

705
01:03:04,239 --> 01:03:07,242
'Door closed.
Authorized visitor exits.'

706
01:03:11,830 --> 01:03:16,835
'Everything is so still around me
and so calm within my soul.'

707
01:03:23,174 --> 01:03:24,634
What the hell?

708
01:03:37,522 --> 01:03:39,649
- Hello?
- Sondra, it's agent Matheson.

709
01:03:40,608 --> 01:03:42,610
I don't know why,
but I'm glad to hear your voice.

710
01:03:44,029 --> 01:03:46,323
'Look, the license plate number
you gave me is legit.'

711
01:03:47,949 --> 01:03:49,951
it belongs to a Joe montero.

712
01:03:50,076 --> 01:03:51,494
Owner of PC brainiacs.

713
01:03:53,621 --> 01:03:56,624
'Five feet 10 inches tall,
185 pounds, dark hair.'

714
01:03:58,668 --> 01:04:00,795
what? But...
That's the guy we threw out.

715
01:04:00,920 --> 01:04:03,590
If he was the real montero,
then who's Albert?

716
01:04:03,715 --> 01:04:05,925
""Albert""?
Somebody else is there?

717
01:04:14,100 --> 01:04:15,101
Misty!

718
01:04:17,854 --> 01:04:19,314
Sondra?

719
01:04:19,439 --> 01:04:20,541
- 'Sondra, can you hear me?'
- Yeah.

720
01:04:20,565 --> 01:04:21,608
Sondra?

721
01:04:25,153 --> 01:04:26,237
Hello?

722
01:04:26,363 --> 01:04:29,574
'Well, lotte remained
in the darkness of obscure shadows.

723
01:04:30,533 --> 01:04:33,870
'I saw the silhouette of a woman
walking toward her destiny.'

724
01:04:34,621 --> 01:04:36,206
misty, get back into the house!

725
01:04:36,331 --> 01:04:38,917
'I'm sorry, Ben.
The intercom is mute.'

726
01:04:43,963 --> 01:04:46,591
'Strange, isn't it?

727
01:04:46,716 --> 01:04:50,136
'You're repulsed
yet riveted to the monitor.

728
01:04:50,762 --> 01:04:55,934
'Can't help but watch someone being killed
so long as it's not you.'

729
01:05:14,994 --> 01:05:16,287
Albert.

730
01:05:19,958 --> 01:05:21,334
The gate's jammed.

731
01:05:51,489 --> 01:05:54,367
Don't even draw a single breath.

732
01:05:55,243 --> 01:05:58,413
Because if you inhale, even slightly,

733
01:05:58,538 --> 01:06:01,416
cold steel will cut deeply
into yourjugular.

734
01:06:03,501 --> 01:06:04,544
'I'm sorry, Ben.

735
01:06:04,669 --> 01:06:06,004
'Aii phone lines out of order.'

736
01:06:08,381 --> 01:06:10,508
just talked to LAPD.
Look what they got.

737
01:06:12,385 --> 01:06:14,637
Right, this is for real.
Get an address.

738
01:06:14,762 --> 01:06:16,097
And I want police backup.

739
01:06:16,222 --> 01:06:18,224
I'll reference her phone number
from the computer.

740
01:06:20,810 --> 01:06:21,853
Got it.

741
01:06:21,978 --> 01:06:23,956
You sure? Don't you want to run
a manual check on this?

742
01:06:23,980 --> 01:06:26,483
Yes, I'm sure. I don't need
a manual check. Let's do this.

743
01:06:26,608 --> 01:06:28,276
Alright.
Don't get trigger happy.

744
01:06:32,155 --> 01:06:33,715
'Phone lines still out of order.'

745
01:06:40,371 --> 01:06:43,166
'All units,
federal agents requesting backup.

746
01:06:43,291 --> 01:06:44,918
'All units respond.'

747
01:06:45,919 --> 01:06:51,925
your sister's in that house,
viewing you, unable to help,

748
01:06:52,050 --> 01:06:53,843
while you'll be down here...

749
01:06:55,345 --> 01:06:57,972
Seeing just how pathetically
helpless she is.

750
01:06:58,806 --> 01:07:01,267
- Hello!
- 'Intercom still mute.'

751
01:07:02,519 --> 01:07:05,396
but firstly, lotte...

752
01:07:06,940 --> 01:07:08,024
Go to hell.

753
01:07:09,025 --> 01:07:11,110
'Unit 14, eta five minutes.'

754
01:07:11,819 --> 01:07:13,404
alright, we got backup.
Step on it.

755
01:07:13,530 --> 01:07:14,739
You got it.

756
01:07:17,742 --> 01:07:20,203
Love its silhouette.

757
01:07:20,328 --> 01:07:25,792
It does not make me shudder
to grasp the cold and terrible cup

758
01:07:25,917 --> 01:07:28,336
from which I shall drink
the transport of death.

759
01:07:35,593 --> 01:07:38,221
No, no. Please!

760
01:07:38,346 --> 01:07:39,889
Please, help the light.

761
01:07:52,402 --> 01:07:55,242
'Bravo, Charlie, Sierra,
it's time for holding on tight.'

762
01:08:05,748 --> 01:08:07,250
No, misty.

763
01:08:08,376 --> 01:08:11,004
You are now my precious hourglass.

764
01:08:11,129 --> 01:08:13,506
Your blood, the sands of time,

765
01:08:13,631 --> 01:08:16,593
draining into the fathomless abyss
of eternity.

766
01:08:19,178 --> 01:08:24,726
An incision this deep will keep you alive
for perhaps twenty minutes.

767
01:08:24,851 --> 01:08:28,855
By the twelfth minute,
you'll get the urge to shut your eyes.

768
01:08:28,980 --> 01:08:31,149
You must resist.

769
01:08:31,774 --> 01:08:34,861
When I come back, I want you alive.

770
01:08:35,778 --> 01:08:39,490
The final curtain is always mine.

771
01:08:39,616 --> 01:08:40,825
Sondra!

772
01:08:41,409 --> 01:08:44,454
Oh, about those twenty minutes...

773
01:08:44,579 --> 01:08:49,500
It only applies to those
who keep very still and breathe lightly.

774
01:08:49,626 --> 01:08:53,087
Struggle and you cut this time in half.

775
01:08:53,212 --> 01:08:57,133
'An incision this deep will keep you alive

776
01:08:57,258 --> 01:09:00,428
'for perhaps twenty minutes.'

777
01:09:04,807 --> 01:09:07,226
'Electronic chronometer activated.'

778
01:09:19,364 --> 01:09:21,032
Is it just me

779
01:09:21,157 --> 01:09:25,328
or do you also have that sneaking suspicion
you left the door unlocked?

780
01:09:31,042 --> 01:09:32,418
Sondra!

781
01:09:38,132 --> 01:09:39,634
Sondra!

782
01:10:27,807 --> 01:10:28,850
Secure door.

783
01:10:28,975 --> 01:10:30,268
Come on, secure door.

784
01:10:30,893 --> 01:10:32,770
'System error.'

785
01:10:40,027 --> 01:10:41,446
Oh, my god. Close the system.

786
01:10:52,290 --> 01:10:53,291
Fucking hal!

787
01:10:54,792 --> 01:10:56,002
'Override.'

788
01:11:06,929 --> 01:11:09,056
'The front door is secured, Ben.'

789
01:11:09,182 --> 01:11:10,516
yes, misty.

790
01:11:11,267 --> 01:11:12,351
We can do this.

791
01:11:40,254 --> 01:11:41,839
Alright, let's go.

792
01:11:43,591 --> 01:11:46,093
Alright. A couple of you guys,
both of you head up this way?

793
01:11:46,219 --> 01:11:48,387
You guys go this way. Let's go.

794
01:11:54,519 --> 01:11:55,770
- Put your hands up.
- Now!

795
01:12:00,274 --> 01:12:01,818
Don't move.

796
01:12:03,069 --> 01:12:04,779
I hope you guys can explain yourselves.

797
01:12:04,904 --> 01:12:06,924
- What are you talking about?
- I'll tell you what I'm talking about.

798
01:12:06,948 --> 01:12:08,407
Keep your hands up.

799
01:12:08,533 --> 01:12:10,409
This is my property.
I live here.

800
01:12:10,535 --> 01:12:13,412
I mean, I hope you guys have
a damn good reason for this shit.

801
01:12:23,297 --> 01:12:24,507
Hal, is that you?

802
01:12:24,632 --> 01:12:26,509
'Hal fully reset and ready.'

803
01:12:29,011 --> 01:12:30,638
that's it.

804
01:12:30,763 --> 01:12:32,265
Keep the computer busy.

805
01:12:33,307 --> 01:12:34,809
It's exactly what I want.

806
01:12:36,644 --> 01:12:40,523
I am not going to die.

807
01:12:41,816 --> 01:12:43,109
I told you.

808
01:12:43,234 --> 01:12:45,862
The asshole hacked our computer,
fed us the wrong address.

809
01:12:45,987 --> 01:12:48,948
I'll call and have
a manual check run this time, ok?

810
01:12:49,073 --> 01:12:50,074
Yeah.

811
01:13:04,589 --> 01:13:07,091
So, the front door is secured.

812
01:13:07,216 --> 01:13:08,759
Let's see what's still on manual.

813
01:13:19,020 --> 01:13:21,022
Ok, support,
we have a new destination.

814
01:13:21,147 --> 01:13:25,109
'Dispatch confirming address.

She's with her dying friend constantly.

It's always the same.

Ever present, ever lovely.

If only she had waited.

899
01:23:33,175 --> 01:23:36,470
If only she had let time take effect.

900
01:23:38,514 --> 01:23:39,765
Misty!

901
01:23:42,226 --> 01:23:44,144
If it wasn't for the darkness...

902
01:23:44,937 --> 01:23:46,188
Would there have been light?

903
01:23:48,732 --> 01:23:50,275
First, lotte.

904
01:23:53,028 --> 01:23:54,905
You, fräulein.

905
01:23:56,281 --> 01:23:58,200
You just watch.

906
01:24:21,181 --> 01:24:25,143
I should inform you.
I'm wearing a passive light intensifier.

907
01:24:25,269 --> 01:24:29,273
Existing light is amplified 60,000 times.

908
01:24:29,398 --> 01:24:34,361
It also has infrared...
And everything else my heart desires.

909
01:24:47,374 --> 01:24:52,170
See the cat retreating in the cradle
while time starts to count itself again.

910
01:25:24,286 --> 01:25:27,748
Ah, auxiliary power to electronic locks.

911
01:25:31,543 --> 01:25:33,962
She locked me out of her affection...

912
01:25:34,713 --> 01:25:37,049
With silence as her only weapon.

913
01:26:26,556 --> 01:26:28,642
Tick... tack.

914
01:26:29,685 --> 01:26:32,896
The sounds of eternity
boomed like thunder.

915
01:26:44,783 --> 01:26:47,619
And while eternity passed us,

916
01:26:47,744 --> 01:26:51,206
lotte drifted deeper
into the darkness of doubt.

917
01:27:13,228 --> 01:27:15,689
So, you managed to hide upstairs.

918
01:27:30,454 --> 01:27:33,665
Oh, lotte, lotte.

919
01:27:33,790 --> 01:27:36,626
Why can't you see that the longer I wait,

920
01:27:36,752 --> 01:27:38,795
the sweeter the ending will be.

921
01:27:55,395 --> 01:27:58,940
For me, every room is transparent.

922
01:27:59,941 --> 01:28:02,527
But where's my little lotte gone?

923
01:28:02,652 --> 01:28:03,862
Here, asshole!

924
01:28:06,823 --> 01:28:08,450
What was that amplification again?

925
01:28:08,575 --> 01:28:09,659
60,000?

926
01:28:13,121 --> 01:28:15,290
Oh, lotte.

927
01:28:15,415 --> 01:28:17,000
You've been watching too many movies.

928
01:28:20,003 --> 01:28:21,630
I've seen rear window, too.

929
01:28:24,841 --> 01:28:27,928
This little miracle of a unit
has surge protection.

930
01:28:28,053 --> 01:28:30,680
It shuts down in brief flashes of light.

931
01:28:31,306 --> 01:28:34,100
It's gonna take much more
than a tiny flashbulb to kill me.

932
01:30:09,237 --> 01:30:10,655
Really?

933
01:30:15,535 --> 01:30:18,079
Don't talk, blabbermouth.
Just breathe.

934
01:30:19,414 --> 01:30:24,002
Maybe god is a woman.

935
01:30:24,961 --> 01:30:27,005
Yeah, maybe she is.

936
01:30:29,299 --> 01:30:30,717
Sorry.

937
01:30:32,510 --> 01:30:35,847
I'm so sorry to put you through all this.

938
01:30:44,564 --> 01:30:45,607

for instance, so...

Until I do my homework, I'd just
feel better if there's a couple men here.

She'll be here soon.

26
00:06:19,125 --> 00:06:20,458
Who's ""she""?

27
00:06:20,750 --> 00:06:23,375
My wife, she'll be here soon.

28
00:06:25,583 --> 00:06:28,875
Please move. We're trying to clean up.

29
00:06:29,708 --> 00:06:32,583
She's coming. From the future.

30
00:06:35,208 --> 00:06:38,000
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

31
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,792
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

32
00:07:03,792 --> 00:07:05,000
You look tired.

33
00:07:05,167 --> 00:07:06,958
I couldn't sleep at all.

34
00:07:07,292 --> 00:07:11,542
- Oh, birthday party?
- Yes, we partied until morning.

35
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:17,375
I made it past the 300 mark!

36
00:07:17,833 --> 00:07:19,167
Wow, that's great.

37
00:07:20,042 --> 00:07:21,542
Two minutes, with no mistakes.

38
00:07:21,708 --> 00:07:23,458
You're better than a dancer.

39
00:07:23,583 --> 00:07:25,333
No, of course not.

40
00:07:25,750 --> 00:07:27,750
I can't move anymore.

41
00:07:28,250 --> 00:07:29,875
I can't do the lighting check.

42
00:07:30,750 --> 00:07:32,333
Can you, please?

43
00:07:33,333 --> 00:07:36,083
You're so out of shape!

44
00:07:44,583 --> 00:07:46,042
Yes, okay.

45
00:07:46,417 --> 00:07:47,617
Three minutes behind schedule.

46
00:10:16,667 --> 00:10:19,500
Please mind your step as you leave.

47
00:10:20,625 --> 00:10:22,875
Thank you very much.

48
00:10:28,167 --> 00:10:29,417
Izumi.

49
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,458
Good job!

50
00:10:33,958 --> 00:10:35,500
That was great.

51
00:10:36,208 --> 00:10:40,417
- I'm so proud of you! Well done.
- Well done.

52
00:10:41,458 --> 00:10:43,458
Wasn't she great?

53
00:10:43,625 --> 00:10:45,917
- The best I've seen so far.
- Really?

54
00:10:46,083 --> 00:10:48,042
You've been working so hard.

55
00:10:52,083 --> 00:10:53,792
Theater, all clear.

56
00:11:14,208 --> 00:11:15,250
<i>Did you lose your job?</i>

57
00:11:17,083 --> 00:11:18,250
You look so young.

58
00:11:18,542 --> 00:11:21,000
No, I've been doing this for some time.

59
00:11:21,333 --> 00:11:24,417
Really? How's business these days?

60
00:11:25,083 --> 00:11:29,125
Pretty tough, especially at night.

61
00:11:29,667 --> 00:11:31,083
I see.

62
00:11:32,083 --> 00:11:36,333
It's still fine during the day,
but it's dead after midnight.

63
00:11:39,583 --> 00:11:41,583
Tonight's show was canceled too.

64
00:11:41,833 --> 00:11:42,833
Really?

65
00:11:43,375 --> 00:11:45,625
Our agency has to refund the tickets.

66
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:48,083
They might go under.

67
00:11:48,917 --> 00:11:50,917
Everyone's struggling, huh?

68
00:11:52,417 --> 00:11:54,333
I hope this crisis ends soon.

69
00:12:05,833 --> 00:12:09,000
It's incredible
that they still held the Olympics.

70
00:12:13,167 --> 00:12:15,875
- Sorry, can I take a toilet break?
- Sure.

71
00:13:26,333 --> 00:13:30,500
SCHIUMA

72
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:51,542
SCHIUMA

73
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:08,583
From 12 to 13 of the ninth part. Okay.

74
00:15:08,750 --> 00:15:10,542
<i>For the final chorus section,</i>

75
00:15:10,750 --> 00:15:14,708
<i>no spotlight from 30 to 33
of the ninth part.</i>

76
00:15:14,833 --> 00:15:17,792
No spotlight from 30 to 33. Got it.

77
00:15:39,958 --> 00:15:42,792
We'll just have to wait it out.

78
00:15:45,083 --> 00:15:47,917
Yeah, I guess we've got no choice.

79
00:15:49,208 --> 00:15:51,042
Let's see how things go.

80
00:17:48,417 --> 00:17:49,542
Monja.

81
00:17:51,458 --> 00:17:52,583
Monja.

82
00:17:56,167 --> 00:17:57,292
Monja?

83
00:17:58,042 --> 00:17:59,958
No, Monja, not that!

84
00:19:00,292 --> 00:19:03,208
AUTOMOBILE REPAIR PLANT

85
00:19:25,292 --> 00:19:29,542
FREE TONIGHT? HAVING DRINKS WITH THE GUYS!

86
00:20:10,833 --> 00:20:12,000
Good morning.

87
00:20:24,917 --> 00:20:28,625
- Is your birthday this month?
- Yeah.

88
00:20:29,333 --> 00:20:31,458
Then you get a 10% discount.

89
00:20:32,375 --> 00:20:33,375
Really?

90
00:20:33,625 --> 00:20:36,375
- You don't want it?
- Of course I do. Thank you.

91
00:20:36,958 --> 00:20:38,083
When is it?

92
00:20:40,375 --> 00:20:41,583
It was yesterday.

93
00:20:41,708 --> 00:20:45,292
Too bad. If it had been today,
you would've got 20% off.

94
00:20:46,708 --> 00:20:49,208
- Sorry, I lied. It's actually today.
- Huh?

95
00:20:51,958 --> 00:20:54,417
What, Mom? Have you eaten already?

96
00:20:54,583 --> 00:20:56,958
- Phone's ringing.
- Hey!

97
00:20:57,375 --> 00:20:58,708
No peeking!

98
00:20:59,292 --> 00:21:02,292
- Where's the ashtray?
- It's there.

99
00:21:03,083 --> 00:21:05,458
Just leave it where it is.

100
00:21:05,625 --> 00:21:07,208
- Gimme that.
- Are you okay?

101
00:21:08,333 --> 00:21:09,750
I got a call.

102
00:21:12,542 --> 00:21:14,000
Yes, I knew it.

103
00:21:30,208 --> 00:21:31,375
Done.

104
00:21:39,208 --> 00:21:40,833
Looks good.

105
00:21:41,333 --> 00:21:42,625
Thank you.

106
00:21:44,125 --> 00:21:46,000
- Don't forget those.
- Oh, right.

107
00:21:47,292 --> 00:21:49,417
What's that? Is that a girl's thing?

108
00:21:51,208 --> 00:21:52,417
It's a barrette.

109
00:21:55,333 --> 00:21:57,250
I guess I don't need it anymore.

110
00:21:57,750 --> 00:21:59,583
Mom, what about dinner?

111
00:23:03,833 --> 00:23:05,125
It's raised.

112
00:23:05,875 --> 00:23:07,333
It's raised!

113
00:23:08,042 --> 00:23:11,167
Not that! The angle is wrong.

114
00:23:11,500 --> 00:23:12,708
Tilt it upwards!

115
00:25:30,167 --> 00:25:32,667
Hey, Saeki! You klutz!

116
00:25:32,958 --> 00:25:35,500
- The spotlight's off!
- I'm sorry.

117
00:25:35,583 --> 00:25:38,833
Cut the crap, not your hair, you dimwit!

118
00:25:38,917 --> 00:25:40,125
Yes, I'm sorry.

119
00:25:47,583 --> 00:25:48,708
Excuse me.

120
00:25:49,208 --> 00:25:53,042
I'm sorry about that mistake
with the lights.

121
00:25:53,292 --> 00:25:55,625
- No worries. It was only the soundcheck.
- I'm sorry.

122
00:25:56,125 --> 00:25:59,833
- The lights were great.
- Really? Thank you.

123
00:26:00,500 --> 00:26:02,208
I'll pass that on to my boss.

124
00:26:02,667 --> 00:26:05,083
Some people still say ""dimwit,"" huh?

125
00:26:05,458 --> 00:26:09,167
She's always dead serious
when it comes to the lights.

126
00:26:09,583 --> 00:26:11,125
But she's pretty cool.

127
00:26:18,208 --> 00:26:19,375
Sorry, but...

128
00:26:20,625 --> 00:26:22,500
have we met before?

129
00:26:25,042 --> 00:26:26,792
I have the feeling we have.

130
00:26:27,458 --> 00:26:28,917
Sorry, I can't recall.

131
00:26:29,792 --> 00:26:33,042
Excuse me. I look forward to the show.

132
00:26:49,167 --> 00:26:50,375
Teruo?

133
00:26:51,417 --> 00:26:56,333
- Hey, long time no see, Izumi.
- Hey! How are you?

134
00:26:56,458 --> 00:26:58,333
- You've cut your hair.
- I cut it today.

135
00:26:58,500 --> 00:27:00,667
Really? Wow.

136
00:27:00,875 --> 00:27:04,250
- Did something good happen?
- Oh? What do you mean?

137
00:27:04,375 --> 00:27:06,125
You were grinning.

138
00:27:06,250 --> 00:27:08,875
Really? No, not at all.

139
00:27:09,083 --> 00:27:11,833
- Is that why you're drinking?
- No, no...

140
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,208
A lot goes on in an adult's life.

141
00:27:14,375 --> 00:27:16,667
- In a university student's too.
- Is that so?

142
00:27:17,458 --> 00:27:19,750
- I'm having drinks with my friends.
- Is that right?

143
00:27:19,875 --> 00:27:21,625
- Sorry to bother you.
- Not at all.

144
00:27:24,083 --> 00:27:27,042
- I'm now old enough to drink.
- Congratulations.

145
00:27:27,292 --> 00:27:31,083
- Do you have time tonight?
- Yeah, I do.

146
00:27:31,250 --> 00:27:32,500
Let's grab a drink.

147
00:27:32,792 --> 00:27:35,458
I usually cruise around at night.

148
00:27:35,750 --> 00:27:37,792
So your hours aren't fixed?

149
00:27:37,917 --> 00:27:40,375
Yes, it's quite easygoing.

150
00:27:43,792 --> 00:27:45,875
What makes you happy?

151
00:27:46,667 --> 00:27:50,833
I would say... Narita.

152
00:27:51,083 --> 00:27:52,375
Narita Airport.

153
00:27:53,917 --> 00:27:55,792
- As a destination?
- Yes.

154
00:27:56,833 --> 00:27:58,917
It's money, after all.

155
00:28:00,500 --> 00:28:01,958
Narita's far away.

156
00:28:02,875 --> 00:28:04,375
Yes, it is.

157
00:28:04,792 --> 00:28:08,583
But any further than that
would be a pain to drive back.

158
00:28:08,875 --> 00:28:12,292
From Narita, you can drive
straight back on the highway.

159
00:28:20,125 --> 00:28:24,250
If you want money, I can find you a job.

160
00:28:24,542 --> 00:28:29,208
Sure, I need money,
but it's not that important to me.

161
00:28:29,833 --> 00:28:31,917
I actually like this job.

162
00:28:32,583 --> 00:28:33,792
Right.

163
00:28:37,083 --> 00:28:39,000
What do you like about it?

164
00:28:44,500 --> 00:28:46,875
I'd like to travel somewhere...

165
00:28:48,042 --> 00:28:50,917
but I don't know where to go.

166
00:28:53,583 --> 00:28:55,208
So it feels nice

167
00:28:55,917 --> 00:29:00,375
to keep heading towards a destination
of the customers' choosing.

168
00:29:01,333 --> 00:29:05,458
Makes me feel like
I'm always heading somewhere.

169
00:29:07,208 --> 00:29:08,250
{\an8}TOMARI TREE

170
00:29:08,375 --> 00:29:11,000
{\an8}Dance transcends words or language.

171
00:29:12,083 --> 00:29:14,292
I can't speak any English

172
00:29:14,458 --> 00:29:18,875
but I can talk to people all over
the world through my dancing.

173
00:29:19,083 --> 00:29:23,500
After I graduate,
I want to try dancing overseas.

174
00:29:23,750 --> 00:29:24,875
I see.

175
00:29:25,042 --> 00:29:26,792
I'm already getting invitations.

176
00:29:26,958 --> 00:29:30,125
Really? Wow, that's great. Thanks.

177
00:29:30,292 --> 00:29:31,708
I made a stronger one.

178
00:29:32,625 --> 00:29:34,750
Are you still with the same group?

179
00:29:34,917 --> 00:29:37,542
No, I do stage lighting now.

180
00:29:37,792 --> 00:29:39,500
- You quit dancing?
- Yeah.

181
00:29:39,875 --> 00:29:43,833
I injured my foot after you left.

182
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:45,167
Badly?

183
00:29:45,333 --> 00:29:47,375
Bad enough to have to give up.

184
00:29:49,083 --> 00:29:50,625
I'm so sorry.

185
00:29:52,125 --> 00:29:54,875
Yeah, but it's fun lighting the stage.

186
00:29:55,292 --> 00:30:01,250
It feels like I'm almost breathing
and dancing with the performers.

187
00:30:01,917 --> 00:30:03,750
I'm still a newbie, though.

188
00:30:05,208 --> 00:30:06,542
Hence the hair cut?

189
00:30:06,708 --> 00:30:10,125
No, that's just because
I had a birthday discount.

190
00:30:10,750 --> 00:30:13,750
Wait, is it today?

191
00:30:14,333 --> 00:30:16,750
- Don't you need to be somewhere else?
- No, not really.

192
00:30:16,917 --> 00:30:19,042
Sorry it has to be here.

193
00:30:19,292 --> 00:30:21,500
I'm too old for birthdays anyway.

194
00:30:21,667 --> 00:30:24,917
I'm sorry, I didn't realize.
Congratulations.

195
00:30:25,167 --> 00:30:27,458
- Congratulations.
- Thanks.

196
00:30:28,458 --> 00:30:31,833
- It's like I'm imposing on you guys.
- We're delighted to.

197
00:30:31,958 --> 00:30:35,292
I can't eat this cake alone now.

198
00:30:35,958 --> 00:30:37,292
I made that.

199
00:30:37,417 --> 00:30:39,042
I like chocolate.

200
00:30:39,208 --> 00:30:42,000
I know, but can you at least
give it a try?

201
00:30:42,125 --> 00:30:43,417
Let's try it together.

202
00:30:43,583 --> 00:30:45,250
Okay, just one bite.

203
00:30:45,458 --> 00:30:47,000
Look this way.

204
00:30:49,333 --> 00:30:51,042
Maybe it's a bit too dark.

205
00:30:52,500 --> 00:30:54,125
Your faces don't show.

206
00:30:54,250 --> 00:30:55,458
Hey, can I move that?

207
00:30:55,625 --> 00:30:57,458
The lighting man in action!

208
00:30:57,708 --> 00:30:59,542
You should take a picture.

209
00:30:59,667 --> 00:31:03,167
- What a craftsman.
- Awesome.

210
00:31:03,333 --> 00:31:04,750
Is this better?

211
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:07,417
That's great
but now the spotlight's on me.

212
00:31:10,917 --> 00:31:13,625
Those with blood type A
seem to be the horniest.

213
00:31:14,375 --> 00:31:17,292
- Really? Who said that?
- I did.

214
00:31:18,042 --> 00:31:23,042
I made a pie chart of my experiences
and the majority were blood type A.

215
00:31:23,208 --> 00:31:24,708
What's your blood type?

216
00:31:24,875 --> 00:31:26,708
- What? Me?
- Yes, you.

217
00:31:26,833 --> 00:31:28,042
Type A.

218
00:31:28,875 --> 00:31:30,917
- I'm doomed.
- Pervert!

219
00:31:31,625 --> 00:31:33,292
What about Ena?

220
00:31:33,750 --> 00:31:35,083
I'm also type A.

221
00:31:35,208 --> 00:31:37,125
- Really? The pervert duo.
- Type A?

222
00:31:37,208 --> 00:31:39,458
- You are pervert pair.
- Not pair.

223
00:31:39,833 --> 00:31:41,792
Yo, what about you?

224
00:31:42,042 --> 00:31:43,208
I'm type A.

225
00:31:43,875 --> 00:31:46,583
A trio of perverts!
Okay, let's play a game.

226
00:31:46,667 --> 00:31:49,792
Take it in turns to touch the hand
of the guy you fancy.

227
00:31:50,125 --> 00:31:53,375
- Here it comes.
- It's just a game.

228
00:31:53,792 --> 00:31:55,333
- Let's take turns.
- Okay...

229
00:31:55,542 --> 00:31:58,000
- Can Ena go first?
- Ena will go first.

230
00:32:02,250 --> 00:32:03,500
Okay, good job.

231
00:32:05,125 --> 00:32:06,875
It's my turn now.

232
00:32:07,542 --> 00:32:12,125
- Hey, hey, hey.
- What do you think?

233
00:32:12,208 --> 00:32:16,667
- What?
- I am eating Ohagi with Anko.

234
00:32:24,750 --> 00:32:25,958
Here you go.

235
00:32:26,208 --> 00:32:29,417
Oh, thank you.

236
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:38,250
Thank you.

237
00:32:40,458 --> 00:32:41,792
Group date?

238
00:32:41,958 --> 00:32:43,292
Yeah.

239
00:32:44,417 --> 00:32:45,625
How's that going?

240
00:32:45,750 --> 00:32:47,292
So-so.

241
00:32:48,833 --> 00:32:50,250
Mine's horrible.

242
00:32:50,542 --> 00:32:51,625
Is it?

243
00:32:51,792 --> 00:32:54,750
There's a girl who brought her kid along.

244
00:32:55,333 --> 00:32:57,292
To a group date? I don't get it.

245
00:32:58,125 --> 00:33:00,375
Everyone's just fiddling
with their phones.

246
00:33:00,708 --> 00:33:02,167
What a waste of time.

247
00:33:11,167 --> 00:33:13,375
I wish I could date a celebrity.

248
00:33:14,333 --> 00:33:15,958
Celebrities don't come here.

249
00:33:16,167 --> 00:33:17,708
But don't you wish for that too?

250
00:33:17,875 --> 00:33:19,583
Why would I want that?

251
00:33:19,917 --> 00:33:21,333
Because they're famous.

252
00:33:21,875 --> 00:33:24,708
Dating a celebrity would be
like a dream come true.

253
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:26,583
Even if you break up with them,

254
00:33:26,750 --> 00:33:29,125
any time you see them on TV,

255
00:33:29,333 --> 00:33:33,292
you'll feel proud to have dated them
and feel great about it.

256
00:33:33,958 --> 00:33:35,917
- I kinda get it.
- Yeah?

257
00:33:36,667 --> 00:33:39,292
- Yo, we're going to the next bar.
- Okay.

258
00:33:43,667 --> 00:33:45,417
I have to get back to Hell.

259
00:33:46,458 --> 00:33:49,375
Let's be friends on Line.

260
00:33:52,375 --> 00:33:53,500
Just to...

261
00:33:54,250 --> 00:33:55,792
You do use Line, right?

262
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:57,500
Yeah, I do.

263
00:33:57,708 --> 00:33:59,417
Then let's just be friends.

264
00:34:00,417 --> 00:34:03,417
When it comes to Line,
the more the merrier.

265
00:34:03,542 --> 00:34:05,000
Yeah.

266
00:34:07,292 --> 00:34:08,500
Here's my QR code.

267
00:34:08,750 --> 00:34:10,333
- I'll scan it.
- Sure.

268
00:34:11,042 --> 00:34:12,375
- Thank you.
- Sure.

269
00:34:12,833 --> 00:34:13,875
You have a cat?

270
00:34:14,292 --> 00:34:15,750
Not anymore.

271
00:34:16,250 --> 00:34:17,375
But...

272
00:34:17,542 --> 00:34:19,083
He belongs to someone else.

273
00:34:20,250 --> 00:34:21,458
Your ex?

274
00:34:21,625 --> 00:34:23,250
Well, sort of.

275
00:34:24,333 --> 00:34:26,792
You're dwelling on him? That's heavy.

276
00:34:26,917 --> 00:34:29,292
No, I'm not dwelling on it. Heavy?

277
00:34:29,417 --> 00:34:31,000
Don't you feel heavy?

278
00:34:31,500 --> 00:34:35,667
I forgot about that photo.
I'm going to change it right now.

279
00:34:35,833 --> 00:34:37,633
- Yes, let's change it right now.
- Right now.

280
00:34:37,750 --> 00:34:39,583
Oh, what is this?

281
00:34:40,125 --> 00:34:43,750
Are you an old lady or something? Here.

282
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:50,125
- Were you born in the 20th century?
- At the very end of it.

283
00:34:50,625 --> 00:34:52,208
- Is any pic okay?
- Yeah.

284
00:34:52,625 --> 00:34:54,917
Then this one. There you go.

285
00:34:55,125 --> 00:34:56,417
Done.

286
00:34:56,625 --> 00:34:59,208
- You're still dwelling on it.
- I am not.

287
00:34:59,375 --> 00:35:01,542
From now on, it'll be this.

288
00:35:02,250 --> 00:35:03,500
Forget the past.

289
00:35:03,667 --> 00:35:06,417
You can't just tell me to forget about it.

290
00:35:06,583 --> 00:35:08,333
I'll text you every day.

291
00:35:08,458 --> 00:35:12,208
Every day? We've just met. Okay then.

292
00:35:13,292 --> 00:35:16,583
- I might not reply, but okay.
- Thank you.

293
00:35:17,583 --> 00:35:19,125
Summer has arrived.

294
00:35:19,875 --> 00:35:22,542
Yeah. Have a nice summer.

295
00:35:36,125 --> 00:35:37,792
Not now.

296
00:35:38,417 --> 00:35:40,583
You're dwelling on the past.

297
00:35:40,750 --> 00:35:43,917
- No, seriously, I'm not.
- What's going on?

298
00:35:44,042 --> 00:35:46,667
- He is really stupid.
- Why?

299
00:35:46,792 --> 00:35:49,917
I have a boyfriend now.
That was a long time ago.

300
00:35:50,042 --> 00:35:51,417
How old are you?

301
00:35:52,458 --> 00:35:55,292
Teruo has a girlfriend too, right?

302
00:35:55,833 --> 00:35:57,208
Well...

303
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:01,458
She's happy and being strong.

304
00:36:03,125 --> 00:36:06,708
Right. I'm sure she is.

305
00:36:09,875 --> 00:36:13,125
Men fall in love with their dreams, right?

306
00:36:26,500 --> 00:36:28,333
What a funny way of eating.

307
00:36:28,958 --> 00:36:30,333
It tastes better this way.

308
00:36:30,458 --> 00:36:34,917
Haven't you thought how nice it would be

309
00:36:35,167 --> 00:36:38,750
if you could eat all the cake you wanted?

310
00:36:38,917 --> 00:36:40,875
I totally understand.

311
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:42,167
I wasn't asking you.

312
00:36:42,292 --> 00:36:43,875
Huh? Who are you?

313
00:36:44,250 --> 00:36:45,500
Who are you?

314
00:36:46,417 --> 00:36:48,292
What's with that face?

315
00:36:49,208 --> 00:36:52,333
I could endure everything
for the sake of dance,

316
00:36:52,417 --> 00:36:54,083
even if it's cake.

317
00:36:56,125 --> 00:36:58,250
I wonder how I could bear so much.

318
00:37:01,042 --> 00:37:04,917
Now I can see that dancing was
a great opportunity for me.

319
00:37:06,583 --> 00:37:08,167
But you loved it, right?

320
00:37:10,167 --> 00:37:12,000
Enough to resist cakes?

321
00:37:16,792 --> 00:37:19,333
Your dancing was so beautiful.

322
00:37:20,958 --> 00:37:22,250
Thanks.

323
00:37:24,375 --> 00:37:29,375
You have talent, Izumi,
so I think you'll do great.

324
00:37:30,708 --> 00:37:32,792
You have talent too.

325
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:37,125
More than me in any case.

326
00:37:37,333 --> 00:37:39,167
Who are you? Seriously?

327
00:37:39,708 --> 00:37:42,625
But, seriously,
you have more talent than I do.

328
00:37:42,750 --> 00:37:44,208
Wait, I'm over here.

329
00:37:44,333 --> 00:37:45,542
You know?

330
00:37:45,625 --> 00:37:47,542
Izumi is over here.

331
00:37:47,833 --> 00:37:50,875
Teruo, don't mind him.

332
00:37:51,250 --> 00:37:54,000
You're so annoying!

333
00:37:54,125 --> 00:37:56,083
You guys don't even see me.

334
00:37:56,292 --> 00:37:59,333
That's not fair!

335
00:37:59,958 --> 00:38:01,167
I hate you.

336
00:38:35,042 --> 00:38:36,542
Sorry, did I wake you?

337
00:38:38,625 --> 00:38:41,208
I will...

338
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:43,958
make you happy forever.

339
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:49,167
Thank you.

340
00:38:50,583 --> 00:38:51,833
I took a cigarette.

341
00:38:53,958 --> 00:38:55,833
This is sheer destiny.

342
00:38:59,875 --> 00:39:02,292
Come back here when you're done smoking.

343
00:40:36,042 --> 00:40:37,458
Good morning.

344
00:40:45,042 --> 00:40:46,875
- Kick up at seven.
- Okay.

345
00:40:46,958 --> 00:40:48,875
Okay, one more time.

346
00:40:55,333 --> 00:40:59,542
The leg and hip position is important

347
00:40:59,667 --> 00:41:02,292
when you stand up.

348
00:41:03,708 --> 00:41:05,292
Kick into the air.

349
00:41:10,917 --> 00:41:15,583
Mouri, you should kick up the leg
about now.

350
00:41:15,750 --> 00:41:18,958
Then let's begin.

351
00:41:23,500 --> 00:41:24,792
Over here?

352
00:41:24,917 --> 00:41:26,917
- Yes, thank you.
- Okay.

353
00:41:29,667 --> 00:41:31,500
That'll be 1780 yen.

354
00:41:31,750 --> 00:41:33,958
I have a taxi ticket.

355
00:41:34,250 --> 00:41:35,333
Okay.

356
00:41:37,958 --> 00:41:41,167
Please write down the fare.

357
00:41:47,042 --> 00:41:49,125
Thank you.

358
00:41:49,417 --> 00:41:51,333
- I'll open the door now.
- Thanks.

359
00:41:53,167 --> 00:41:54,750
Thank you.

360
00:41:56,750 --> 00:41:59,708
Is something wrong?

361
00:42:01,417 --> 00:42:03,458
What? No.

362
00:42:04,208 --> 00:42:07,000
I don't want to go to cram school either.

363
00:42:07,417 --> 00:42:09,417
Hang in there, okay?

364
00:42:11,875 --> 00:42:12,958
Yes.

365
00:42:14,125 --> 00:42:15,792
Thank you.

366
00:42:26,042 --> 00:42:28,250
What did the doctor say?

367
00:42:31,292 --> 00:42:33,042
To give up dancing.

368
00:42:35,583 --> 00:42:37,083
It's not going back to normal.

369
00:42:43,458 --> 00:42:46,542
A healthy body is obviously important...

370
00:42:47,208 --> 00:42:51,500
but you're working hard on your rehab
and we'll always be there to help.

371
00:42:51,708 --> 00:42:55,000
Maybe we can reduce your roles

372
00:42:55,167 --> 00:42:59,208
and make things easier on you.

373
00:43:06,833 --> 00:43:08,958
How can you wait for so long?

374
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:12,417
Because I want to.

375
00:43:15,875 --> 00:43:17,542
You believe she's coming?

376
00:43:22,958 --> 00:43:24,333
Are you also waiting?

377
00:43:27,792 --> 00:43:29,333
Yes.

378
00:43:32,667 --> 00:43:35,375
It's a miracle that
there's someone waiting.

379
00:43:40,500 --> 00:43:43,625
But what if they don't come?

380
00:43:52,958 --> 00:43:56,708
Maybe it'd be good
to go to them for a change.

381
00:44:15,917 --> 00:44:18,625
Why are you here?

382
00:44:20,292 --> 00:44:21,542
I'm taking you home.

383
00:44:47,208 --> 00:44:48,833
Hey, I need that leg.

384
00:45:03,500 --> 00:45:05,792
Really? You chatted with him?

385
00:45:06,542 --> 00:45:10,208
I greeted him this morning too.
He's amazing.

386
00:45:10,875 --> 00:45:12,917
He has total faith in her.

387
00:45:13,083 --> 00:45:16,208
I really hope they'll meet again.

388
00:45:17,792 --> 00:45:19,417
Did he remember you?

389
00:45:21,500 --> 00:45:23,250
Why didn't you reply?

390
00:45:24,792 --> 00:45:27,625
I'm sorry.
I was planning to do that today.

391
00:45:28,833 --> 00:45:30,375
It's not funny.

392
00:45:31,167 --> 00:45:33,208
I was really worried about you.

393
00:45:35,250 --> 00:45:38,167
- I'm fine.
- No, you're not.

394
00:45:40,042 --> 00:45:41,292
I'm sorry.

395
00:45:42,125 --> 00:45:44,167
But give me a bit of time.

396
00:45:44,792 --> 00:45:47,417
I already have. Two weeks.

397
00:45:48,375 --> 00:45:50,167
What exactly do you mean?

398
00:45:50,708 --> 00:45:53,833
I'm still flustered and broken.

399
00:45:55,417 --> 00:45:59,417
I didn't want to trouble you
because of my situation.

400
00:45:59,542 --> 00:46:02,792
Trouble me. Let's think it out together.

401
00:46:02,958 --> 00:46:05,792
I want to, but I'm still...

402
00:46:07,833 --> 00:46:09,750
It's always about you.

403
00:46:10,875 --> 00:46:14,167
Taking it on alone
and making all the decisions yourself.

404
00:46:15,417 --> 00:46:17,833
You're like a ""selfish machine.""

405
00:46:18,667 --> 00:46:22,250
Always run for the cat, just bearing,
always go to Yakitori.

406
00:46:24,458 --> 00:46:27,000
Is this about last month?

407
00:46:27,208 --> 00:46:31,417
You always go to Toriki,
even on days off.

408
00:46:32,667 --> 00:46:35,417
- Then tell me.
- Then ask me.

409
00:46:37,583 --> 00:46:39,542
Anyway, Toriki doesn't matter.

410
00:46:50,292 --> 00:46:53,750
You could be a movie star.

411
00:47:02,792 --> 00:47:05,125
I'm here to support you.

412
00:47:07,125 --> 00:47:10,000
Until you heal and even after you heal.

413
00:47:11,667 --> 00:47:13,750
Even if you can't dance anymore,

414
00:47:14,042 --> 00:47:17,333
we'll work like normal
and live happily together.

415
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:23,583
- What do you mean?
- Exactly what I said.

416
00:47:24,333 --> 00:47:28,083
No matter how much you change,
my feelings for you won't change.

417
00:47:28,625 --> 00:47:30,125
I'll still love you.

418
00:47:32,875 --> 00:47:38,208
If you'd still love me if I changed,
then you don't love who I am now.

419
00:47:38,833 --> 00:47:40,292
Stop sounding like a girl.

420
00:47:40,458 --> 00:47:42,833
It's got nothing to do with gender.

421
00:47:47,542 --> 00:47:50,167
I'm saying that I love who you are.

422
00:47:50,375 --> 00:47:53,167
So whatever version of Teruo
you turn into,

423
00:47:53,375 --> 00:47:54,958
I will still love you.

424
00:48:03,458 --> 00:48:05,250
It's pretty easy to imagine.

425
00:48:07,042 --> 00:48:10,250
Working a normal job
and having fun on our days off.

426
00:48:11,167 --> 00:48:13,750
Sometimes cooking a meal.

427
00:48:14,958 --> 00:48:17,167
I love that Teruo too.

428
00:48:19,958 --> 00:48:22,167
You don't know me as a non-dancer.

429
00:48:22,667 --> 00:48:25,792
What are you so angry about?

430
00:48:27,667 --> 00:48:28,958
Nothing.

431
00:48:33,167 --> 00:48:35,833
I'll still love you
no matter what you are.

432
00:48:42,292 --> 00:48:46,292
What is it? I can't understand you
if you won't tell me what's wrong.

433
00:48:48,208 --> 00:48:49,500
What?

434
00:48:51,833 --> 00:48:54,750
It's nothing. I'm sorry.

435
00:48:55,167 --> 00:48:57,833
I'm the one who doesn't understand.

436
00:48:58,583 --> 00:49:00,750
Why are you saying these things?

437
00:49:02,125 --> 00:49:03,708
Communication breakdown.

438
00:49:17,500 --> 00:49:21,625
Maybe we never did communicate.

439
00:49:28,792 --> 00:49:33,917
Do you know how worried I've been
these past two weeks?

440
00:49:48,583 --> 00:49:49,875
Forget it.

441
00:49:52,333 --> 00:49:54,000
- Forget what?
- Nothing.

442
00:49:58,958 --> 00:50:04,167
I'm at the point of not knowing
whether I can keep on dancing or not.

443
00:50:05,083 --> 00:50:08,417
I wanted to see you
after everything's clear.

444
00:50:08,583 --> 00:50:12,875
I need to know if I can continue dancing
or if I have to find something else.

445
00:50:12,958 --> 00:50:14,750
That's not what I want.

446
00:50:21,042 --> 00:50:23,958
You say you're doing it for me,
but it's all about you.

447
00:50:38,833 --> 00:50:42,250
Here we are. Take care when you get out.

448
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:53,000
That'll be 2240 yen,
but 2500 yen is fine.

449
00:50:54,792 --> 00:50:57,042
Why are you acting like this?

450
00:51:01,042 --> 00:51:02,333
Please get out.

451
00:51:18,458 --> 00:51:21,250
Hey, this is for you.

452
00:51:29,417 --> 00:51:31,500
Let's eat together.

453
00:51:32,792 --> 00:51:34,667
I'm trying to apologize

454
00:51:34,750 --> 00:51:36,542
Taxi fare is 2240 yen.

455
00:51:36,625 --> 00:51:39,625
Please understand
that I just need some time.

456
00:51:53,125 --> 00:51:55,292
And you don't come running after me.

457
00:52:26,583 --> 00:52:29,083
- I'm into Tanaka.
- He's popular.

458
00:52:29,500 --> 00:52:32,708
You gotta move fast.

459
00:52:33,375 --> 00:52:36,458
He'd definitely be into you.

460
00:52:48,667 --> 00:52:49,958
He just won't listen.

461
00:52:50,125 --> 00:52:53,500
There's no stopping him
once he starts running.

462
00:52:53,625 --> 00:52:55,417
Today's youth are hopeless.

463
00:52:57,083 --> 00:53:00,167
What do you want for dinner?

464
00:53:00,792 --> 00:53:02,375
- Curry.
- Curry?

465
00:53:02,542 --> 00:53:04,500
- Fried chicken.
- You want fried chicken?

466
00:53:21,792 --> 00:53:24,958
So, where to next?

467
00:53:25,125 --> 00:53:26,458
You're fine.

468
00:53:26,625 --> 00:53:29,750
There's always the next one.

469
00:53:30,667 --> 00:53:34,250
Who's gonna trust a third-timer like you?

470
00:53:34,417 --> 00:53:37,625
Stop bullying me!

471
00:53:37,750 --> 00:53:39,917
Three times is really crazy.

472
00:53:40,042 --> 00:53:42,250
If you need to throw up, I can pull over.

473
00:53:42,375 --> 00:53:46,250
Excuse us, driver,
he just got divorced today.

474
00:53:49,250 --> 00:53:52,583
The world's full of cooler guys than you.

475
00:53:52,750 --> 00:53:55,333
- Can I smoke?
- No, sorry.

476
00:53:55,917 --> 00:53:58,792
Can you let him smoke, just for today?

477
00:53:58,875 --> 00:54:01,083
- Sorry, that's not possible.
- Only one, please.

478
00:54:01,458 --> 00:54:04,875
Hey, what's this?

479
00:54:06,167 --> 00:54:07,792
Sorry, I'll take that.

480
00:54:07,917 --> 00:54:11,292
- This is nice. Is it for you?
- It's garbage.

481
00:54:13,792 --> 00:54:16,375
He can have it as a divorce gift.

482
00:54:17,458 --> 00:54:22,000
- I don't want this trash.
- Of course not. Who'd want this?

483
00:54:22,167 --> 00:54:25,625
- Please have it.
- Accept her present. C'mon!

484
00:54:25,792 --> 00:54:27,667
Who would want this garbage?

485
00:54:27,792 --> 00:54:29,833
Seriously, you can have it.

486
00:54:30,042 --> 00:54:32,542
It's a present. Now take it!

487
00:54:32,917 --> 00:54:34,083
Just take it!

488
00:54:39,750 --> 00:54:41,958
Sorry, I was just joking.

489
00:54:42,208 --> 00:54:44,208
- Here's an ashtray.
- Great.

490
00:54:56,042 --> 00:54:58,792
TO TERUO
GOOD LUCK

491
00:56:18,375 --> 00:56:21,417
Teruo, you're late.

492
00:56:23,875 --> 00:56:25,083
Really?

493
00:56:25,875 --> 00:56:28,375
It's seven minutes past.

494
00:56:29,917 --> 00:56:31,583
Seven minutes past what?

495
00:56:32,708 --> 00:56:37,125
I don't know, but it's past that time.

496
00:56:38,500 --> 00:56:39,958
I have no idea.

497
00:56:48,500 --> 00:56:49,833
Did you sleep?

498
00:56:50,708 --> 00:56:52,125
Yeah.

499
00:56:57,000 --> 00:56:58,917
I want to see Teruo.

500
00:57:01,875 --> 00:57:03,583
I'm here.

501
00:57:06,042 --> 00:57:08,708
When I sleep, I don't get to see you.

502
00:57:11,458 --> 00:57:13,042
Well, then...

503
00:57:14,708 --> 00:57:16,792
let's meet in our dreams.

504
00:57:18,500 --> 00:57:20,167
Where in our dreams?

505
00:57:22,250 --> 00:57:23,958
In our dreams...

506
00:57:26,625 --> 00:57:28,208
on Third Street, block 5-1.

507
00:57:30,917 --> 00:57:32,208
Where's that?

508
00:57:34,500 --> 00:57:36,208
Near the candy shop.

509
00:57:36,917 --> 00:57:38,042
The candy shop?

510
00:57:38,208 --> 00:57:41,083
Turn here, then you turn around.

511
00:57:42,875 --> 00:57:44,708
Then you go straight

512
00:57:45,500 --> 00:57:48,750
all the way up this road.

513
00:57:49,292 --> 00:57:51,208
And then what?

514
00:57:53,833 --> 00:57:55,000
Where?

515
00:58:13,458 --> 00:58:14,542
Yo?

516
00:58:18,667 --> 00:58:20,083
Good morning, Yo.

517
00:58:21,708 --> 00:58:23,333
You're awake.

518
00:58:24,250 --> 00:58:25,667
Hey, Yo?

519
00:58:27,417 --> 00:58:28,542
What's this?

520
00:58:30,292 --> 00:58:34,375
- Santa came?
- It's from Santa? Really?

521
00:58:35,417 --> 00:58:36,750
Santa Claus?

522
00:58:36,958 --> 00:58:40,042
He came through the window last night.

523
00:58:41,667 --> 00:58:45,250
Poor Santa,
having to work on his off season.

524
00:58:47,500 --> 00:58:48,792
What's this?

525
00:58:52,708 --> 00:58:54,292
- Can I open it?
- Yes.

526
00:58:54,792 --> 00:58:56,125
Santa...

527
00:59:03,667 --> 00:59:06,458
Wow, how nice.

528
00:59:07,417 --> 00:59:08,750
It's pretty.

529
00:59:10,458 --> 00:59:12,292
It's so beautiful.

530
00:59:12,875 --> 00:59:14,083
But what is it?

531
00:59:15,042 --> 00:59:17,375
- It's a barrette.
- A barrette?

532
00:59:18,292 --> 00:59:19,458
Here, let me.

533
00:59:24,375 --> 00:59:25,667
Let's try it on.

534
00:59:27,542 --> 00:59:28,792
Should I turn around?

535
00:59:28,958 --> 00:59:31,042
- It's dangerous.
- I almost fell.

536
00:59:47,958 --> 00:59:49,042
How is it?

537
00:59:50,583 --> 00:59:52,458
It looks really nice.

538
00:59:53,000 --> 00:59:55,583
- It'll look good when you're dancing.
- Really?

539
00:59:57,667 --> 01:00:00,708
I can't see it but thank you.

540
01:00:01,458 --> 01:00:03,833
- Happy birthday.
- Thanks.

541
01:00:26,625 --> 01:00:28,000
It's time.

542
01:00:52,500 --> 01:00:54,208
Hurry up!

543
01:00:54,833 --> 01:00:56,458
Wait.

544
01:00:57,500 --> 01:00:58,917
Are you ready?

545
01:01:08,958 --> 01:01:10,167
Careful!

546
01:01:14,375 --> 01:01:15,625
Ouch.

547
01:01:28,208 --> 01:01:31,792
Excuse us. This is for you.

548
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:37,292
Thank you.

549
01:01:45,958 --> 01:01:47,875
Oh right, today's...

550
01:01:48,750 --> 01:01:51,208
He never misses the monthly anniversary.

551
01:01:53,625 --> 01:01:55,917
- Respect.
- Yeah.

552
01:01:59,250 --> 01:02:01,500
CLOSED

553
01:02:01,750 --> 01:02:04,375
It's alright, hurry up.

554
01:02:04,750 --> 01:02:06,417
Is it okay to be in here?

555
01:02:07,292 --> 01:02:09,333
If we get caught, we'll just apologize.

556
01:02:14,542 --> 01:02:17,167
This is amazing.

557
01:02:21,875 --> 01:02:26,083
How can they breathe
when their mouths are always open?

558
01:02:26,625 --> 01:02:29,667
Fish breathe through their gills.
They're fine.

559
01:02:32,625 --> 01:02:34,167
What are those?

560
01:02:34,750 --> 01:02:36,417
They're pilchards, true sardines.

561
01:02:37,458 --> 01:02:38,792
What's that black one?

562
01:02:38,958 --> 01:02:40,208
- Which one?
- That one.

563
01:02:40,375 --> 01:02:41,917
That's a beard grunt.

564
01:02:42,500 --> 01:02:46,750
It's rare to see him out here.
He's usually hiding.

565
01:02:47,042 --> 01:02:49,667
Maybe he feels relaxed
when there's no one around.

566
01:02:52,792 --> 01:02:56,292
Why do you work here?

567
01:02:58,708 --> 01:03:02,375
These fish seem free,
but actually they're not.

568
01:03:03,000 --> 01:03:06,750
And they somehow make me
feel free from gravity.

569
01:03:07,875 --> 01:03:10,167
But it's mostly because I like fish.

570
01:03:12,083 --> 01:03:13,708
I like birds too.

571
01:03:13,917 --> 01:03:15,583
Then let's go hiking.

572
01:03:15,958 --> 01:03:19,667
I like the sea better.
Let's go to the sea.

573
01:03:19,958 --> 01:03:21,583
And Battleship Island.

574
01:03:21,833 --> 01:03:23,500
That's a lot to visit.

575
01:03:23,750 --> 01:03:25,000
What about you, Yo?

576
01:03:26,708 --> 01:03:28,000
Let me see.

577
01:03:29,375 --> 01:03:30,583
I'd like to eat sushi.

578
01:03:33,292 --> 01:03:35,583
Don't say that in front of the fish.

579
01:03:40,542 --> 01:03:47,000
Hey, doesn't it feel like
we're the only people on Earth?

580
01:03:47,917 --> 01:03:51,375
Yeah, it's so cool.

581
01:03:51,708 --> 01:03:52,875
Isn't it?

582
01:03:53,375 --> 01:03:56,667
- But I feel it more than you.
- No, I feel it too.

583
01:03:58,083 --> 01:03:59,208
Are you a teenager?

584
01:03:59,292 --> 01:04:02,792
No, I'm 30 today.
Sorry that I still sound like a teenager.

585
01:04:06,250 --> 01:04:09,458
Hey, Teruo. Look!

586
01:04:10,542 --> 01:04:11,875
It's all mine.

587
01:04:22,625 --> 01:04:24,208
Show me your dance.

588
01:04:24,417 --> 01:04:25,917
What? Here?

589
01:04:28,667 --> 01:04:30,125
Okay, then I'll dance.

590
01:04:33,333 --> 01:04:35,125
That's very nice.

591
01:05:11,000 --> 01:05:13,125
What's that? A fish?

592
01:05:13,292 --> 01:05:14,292
Yeah.

593
01:06:17,583 --> 01:06:20,958
- Oh my gosh.
- What?

594
01:06:44,625 --> 01:06:46,500
Wait, hold on.

595
01:06:46,708 --> 01:06:48,625
I can't. Not here.

596
01:07:05,833 --> 01:07:08,833
You could be a movie star.

597
01:07:09,750 --> 01:07:11,625
I really wouldn't want to do that.

598
01:07:12,542 --> 01:07:14,167
I'm being serious.

599
01:07:14,417 --> 01:07:16,542
Everyone wants to be a movie star.

600
01:07:18,375 --> 01:07:21,667
I'm not saying it right.

601
01:07:22,625 --> 01:07:26,708
I have everything planned out for me
and it's going just fine.

602
01:07:26,792 --> 01:07:29,083
Don't laugh, be serious.

603
01:07:31,167 --> 01:07:33,667
Sorry, you seemed to be enjoying it.

604
01:07:33,792 --> 01:07:35,542
You were in theater club, right?

605
01:07:35,792 --> 01:07:38,083
Careful! You're crazy!

606
01:07:38,792 --> 01:07:40,333
This is scary.

607
01:07:41,458 --> 01:07:43,917
Yeah, Jim made me an offer.

608
01:07:44,083 --> 01:07:45,500
Jim Jarmusch?

609
01:07:45,792 --> 01:07:47,583
I can only say Jim.

610
01:07:47,750 --> 01:07:49,458
Oh right. Jim Carrey?

611
01:07:53,208 --> 01:07:56,583
This is great, but are you sure
you should be using the taxi?

612
01:07:56,750 --> 01:07:59,042
I begged my boss.

613
01:07:59,167 --> 01:08:01,208
- And he said it was okay?
- Nope.

614
01:08:02,500 --> 01:08:04,333
They'll fire me if they find out.

615
01:08:04,458 --> 01:08:05,500
You're insane.

616
01:08:05,833 --> 01:08:08,292
Like I told you, I'm gonna be a mechanic.

617
01:08:08,417 --> 01:08:09,917
The camera's still rolling.

618
01:08:10,875 --> 01:08:13,917
How is this night sky drive, sir?

619
01:08:14,125 --> 01:08:16,042
It's the best.

620
01:08:16,375 --> 01:08:18,750
Wow, there's so many stars.

621
01:08:18,917 --> 01:08:21,042
It's like driving along the Milky Way.

622
01:08:23,500 --> 01:08:26,625
- The backstreet route.
- Doesn't that take longer?

623
01:08:26,833 --> 01:08:29,875
- I'm avoiding traffic.
- Oh, I see.

624
01:08:33,917 --> 01:08:36,667
So, where to, sir?

625
01:08:37,542 --> 01:08:40,292
Take me past that star.

626
01:08:42,083 --> 01:08:44,708
Fasten your seat-belt, please.

627
01:08:47,167 --> 01:08:48,958
And now you're fired.

628
01:08:49,125 --> 01:08:52,042
Yeah, I'm totally screwed.

629
01:08:52,625 --> 01:08:54,250
You could be a movie star.

630
01:08:54,417 --> 01:08:56,750
Like I told you,
I'm gonna be a mechanic.

631
01:09:04,667 --> 01:09:05,750
Is it lit?

632
01:09:06,000 --> 01:09:07,042
Yeah.

633
01:09:08,125 --> 01:09:11,792
- It's so pretty.
- I'm gonna get burned.

634
01:09:14,083 --> 01:09:15,292
It's so pretty.

635
01:09:17,000 --> 01:09:18,333
Twirl around.

636
01:09:30,708 --> 01:09:32,000
What's the matter?

637
01:09:33,458 --> 01:09:34,708
I was just thinking...

638
01:09:36,208 --> 01:09:37,708
people are living.

639
01:09:49,083 --> 01:09:50,208
What is it?

640
01:09:58,083 --> 01:10:00,083
I was just thinking how beautiful you are.

641
01:10:04,417 --> 01:10:05,542
Shut up.

642
01:10:13,333 --> 01:10:14,583
Teruo?

643
01:10:15,375 --> 01:10:17,250
Please stay well, and tomorrow too.

644
01:10:19,333 --> 01:10:21,000
What's gotten into you?

645
01:10:21,583 --> 01:10:23,333
And the day after tomorrow too.

646
01:10:24,042 --> 01:10:26,375
Please stay alive forever.

647
01:10:27,667 --> 01:10:28,958
You too, Yo.

648
01:10:29,875 --> 01:10:31,417
Health is my strong point.

649
01:10:53,333 --> 01:10:57,333
Winona Ryder is so cool.
She sticks to her guns.

650
01:10:58,042 --> 01:10:59,875
Yeah, she's cool.

651
01:11:02,083 --> 01:11:04,375
I don't even have a life plan.

652
01:11:05,667 --> 01:11:08,625
I'm just taking
a smooth detour through life.

653
01:11:12,250 --> 01:11:16,208
I'd take up that movie star offer,
even if I couldn't be one.

654
01:11:16,750 --> 01:11:19,583
Of course you could be one.

655
01:11:21,125 --> 01:11:23,083
I definitely want a family.

656
01:11:29,708 --> 01:11:30,958
It's nothing.

657
01:11:43,125 --> 01:11:45,667
What do you prefer, subtitles or dubs?

658
01:11:46,167 --> 01:11:47,542
Subtitles.

659
01:11:48,083 --> 01:11:49,292
Why?

660
01:11:49,625 --> 01:11:51,792
Because I can focus more on the movie.

661
01:11:52,833 --> 01:11:55,375
And I can hear the actors' own words.

662
01:11:57,167 --> 01:11:59,625
Why are there so many languages?

663
01:12:00,083 --> 01:12:01,333
What do you mean?

664
01:12:01,500 --> 01:12:05,667
It'd be a lot easier
if everybody spoke the same language.

665
01:12:10,208 --> 01:12:14,750
But words don't always convey
one's true feelings or thoughts.

666
01:12:16,042 --> 01:12:18,667
Some things don't even need words.

667
01:12:18,875 --> 01:12:20,583
Silence doesn't work.

668
01:12:28,042 --> 01:12:29,667
I'm watching the movie.

669
01:12:31,958 --> 01:12:34,750
Seems sad to only have three long candles.

670
01:12:34,958 --> 01:12:36,667
Maybe.

671
01:12:37,417 --> 01:12:39,750
Was it better with 30 short candles?

672
01:12:40,833 --> 01:12:43,292
Let's do that on your birthday.

673
01:12:43,458 --> 01:12:45,667
Please don't, seriously.

674
01:12:55,875 --> 01:12:57,083
Strawberry?

675
01:12:58,583 --> 01:13:00,333
I only want the strawberry.

676
01:13:07,167 --> 01:13:08,792
- It's good.
- It's so good.

677
01:13:15,417 --> 01:13:17,875
I'll propose to you
on my birthday next year.

678
01:13:21,417 --> 01:13:23,625
- What?
- Did I say something?

679
01:13:26,792 --> 01:13:29,750
Wait, yes, you said something.

680
01:13:29,917 --> 01:13:31,583
- No, I didn't.
- Yes, you did.

681
01:13:31,750 --> 01:13:33,708
- Did I?
- What did you just say?

682
01:13:41,667 --> 01:13:43,792
- You said something.
- Did I say something?

683
01:13:45,500 --> 01:13:48,625
Don't fool me. You taste like strawberry.

684
01:13:54,833 --> 01:13:57,792
You mean on your birthday next year?

685
01:13:58,125 --> 01:14:00,292
Or on mine? Mine's in May.

686
01:14:00,792 --> 01:14:03,042
Next year or tomorrow...

687
01:14:03,833 --> 01:14:05,000
Tomorrow?

688
01:14:06,750 --> 01:14:08,083
Tomorrow?

689
01:14:10,458 --> 01:14:12,083
I can't wait till tomorrow.

690
01:14:12,333 --> 01:14:15,375
- Tomorrow's so soon.
- Very soon.

691
01:14:15,583 --> 01:14:18,125
Tomorrow? Really?

692
01:14:18,833 --> 01:14:20,000
Great.

693
01:14:22,000 --> 01:14:23,292
Again?

694
01:14:23,708 --> 01:14:25,708
Isn't it too much?

695
01:14:25,875 --> 01:14:28,167
- Is that a no?
- I didn't say no.

696
01:14:28,375 --> 01:14:30,500
- So it's okay?
- Yeah.

697
01:14:36,667 --> 01:14:39,917
- You taste like cake.
- You too.

698
01:14:40,167 --> 01:14:43,125
- Really?
- Your face is full of cake.

699
01:14:44,667 --> 01:14:46,458
Full of cake.

700
01:15:29,833 --> 01:15:30,833
WHAT ABOUT TOMORROW?

701
01:15:30,917 --> 01:15:32,208
I HAVE A CLASS AND THEN WORK.

702
01:15:32,333 --> 01:15:33,333
OKAY.

703
01:15:33,417 --> 01:15:34,657
IT'LL RAIN TOMORROW. TAKE CARE.

704
01:15:50,125 --> 01:15:54,083
Do you mind if I take the backstreets
to avoid traffic?

705
01:15:54,333 --> 01:15:55,500
Okay.

706
01:15:55,958 --> 01:15:58,417
So, shall we meet at five o'clock?

707
01:15:58,917 --> 01:16:02,458
Yeah, it's all fine with me.

708
01:16:04,167 --> 01:16:06,542
Get yourself squeaky clean, okay?

709
01:16:06,750 --> 01:16:08,500
Okay, see you later.

710
01:16:16,833 --> 01:16:18,292
Hi, it's me.

711
01:16:20,167 --> 01:16:22,375
I have a meeting, so I'll be late today.

712
01:16:23,542 --> 01:16:25,292
I'll eat with Yuka tomorrow.

713
01:16:26,208 --> 01:16:30,125
What? It's work. I have no choice.

714
01:16:34,833 --> 01:16:35,917
Sorry.

715
01:16:37,917 --> 01:16:41,458
The taxi driver's pretty rough.
No, I'm all right.

716
01:16:43,042 --> 01:16:46,375
Anyway, tell Yuka for me, okay?

717
01:17:06,750 --> 01:17:08,042
Teruo?

718
01:17:11,333 --> 01:17:12,625
What's going on?

719
01:17:12,875 --> 01:17:14,625
No way.

720
01:17:14,792 --> 01:17:17,167
- Happy birthday.
- Thanks.

721
01:17:17,333 --> 01:17:20,125
- That's expensive stuff.
- I worked hard for that.

722
01:17:21,750 --> 01:17:23,958
Okay, guys, let's take a photo.

723
01:17:24,208 --> 01:17:25,625
You're too kind.

724
01:17:26,167 --> 01:17:28,917
- Please open it later.
- Closer.

725
01:17:29,417 --> 01:17:30,958
Say cheese.

726
01:17:31,625 --> 01:17:33,958
You're too rigid! Smile more.

727
01:17:34,208 --> 01:17:35,875
Say cheese.

728
01:17:38,250 --> 01:17:41,208
Thanks so much.

729
01:17:41,583 --> 01:17:45,583
You're welcome.
Please open it when I'm not around.

730
01:17:51,250 --> 01:17:52,958
Teruo, let's go.

731
01:18:28,083 --> 01:18:30,083
Are you okay?

732
01:18:30,667 --> 01:18:33,417
Yes, she said
she's gonna get some umbrellas.

733
01:18:34,208 --> 01:18:35,458
Your wife?

734
01:18:36,250 --> 01:18:38,375
Why don't you wait in my taxi?

735
01:18:38,500 --> 01:18:40,458
She'll be back very soon.

736
01:18:40,792 --> 01:18:42,833
- But...
- I'm fine.

737
01:18:43,792 --> 01:18:46,042
Hold this while I go look for her.

738
01:18:46,125 --> 01:18:47,333
Hey, wait.

739
01:19:50,750 --> 01:19:54,708
Teruo, come out with us
to celebrate your birthday.

740
01:19:54,917 --> 01:19:57,000
Thanks, but I have to work.

741
01:19:57,167 --> 01:19:58,792
When does it start?

742
01:19:58,917 --> 01:20:02,083
Soon. But thanks anyway.

743
01:20:02,667 --> 01:20:03,958
Good luck with work.

744
01:20:04,125 --> 01:20:06,417
- Thanks again for the present.
- It was nothing.

745
01:20:06,667 --> 01:20:09,458
- Gotta go. Good night.
- Sure, good night.

746
01:20:29,333 --> 01:20:31,208
Over here!

747
01:20:33,083 --> 01:20:34,917
What a relief.

748
01:20:35,125 --> 01:20:37,458
I'm sorry to have troubled you.

749
01:20:37,625 --> 01:20:39,792
I'm glad you met each other.

750
01:20:39,875 --> 01:20:41,083
Thanks.

751
01:20:44,083 --> 01:20:47,583
Thank you. We finally found each other.

752
01:20:52,917 --> 01:20:53,958
Thank you.

753
01:20:56,583 --> 01:21:00,750
TOMARI TREE

754
01:21:00,875 --> 01:21:02,875
Really? Then all's well.

755
01:21:03,625 --> 01:21:07,708
But my figures today were bad.
My boss was furious.

756
01:21:09,542 --> 01:21:11,417
There are always days like that.

757
01:21:12,292 --> 01:21:14,667
It was pointless to go looking for her.

758
01:21:15,083 --> 01:21:16,542
That's not true.

759
01:21:17,208 --> 01:21:20,667
They met each other because you helped
make his wish come true.

760
01:21:21,500 --> 01:21:22,750
That's how things go.

761
01:21:29,500 --> 01:21:32,292
He always goes there every year

762
01:21:32,958 --> 01:21:35,292
on the anniversary
of the day they first met.

763
01:21:36,708 --> 01:21:37,958
That's called love.

764
01:21:39,083 --> 01:21:41,000
Love is such a convenient word.

765
01:21:41,667 --> 01:21:44,167
I guess you don't understand love yet.

766
01:21:48,375 --> 01:21:49,375
Love?

767
01:21:51,417 --> 01:21:53,167
Is love something to cling on to?

768
01:21:54,292 --> 01:21:57,000
It's not about doing something.

769
01:21:58,250 --> 01:22:02,417
It's not about demanding
something in return either.

770
01:22:03,583 --> 01:22:04,750
After all...

771
01:22:06,167 --> 01:22:07,375
love is an escape route.

772
01:22:08,667 --> 01:22:09,708
Is it?

773
01:22:10,250 --> 01:22:11,375
That's why it's good.

774
01:22:12,500 --> 01:22:14,250
Not everyone's as strong as you think.

775
01:22:17,125 --> 01:22:19,542
Caring for each other.

776
01:22:20,083 --> 01:22:21,250
Trusting each other.

777
01:22:23,500 --> 01:22:25,667
What connects people...

778
01:22:27,083 --> 01:22:30,542
are feelings and thoughts.

779
01:22:31,875 --> 01:22:36,083
It all falls down
as soon as you put words to...

780
01:22:41,792 --> 01:22:43,542
And there goes the truth.

781
01:22:44,500 --> 01:22:45,875
You're such a wise man.

782
01:22:51,667 --> 01:22:53,458
One who's secretly in love.

783
01:22:54,500 --> 01:22:55,500
Still?

784
01:22:56,083 --> 01:22:57,208
I might give up soon.

785
01:22:59,542 --> 01:23:01,708
I'm a sucker for cute smiles.

786
01:23:02,042 --> 01:23:03,333
How's it going now?

787
01:23:03,875 --> 01:23:05,250
It doesn't matter.

788
01:23:08,042 --> 01:23:09,083
What about you?

789
01:23:11,792 --> 01:23:14,000
I don't know what he's thinking.

790
01:23:14,667 --> 01:23:16,167
You're not together yet?

791
01:23:16,792 --> 01:23:18,292
I'm ignoring him right now.

792
01:23:19,292 --> 01:23:21,375
- You had an argument?
- Not really.

793
01:23:25,458 --> 01:23:28,125
- Teruo's not coming today?
- He had to work.

794
01:23:29,625 --> 01:23:31,667
Right, it's Tuesday.

795
01:23:34,417 --> 01:23:36,000
I don't get it.

796
01:23:37,917 --> 01:23:40,958
He does message me
but he remains distant.

797
01:23:41,708 --> 01:23:44,000
At least that's the vibe I'm getting.

798
01:23:44,917 --> 01:23:49,042
I'm scared I'll lose myself
if we get together.

799
01:23:52,667 --> 01:23:53,833
Ouch.

800
01:23:58,250 --> 01:24:01,625
It's his birthday,
so I'll send him a little reply.

801
01:24:03,167 --> 01:24:06,000
But he doesn't really seem
like the birthday type.

802
01:24:06,458 --> 01:24:08,708
That's not for you to decide.

803
01:24:12,042 --> 01:24:13,375
Good evening.

804
01:24:13,917 --> 01:24:17,083
- Hey, good evening.
- I'm starving.

805
01:24:17,250 --> 01:24:20,000
What's the matter?
Would you like meat or rice?

806
01:24:20,167 --> 01:24:22,792
How about... both?

807
01:24:23,083 --> 01:24:25,500
Both? Okay.

808
01:24:26,958 --> 01:24:30,708
Okay then, time to take a hint.

809
01:24:32,542 --> 01:24:34,000
How about a drink?

810
01:24:34,208 --> 01:24:36,917
A wheat soda with two slices of lemon.

811
01:24:37,083 --> 01:24:38,625
Two slices of lemon? Okay.

812
01:24:40,167 --> 01:24:43,542
- Why are you so hungry today?
- I didn't have time to eat.

813
01:24:55,417 --> 01:24:57,625
Nohara, what's up?

814
01:25:04,875 --> 01:25:08,375
- What's this?
- Why? Wait!

815
01:25:08,708 --> 01:25:10,625
Wait!

816
01:25:10,708 --> 01:25:12,208
Hey, stop!

817
01:25:13,375 --> 01:25:15,708
- Why are you running?
- Why are you chasing me?

818
01:25:15,833 --> 01:25:19,167
- Because you're running.
- Yeah, because you're chasing me.

819
01:25:33,458 --> 01:25:34,750
What's the matter?

820
01:25:37,125 --> 01:25:40,583
Bad day at work?

821
01:25:44,625 --> 01:25:46,167
You're all sweaty.

822
01:25:49,125 --> 01:25:50,375
It stinks.

823
01:25:50,625 --> 01:25:52,625
I'm so sorry.

824
01:25:58,625 --> 01:25:59,875
It's painful.

825
01:26:00,833 --> 01:26:01,875
Okay.

826
01:26:03,958 --> 01:26:05,167
Regretful.

827
01:26:05,833 --> 01:26:07,042
Regretful.

828
01:26:09,750 --> 01:26:11,000
Stupid.

829
01:26:11,792 --> 01:26:13,083
I'm the stupid one.

830
01:26:17,417 --> 01:26:18,958
What are we?

831
01:26:19,875 --> 01:26:21,000
Huh?

832
01:26:21,833 --> 01:26:25,125
Sorry, don't answer that. I'm so stupid.

833
01:26:27,667 --> 01:26:30,292
But your heart's already saying it.

834
01:26:31,000 --> 01:26:33,417
What? Shut up.

835
01:26:34,917 --> 01:26:36,667
Let your heart speak too.

836
01:27:16,083 --> 01:27:17,083
What's this?

837
01:27:18,708 --> 01:27:19,875
Your birthday present.

838
01:27:20,708 --> 01:27:23,125
This is way too much!

839
01:27:23,750 --> 01:27:26,708
Thanks, I'm so happy.

840
01:27:27,667 --> 01:27:28,792
What is this?

841
01:27:41,125 --> 01:27:42,833
It's not rolling back.

842
01:28:00,500 --> 01:28:01,500
Thank you.

843
01:28:15,750 --> 01:28:17,167
It's stopped raining.

844
01:28:25,208 --> 01:28:26,792
What are you thinking about?

845
01:28:32,875 --> 01:28:36,917
Don't you think he's a bit slow,
from a professional point of view?

846
01:28:37,708 --> 01:28:39,958
Is that it?

847
01:28:40,208 --> 01:28:41,542
But really...

848
01:28:46,625 --> 01:28:47,792
Ouch!

849
01:29:01,792 --> 01:29:03,708
Please stop here.

850
01:29:17,000 --> 01:29:19,333
Since we became really close...

851
01:29:21,167 --> 01:29:24,833
I thought it would
screw things up if I said so.

852
01:29:27,375 --> 01:29:29,500
But I need to tell you.

853
01:29:37,458 --> 01:29:39,208
This is like some romantic movie.

854
01:29:40,833 --> 01:29:43,667
There should be some lovely music
playing right about now.

855
01:29:44,708 --> 01:29:45,958
What?

856
01:29:46,250 --> 01:29:47,542
Sorry, go on.

857
01:29:50,167 --> 01:29:51,458
Well...

858
01:29:53,583 --> 01:29:55,292
I want to be honest with you.

859
01:30:03,500 --> 01:30:04,875
What?

860
01:30:05,417 --> 01:30:08,583
I kinda lost it right there.

861
01:30:08,958 --> 01:30:10,583
- Huh?
- It's nothing.

862
01:30:11,292 --> 01:30:12,458
What?

863
01:30:14,458 --> 01:30:16,250
- It's nothing.
- What?

864
01:30:19,333 --> 01:30:20,333
Nothing.

865
01:30:21,375 --> 01:30:23,333
You can't back down now.

866
01:30:23,625 --> 01:30:24,667
What?

867
01:30:24,875 --> 01:30:29,208
I'm sorry, but it's better to say things
while you still can.

868
01:30:30,208 --> 01:30:31,833
I stopped the meter.

869
01:30:45,792 --> 01:30:46,958
Well...

870
01:31:00,083 --> 01:31:02,583
I don't want you to go home tonight.

871
01:31:05,042 --> 01:31:06,167
I mean...

872
01:31:06,875 --> 01:31:11,458
the way you say whatever's on your mind.

873
01:31:13,333 --> 01:31:16,750
The way you act before thinking.

874
01:31:19,167 --> 01:31:22,792
The way you act tough
when you're actually scared.

875
01:31:27,000 --> 01:31:28,333
And also...

876
01:31:31,458 --> 01:31:33,583
the way you laugh about everything.

877
01:31:34,625 --> 01:31:36,708
How you start dancing spontaneously.

878
01:31:39,375 --> 01:31:41,667
I love your strange voice.

879
01:31:43,667 --> 01:31:45,667
And I love your name, Yo Nohara.

880
01:31:59,458 --> 01:32:02,292
- Keep going.
- What?

881
01:32:07,333 --> 01:32:08,375
What?

882
01:32:11,708 --> 01:32:13,042
And so...

883
01:32:21,750 --> 01:32:24,333
- It's time for you to go.
- I know.

884
01:32:24,500 --> 01:32:26,708
Then hurry up.

885
01:32:26,875 --> 01:32:28,250
I'm sorry.

886
01:32:30,458 --> 01:32:33,917
- I'm going now.
- Good luck.

887
01:32:34,167 --> 01:32:36,417
- Your drink bottle.
- Thank you.

888
01:32:36,583 --> 01:32:38,375
Good luck.

889
01:32:47,167 --> 01:32:48,167
For you.

890
01:32:54,917 --> 01:32:57,333
They're beautiful. Thank you.

891
01:32:58,667 --> 01:33:00,125
I'm so happy.

892
01:33:07,125 --> 01:33:11,000
WE ARE PATHETIC

893
01:33:11,333 --> 01:33:13,625
- Thank you.
- Congratulations.

894
01:33:14,542 --> 01:33:15,792
Have a happy life.

895
01:33:16,292 --> 01:33:17,458
Together forever.

896
01:34:25,833 --> 01:34:29,500
Still I keep walking,
sometimes remembering.

897
01:34:29,667 --> 01:34:31,833
Waking up from one dream to another.

898
01:34:32,000 --> 01:34:33,958
Until I meet you, shining brightly.

899
01:35:24,208 --> 01:35:27,583
Thank you for coming to watch us tonight.

900
01:35:35,458 --> 01:35:38,458
I'm so happy our opening night
was a success.

901
01:35:39,000 --> 01:35:41,250
Thank you to those
who came to see us.

902
01:35:42,708 --> 01:35:45,125
Let's keep up the good work.

903
01:35:45,292 --> 01:35:46,458
We will.

904
01:35:47,000 --> 01:35:48,375
Let's become legendary.

905
01:35:49,833 --> 01:35:51,083
Cheers!

906
01:35:51,333 --> 01:35:53,333
Cheers!

907
01:35:58,542 --> 01:36:02,917
- Well done.
- Thank you.

908
01:36:06,500 --> 01:36:09,667
Well done.

909
01:36:12,750 --> 01:36:13,958
Hey, it's Yo!

910
01:36:14,125 --> 01:36:16,000
- Good work.
- So happy to see you!

911
01:36:16,167 --> 01:36:17,917
Thanks for coming.

912
01:36:22,667 --> 01:36:23,708
How was it?

913
01:36:27,875 --> 01:36:29,167
- It was good.
- Really?

914
01:36:29,333 --> 01:36:31,958
It was, wasn't it? Honestly...

915
01:36:32,875 --> 01:36:34,083
I think it went great.

916
01:36:34,750 --> 01:36:38,917
I know it sounds weird for me to say it,
but we were perfect.

917
01:36:39,000 --> 01:36:40,125
Satsuki.

918
01:36:40,833 --> 01:36:42,125
We'll talk later.

919
01:36:50,167 --> 01:36:51,583
Is that really all?

920
01:36:53,208 --> 01:36:55,750
You looked like you had more to say.

921
01:36:58,375 --> 01:37:00,458
It's their first night, so...

922
01:37:02,417 --> 01:37:06,208
Imagine that I'm Satsuki and try it on me.

923
01:37:06,292 --> 01:37:07,375
No.

924
01:37:09,708 --> 01:37:10,917
Well...

925
01:37:13,708 --> 01:37:16,708
tonight's performance was good.

926
01:37:17,667 --> 01:37:21,875
But the play itself was a bit off.

927
01:37:23,583 --> 01:37:25,958
Honestly, I thought it was a failure.

928
01:37:29,083 --> 01:37:31,333
Incorporating dance into it is fine...

929
01:37:32,250 --> 01:37:36,167
but even though the dancers
are part of the play,

930
01:37:36,292 --> 01:37:37,917
they didn't seem to fit in.

931
01:37:38,208 --> 01:37:40,625
Maybe the dances were too beautiful.

932
01:37:42,625 --> 01:37:44,292
I choreographed the dancing.

933
01:37:45,000 --> 01:37:47,958
- Oh, you're the choreographer?
- And a dancer too.

934
01:37:52,250 --> 01:37:53,458
Yes.

935
01:37:57,375 --> 01:37:59,000
What's going on?

936
01:38:21,167 --> 01:38:23,667
Congratulations!

937
01:38:57,000 --> 01:38:58,875
Wait, what?

938
01:39:02,667 --> 01:39:04,292
Oh, my bag.

939
01:39:13,125 --> 01:39:16,833
Hello! Is anyone there?

940
01:39:18,167 --> 01:39:19,500
Anybody?

941
01:39:26,500 --> 01:39:27,958
What are you doing?

942
01:39:29,542 --> 01:39:30,917
It's closing time.

943
01:39:33,708 --> 01:39:34,875
I'm just...

944
01:39:36,833 --> 01:39:38,167
bouldering?

945
01:39:59,500 --> 01:40:01,750
I'm sorry about everything.

946
01:40:02,000 --> 01:40:04,917
No, it's all right.

947
01:40:06,833 --> 01:40:08,375
You clicked your tongue.

948
01:40:08,583 --> 01:40:10,917
What? No, I didn't.

949
01:40:11,333 --> 01:40:14,625
I can see it in your eyes.

950
01:40:14,917 --> 01:40:16,000
No way.

951
01:40:16,875 --> 01:40:19,083
- Now that was for real.
- No.

952
01:40:21,750 --> 01:40:26,625
Now that's definitely
your tongue clicking.

953
01:40:29,917 --> 01:40:33,125
- Did I click my tongue?
- Huh?

954
01:40:33,458 --> 01:40:34,917
Yes, a few times.

955
01:40:37,333 --> 01:40:38,792
Is it a habit?

956
01:40:39,000 --> 01:40:40,833
- Not at all.
- Oh, okay.

957
01:40:45,375 --> 01:40:47,708
What was that? A habit?

958
01:40:47,875 --> 01:40:53,208
- Buy me a beer.
- A beer? Of course, definitely.

959
01:40:55,083 --> 01:41:00,000
- My tongue might stop clicking then.
- Just like hiccups?

960
01:41:08,583 --> 01:41:10,833
Defeated on opening night.

961
01:41:11,542 --> 01:41:13,083
I'm really sorry.

962
01:41:14,167 --> 01:41:15,875
And on your birthday too, right?

963
01:41:18,125 --> 01:41:19,792
But at least you were honest.

964
01:41:20,917 --> 01:41:22,083
Yes.

965
01:41:27,208 --> 01:41:29,417
I think you're right.

966
01:41:30,167 --> 01:41:31,917
- What did I say again?
- Huh?

967
01:41:32,208 --> 01:41:34,417
That the dancing was too beautiful.

968
01:41:36,917 --> 01:41:42,167
It was the first time I got to do
the choreography for a play.

969
01:41:42,667 --> 01:41:44,792
I wasn't so sure of myself.

970
01:41:48,167 --> 01:41:51,125
I'm cocky enough to criticize others,

971
01:41:51,500 --> 01:41:53,708
but I've also been told I'm bad.

972
01:41:55,708 --> 01:41:57,542
I used to act.

973
01:41:57,958 --> 01:42:01,500
Really? You don't act anymore?

974
01:42:04,333 --> 01:42:06,042
Nice music.

975
01:42:10,833 --> 01:42:12,333
What was that?

976
01:42:12,917 --> 01:42:15,625
You're dead if you miss the spots.

977
01:42:15,792 --> 01:42:17,292
That's impossible.

978
01:42:18,083 --> 01:42:19,958
- Like this?
- Yeah, like that.

979
01:42:20,958 --> 01:42:22,750
- There's no spot there.
- There is.

980
01:42:25,917 --> 01:42:27,000
You're dead.

981
01:42:29,583 --> 01:42:32,792
My name is Teruo Saeki.

982
01:42:35,417 --> 01:42:37,958
- What's yours?
- Not gonna tell you.

983
01:42:39,458 --> 01:42:41,125
We won't meet again anyway.

984
01:43:08,333 --> 01:43:09,667
You were watching us closely.

985
01:43:13,208 --> 01:43:14,333
Yes, yes.

986
01:43:20,000 --> 01:43:21,875
- How am I?
- Good.

987
01:43:22,000 --> 01:43:23,042
Don't lie.

988
01:43:27,167 --> 01:43:28,333
What now?

989
01:43:29,875 --> 01:43:31,083
- Me, dance?
- Please dance.

990
01:43:34,875 --> 01:43:35,917
Excellent.

991
01:43:37,500 --> 01:43:39,500
Okay then, what should I do?

992
01:43:41,458 --> 01:43:42,625
Pull.

993
01:43:45,667 --> 01:43:47,042
- Fly.
- Fly?

994
01:43:49,500 --> 01:43:50,875
Fly again.

995
01:43:54,333 --> 01:43:55,500
Pull.

996
01:44:00,500 --> 01:44:02,208
- Copy me.
- Okay.

997
01:44:03,042 --> 01:44:07,125
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven...

998
01:44:07,375 --> 01:44:10,792
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven...

999
01:44:10,875 --> 01:44:11,875
Good.

1000
01:44:11,958 --> 01:44:15,375
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven...

1001
01:44:16,708 --> 01:44:18,042
And again.

1002
01:44:26,250 --> 01:44:27,250
I'm flying!

1003
01:44:33,542 --> 01:44:35,625
- Wanna fly again?
- Wait.

1004
01:44:38,750 --> 01:44:39,833
I'm flying!

1005
01:45:12,875 --> 01:45:15,750
I'm sorry, I can't find the way out.

1006
01:45:18,167 --> 01:45:19,625
Let me show you.

1007
01:45:21,917 --> 01:45:23,167
Thank you.

1008
01:45:29,333 --> 01:45:30,917
Have we met before?

1009
01:45:35,375 --> 01:45:37,042
I have the feeling we have.

1010
01:45:46,333 --> 01:45:49,000
Yes, a couple of times.

1011
01:46:16,875 --> 01:46:18,042
All set?

1012
01:46:42,000 --> 01:46:46,917
TUESDAY, JULY 27

1013
01:47:15,708 --> 01:47:17,875
What are you thinking about?

1014
01:47:19,250 --> 01:47:20,458
Just stuff.

1015
01:47:21,833 --> 01:47:25,583
Done. What do you think?

1016
01:47:26,500 --> 01:47:28,958
I told you that the cream comes first.

1017
01:47:29,708 --> 01:47:34,792
The cream, you know,
the ones that look like raindrops.

1018
01:47:36,375 --> 01:47:38,917
Yes, but don't make them so big.

1019
01:47:39,083 --> 01:47:43,417
A bit more pointed, like a candle.

1020
01:47:48,917 --> 01:47:50,583
- Okay.
- Where's the plate?

1021
01:47:51,208 --> 01:47:54,042
- What?
- It was here.

1022
01:47:54,250 --> 01:47:57,708
- In the fridge?
- Oh, I see.

1023
01:48:02,667 --> 01:48:04,125
What do you think?

1024
01:48:04,500 --> 01:48:06,125
- It's nice.
- Is it?

1025
01:48:06,917 --> 01:48:10,417
But you're so flexible.

1026
01:48:10,833 --> 01:48:12,042
You think so?

1027
01:48:13,000 --> 01:48:15,417
He's so cute when he's lost.

1028
01:48:15,583 --> 01:48:16,583
Here we go.

1029
01:48:18,250 --> 01:48:20,125
To celebrate your mom's delivery day.

1030
01:48:22,417 --> 01:48:24,208
Thanks so much.

1031
01:48:24,792 --> 01:48:26,000
Open up wide.

1032
01:48:32,417 --> 01:48:33,833
It's too big!

1033
01:49:15,917 --> 01:49:17,167
Welcome back.

1034
01:49:18,000 --> 01:49:19,417
Sorry, did I wake you?

1035
01:49:19,875 --> 01:49:20,917
No, don't worry.

1036
01:49:24,708 --> 01:49:27,333
Business was bad today.

1037
01:49:30,375 --> 01:49:31,875
What's with the cake?

1038
01:49:33,125 --> 01:49:34,875
I just craved something sweet.

1039
01:49:36,417 --> 01:49:38,250
Want it now? I'll make some tea.

1040
01:49:38,333 --> 01:49:40,625
No, let's have it tomorrow.

1041
01:49:41,083 --> 01:49:42,333
Weren't you craving some?

1042
01:49:42,667 --> 01:49:45,917
Nah, let's have it tomorrow.

1043
01:49:47,125 --> 01:49:50,417
Okay then. Well, good night.

1044
01:49:50,625 --> 01:49:51,917
Good night.

1045
01:51:18,208 --> 01:51:23,500
JUST REMEMBERING

"
Level Five,https://yts-subs.com/movie-imdb/tt0116866,https://yts-subs.com/subtitles/level-five-1997-english-yify-481235,"1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Level Five (1997)

2
00:00:44,196 --> 00:00:46,738
What can these be

3
00:00:46,863 --> 00:00:48,986
but the playthings of a mad God

4
00:00:49,111 --> 00:00:51,944
who made us to build them for him?

5
00:00:53,278 --> 00:00:54,820
Imagine Neanderthal man glimpsing

6
00:00:54,945 --> 00:00:58,071
with this vision in his head:

7
00:00:58,196 --> 00:01:00,729
a flash of city at night,

8
00:01:00,985 --> 00:01:03,853
all motion and light.

9
00:01:04,445 --> 00:01:07,442
He cannot tell what it means,

10
00:01:07,902 --> 00:01:10,444
he has had a poetic vision,

11
00:01:10,569 --> 00:01:13,022
all motion and light,

12
00:01:13,651 --> 00:01:18,234
A sea of lights,
he cannnot unravel the images

13
00:01:18,359 --> 00:01:21,276
that land in his mind,

14
00:01:21,401 --> 00:01:23,439
like birds,

15
00:01:23,733 --> 00:01:27,857
swift, unreachable birds.

16
00:01:27,982 --> 00:01:30,518
Thoughts, memories, visions

17
00:01:30,899 --> 00:01:32,936
are the same to him,

18
00:01:33,399 --> 00:01:36,894
a scary hallucination.

19
00:01:38,023 --> 00:01:40,189
Such was William Gibson's vision

20
00:01:40,314 --> 00:01:44,936
when he wrote Neuromancer
and invented Cyberspace:

21
00:01:45,648 --> 00:01:49,013
He saw a Sargasso Sea,

22
00:01:49,354 --> 00:01:53,605
full of binary algae.
On that image we Neanderthals

23
00:01:53,730 --> 00:01:56,855
grafted our own visions,

24
00:01:56,980 --> 00:01:59,146
our thoughts and memories,

25
00:01:59,271 --> 00:02:02,222
our pitiful scraps of information.

26
00:02:05,479 --> 00:02:08,974
But none of us knows what a city is.

27
00:02:13,436 --> 00:02:16,518
This is the stuff you used to write.

28
00:02:17,144 --> 00:02:21,386
You wrote at night, late,
sitting at the computer,

29
00:02:22,352 --> 00:02:23,976
before you logged out.

30
00:02:25,769 --> 00:02:29,300
I'd find it in the morning
when I logged in.

31
00:02:31,268 --> 00:02:34,182
You had been working at your game,

32
00:02:35,810 --> 00:02:39,140
and I was about to work on my book.

33
00:02:41,559 --> 00:02:45,504
Computer at night, barnow's delight.

34
00:02:46,973 --> 00:02:50,055
Computer in the morning,
tomcat's warning.

35
00:02:53,974 --> 00:02:56,093
You said we were two eights,

36
00:02:57,723 --> 00:02:59,760
eight hours for you,

37
00:03:00,805 --> 00:03:02,844
eight hours for me,

38
00:03:05,139 --> 00:03:07,805
eight hours for us both.

39
00:05:45,541 --> 00:05:48,726
Okinawa was sacrificed!

40
00:05:56,621 --> 00:06:02,620
Why do material objects
display such endless,

41
00:06:02,745 --> 00:06:04,703
willful mockery?

42
00:06:04,828 --> 00:06:07,703
If it could be turned to energy,

43
00:06:07,828 --> 00:06:10,371
the world coud do without oil.

44
00:06:10,496 --> 00:06:13,035
Why is it whenever I ask friends

45
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:18,232
to taste my Tarte Tatin,
my speciality, my triumph.

46
00:06:19,119 --> 00:06:22,946
All the teaspoons dematerialise?

47
00:06:23,743 --> 00:06:26,492
And why at coffee time

48
00:06:26,868 --> 00:06:30,032
do we stir the sugar with forks?

49
00:06:30,701 --> 00:06:32,407
So shaming.

50
00:06:34,201 --> 00:06:36,993
And why does a monkey

51
00:06:37,118 --> 00:06:39,902
steal one of my socks every night,
just one,

52
00:06:40,782 --> 00:06:43,991
to see me scrabble in the morning

53
00:06:44,116 --> 00:06:47,776
and leave with odd socks?

54
00:06:49,866 --> 00:06:51,902
Shame again.

55
00:06:52,781 --> 00:06:54,901
Not to mention the computer.

56
00:06:55,615 --> 00:06:57,323
Bombs everywhere,

57
00:06:57,448 --> 00:07:00,529
Application ""Unknown"".
System unexpectedly quit.

58
00:07:00,654 --> 00:07:02,863
Type 14 error.

59
00:07:02,988 --> 00:07:05,655
Type 13 would be prettier,

60
00:07:05,780 --> 00:07:08,316
but it's always type 14.

61
00:07:09,572 --> 00:07:13,196
Is that what general Ushijima thought

62
00:07:13,321 --> 00:07:16,235
when he saw victory slip away?

63
00:07:18,404 --> 00:07:21,769
When war displayed
the stubborn willfulness

64
00:07:22,361 --> 00:07:25,395
of material objects?

65
00:07:27,945 --> 00:07:30,183
All that strategy,

66
00:07:31,194 --> 00:07:33,944
all that loyalty to the Emperor,

67
00:07:34,069 --> 00:07:37,360
and the malignity of objects
stole an army as neatly

68
00:07:37,485 --> 00:07:41,526
as monkeys steal socks.

69
00:07:42,651 --> 00:07:44,401
I thought the Game would

70
00:07:44,526 --> 00:07:47,401
rectify this malignant fate.

71
00:07:47,526 --> 00:07:49,895
The 9th Division stuck in Formosa?

72
00:07:51,026 --> 00:07:53,858
So I create a ""Formosa"" sub-program,

73
00:07:53,983 --> 00:07:56,400
I ask for the 9th
Division's intervention.

74
00:07:56,525 --> 00:08:00,683
You're kidding! ""Access denied"".

75
00:08:00,900 --> 00:08:03,566
If I insist, the sub-program vanishes.

76
00:08:03,691 --> 00:08:07,601
If I insist again, the system crashes.

77
00:08:09,523 --> 00:08:12,105
The beginning is strange.

78
00:08:12,230 --> 00:08:15,481
Landing April 1st sounds foolish.

79
00:08:15,606 --> 00:08:18,686
It's Sunday, like Pearl Harbour.

80
00:08:19,980 --> 00:08:23,479
The Americans expect a bloodbath,

81
00:08:23,604 --> 00:08:25,643
like in the other islands.

82
00:08:26,896 --> 00:08:29,349
They land on the beach.

83
00:08:30,270 --> 00:08:32,308
No reaction.

84
00:08:32,561 --> 00:08:35,265
No reception commitee.

85
00:08:36,021 --> 00:08:39,144
They reach the Japanese forts,
find them abandoned,

86
00:08:39,269 --> 00:08:43,429
yet intact: the bombs
didn't work.

87
00:08:44,145 --> 00:08:47,769
So why did the Japanese leave?

88
00:08:47,894 --> 00:08:51,644
Ushijima, watching
from the Shuri heights,

89
00:08:51,769 --> 00:08:54,769
waits for planes to decimate

90
00:08:54,894 --> 00:08:57,476
those idiot Yanks
trapped on the beaches.

91
00:08:57,601 --> 00:08:59,639
No planes.

92
00:09:00,934 --> 00:09:04,265
For both sides, nothing
goes as planned.

93
00:09:06,101 --> 00:09:08,267
I'll sort this mess out.

94
00:09:08,392 --> 00:09:12,434
Put the Japanese back in their bunkers,

95
00:09:12,559 --> 00:09:14,017
bring in planes.

96
00:09:14,142 --> 00:09:17,600
Sounds easier to move symbols

97
00:09:17,725 --> 00:09:20,182
than real planes...

98
00:09:20,307 --> 00:09:22,724
But no. ""Request denied"".

99
00:09:22,849 --> 00:09:25,891
And here I am with my codes

100
00:09:26,016 --> 00:09:28,640
that don't enter, my access denied,

101
00:09:28,765 --> 00:09:31,004
my type 14 errors...

102
00:09:34,306 --> 00:09:36,344
And my calling on you.

103
00:09:38,429 --> 00:09:41,722
One day I'll give Chris all this stuff

104
00:09:41,847 --> 00:09:43,847
for him to try to do something.

105
00:09:43,972 --> 00:09:46,929
A game that won't work,
a woman going loony...

106
00:09:47,054 --> 00:09:50,585
We'll see what he can do,
the editing wunderkind.

107
00:09:54,013 --> 00:09:56,796
That's where I came in.

108
00:09:57,095 --> 00:09:59,136
At that point in my life
I was readier for other people's images

109
00:09:59,261 --> 00:10:01,135
than my own.

110
00:10:01,260 --> 00:10:04,793
Laura's challenge fired me up.

111
00:10:04,970 --> 00:10:07,344
I began with their trip to Tokyo.

112
00:10:07,469 --> 00:10:10,844
Like them I loved the city.

113
00:10:10,969 --> 00:10:14,132
And the Game offered me
a new way in WWII.

114
00:10:14,344 --> 00:10:18,384
I'd become so Japanese I shared
their collective amnesia.

115
00:10:18,718 --> 00:10:21,550
As if the War'd never happened.

116
00:11:12,588 --> 00:11:16,253
I feel the Japanese have changed a lot.

117
00:11:16,378 --> 00:11:21,045
I feel they want to bury
their whole past,

118
00:11:21,170 --> 00:11:22,878
World War II...

119
00:11:23,003 --> 00:11:25,419
Japanese people

120
00:11:25,544 --> 00:11:28,210
tend to avoid facing that issue.

121
00:11:29,669 --> 00:11:33,377
It's a tragedy that's affected
my whole life.

122
00:11:33,502 --> 00:11:36,877
Yet it contains a depth,

123
00:11:37,002 --> 00:11:41,293
a kind of life so strong and vivid

124
00:11:41,418 --> 00:11:46,834
that today we cannot approach

125
00:11:46,959 --> 00:11:49,577
that kind of intensity.

126
00:11:55,583 --> 00:11:57,750
There's some kind of madness, in fact,

127
00:11:57,875 --> 00:11:59,457
about WWII.

128
00:11:59,582 --> 00:12:03,790
It's not nostalgia, I'm not nostalgic

129
00:12:03,915 --> 00:12:05,665
about that era.

130
00:12:05,790 --> 00:12:07,498
But those who lived through it

131
00:12:07,623 --> 00:12:11,998
find something missing today.

132
00:12:12,123 --> 00:12:16,032
Some of that was worthwhile.

133
00:12:17,289 --> 00:12:22,745
Which is not to belittle the atrocities

134
00:12:22,870 --> 00:12:25,246
perpetrated by the Japanese military.

135
00:12:25,371 --> 00:12:29,234
But having to define who one is,

136
00:12:29,371 --> 00:12:33,453
having to fight to the very end,

137
00:12:33,578 --> 00:12:36,035
means facing

138
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:42,702
something which alters
your whole perception of life

139
00:12:42,827 --> 00:12:46,442
in the face of something crucial.

140
00:12:50,785 --> 00:12:53,618
I want to tease the computer,

141
00:12:53,743 --> 00:12:56,784
like we used to, fool about with it,

142
00:12:56,909 --> 00:13:00,322
turn its neurons inside out.

143
00:13:00,701 --> 00:13:05,322
In Logo, for instance,
a noun for a verb.

144
00:13:10,868 --> 00:13:14,906
""Dog"" and the computer is foxed,

145
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:19,449
It doesn't know what to answer and
confesses: ""I don't know how to dog"".

146
00:13:19,574 --> 00:13:21,610
""Sardine"":

147
00:13:25,906 --> 00:13:27,782
It doesn't know how to sardine,

148
00:13:27,907 --> 00:13:29,944
Or ""Cauliflower"":

149
00:13:31,196 --> 00:13:33,068
""I don't know how to cauliflower"".

150
00:13:34,446 --> 00:13:37,859
So humiliating for a computer
not knowing how to cauliflower.

151
00:13:38,822 --> 00:13:41,696
""Tortoise"":
""I don't know how to tortoise"".

152
00:13:41,821 --> 00:13:45,029
""Rhododendron""...
""Cake-slice""...

153
00:13:45,154 --> 00:13:47,191
""Eiffel Tower""...

154
00:13:48,904 --> 00:13:50,941
""Shoe"":

155
00:13:51,820 --> 00:13:54,308
""I don't know how to shoe"".

156
00:14:00,652 --> 00:14:05,938
I remember an abandoned shoe,
one night.

157
00:14:07,860 --> 00:14:11,935
It was in a crosswalk, alone, derelict.

158
00:14:13,818 --> 00:14:17,609
No one had picked it up.
No one had run over it.

159
00:14:17,734 --> 00:14:19,771
Another night,

160
00:14:20,984 --> 00:14:23,021
it was still there.

161
00:14:23,192 --> 00:14:27,068
As if the citizens of Paris
had no interest or found superflous

162
00:14:27,193 --> 00:14:30,272
to deal with abandoned shoes.

163
00:14:33,066 --> 00:14:36,183
Maybe an unknown woman
left her shoe every night

164
00:14:37,482 --> 00:14:40,266
in the crosswalk.

165
00:14:54,855 --> 00:14:56,892
Welcome to OWL.

166
00:14:58,979 --> 00:15:01,017
Optional World Link.

167
00:15:02,061 --> 00:15:06,471
This terminal will give you access
to all available networks:

168
00:15:09,561 --> 00:15:12,770
Radio, television, news networks,

169
00:15:12,895 --> 00:15:18,019
whether they exist or not,
present or future.

170
00:15:18,144 --> 00:15:21,769
Bits have replaced savings.

171
00:15:21,894 --> 00:15:25,176
Gold and dollar belong in the past.

172
00:15:27,144 --> 00:15:31,800
Right here, feel the beating
of the heart of the future.

173
00:15:34,101 --> 00:15:36,139
The Knowledge-standard!

174
00:16:26,263 --> 00:16:28,260
Ah, the Network!

175
00:16:28,385 --> 00:16:32,010
That was
Wladimir Zakrjevski's contribution,

176
00:16:32,135 --> 00:16:33,595
the genious of the banks.

177
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:37,177
The Network's Network, that gave you
a free connection

178
00:16:37,302 --> 00:16:40,466
to databanks worldwide.

179
00:16:41,052 --> 00:16:44,260
In pre-historic times
people used pseudonyms.

180
00:16:44,385 --> 00:16:47,999
Here they wore virtual masks.

181
00:16:48,384 --> 00:16:50,884
Laura spent time cyberlooking

182
00:16:51,009 --> 00:16:54,843
for Okinawa witnesses and informants,

183
00:16:54,968 --> 00:16:58,258
but, like in any other network,
she found all sorts of things.

184
00:16:58,383 --> 00:17:01,758
Rumour had it initiates could

185
00:17:01,883 --> 00:17:04,883
plug into other people's
nervous system. So they said anyway.

186
00:18:03,085 --> 00:18:07,244
Yesterday I had
a strange exchange on OWL.

187
00:18:07,751 --> 00:18:09,793
A guy said:

188
00:18:09,918 --> 00:18:12,122
""Good evening, Michel.

189
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,750
I just took something to sleep.

190
00:18:16,875 --> 00:18:18,913
I won't wake up.

191
00:18:19,667 --> 00:18:22,618
I feel so calm.

192
00:18:24,916 --> 00:18:28,207
Before dying, I want to make a gift

193
00:18:28,332 --> 00:18:31,746
of the kind my contemporaries
can appreciate.

194
00:18:32,208 --> 00:18:35,785
One last phone call before I go.

195
00:18:37,165 --> 00:18:40,745
I am well-known, you see,
very well-known.

196
00:18:42,081 --> 00:18:45,825
Tomorrow my name
will be in all the papers.

197
00:18:46,915 --> 00:18:51,535
And yours too, if you say
you're the last person

198
00:18:51,913 --> 00:18:54,696
I spoke to before I left.

199
00:18:56,578 --> 00:18:59,281
So I make this gift.

200
00:19:00,579 --> 00:19:02,900
The last words of...

201
00:19:03,995 --> 00:19:07,941
You'll see tomorrow in the papers,
I'm not fooling, you see?""

202
00:19:09,994 --> 00:19:13,655
I answered:
""I think you're fooling,

203
00:19:14,910 --> 00:19:17,233
because I know about death,

204
00:19:18,202 --> 00:19:20,240
I know it well,

205
00:19:21,327 --> 00:19:23,364
I know it by heart.

206
00:19:24,700 --> 00:19:30,201
And we could still talk
even if you said

207
00:19:30,326 --> 00:19:32,529
you were dead.

208
00:19:33,908 --> 00:19:36,657
Because the man I loved is dead

209
00:19:37,117 --> 00:19:39,154
and I talk to him every night.

210
00:19:40,742 --> 00:19:42,779
Good night, Michel.""

211
00:19:51,615 --> 00:19:55,063
The next day there was
nothing in the papers.

212
00:19:56,532 --> 00:19:58,985
At first, I thought

213
00:20:00,698 --> 00:20:05,319
that he was fooling,
that he was a nobody.

214
00:20:07,990 --> 00:20:12,196
But there's a dark space there.

215
00:20:13,113 --> 00:20:15,150
Thinking back on it.

216
00:20:15,696 --> 00:20:17,732
Nothing in the press.

217
00:20:20,070 --> 00:20:24,194
But what if the death part

218
00:20:24,653 --> 00:20:28,148
wasn't fooling, only the fame part?

219
00:20:29,236 --> 00:20:32,931
What if he'd only lied when he said

220
00:20:34,194 --> 00:20:36,517
""I am well-known"",

221
00:20:38,360 --> 00:20:41,606
to make me believe before he died

222
00:20:44,026 --> 00:20:46,147
he was someone else,

223
00:20:47,318 --> 00:20:50,896
and I deprived him of that pleasure,

224
00:20:51,275 --> 00:20:53,515
one last joy before dying?

225
00:20:58,692 --> 00:21:00,607
And I thought I've never

226
00:21:00,732 --> 00:21:04,774
mentioned you to a stranger before.

227
00:21:11,606 --> 00:21:14,940
He died somewhat mysteriously
after the trip to Okinawa.

228
00:21:15,065 --> 00:21:19,440
For those who love premonition signs,

229
00:21:19,565 --> 00:21:22,939
his last images were shot
in the foreign graveyard of Naha.

230
00:21:23,064 --> 00:21:26,772
He said it'd be good to lie
among the decaying tombs

231
00:21:26,897 --> 00:21:31,189
of the combatants of all the useless
wars, including that of Commodore Perry's.

232
00:21:31,314 --> 00:21:34,311
92 years before MacArthur,
Perry came unasked

233
00:21:34,436 --> 00:21:37,021
to Shuri Castle,

234
00:21:37,146 --> 00:21:40,853
that World War II would turn to dust,

235
00:21:40,978 --> 00:21:43,561
whilst modernising Japan.

236
00:21:43,686 --> 00:21:47,353
As if this country needed a US soldier

237
00:21:47,478 --> 00:21:49,930
each century to enter a new era.

238
00:21:50,519 --> 00:21:54,227
Beside Perry's tomb he'd
explained Oshima's comment,

239
00:21:54,352 --> 00:21:56,477
his: ""Okinawa was sacrificed!"".

240
00:21:56,602 --> 00:21:59,976
Sute-Ishi, a term from the game Go:

241
00:22:00,101 --> 00:22:02,518
It means sacrificing a piece

242
00:22:02,643 --> 00:22:05,013
to save a game.

243
00:22:23,057 --> 00:22:26,766
If you cut... the root.

244
00:22:26,891 --> 00:22:30,421
If you cut life at the root.

245
00:22:30,848 --> 00:22:33,468
If you are cut from the root of life,

246
00:22:34,556 --> 00:22:39,546
you die. If...
In any strategic technique,

247
00:22:40,764 --> 00:22:44,723
you need to consider saving yourself

248
00:22:44,848 --> 00:22:49,384
and sacrificing a victory card.

249
00:22:51,055 --> 00:22:54,004
If we speak of Okinawa

250
00:22:55,511 --> 00:22:59,208
with respect to Japan's main island,

251
00:23:00,136 --> 00:23:03,336
such was the sacrifice.

252
00:23:10,469 --> 00:23:13,926
The battle was lost in advance,

253
00:23:14,051 --> 00:23:17,968
a battle the Japanese army

254
00:23:18,093 --> 00:23:22,051
had no chance of winning.

255
00:23:22,176 --> 00:23:26,342
It was inscribed
in the context of defeat.

256
00:23:26,467 --> 00:23:31,467
And because that was the context,

257
00:23:31,592 --> 00:23:37,049
the purpose was to fix the aftermath,

258
00:23:37,174 --> 00:23:39,716
and reinforce the ""Tennosei"",
the imperial system,

259
00:23:39,841 --> 00:23:43,799
which had to survive
to the military defeat.

260
00:23:43,924 --> 00:23:49,381
Another direct consecuence

261
00:23:49,506 --> 00:23:52,631
inscribed in this context of defeat,

262
00:23:52,756 --> 00:23:56,839
was that no effort was made

263
00:23:56,964 --> 00:24:02,672
to protect the civilian population,

264
00:24:02,797 --> 00:24:08,047
so civilian casualties far outnumbered

265
00:24:08,172 --> 00:24:12,129
military casualties.

266
00:24:12,254 --> 00:24:18,294
It's true that Okinawa
was a horrendous battle.

267
00:24:18,419 --> 00:24:22,378
Nothing remains, no culture heritage,

268
00:24:22,503 --> 00:24:25,752
no culture from the past.

269
00:24:25,877 --> 00:24:28,334
Everything was destroyed,

270
00:24:28,459 --> 00:24:31,044
utterly destroyed.

271
00:24:31,169 --> 00:24:34,419
I who love so much the past,

272
00:24:34,544 --> 00:24:39,876
in Okinawa I feel a deep despair.

273
00:24:40,001 --> 00:24:43,126
In a way, the people of Okinawa

274
00:24:43,251 --> 00:24:48,208
are resentful, even today.

275
00:24:48,333 --> 00:24:51,708
There is a profound
feeling of injustice

276
00:24:51,833 --> 00:24:54,499
on account of those events.

277
00:24:54,999 --> 00:24:56,549
I think the war isn't over yet.

278
00:25:02,374 --> 00:25:05,248
In conversation, I still mention
the levels

279
00:25:05,373 --> 00:25:07,623
we used to give to people

280
00:25:07,748 --> 00:25:08,748
when we spoke.

281
00:25:09,998 --> 00:25:12,165
When someone came and said:

282
00:25:12,290 --> 00:25:16,414
""I am Catholic, or Communist,
or Anarchist"",

283
00:25:16,539 --> 00:25:21,123
or any other bigotry, we would say:

284
00:25:21,248 --> 00:25:24,244
""Level One!""
We'd laugh so much!

285
00:25:28,289 --> 00:25:32,447
When they were funnier, or wittier,

286
00:25:32,580 --> 00:25:34,616
we'd say: ""Level Two!""

287
00:25:35,953 --> 00:25:37,990
But it never went higher.

288
00:25:40,994 --> 00:25:43,618
The Game became such a standard

289
00:25:43,743 --> 00:25:46,993
that we could do nothing
unless we gave levels

290
00:25:47,118 --> 00:25:49,323
to everything in life.

291
00:25:51,909 --> 00:25:54,991
But nothing ever reached Level 5.

292
00:25:57,451 --> 00:26:00,070
I remember one day I said to you:

293
00:26:01,367 --> 00:26:04,614
""Must one die to get to Level Five?""

294
00:26:14,241 --> 00:26:15,824
She had enjoyed Okinawa.

295
00:26:15,949 --> 00:26:19,032
She had loved the ice in summer.

296
00:26:19,157 --> 00:26:21,741
She had loved Naha, a spiritless
city, apparently,

297
00:26:21,866 --> 00:26:25,313
yet full of ghosts,
and they loved ghosts.

298
00:26:41,405 --> 00:26:44,113
She had loved the jungle figs indoors,

299
00:26:44,238 --> 00:26:46,613
and birdsong at traffic lights

300
00:26:46,738 --> 00:26:49,155
that got the blind across.

301
00:26:49,280 --> 00:26:52,277
It was Japan, yet that Japan
that hadn't lost its memory.

302
00:27:03,443 --> 00:27:05,932
There were cats too,
for they loved cats.

303
00:27:06,902 --> 00:27:10,315
There were tags, and owls and karate.

304
00:27:16,818 --> 00:27:20,109
And their cult-film: a ghost story.

305
00:27:20,234 --> 00:27:22,732
Seeing together there
was a sign to them,

306
00:27:22,857 --> 00:27:24,434
and they loved signs.

307
00:27:27,067 --> 00:27:30,314
That's when you started
calling me Laura.

308
00:27:32,066 --> 00:27:34,103
We loved the film.

309
00:27:37,566 --> 00:27:40,598
We didn't know about the song yet.

310
00:27:44,398 --> 00:27:49,731
I was amazed you could fall
for an image,

311
00:27:49,941 --> 00:27:53,720
then have a real lady
appear in its stead.

312
00:27:55,690 --> 00:27:58,722
Can one be as lovely as an image?

313
00:27:59,689 --> 00:28:03,100
Can one be as memorable as a song?

314
00:28:09,397 --> 00:28:12,726
I remember about David Raksin,

315
00:28:13,603 --> 00:28:16,144
commissioned to write a song

316
00:28:16,269 --> 00:28:20,059
over the weekend for Mr Preminger.

317
00:28:20,184 --> 00:28:23,183
You don't keep Mr Preminger waiting.

318
00:28:25,393 --> 00:28:29,717
He'd got a letter from his wife
which he couldn't decipher.

319
00:28:33,143 --> 00:28:37,476
He wasn't short-sighted,
but something odd inside him

320
00:28:37,601 --> 00:28:41,594
prevented him from being able
to read it.

321
00:28:42,683 --> 00:28:46,892
He used to compose by placing
a sheet of paper

322
00:28:47,017 --> 00:28:51,839
on the piano to focus his attention,

323
00:28:52,849 --> 00:28:56,890
so the music flowed from a void,

324
00:28:57,974 --> 00:28:59,973
not from an idea.

325
00:29:00,098 --> 00:29:03,223
And he took his wife's letter
that he couldn't decipher

326
00:29:03,348 --> 00:29:06,132
and put it on the piano.

327
00:29:06,765 --> 00:29:09,927
Then the notes started to flow.

328
00:29:10,680 --> 00:29:14,460
And as they flowed, as they fell,

329
00:29:14,848 --> 00:29:18,709
he began to decipher the words.

330
00:29:20,304 --> 00:29:23,919
They said his wife was leaving him.

331
00:29:35,511 --> 00:29:37,548
And me too, when

332
00:29:38,969 --> 00:29:42,417
I decipher your programme,
I don't understand it fully.

333
00:29:44,426 --> 00:29:47,175
It seems complicated,
I'm afraid I'll mess it up,

334
00:29:47,300 --> 00:29:50,583
I'm afraid I'll find things hidden

335
00:29:54,467 --> 00:29:58,791
that flow out without my noticing.

336
00:29:59,716 --> 00:30:02,717
Like in a storm when there's a fog

337
00:30:02,842 --> 00:30:08,375
and suddenly the sun pierces through
and truth appears.

338
00:30:08,591 --> 00:30:10,628
I'm afraid...

339
00:30:11,341 --> 00:30:16,715
I'll find something's
going to happen there

340
00:30:16,840 --> 00:30:18,877
which I can't see yet,

341
00:30:20,340 --> 00:30:22,377
something that suddenly

342
00:30:23,090 --> 00:30:27,672
will seem as potent as a song

343
00:30:27,797 --> 00:30:30,795
suddenly not ours anymore,

344
00:30:31,839 --> 00:30:34,125
but everyone's to share,

345
00:30:35,047 --> 00:30:39,669
just as Laura's song
has become ours... now.

346
00:31:51,830 --> 00:31:54,071
Can you hear my footsteps?

347
00:32:30,743 --> 00:32:33,574
That summer, a store
hired dancers from Kyoto,

348
00:32:33,699 --> 00:32:36,200
there in the big island,
the true Japan.

349
00:32:36,325 --> 00:32:38,150
Where, in 1944, they'd sent

350
00:32:40,075 --> 00:32:42,824
thousands of children for safety.

351
00:32:42,949 --> 00:32:44,699
No one asked their parents,

352
00:32:44,824 --> 00:32:49,032
for 4 centuries no one
asked anything to the Okinawans.

353
00:32:49,157 --> 00:32:52,199
The children were put on a ship
and the ship sank.

354
00:32:52,324 --> 00:32:54,374
1000 dead. Even before
the battle started,

355
00:32:56,198 --> 00:32:59,781
Okinawa had its dead,
only they didn't know.

356
00:32:59,906 --> 00:33:02,198
Survivors were told to send cards

357
00:33:02,323 --> 00:33:06,150
saying everything was fine,
everyone had landed safely.

358
00:33:10,405 --> 00:33:13,072
Ten years later, Oshima
filmed the parents

359
00:33:13,197 --> 00:33:16,613
gathered where the ship sank,
to console the souls,

360
00:33:16,738 --> 00:33:20,518
as the Japanese saying goes,
of their drowned children.

361
00:35:33,056 --> 00:35:36,753
Seen from the sky, Okinawa's main island
looks like a beast.

362
00:35:37,348 --> 00:35:40,347
Not a green crocodile like Cuba,

363
00:35:40,472 --> 00:35:43,839
rather a crouched beast,

364
00:35:45,014 --> 00:35:47,633
ready to jump, to unfurl

365
00:35:47,972 --> 00:35:51,096
into who knows what form:

366
00:35:51,221 --> 00:35:53,343
a lizard, a dragon?

367
00:35:53,929 --> 00:35:57,554
As if all History's fierceness,

368
00:35:57,679 --> 00:35:59,636
was in that island,

369
00:35:59,761 --> 00:36:03,345
where people are so peaceble
they infuriate History

370
00:36:03,470 --> 00:36:06,800
for having something to do with them.

371
00:36:07,596 --> 00:36:10,635
It's like Julius Caesar
moving to Bora Bora.

372
00:36:10,760 --> 00:36:12,799
Or Napoleon in the South Pole.

373
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:17,671
St Helena was no fun anyway.

374
00:36:20,092 --> 00:36:22,129
Strange to think that

375
00:36:23,592 --> 00:36:26,800
the first ever mention of Okinawa

376
00:36:26,925 --> 00:36:30,373
was on account of him.

377
00:36:32,091 --> 00:36:34,092
An English Captain came to him

378
00:36:34,217 --> 00:36:36,716
after going around the Pacific,

379
00:36:36,841 --> 00:36:40,917
and described a strange little island,

380
00:36:41,466 --> 00:36:43,835
wherein ""the natives had no weapons"".

381
00:36:44,966 --> 00:36:49,705
""No cannons?"", says the Emperor,
somewhat disgusted.

382
00:36:51,131 --> 00:36:54,082
""No cannons, no pistols,

383
00:36:54,298 --> 00:36:57,165
no muskets,
no weapons at all.""

384
00:36:57,672 --> 00:37:00,207
""How do they wage war?""

385
00:37:02,005 --> 00:37:05,003
""They don't.
They're not interested.""

386
00:37:05,922 --> 00:37:08,963
Napoleon, outraged,
concluded that people

387
00:37:09,088 --> 00:37:12,832
who don't love war
are most ""despicable"".

388
00:37:17,961 --> 00:37:21,211
So thought the island,

389
00:37:21,336 --> 00:37:24,503
the big dragon hidden in the island,

390
00:37:24,628 --> 00:37:28,622
ready to pounce like a cat,

391
00:37:29,335 --> 00:37:33,958
like a tiger
waiting for the proper time.

392
00:37:35,127 --> 00:37:38,460
Travellers enraged him,
travellers of all times,

393
00:37:38,585 --> 00:37:41,418
with tales of Okinawan's gentleness.

394
00:37:41,543 --> 00:37:46,365
Gentleness! Is history written
with gentleness?

395
00:37:47,583 --> 00:37:50,782
Do you honour gentleness
when you're a dragon?

396
00:37:53,333 --> 00:37:56,416
So Okinawans hated violence?

397
00:37:56,541 --> 00:37:58,697
They had it coming.

398
00:37:59,874 --> 00:38:02,832
A peaceful isle out of the world,

399
00:38:02,957 --> 00:38:07,873
out of History, would become the stage

400
00:38:07,998 --> 00:38:11,079
of the bloodiest battle of all time.

401
00:38:11,915 --> 00:38:15,575
A happy, life-loving woman

402
00:38:16,955 --> 00:38:19,491
was chosen to encounter death.

403
00:38:21,664 --> 00:38:24,531
I recognise myself
in that little island,

404
00:38:26,163 --> 00:38:29,326
because my suffering,

405
00:38:30,704 --> 00:38:32,079
my most unique suffering,

406
00:38:33,663 --> 00:38:38,118
my most intimate suffering
is also the most banal,

407
00:38:40,953 --> 00:38:43,406
the easiest to name,

408
00:38:45,328 --> 00:38:47,366
So...

409
00:38:48,452 --> 00:38:52,613
It's irrelevant to give it a name
that sounds like a song,

410
00:38:53,953 --> 00:38:55,989
like a movie,

411
00:38:58,576 --> 00:39:00,614
""Okinawa mon amour...""

412
00:39:02,367 --> 00:39:10,367
The Americans landed
in the Kerama islands.

413
00:39:16,449 --> 00:39:24,449
They bombed Naha from there.

414
00:39:34,322 --> 00:39:38,446
Look, we had a swim
over there yesterday.

415
00:39:49,904 --> 00:39:54,028
I'm sure you've read
about it in the papers,

416
00:39:54,153 --> 00:40:00,317
mass suicide in the Kerama islands...

417
00:40:03,070 --> 00:40:07,643
I read page after page on Okinawa

418
00:40:09,236 --> 00:40:11,475
and I feel like crying.

419
00:40:13,152 --> 00:40:17,609
The only place in the world,
the Nazi camps aside, where people

420
00:40:17,734 --> 00:40:19,773
continued to die after the battle.

421
00:40:22,650 --> 00:40:25,358
The islanders weren't true Japanese,

422
00:40:25,483 --> 00:40:27,817
but were Japanese enough to die.

423
00:40:27,942 --> 00:40:31,981
""No one falls into enemy hands alive,
it is shameful"".

424
00:40:32,107 --> 00:40:38,815
We were imbued with army orders
stating that,

425
00:40:38,940 --> 00:40:44,898
if necessary, meaning
when encountering the enemy,

426
00:40:45,023 --> 00:40:50,772
the first granade was for the enemy

427
00:40:50,897 --> 00:40:55,056
and the second we had to use
for suicide.

428
00:40:57,230 --> 00:41:00,522
Two months later, one of the most famous
images of that battle

429
00:41:00,647 --> 00:41:04,771
showed a little girl
waving a white flag

430
00:41:04,896 --> 00:41:08,563
at the head of a line
of civilians and soldiers.

431
00:41:08,688 --> 00:41:11,853
Okinawa would remember that symbol:

432
00:41:11,978 --> 00:41:15,061
A child survivor of forced suicide

433
00:41:15,186 --> 00:41:19,097
put out to protect an Army in ruins.

434
00:41:42,183 --> 00:41:44,221
See that?

435
00:41:45,766 --> 00:41:48,848
You'll be on American TV.

436
00:41:52,807 --> 00:41:55,474
And because we were convinced
this was what war was,

437
00:41:55,599 --> 00:41:57,973
that everyone was
doing this to everyone,

438
00:41:58,098 --> 00:42:01,890
because they must not shame,
a superior race,

439
00:42:02,015 --> 00:42:06,388
a model for humanity,
and because they were nice,

440
00:42:07,180 --> 00:42:10,131
and because they were helpful

441
00:42:10,971 --> 00:42:14,633
and wanted to do what
was expected of them,

442
00:42:15,222 --> 00:42:18,422
and wanted to prove Napoleon wrong,

443
00:42:21,138 --> 00:42:26,802
they killed themselves...
in their thousands, whole families.

444
00:42:28,679 --> 00:42:32,044
With a granade, if the Army
has supplied granades,

445
00:42:33,386 --> 00:42:36,550
with sticks if they had no granades

446
00:42:37,470 --> 00:42:40,751
or by jumping off cliffs,

447
00:42:42,594 --> 00:42:45,508
like the women of Saipan had done.

448
00:42:47,636 --> 00:42:50,503
I'd seen these images before.

449
00:42:51,885 --> 00:42:57,253
In slow-motion you can see
this woman turn back,

450
00:42:58,593 --> 00:43:00,465
and spot the camera.

451
00:43:01,468 --> 00:43:05,591
Do we know she would have jumped
if at the last minute

452
00:43:05,841 --> 00:43:08,672
she hadn't known she was watched?

453
00:43:13,048 --> 00:43:17,090
I remember the man in Paris, in 1900

454
00:43:17,382 --> 00:43:21,922
attempting a mad leap
with a Batman-like parachute

455
00:43:22,047 --> 00:43:24,965
from the Eiffel Tower.

456
00:43:25,090 --> 00:43:27,329
It's so obvious,

457
00:43:27,754 --> 00:43:30,208
at least it is to me,

458
00:43:32,130 --> 00:43:34,878
that at the last minute,

459
00:43:36,672 --> 00:43:39,420
he knows the contraption won't work,

460
00:43:39,963 --> 00:43:42,000
he knows he'll die,

461
00:43:43,338 --> 00:43:45,577
but the camera is there.

462
00:43:46,546 --> 00:43:48,582
He can't chicken out,

463
00:43:48,920 --> 00:43:52,416
so he jumps and dies.

464
00:43:57,502 --> 00:44:00,252
The woman in Saipan saw the lens
and knew

465
00:44:00,377 --> 00:44:03,044
that foreign devils
would show the world

466
00:44:03,169 --> 00:44:06,865
she hadn't had the guts to jump.

467
00:44:07,376 --> 00:44:11,156
So she jumps. The cameraman
aimed at her

468
00:44:12,460 --> 00:44:17,495
like a hunter through his sights,

469
00:44:19,250 --> 00:44:22,947
and he shot her like a hunter.

470
00:44:39,405 --> 00:44:43,103
This is a little book entitled
""The tragedy of Okinawa"".

471
00:44:43,823 --> 00:44:47,697
The print is odd,
with characters spaced

472
00:44:47,822 --> 00:44:50,447
like in a primer.

473
00:44:50,572 --> 00:44:54,447
It's very thin,
the lines are doublespaced.

474
00:44:54,572 --> 00:44:57,154
It's like it intends
to teach how to read,

475
00:44:57,279 --> 00:45:00,064
and how not to read.

476
00:45:00,988 --> 00:45:02,904
No book can explain

477
00:45:03,029 --> 00:45:05,730
how a 16 years old boy kills his mother

478
00:45:07,361 --> 00:45:10,861
beacause an invisible camera
spies on him,

479
00:45:10,986 --> 00:45:13,653
and he cannot desobey.

480
00:45:15,860 --> 00:45:18,609
The boy's name was Kinjo,

481
00:45:19,277 --> 00:45:22,276
he lived in Tokashiki Island,

482
00:45:23,069 --> 00:45:26,315
where you used to go whale-watching.

483
00:45:27,109 --> 00:45:31,185
What could he tell us now, Kinjo?

484
00:45:33,026 --> 00:45:35,479
What could we say to him?

485
00:45:36,943 --> 00:45:38,483
Know what?

486
00:45:38,608 --> 00:45:41,775
When I began to choke, literally choke,

487
00:45:41,900 --> 00:45:46,106
among this horror
where everyone is a persecutor,

488
00:45:46,231 --> 00:45:49,894
I put a flag in the program

489
00:45:50,023 --> 00:45:52,264
that'll prompt a quote.

490
00:45:53,024 --> 00:45:56,022
Too bad for those who don't get it.

491
00:45:56,147 --> 00:46:00,148
You know it.
It was in the Keepsake

492
00:46:00,273 --> 00:46:05,806
where I saved sentences for tough times.

493
00:46:06,855 --> 00:46:08,893
Thinking ahead...

494
00:46:11,647 --> 00:46:14,021
It's Rabbi Huna's admonition.

495
00:46:14,146 --> 00:46:18,091
Maybe most people won't understand.

496
00:46:20,313 --> 00:46:22,350
It's the one that goes:

497
00:46:23,978 --> 00:46:28,102
""God always sides with the persecuted.

498
00:46:29,021 --> 00:46:32,599
If a just man persecutes a just man,

499
00:46:33,020 --> 00:46:35,852
God sides with the persecuted;

500
00:46:35,977 --> 00:46:38,352
if a bad man persecutes a just man,

501
00:46:38,477 --> 00:46:41,519
God sides with the persecuted;

502
00:46:41,644 --> 00:46:43,976
if a bad man persecutes a bad man,

503
00:46:44,101 --> 00:46:46,809
God sides with the persecuted;

504
00:46:46,934 --> 00:46:50,715
and even if a just man
persecutes a bad man,

505
00:46:51,018 --> 00:46:54,715
God sides with the persecuted"".

506
00:47:12,806 --> 00:47:16,098
These bullfights, like in Mycenae...

507
00:47:16,223 --> 00:47:17,931
In Spain when there's a bullfight

508
00:47:18,056 --> 00:47:21,389
it's to challenge death,
you stare at the sun,

509
00:47:21,514 --> 00:47:27,297
stare at death in the face, like
in the fascist anthem ""Cara al sol"".

510
00:47:31,804 --> 00:47:34,261
In Okinawa, it's the opposite:

511
00:47:34,386 --> 00:47:39,377
They say that before death
is a time for playing,

512
00:47:41,928 --> 00:47:43,753
not a time for killing.

513
00:48:49,963 --> 00:48:52,713
- It's a brave animal.
- But it's not in shape.

514
00:48:52,838 --> 00:48:58,463
- Can it do better?
- It's really brave.

515
00:48:58,588 --> 00:49:04,950
- It has no luck.
- It's a brave beast.

516
00:49:40,657 --> 00:49:46,274
If some future ethnologist
gets to see these images,

517
00:49:46,532 --> 00:49:48,740
he'll ponder the funeral rites

518
00:49:48,865 --> 00:49:53,900
of the strange tribes
of the late 20th Century.

519
00:49:54,780 --> 00:49:58,115
I'll be pleased to give details.

520
00:49:58,240 --> 00:50:01,447
Yes, it was customary for such tribes

521
00:50:01,572 --> 00:50:05,322
to address a familiar
and protective spirit

522
00:50:05,447 --> 00:50:08,029
known as a computer to some of them

523
00:50:08,154 --> 00:50:10,571
and as an electronic calculator
to others.

524
00:50:10,696 --> 00:50:13,446
They'd consult on everything,

525
00:50:13,571 --> 00:50:17,986
it kept their memory.
In fact, they no longer had a memory,

526
00:50:18,111 --> 00:50:20,517
it was their memory.

527
00:50:22,611 --> 00:50:25,609
It was accompanied by a whole ritual.

528
00:50:26,778 --> 00:50:30,610
The ethnologist from the future
doesn't know what he's missing,

529
00:50:30,735 --> 00:50:35,485
by not following me in the morning,
between switching the computer on

530
00:50:35,610 --> 00:50:38,776
and coming later to work on it.

531
00:50:38,901 --> 00:50:42,359
He could send a spy camera,

532
00:50:42,484 --> 00:50:46,893
and see me having breakfast
with two cups,

533
00:50:47,858 --> 00:50:51,224
hanging out two towels,

534
00:50:53,734 --> 00:50:57,429
placing two toothbrushes in a glass..

535
00:51:01,358 --> 00:51:06,145
Pardon me, dear ethnologist,
this is not really for you.

536
00:51:07,355 --> 00:51:10,690
It's for Gloria,
when she comes to clean for me,

537
00:51:10,815 --> 00:51:13,432
and for passing friends.

538
00:51:13,731 --> 00:51:15,851
It re-assures them.

539
00:51:16,398 --> 00:51:21,105
They think: ""Laura has got someone
in her life. She plays the mistery girl,

540
00:51:21,230 --> 00:51:26,467
but I know the tell-tale signs"".

541
00:51:29,854 --> 00:51:33,765
If they suspected my
encounters with you,

542
00:51:35,604 --> 00:51:37,724
they'de be aghast.

543
00:51:41,436 --> 00:51:44,853
In The Girl with the Golden Eyes,
Marsay refers to screen-women,

544
00:51:44,978 --> 00:51:48,971
women you display
to hide the one that matters.

545
00:51:49,727 --> 00:51:54,186
I've got a screen-man, with my cups

546
00:51:54,311 --> 00:51:57,805
and my towels and my toothbrushes.

547
00:51:58,809 --> 00:52:05,848
Only he's the hidden one
and you're invisible.

548
00:52:10,142 --> 00:52:13,306
You can't make a better ménage à troi.

549
00:52:14,058 --> 00:52:17,340
Well. Back to the grind.

550
00:52:51,721 --> 00:52:54,173
The Knowledge-standard...

551
00:52:54,303 --> 00:52:58,095
When you saw the knowledge
available on the net,

552
00:52:58,220 --> 00:53:00,261
you could smile.

553
00:53:00,386 --> 00:53:02,428
But that was exactly their game:

554
00:53:02,553 --> 00:53:10,042
have information ever further
and faster.

555
00:53:10,969 --> 00:53:14,801
In past times, to lend weight to money,

556
00:53:14,926 --> 00:53:18,552
they sought a dense, rare material

557
00:53:18,677 --> 00:53:21,718
to act as a pledge inside coffers.

558
00:53:21,843 --> 00:53:24,175
They chose gold.

559
00:53:24,300 --> 00:53:28,217
Money became invisible and volatile,

560
00:53:28,342 --> 00:53:30,133
so the new power needed a pledge

561
00:53:30,258 --> 00:53:33,966
that was invisible and volatile too.

562
00:53:34,091 --> 00:53:36,424
They found Knowledge.

563
00:53:36,549 --> 00:53:40,299
Atoms of knowledge
came through our screen,

564
00:53:40,424 --> 00:53:44,048
It was into Knowledge's black holes...

565
00:53:44,173 --> 00:53:47,590
that fell this century's dreams
of power. This unending century.

566
00:53:47,715 --> 00:53:51,340
The screen tore into black shapes

567
00:53:51,465 --> 00:53:54,297
reminiscent of other forms,
wherein the century

568
00:53:54,422 --> 00:53:57,338
had made the blueprints
for its own suicide,

569
00:53:57,463 --> 00:54:02,167
engraving images in our minds.
Images of ruins:

570
00:54:02,339 --> 00:54:08,286
The ruins of Coventry and
Berlin, of Dresden and Stalingrad.

571
00:54:09,254 --> 00:54:12,168
The ruins of Okinawa.

572
00:54:40,751 --> 00:54:44,660
Yesterday I set the puzzle
as a screensaver.

573
00:54:45,542 --> 00:54:46,958
Very appropriate.

574
00:54:47,083 --> 00:54:50,584
I have the impression that
you left me in a huge puzzle,

575
00:54:50,709 --> 00:54:52,999
with the discouraging thought that,

576
00:54:53,124 --> 00:54:56,620
in the end, there'd be no image.

577
00:54:57,124 --> 00:55:02,030
Pretty modern.
A puzzle about itself.

578
00:55:03,165 --> 00:55:05,207
Our grandmothers' puzzles were

579
00:55:05,332 --> 00:55:09,705
the Mona Lisa, the Night Watch.

580
00:55:09,830 --> 00:55:14,664
I imagine a perfect gift
for the century's end,

581
00:55:14,789 --> 00:55:19,078
that might be an Yves Klein puzzle.

582
00:55:21,286 --> 00:55:26,663
Strategy games are made
to win back lost battles. No?

583
00:55:26,788 --> 00:55:30,411
Did you really think a player would

584
00:55:30,536 --> 00:55:33,328
just repeat history
the whole night long

585
00:55:33,453 --> 00:55:37,743
and learn he could only play
his part one way?

586
00:55:38,536 --> 00:55:41,652
I tried the Marienbad game.

587
00:55:42,827 --> 00:55:45,535
After a few moves the computer said:

588
00:55:45,660 --> 00:55:48,077
""I won already,

589
00:55:48,202 --> 00:55:51,946
but we may go on if you like"".

590
00:55:54,868 --> 00:55:57,570
Death could say that.

591
00:56:02,659 --> 00:56:05,117
The south of Okinawa is an anthill

592
00:56:05,242 --> 00:56:08,450
with thousand of caves and tunnels

593
00:56:08,575 --> 00:56:11,117
fortified by High Command.

594
00:56:11,242 --> 00:56:14,199
The frontline is at Shuri,

595
00:56:14,324 --> 00:56:17,275
where Ushijima's headquarters were.

596
00:56:18,867 --> 00:56:22,615
With him, General Cho,
a hardline nationalist,

597
00:56:22,740 --> 00:56:25,449
involved in the coup d'etat
in Manchuria in 1931,

598
00:56:25,574 --> 00:56:27,531
the Sino-Japanese prelude

599
00:56:27,656 --> 00:56:30,697
to World War Two.

600
00:56:30,822 --> 00:56:36,488
There is also Colonel Yahara,
a man as reflective

601
00:56:36,613 --> 00:56:40,144
as Chao is loud.
He too plays by the book.

602
00:56:43,654 --> 00:56:47,101
Reading the archives, you find proof
the three of them know:

603
00:56:47,321 --> 00:56:49,402
their mission's suicidal.

604
00:56:49,527 --> 00:56:51,735
The battle cannot be won.

605
00:56:51,860 --> 00:56:54,195
Yet there were bombastic bulletins

606
00:56:54,320 --> 00:56:56,985
and tracts proclaiming victory.

607
00:56:57,110 --> 00:57:01,652
Doubters received drastic punishment.

608
00:57:01,777 --> 00:57:03,319
In April and May,

609
00:57:03,444 --> 00:57:05,985
Cho launched mad counter-attacks.

610
00:57:06,110 --> 00:57:07,819
Since the battle is lost,

611
00:57:07,944 --> 00:57:10,693
samourai spirit is what counts.

612
00:57:10,818 --> 00:57:13,318
Japanese soldiers practising
bayonet drill

613
00:57:13,443 --> 00:57:14,859
on live prisoners,

614
00:57:14,984 --> 00:57:17,443
or choking babies in caves

615
00:57:17,568 --> 00:57:20,025
so the enemy don't hear them,

616
00:57:20,150 --> 00:57:22,188
doesn't sound so samourai-like.

617
00:57:22,608 --> 00:57:26,443
But committing suicide with granades

618
00:57:26,568 --> 00:57:30,014
in the subterranean Navy HQ
is truly in the grand tradition.

619
00:57:36,857 --> 00:57:40,316
But Maginot Lines never hold.

620
00:57:40,441 --> 00:57:42,940
Outside, the US attack progresses.

621
00:57:43,065 --> 00:57:46,024
Another famous photo shows
the Tomori lion

622
00:57:46,149 --> 00:57:48,730
surrounded by infantry men.

623
00:57:48,855 --> 00:57:52,522
I wonder what the first GI thought

624
00:57:52,647 --> 00:57:56,722
when he saw that critter.

625
00:58:01,520 --> 00:58:03,563
The lion still guards its village,

626
00:58:03,688 --> 00:58:05,354
since its mission was to protect it.

627
00:58:05,479 --> 00:58:08,603
Visitors never fail

628
00:58:08,728 --> 00:58:12,259
to leave coins in its mouth,
for good luck.

629
00:58:16,894 --> 00:58:19,808
They chuck coins in the tunnels too.

630
00:58:23,394 --> 00:58:26,476
In a bunker like this,
Yahara writes in his diary

631
00:58:26,601 --> 00:58:30,101
that before the final rout,

632
00:58:30,226 --> 00:58:32,768
he took the time
to destroy all his papers

633
00:58:32,893 --> 00:58:37,845
and rearrange the furniture
""to leave a good impression"".

634
00:58:43,351 --> 00:58:46,430
I found one Kinjo
in one of your listings,

635
00:58:46,932 --> 00:58:49,974
I was obsessed by that boy

636
00:58:50,099 --> 00:58:52,349
who had killed his family

637
00:58:52,474 --> 00:58:54,932
to obey a tacit order

638
00:58:55,057 --> 00:58:57,849
engraved on his child's mind.

639
00:58:57,974 --> 00:59:01,470
""No one falls into enemy hands alive"".

640
00:59:02,015 --> 00:59:05,594
The syllables of his name sum it up.

641
00:59:07,847 --> 00:59:10,169
I was disappointed.

642
00:59:10,472 --> 00:59:13,555
That Kinjo is in Yahara's book,

643
00:59:13,680 --> 00:59:16,846
one of the many boys of Okinawa

644
00:59:16,971 --> 00:59:21,263
drafted under the engaging motto:
""By blood and by iron"".

645
00:59:21,388 --> 00:59:24,760
Not even soldiers,

646
00:59:24,885 --> 00:59:29,757
they're just trying to help out,
obeying orders.

647
00:59:30,261 --> 00:59:32,303
Yahara describes going by night

648
00:59:32,428 --> 00:59:35,094
to get sugar-cane, underfire,
for survival.

649
00:59:35,219 --> 00:59:41,831
Then he ran home and
hid under the bed, like a puppy.

650
00:59:43,677 --> 00:59:46,674
Yahara thinks of his own son

651
00:59:47,426 --> 00:59:52,214
and he starts to have doubts
about the War.

652
00:59:57,008 --> 01:00:00,836
But the other Kinjo,
will I ever get to understand him?

653
01:00:01,009 --> 01:00:04,424
I only know it happened
in the Kerama islands,

654
01:00:04,549 --> 01:00:09,882
where we went on a day so glorious.

655
01:00:10,424 --> 01:00:14,381
A massacre seemed inimaginable.

656
01:00:14,506 --> 01:00:17,540
The view over the archipielago.

657
01:00:18,674 --> 01:00:25,256
""The fractal islands on Klein blue"",
you said,

658
01:00:25,381 --> 01:00:27,621
simple as ever.

659
01:00:29,421 --> 01:00:33,796
Kannon, Goddess of Mercy's temple,

660
01:00:33,921 --> 01:00:35,546
her statue behind glass

661
01:00:35,671 --> 01:00:39,504
that made her appear

662
01:00:39,629 --> 01:00:43,158
in her place, in the sky.

663
01:00:45,295 --> 01:00:50,200
There was also
a magical Okinawa weaver.

664
01:00:51,336 --> 01:00:54,627
Unavoidably, one calls
on all those myths

665
01:00:54,752 --> 01:00:57,169
the knotted threads of man:

666
01:00:57,294 --> 01:01:01,335
the Parcae, the Norns,

667
01:01:01,460 --> 01:01:04,209
all the figures devised by men to say

668
01:01:04,334 --> 01:01:08,624
life's thread unravels and breaks.

669
01:01:10,584 --> 01:01:13,949
Do they spin Kinjo's life still?

670
01:01:15,333 --> 01:01:20,951
What would Kinjo think before
fractal islands and Klein blue?

671
01:01:22,749 --> 01:01:25,867
Before the Goddess of Mercy?

672
01:01:35,748 --> 01:01:39,541
A few visits to Heiwa Dori,
Naha's indoors market,

673
01:01:39,666 --> 01:01:44,622
and you become aware:
it is run by women.

674
01:01:44,747 --> 01:01:49,205
All are connected with the War.
They are widows and orphans.

675
01:01:49,330 --> 01:01:52,371
Sometimes survivors.

676
01:01:52,496 --> 01:01:54,911
Most little girls of that age

677
01:01:55,036 --> 01:01:57,038
experienced mobilization, propaganda,

678
01:01:57,163 --> 01:02:00,828
a feeling that they too must fight.

679
01:02:00,953 --> 01:02:05,824
The nurses at Himeyuri-no-to
became a symbol.

680
01:02:06,077 --> 01:02:08,661
An obligatory tourist pilgrimage
in Okinawa.

681
01:02:08,786 --> 01:02:12,244
It starts with a cheerful song,

682
01:02:12,369 --> 01:02:14,904
which was their favourite.

683
01:02:48,032 --> 01:02:50,189
Then the photo sessions.

684
01:03:03,239 --> 01:03:04,823
And faces peering into a hole

685
01:03:04,948 --> 01:03:07,530
that looks like a simple hole
in the ground.

686
01:03:07,655 --> 01:03:09,697
This is the entrance
to the Himeyuri cave,

687
01:03:09,822 --> 01:03:12,029
site of the 3rd surgical unit,

688
01:03:12,154 --> 01:03:14,821
where 46 girls died suffocated

689
01:03:14,946 --> 01:03:16,738
during the final attack,

690
01:03:16,863 --> 01:03:19,819
when the Army disbanded
the Nursing Corps

691
01:03:19,944 --> 01:03:22,320
and left them to their fate,

692
01:03:22,445 --> 01:03:25,110
with orders not to surrender.

693
01:03:52,900 --> 01:03:54,567
In the local museum,

694
01:03:54,692 --> 01:03:58,934
there's a diorama of the cave
with sound and light effects.

695
01:04:01,775 --> 01:04:05,149
Next comes a ""requiem"" room

696
01:04:05,274 --> 01:04:09,232
with portraits of the 206 pupils
and teachers of the Himeyuri College,

697
01:04:09,357 --> 01:04:13,273
and eye-witness accounts.

698
01:04:13,398 --> 01:04:15,024
As could be expected,

699
01:04:15,149 --> 01:04:17,856
the choice of site was controversial.

700
01:04:17,981 --> 01:04:19,980
Was too much made of girls

701
01:04:20,105 --> 01:04:21,814
from the Okinawa elite

702
01:04:21,939 --> 01:04:24,398
when others were forgotten?

703
01:04:24,523 --> 01:04:27,855
As if there were privileged martyrs.

704
01:04:27,980 --> 01:04:31,646
This adds more sadness, this competition
of memory.

705
01:04:31,771 --> 01:04:34,186
My dead are deader than your dead.

706
01:04:34,311 --> 01:04:37,225
We had seen that too.

707
01:04:41,894 --> 01:04:44,436
The Game had kept only the faces.

708
01:04:44,561 --> 01:04:46,469
That was enough.

709
01:05:03,951 --> 01:05:05,951
But to understand what happened,

710
01:05:06,076 --> 01:05:10,697
one must climb down into the caves
with rope and a torch,

711
01:05:11,242 --> 01:05:14,533
then turn out the light
and try to imagine

712
01:05:14,658 --> 01:05:17,116
a teenage girl in the dark,

713
01:05:17,241 --> 01:05:22,074
with rotten corpses and
amputation without anaesthetic.

714
01:05:22,199 --> 01:05:26,240
The sound of maggots in live flesh.

715
01:05:26,365 --> 01:05:28,406
And other sounds,
the shrieks of dying men,

716
01:05:28,531 --> 01:05:30,366
the hungry begging

717
01:05:30,491 --> 01:05:33,406
for amputated limbs to be cooked.

718
01:05:33,531 --> 01:05:36,405
Try to imagine that.

719
01:05:36,530 --> 01:05:39,823
And also the wait for a resolution.

720
01:05:39,948 --> 01:05:43,028
Most likely, liquidation
with flame-throwers.

721
01:06:12,485 --> 01:06:13,859
Soon, Heiwa Dori will get normal traders

722
01:06:13,984 --> 01:06:16,233
like any other.

723
01:06:16,358 --> 01:06:20,683
Until then, the market guards
Okinawa's memory.

724
01:06:24,775 --> 01:06:27,643
Its ladies are grave-keepers.

725
01:06:44,690 --> 01:06:47,936
I wish I could bring good news.

726
01:06:49,065 --> 01:06:52,311
The Network is not what it was.

727
01:06:52,524 --> 01:06:57,014
You said there is something
irretrievably vulgar about success.

728
01:06:57,522 --> 01:07:00,189
OWL must be a success.

729
01:07:00,314 --> 01:07:04,104
You wonder how some people plug in.

730
01:07:04,229 --> 01:07:07,438
A few days ago a man
in an Oberon mask asked me

731
01:07:07,563 --> 01:07:10,430
if I was his baby donkey.

732
01:07:11,605 --> 01:07:14,388
I felt a whiff of nostalgia.

733
01:07:14,685 --> 01:07:17,061
I remembered the time when

734
01:07:17,186 --> 01:07:19,895
you were all just weirdos
in Washington DC,

735
01:07:20,020 --> 01:07:22,436
and thought that secrecy

736
01:07:22,561 --> 01:07:26,809
in this overbugged world meant
entering the most open network,

737
01:07:26,934 --> 01:07:30,715
with passwords to discourage morons.

738
01:07:33,059 --> 01:07:35,518
But there's no discouraging morons.

739
01:07:35,643 --> 01:07:40,299
You were part Robin Hood,
part secret society,

740
01:07:41,683 --> 01:07:45,017
You were on raids for information,

741
01:07:45,142 --> 01:07:47,183
like leaving Sherwood for supplies.

742
01:07:47,308 --> 01:07:53,342
Then you retreated back
to your impenetrable lair.

743
01:07:55,807 --> 01:07:58,891
I have to go out too,

744
01:07:59,016 --> 01:08:04,056
to gather knowledge about Okinawa,

745
01:08:04,181 --> 01:08:10,048
and I feel like a hunted spy,
I'm afraid they're after me.

746
01:08:11,515 --> 01:08:14,050
And I wonder if it isn't true.

747
01:08:14,805 --> 01:08:18,472
Under those pussy-hound masks,

748
01:08:18,597 --> 01:08:23,221
I discern true enemies,

749
01:08:23,346 --> 01:08:28,418
people who want to know too much
or who already know too much.

750
01:08:32,179 --> 01:08:33,928
""Okinawa?

751
01:08:34,053 --> 01:08:41,672
Rings a bell. Wasn't there
a strategy game about that?

752
01:08:43,301 --> 01:08:48,801
Written by some peculiar guy?
Remind me his name...""

753
01:08:48,926 --> 01:08:51,924
Sure I'll give your name!

754
01:08:55,509 --> 01:08:59,468
Now, I don't mention Okinawa.

755
01:08:59,593 --> 01:09:05,091
I sidestep: the end of
the Pacific campaign,

756
01:09:05,717 --> 01:09:08,288
Ernie Pyle's death,

757
01:09:09,425 --> 01:09:12,299
as if Okinawa was a lethal word,

758
01:09:12,424 --> 01:09:17,414
an ""open, Sesame"". Only I don't know
waht it would open.

759
01:09:18,674 --> 01:09:22,536
How come he knew about the Game?

760
01:09:24,090 --> 01:09:26,544
To whom did you talk?

761
01:09:29,423 --> 01:09:32,172
How stiffing suddenly

762
01:09:32,839 --> 01:09:36,003
these unasked questions.

763
01:10:04,460 --> 01:10:07,752
I get time-ache like headaches.

764
01:10:07,877 --> 01:10:11,376
Here. It spins you inside.

765
01:10:11,501 --> 01:10:14,709
You want to excise it, to get out,

766
01:10:14,834 --> 01:10:17,793
and leave your head to its aches,

767
01:10:17,918 --> 01:10:20,535
you want to go for a stroll.

768
01:10:26,125 --> 01:10:28,583
Time should take care of itself,

769
01:10:28,708 --> 01:10:32,701
leave me to here and now,
talking to cats,

770
01:10:34,582 --> 01:10:38,446
feeling early spring sun on my skin.

771
01:10:39,790 --> 01:10:42,831
No way. Time drills into me.

772
01:10:42,956 --> 01:10:45,248
I suffer electric shocks,

773
01:10:45,373 --> 01:10:47,778
time neuralgia,

774
01:10:50,415 --> 01:10:53,447
the image of a silent house,

775
01:10:53,872 --> 01:10:57,119
a garden in snow, a rainy day,

776
01:10:59,121 --> 01:11:03,328
fondling a horse over a gate.

777
01:11:05,164 --> 01:11:09,735
It is in me but not mine,
a migraine of time,

778
01:11:12,036 --> 01:11:15,119
where time is just pointless pain,

779
01:11:15,244 --> 01:11:20,944
without sentiment or nostalgia,
the sting of time,

780
01:11:21,785 --> 01:11:25,032
the sting of an invisible insect

781
01:11:25,452 --> 01:11:27,940
you can do nothing about.

782
01:11:33,908 --> 01:11:36,776
I was in Vézelay for two days.

783
01:11:37,325 --> 01:11:41,242
I realised I'd forgotten the clue

784
01:11:41,367 --> 01:11:45,200
which distinguishes genuine capitals
from restored ones.

785
01:11:45,325 --> 01:11:49,103
Or vice-versa.

786
01:11:52,657 --> 01:11:58,025
I had the question, but
the answer was a blank.

787
01:12:02,698 --> 01:12:06,028
Could an angel scan my memory

788
01:12:07,030 --> 01:12:09,572
and find the clue

789
01:12:09,697 --> 01:12:14,899
which distinguishes
remembrance from oblivion?

790
01:12:17,738 --> 01:12:19,864
An angel, like in the Jewish legend

791
01:12:19,989 --> 01:12:23,071
you used to love so much:

792
01:12:23,196 --> 01:12:26,361
One second before birth,

793
01:12:26,486 --> 01:12:32,684
we know all about everything.
Plato used to say the same.

794
01:12:33,363 --> 01:12:38,902
But, one second later,
an angel gives us a pat

795
01:12:39,027 --> 01:12:45,603
and erases our memory, so man has
the honor of rediscovery,

796
01:12:46,775 --> 01:12:49,016
if he's up to it.

797
01:12:50,984 --> 01:12:53,234
Does another angel come later

798
01:12:53,359 --> 01:12:57,358
when, willy-nilly, we've gathered
our scraps of memory,

799
01:12:57,483 --> 01:13:03,065
like refugees, and erase
the lot pat by pat?

800
01:13:05,149 --> 01:13:08,691
If I forgot the clue to the capitals,

801
01:13:08,816 --> 01:13:13,189
so vivid last time I was there,

802
01:13:13,649 --> 01:13:18,389
what clues to you will I lose,
one by one?

803
01:13:21,148 --> 01:13:23,440
The Gershwin song we loved,

804
01:13:23,565 --> 01:13:26,134
sung by Sarah Vaughan...

805
01:13:27,355 --> 01:13:32,593
No, no they can't take that away
from me...

806
01:13:32,772 --> 01:13:37,807
The way you this, the way you that...

807
01:13:38,605 --> 01:13:42,385
They can't take that away.

808
01:13:43,939 --> 01:13:47,184
But, yes, angels can.

809
01:13:48,895 --> 01:13:52,307
They can take everything one day.

810
01:13:53,061 --> 01:13:55,763
Here's a piece Florence wrote.

811
01:13:56,434 --> 01:13:59,184
It's in her book of short stories,

812
01:13:59,309 --> 01:14:02,806
To Be Read in an Elevator...

813
01:14:04,726 --> 01:14:06,681
Cocoloco.

814
01:14:06,809 --> 01:14:10,309
It was on an endless tour
in South America

815
01:14:10,434 --> 01:14:15,589
that she bought Cocoloco,
the prettiest of parrots.

816
01:14:15,892 --> 01:14:19,558
Everyday, to exorcise awful shows,

817
01:14:19,683 --> 01:14:24,307
shabby theaters,
dangerous and dirty hotels,

818
01:14:24,432 --> 01:14:28,307
she devised an act with Cocoloco,

819
01:14:28,432 --> 01:14:32,766
which exhaustion and fever
helped her consider brilliant.

820
01:14:32,891 --> 01:14:35,640
Perhaps it was, after all.

821
01:14:35,765 --> 01:14:38,681
She gathered up scraps
of news from a Europe

822
01:14:38,806 --> 01:14:40,473
she loathed

823
01:14:40,598 --> 01:14:43,805
and now regarded as Paradise Lost.

824
01:14:43,930 --> 01:14:46,639
She concieved comic, poetic scenes,

825
01:14:46,764 --> 01:14:49,222
with political satire...

826
01:14:49,347 --> 01:14:53,263
Cocoloco was very good as Yeltsin...

827
01:14:53,388 --> 01:14:55,221
A zaniness reproduced before
startled Indians,

828
01:14:55,346 --> 01:14:58,471
startled but friendly.

829
01:14:58,596 --> 01:15:01,263
Each night took her closer to home.

830
01:15:01,388 --> 01:15:03,846
Closer, in her delirium,

831
01:15:03,971 --> 01:15:06,970
to a triumphal return, with her
and Cocoloco

832
01:15:07,095 --> 01:15:10,009
as kings of TV.

833
01:15:10,554 --> 01:15:12,928
Too exhausted to take notes,

834
01:15:13,053 --> 01:15:16,094
she rehearsed sketches in her head,

835
01:15:16,219 --> 01:15:18,384
with brilliant repartee...

836
01:15:18,509 --> 01:15:20,634
Yes, that was a blank,

837
01:15:20,759 --> 01:15:24,467
but it would come back, she knew.

838
01:15:24,592 --> 01:15:27,425
And Cocoloco on her hand

839
01:15:27,550 --> 01:15:30,509
would look so funny in close-up.

840
01:15:30,634 --> 01:15:33,842
Then Cocoloco died of parrott-disease,

841
01:15:33,967 --> 01:15:36,633
and, back in France,

842
01:15:36,758 --> 01:15:40,336
she realised she'd forgotten it all.

843
01:15:46,424 --> 01:15:49,835
You see, Cocoloco?

844
01:15:51,923 --> 01:15:56,829
We'd have been a great act.

845
01:16:02,547 --> 01:16:07,749
You would have spoken just after me.

846
01:16:09,672 --> 01:16:13,796
You would have said things.

847
01:16:13,921 --> 01:16:19,254
Things as fun as now.

848
01:16:19,379 --> 01:16:23,421
- Pretty Cocoloco.
- Pretty Cocoloco.

849
01:16:23,546 --> 01:16:26,545
We would have been a hit.

850
01:16:26,670 --> 01:16:29,045
We would have been a hit...

851
01:16:29,170 --> 01:16:31,408
You and me in America.

852
01:16:31,835 --> 01:16:33,420
You and me in America.

853
01:16:33,545 --> 01:16:38,958
- You're so sweet, Cocoloco.
- You're so sweet, Cocoloco.

854
01:16:40,417 --> 01:16:43,747
Do you forget stuff too?

855
01:16:44,708 --> 01:16:47,126
Do you ever forget things?

856
01:16:47,251 --> 01:16:51,249
- Do you ever...
- Does the little angel come to you?

857
01:16:51,374 --> 01:16:53,042
Does the little angel...?

858
01:16:53,167 --> 01:16:58,083
- And, with a pat, erase...
- And, with a pat, erase...

859
01:16:58,208 --> 01:17:02,780
- the memory of things?
- The memory of things?

860
01:17:04,291 --> 01:17:07,372
Do you too hover...

861
01:17:10,290 --> 01:17:13,406
between remembrance and oblivion?

862
01:17:14,415 --> 01:17:19,367
Between remembrance and oblivion...
Cocoloco, say something!

863
01:17:20,830 --> 01:17:22,951
Cocoloco.

864
01:17:24,539 --> 01:17:29,289
Cocoloco.

865
01:17:29,414 --> 01:17:33,821
Have you forgotten everything too?
Cocoloco!

866
01:17:35,413 --> 01:17:41,693
You too refuse to speak, Cocoloco?

867
01:17:43,578 --> 01:17:46,742
The angel has erased the lot.

868
01:17:48,785 --> 01:17:50,575
You too.

869
01:17:50,952 --> 01:17:53,157
Cocoloco!

870
01:17:53,994 --> 01:17:55,866
Cocoloco.

871
01:17:56,160 --> 01:17:58,066
All you remember is your name.

872
01:20:25,019 --> 01:20:28,061
This film hasn't been seen in 35 years.

873
01:20:28,186 --> 01:20:31,602
Demoralising, the army censors said.

874
01:20:31,727 --> 01:20:34,309
More moralising was John Wayne

875
01:20:34,434 --> 01:20:37,351
in The Sands of Iwo Jima,
that got shown in wartime

876
01:20:37,476 --> 01:20:39,518
with unexpected results.

877
01:20:39,643 --> 01:20:41,933
The Star turned up in cowboy garb
at a naval hospital,

878
01:20:42,058 --> 01:20:45,142
and got booed!

879
01:20:45,267 --> 01:20:47,975
An episode in a war of images

880
01:20:48,100 --> 01:20:50,808
that soon coincided with real war.

881
01:20:50,933 --> 01:20:53,890
It started here, at Iwo Jima,

882
01:20:54,015 --> 01:20:56,805
with that famous scene.

883
01:20:56,930 --> 01:20:58,580
Or with another scene, in Borneo.

884
01:21:00,640 --> 01:21:08,056
Each scene has its tale.

885
01:21:08,181 --> 01:21:10,931
I know where Gustave is from.

886
01:21:11,056 --> 01:21:13,472
You told me his name was Gustave.

887
01:21:13,597 --> 01:21:15,805
I'd seen him a hundred times.

888
01:21:15,930 --> 01:21:20,264
Nobody had ever filmed
a man burning alive so close,

889
01:21:20,389 --> 01:21:22,847
a lulu for war documentaries.

890
01:21:22,972 --> 01:21:28,679
The unknown soldier, in full kit,
holding his own flame.

891
01:21:28,804 --> 01:21:32,013
He was carted around battlefields,

892
01:21:32,138 --> 01:21:35,928
like a war-artist on tour
with a unique act.

893
01:21:36,053 --> 01:21:39,845
Gustave in the Philippines,
Gustave in Okinawa.

894
01:21:39,970 --> 01:21:43,052
I even saw him in a Vietnam movie,

895
01:21:43,177 --> 01:21:45,761
still burning 20 years later.

896
01:21:45,886 --> 01:21:50,094
I viewed so much newsreel
I knew Gustave at birth.

897
01:21:50,219 --> 01:21:53,009
Filmed in Borneo, by Australians.

898
01:21:53,134 --> 01:21:56,094
The interesting thing is that,
at the end of the original shot,

899
01:21:56,219 --> 01:22:00,633
you can tell he doesn't die.
He gets up again.

900
01:22:00,758 --> 01:22:05,133
You feel he'll get over it

901
01:22:05,258 --> 01:22:07,050
like the napalm girl in Saigon.

902
01:22:07,175 --> 01:22:08,799
That ending has always been cut

903
01:22:08,924 --> 01:22:11,132
in all documentaries.

904
01:22:11,257 --> 01:22:15,417
A born symbol doesn't get out
of it so easily!

905
01:22:15,632 --> 01:22:17,674
He testifies against war,

906
01:22:17,799 --> 01:22:20,091
you cannot weaken his testimony

907
01:22:20,216 --> 01:22:24,381
for the sake of a few frames.
Truth? What is truth?

908
01:22:24,506 --> 01:22:27,715
The truth is, most didn't get up.

909
01:22:27,840 --> 01:22:30,381
So what's so special about this one?

910
01:22:30,506 --> 01:22:33,755
The ethics of imagery?
Is napalm ethical?

911
01:22:33,880 --> 01:22:38,336
Are you in favour of napalm?
Whose side are you on, comrade?

912
01:22:40,797 --> 01:22:44,629
Private Ira Hayes knew his side.

913
01:22:44,754 --> 01:22:49,046
He was a US Marine,
brave and disciplined.

914
01:22:49,171 --> 01:22:52,753
He was told to pose, with five pals,

915
01:22:52,878 --> 01:22:58,586
to re-stage the picture. He
didn't waver. It was for the cause.

916
01:22:58,711 --> 01:23:01,669
Those who had put up the flag

917
01:23:01,794 --> 01:23:06,783
in combat, were gone.
They took six others.

918
01:23:07,336 --> 01:23:12,002
It wasn't much, just a set-up,

919
01:23:12,127 --> 01:23:14,584
there'd be more like it,

920
01:23:14,709 --> 01:23:18,834
the original was uninspiring anyway.

921
01:23:18,959 --> 01:23:21,625
Hayes never got over it.

922
01:23:21,874 --> 01:23:23,707
He wasn't to blame,

923
01:23:23,832 --> 01:23:25,999
he had fought with the best,

924
01:23:26,124 --> 01:23:30,124
but he'd been asked to lie.
Simple soul,

925
01:23:30,249 --> 01:23:32,874
he couldn't live with that lie.

926
01:23:32,999 --> 01:23:35,749
He couldn't tell the truth,

927
01:23:35,874 --> 01:23:39,830
the Corps honor was at stake,
so he took to drink,

928
01:23:39,955 --> 01:23:43,040
and died in poverty.

929
01:23:43,165 --> 01:23:46,581
The picture has become an icon.

930
01:23:46,706 --> 01:23:50,246
It was used in Sarajevo in 1994,

931
01:23:50,371 --> 01:23:53,820
but not to hail the US Marines.

932
01:23:56,914 --> 01:24:00,538
The Army would gladly have done
a replay in Okinawa,

933
01:24:00,663 --> 01:24:02,079
but Marine Corps Public Relations

934
01:24:02,204 --> 01:24:04,163
was unbeatable.

935
01:24:04,288 --> 01:24:07,954
And Okinawa wasn't that simple.

936
01:24:08,079 --> 01:24:12,203
Mabuni Museum shows war as chaotic

937
01:24:12,328 --> 01:24:15,445
and hard to represent,
and unpresentable.

938
01:24:16,245 --> 01:24:19,452
But - as in the books and films -

939
01:24:19,577 --> 01:24:21,952
the smell of battle is missing.

940
01:24:22,077 --> 01:24:26,160
Till we get smellies, like talkies,

941
01:24:26,285 --> 01:24:28,909
war films don't exist. Just as well,

942
01:24:29,034 --> 01:24:32,898
I swear there'd be no audience.

943
01:24:49,741 --> 01:24:53,491
I remember the fear

944
01:24:53,616 --> 01:24:58,156
and I have really
experienced the feeling

945
01:24:58,281 --> 01:25:01,656
of being a part of Japan at war.

946
01:25:01,781 --> 01:25:05,072
That is why I particularly feel,

947
01:25:05,197 --> 01:25:07,240
since my job is film-making,

948
01:25:07,365 --> 01:25:10,864
that Japanese war films are rubbish.

949
01:25:14,030 --> 01:25:15,947
They deal only with themselves,

950
01:25:16,072 --> 01:25:20,029
how they suffered from the war,
how brave and painful it was,

951
01:25:20,154 --> 01:25:23,105
They never show the other side.

952
01:25:23,696 --> 01:25:26,154
Once again, Oshima pointed the way.

953
01:25:26,279 --> 01:25:27,611
Laura went on to study

954
01:25:27,736 --> 01:25:31,070
how each side depicted the enemy.

955
01:25:31,195 --> 01:25:34,063
It was none too pleasant.

956
01:26:08,006 --> 01:26:09,965
We were taught that Westerners

957
01:26:10,090 --> 01:26:14,007
were demons. We were told
if US troops captured us

958
01:26:14,132 --> 01:26:18,380
they'd cut off our noses and ears,
cut off our fingers.

959
01:26:18,505 --> 01:26:24,215
They would drive tanks over our bodies,

960
01:26:24,340 --> 01:26:28,964
and rape our women.

961
01:26:29,089 --> 01:26:34,422
We would suffer horribly, then die.

962
01:26:34,547 --> 01:26:39,088
We were so imbued with all this

963
01:26:39,213 --> 01:26:43,754
that it seemed better

964
01:26:43,879 --> 01:26:48,711
to suppress our loved ones,

965
01:26:48,836 --> 01:26:52,378
than leave them to the enemy,

966
01:26:52,503 --> 01:26:56,920
For them, it would be a consolation

967
01:26:57,045 --> 01:27:01,127
to die by the hand of a loved one.

968
01:27:01,252 --> 01:27:05,919
Filled with this thought,
we lamented and, lamenting,

969
01:27:06,044 --> 01:27:13,118
interrupted our mother's life.

970
01:27:17,708 --> 01:27:22,116
That's where I recognised him: Kinjo.

971
01:27:23,916 --> 01:27:26,248
The boy from the Keramas.

972
01:27:26,373 --> 01:27:32,873
A village elder, a leader,

973
01:27:32,998 --> 01:27:37,331
was snapping off a tree-branch.

974
01:27:37,456 --> 01:27:40,872
I watched him,

975
01:27:40,997 --> 01:27:44,164
intrigued.

976
01:27:44,289 --> 01:27:47,414
Then, on his very hand,

977
01:27:47,539 --> 01:27:50,871
the stick beame a weapon.

978
01:27:50,996 --> 01:27:55,829
As if having a seizure,

979
01:27:55,954 --> 01:28:02,621
he began to beat the life out
of his wife and children,

980
01:28:02,746 --> 01:28:05,621
whom he loved,
using just this piece of wood.

981
01:28:05,746 --> 01:28:10,495
It was terribly shocking,

982
01:28:10,620 --> 01:28:15,035
but telepathically all of us thought

983
01:28:15,160 --> 01:28:18,202
this was the thing to do

984
01:28:18,327 --> 01:28:22,286
and others began to kill
the people they loved most.

985
01:28:22,411 --> 01:28:28,243
They began with children,
with the weak and the old,

986
01:28:28,368 --> 01:28:33,033
with those who lacked the strength
to take their own lives.

987
01:28:33,158 --> 01:28:40,243
So husbands killed wives,

988
01:28:40,368 --> 01:28:45,616
parents killed children,
brothers killed sisters.

989
01:28:45,741 --> 01:28:49,907
They killed them because
they loved them.

990
01:28:50,032 --> 01:28:55,739
Such was the tragedy
of those mass suicides.

991
01:28:55,864 --> 01:29:03,530
It was a real butchery,
and the waters of the river

992
01:29:03,655 --> 01:29:10,447
where they threw the bodies
indiscriminately

993
01:29:10,572 --> 01:29:17,148
became rivers of blood.

994
01:29:17,863 --> 01:29:23,403
As for my own family,

995
01:29:23,528 --> 01:29:29,820
my brother, who was
two years my senior,

996
01:29:29,945 --> 01:29:36,110
and I raised our hand
for the first time

997
01:29:36,235 --> 01:29:42,598
against the mother who had borne us.

998
01:29:43,444 --> 01:29:48,318
At 19, my brother

999
01:29:48,443 --> 01:29:55,568
could not help moaning.
He suffered so much.

1000
01:29:55,693 --> 01:30:02,019
My father went off to die.

1001
01:30:02,399 --> 01:30:08,315
We also killed our younger

1002
01:30:08,440 --> 01:30:10,808
brother and sister.

1003
01:30:13,356 --> 01:30:15,190
Afterwards, he sought
a glorious death in war

1004
01:30:15,315 --> 01:30:17,523
crossing enemy lines:

1005
01:30:17,648 --> 01:30:20,355
He was captured alongside soldiers

1006
01:30:20,480 --> 01:30:22,979
who had called capture dishonorable.

1007
01:30:23,104 --> 01:30:24,939
Mass suicides accompanied

1008
01:30:25,064 --> 01:30:26,397
the advance of US troops.

1009
01:30:26,522 --> 01:30:29,688
Together with Japanese executions

1010
01:30:29,813 --> 01:30:32,104
and casualities of war,

1011
01:30:32,229 --> 01:30:34,979
some 150.000 civilians died in Okinawa,

1012
01:30:35,104 --> 01:30:37,021
a third of the population.

1013
01:30:37,146 --> 01:30:38,688
No other group suffered so,

1014
01:30:38,813 --> 01:30:41,134
except in the Nazi camps.

1015
01:30:48,936 --> 01:30:51,727
Europeans, surviving this,

1016
01:30:51,852 --> 01:30:53,352
might have turned to Buddhism.

1017
01:30:53,477 --> 01:30:55,811
Kinjo found Christianity.

1018
01:30:55,936 --> 01:30:58,645
He became a minister.
He offers his memory

1019
01:30:58,770 --> 01:31:02,809
to help others decipher theirs.

1020
01:31:02,934 --> 01:31:06,143
He wants Japan to acknowledge
its war crimes,

1021
01:31:06,268 --> 01:31:07,934
and mass suicides taught

1022
01:31:08,059 --> 01:31:10,059
in school books,

1023
01:31:10,184 --> 01:31:13,393
not ignored, or called madness.

1024
01:31:13,518 --> 01:31:17,226
He wants what nations and men
are least capable of:

1025
01:31:17,351 --> 01:31:22,254
that memory be faced,
and forgiveness asked.

1026
01:31:31,305 --> 01:31:34,598
If you look in the Bible,

1027
01:31:34,723 --> 01:31:42,722
you'll see confessing your mistakes

1028
01:31:42,847 --> 01:31:45,639
and expressing repentance,

1029
01:31:45,764 --> 01:31:48,554
cleanses people of their past.

1030
01:31:48,679 --> 01:31:55,886
But Japanese mentality,
the way of thought,

1031
01:31:56,011 --> 01:32:03,220
considers that errors
committed in the past

1032
01:32:03,345 --> 01:32:11,345
remain errors forever.
They cannot be erased.

1033
01:32:16,428 --> 01:32:24,428
I decided that my mission must be

1034
01:32:25,384 --> 01:32:31,217
to proclaim the value of human life

1035
01:32:31,342 --> 01:32:38,091
to counter the notion,

1036
01:32:38,216 --> 01:32:42,216
the ideology of the past,

1037
01:32:42,341 --> 01:32:44,673
that held life in such contempt,

1038
01:32:44,798 --> 01:32:47,298
for such was the lie they taught.

1039
01:32:47,423 --> 01:32:50,923
That was the motivation

1040
01:32:51,048 --> 01:32:53,548
for my becoming a missionary,
a Christian minister.

1041
01:32:59,046 --> 01:33:01,671
After the retreat from Shuri,
General Buckner

1042
01:33:01,796 --> 01:33:05,422
sent Ushijima, in his Southern bastion,

1043
01:33:05,547 --> 01:33:09,088
an offer of honorable surrender.

1044
01:33:09,213 --> 01:33:13,917
The Japanese general reacted
with an outburst of laughter.

1045
01:33:14,296 --> 01:33:16,961
Was it laughter, borne on the wind,

1046
01:33:17,086 --> 01:33:20,086
that prompted a frontline gunner?

1047
01:33:20,211 --> 01:33:22,045
Unknowningly, he aimed at Buckner,

1048
01:33:22,170 --> 01:33:25,295
who was examining the ground,
and Simon Bolivar Buckner,

1049
01:33:25,420 --> 01:33:27,252
only US general

1050
01:33:27,377 --> 01:33:29,210
to die in combat,

1051
01:33:29,335 --> 01:33:31,794
failed to convince his enemies,

1052
01:33:31,919 --> 01:33:35,532
and died a few days before them.

1053
01:33:43,043 --> 01:33:47,042
It is said that Ushijima prayed
for Buchner when he died.

1054
01:33:47,167 --> 01:33:50,626
Then he and Cho arranged the ending,

1055
01:33:50,751 --> 01:33:53,749
the only end they could conceive.

1056
01:34:07,122 --> 01:34:11,165
He doesn't know how to harakiri.
You don't say.

1057
01:34:11,290 --> 01:34:16,414
Seppuku is not, in the European sense,

1058
01:34:16,539 --> 01:34:21,747
suicide, but the act
of giving oneself death.

1059
01:34:21,872 --> 01:34:28,413
The act of living through harshest pain
at the end.

1060
01:34:28,538 --> 01:34:31,328
That's what seppuku is.

1061
01:34:31,453 --> 01:34:34,411
So to perform seppuku,

1062
01:34:34,536 --> 01:34:38,953
you must be in good health,
very well-balanced,

1063
01:34:39,078 --> 01:34:43,120
with enough energy
to make a gift of death.

1064
01:34:43,245 --> 01:34:48,702
Pulling a trigger is not enough,
nor is swallowing pills,

1065
01:34:48,827 --> 01:34:52,285
nor stepping out into the void.

1066
01:34:52,410 --> 01:34:57,363
You must touch yourself to the end,

1067
01:34:58,035 --> 01:35:01,530
with living energy.

1068
01:35:15,991 --> 01:35:17,574
What of the piety

1069
01:35:17,699 --> 01:35:20,900
that surrounds
the tombs at Mabuni Hill?

1070
01:35:21,783 --> 01:35:24,198
Hard to believe these quiet people,

1071
01:35:24,323 --> 01:35:26,197
these quiet girls
born thirty years later,

1072
01:35:26,322 --> 01:35:28,614
are nostalgic for imperial times.

1073
01:35:28,739 --> 01:35:32,235
Does sacrifice erase everything?

1074
01:35:38,030 --> 01:35:40,322
When you say ""it happened here"",

1075
01:35:40,447 --> 01:35:48,154
something deep inside us resurfaces.

1076
01:35:48,279 --> 01:35:55,519
That is why many people come
spontaneously, join hands and pray.

1077
01:35:56,070 --> 01:36:01,486
Myself, knowing or learning
the nature of this place,

1078
01:36:01,611 --> 01:36:05,152
I'd offer incense and pray.

1079
01:36:05,277 --> 01:36:09,022
That's all I need to know.

1080
01:36:14,276 --> 01:36:16,734
One wonders what a Japanese general

1081
01:36:16,859 --> 01:36:20,776
has in mind when he offers
his life to the Emperor.

1082
01:36:20,901 --> 01:36:24,314
Thanks to Yahara, we know.

1083
01:36:25,400 --> 01:36:27,858
The last thing Cho tells him is:

1084
01:36:27,983 --> 01:36:29,650
""Remember the French film

1085
01:36:29,775 --> 01:36:32,191
we saw
in Saigon, in '41?""

1086
01:36:32,316 --> 01:36:34,774
It was Waves of the Danube,

1087
01:36:34,899 --> 01:36:37,442
with extras posing as gypsies.

1088
01:36:37,567 --> 01:36:41,148
And the music Cho heard
while disembowelling himself,

1089
01:36:41,273 --> 01:36:43,149
watching the horizon for the last time,

1090
01:36:43,274 --> 01:36:46,306
was Black Eyes.

1091
01:36:58,064 --> 01:37:00,183
Am I going mad?

1092
01:37:02,145 --> 01:37:04,979
I used to see you everywhere,

1093
01:37:05,104 --> 01:37:08,313
I recognised you from afar,

1094
01:37:08,438 --> 01:37:12,020
I went back to the places we loved,

1095
01:37:12,145 --> 01:37:13,603
the Jardin des Plantes,

1096
01:37:13,728 --> 01:37:15,561
the little farm
at the Bois de Boulogne,

1097
01:37:15,686 --> 01:37:19,977
the shore beneath the Golden Gate

1098
01:37:20,102 --> 01:37:24,102
where Kim Novak feigns suicide
in Vertigo...

1099
01:37:24,227 --> 01:37:28,227
I'd see a man from behind,
looking at parrots,

1100
01:37:28,352 --> 01:37:34,597
or sitting among goats,
or leaning against a rail,

1101
01:37:35,018 --> 01:37:37,055
and it would be you.

1102
01:37:38,434 --> 01:37:44,467
Then I'd come closer,
he'd turn round, be someone else.

1103
01:37:45,183 --> 01:37:48,601
I'd wonder how anyone

1104
01:37:48,726 --> 01:37:50,964
could replace you so fast.

1105
01:37:51,724 --> 01:37:56,926
In my moment of distraction,
not more than a split second...

1106
01:38:00,016 --> 01:38:02,598
Now it's the same in the Network.

1107
01:38:02,723 --> 01:38:06,140
Someone calls, it's you,

1108
01:38:06,265 --> 01:38:09,389
I know by tell-tale signs,

1109
01:38:09,514 --> 01:38:13,847
a special word only we would use.

1110
01:38:13,972 --> 01:38:17,800
Then I'd question him,
and he'd shy away,

1111
01:38:18,180 --> 01:38:23,050
not like you anymore.
Then another sign.

1112
01:38:27,138 --> 01:38:29,542
Is this a game?

1113
01:38:30,553 --> 01:38:33,255
Is it you teasing me?

1114
01:38:38,677 --> 01:38:41,710
One day, one woman knows too much,

1115
01:38:43,385 --> 01:38:48,835
too much about you, about me,
about the Game, about everything.

1116
01:38:50,719 --> 01:38:54,166
We are plugged into the masks gallery.

1117
01:38:54,801 --> 01:39:01,840
I ask her to show me hers
and on the screen I see this.

1118
01:39:54,720 --> 01:39:59,302
The end of the battle is written
in the deep, by Okinawa,

1119
01:39:59,427 --> 01:40:02,802
where Oshima, surveyor of memories,

1120
01:40:02,927 --> 01:40:05,885
filmed underwater graveyards.

1121
01:40:06,010 --> 01:40:08,718
Okinawa was the Japs' sute-ishi,

1122
01:40:08,843 --> 01:40:10,468
their sacrificial pawn.

1123
01:40:10,593 --> 01:40:14,218
If the price was high enough, the US

1124
01:40:14,343 --> 01:40:16,218
would shrink from invading

1125
01:40:16,343 --> 01:40:17,883
Japan's main island

1126
01:40:18,008 --> 01:40:19,883
and peace could be made.

1127
01:40:20,008 --> 01:40:22,633
The reality was, it made the case

1128
01:40:22,758 --> 01:40:25,342
for the Atom Bomb.

1129
01:40:25,467 --> 01:40:29,174
Without Okinawa's resistance,
Hiroshima would not have been,

1130
01:40:29,299 --> 01:40:32,257
and the century would've been different.

1131
01:40:32,382 --> 01:40:34,632
Which means that in all respects,

1132
01:40:34,757 --> 01:40:37,923
our lives were fashioned by events

1133
01:40:38,048 --> 01:40:39,256
that took place in that little island,
between the moment

1134
01:40:39,381 --> 01:40:40,715
when Kinjo killed his family,

1135
01:40:40,840 --> 01:40:44,917
and general Ushijima's self-death.

1136
01:40:54,797 --> 01:40:56,420
Now Laura saw

1137
01:40:56,545 --> 01:40:58,670
the Game couldn't change history.

1138
01:40:58,795 --> 01:41:01,586
It would repeat it, in a loop,

1139
01:41:01,711 --> 01:41:05,086
with respectably futile obstinacy.

1140
01:41:05,211 --> 01:41:07,545
Storing the past so as not to revive it

1141
01:41:07,670 --> 01:41:10,205
was sheer 20th Century.

1142
01:41:14,627 --> 01:41:18,377
She was detached now,
as if she'd come to a limit;

1143
01:41:18,502 --> 01:41:23,408
The Game was not hers anymore,
nor was History.

1144
01:41:25,376 --> 01:41:28,918
I knew she spoke with Masks at night.

1145
01:41:29,043 --> 01:41:30,751
I asked what she wanted, she responded:

1146
01:41:30,876 --> 01:41:33,501
Level Five, of course,
in a tone that made you think

1147
01:41:33,626 --> 01:41:38,042
she was cured, as if for her
the War was over.

1148
01:41:38,167 --> 01:41:40,739
Naturally, I was wrong.

1149
01:41:46,332 --> 01:41:50,874
Last night: fun dialog
with a mask.

1150
01:41:50,999 --> 01:41:53,790
A Harfang owl mask, so I listened.

1151
01:41:53,915 --> 01:41:56,915
Having some knowledge about Harfang,

1152
01:41:57,040 --> 01:41:59,528
in our days, shows some culture.

1153
01:42:00,998 --> 01:42:03,622
Disappointing, as usual.

1154
01:42:03,747 --> 01:42:05,748
When he went for a date

1155
01:42:05,873 --> 01:42:07,747
I really got him:

1156
01:42:07,872 --> 01:42:10,246
""Think of all the time we've saved

1157
01:42:10,371 --> 01:42:13,120
in just five minutes:

1158
01:42:13,245 --> 01:42:17,663
Six months of passion,
two years of jealousy,

1159
01:42:17,788 --> 01:42:23,652
four years' infidelity,
eight of misunderstandings,

1160
01:42:25,745 --> 01:42:28,203
reconciliation one spring,

1161
01:42:28,328 --> 01:42:32,078
one summer of fighting,
one autumn of breaking up,

1162
01:42:32,203 --> 01:42:36,035
one winter of dispair,
just work it out.

1163
01:42:36,160 --> 01:42:40,369
Bye and thanks for the time saved"".

1164
01:42:40,494 --> 01:42:42,946
He found nothing to say.

1165
01:42:45,493 --> 01:42:50,944
And you?
Shall I thank you?

1166
01:42:55,783 --> 01:42:58,825
The list I gave him, so as to shine,

1167
01:42:58,950 --> 01:43:02,361
did time have it in store for us?

1168
01:43:09,532 --> 01:43:13,228
I see me, in ten years, without you,

1169
01:43:14,448 --> 01:43:19,152
reading in the paper you've died,

1170
01:43:20,282 --> 01:43:26,644
a feeling of something already seen,
already lost,

1171
01:43:30,697 --> 01:43:34,903
the faraway echo of something
I don't know,

1172
01:43:35,820 --> 01:43:39,944
your absence now
which I wouldn't have known,

1173
01:43:40,821 --> 01:43:44,399
but would have felt within me,

1174
01:43:45,028 --> 01:43:50,017
as if my programmer foresaw it all,

1175
01:43:50,611 --> 01:43:54,474
what happened, what
might have happened.

1176
01:43:58,526 --> 01:44:00,734
Like when you search for a word

1177
01:44:00,859 --> 01:44:03,810
that escapes you.

1178
01:44:05,276 --> 01:44:08,144
""I had it on the tip of my tongue"".

1179
01:44:10,901 --> 01:44:15,806
I'd have your death
on the tip of my memory,

1180
01:44:19,901 --> 01:44:22,352
I'd have thought:

1181
01:44:22,941 --> 01:44:25,690
""There was a time when...""

1182
01:44:29,732 --> 01:44:33,566
But then there was another time,
the time of my list,

1183
01:44:33,691 --> 01:44:36,231
from jealousy to deceit,

1184
01:44:36,356 --> 01:44:39,935
and that time would mute our time,

1185
01:44:41,939 --> 01:44:45,684
mute the echo of our life.

1186
01:44:48,105 --> 01:44:52,845
Everything would have been
as though through a wall,

1187
01:44:54,811 --> 01:44:57,644
barely audible...

1188
01:44:58,103 --> 01:45:02,310
Like when rescuers search
through a wall of rubble,

1189
01:45:03,603 --> 01:45:06,471
they always come too late.

1190
01:45:10,894 --> 01:45:15,764
And you?
What would you have kept?

1191
01:45:18,934 --> 01:45:22,798
One day my image would begin to blur,

1192
01:45:24,601 --> 01:45:29,222
you'd realise the scraps of words,

1193
01:45:30,725 --> 01:45:33,100
scraps of life filling your memory,

1194
01:45:33,225 --> 01:45:39,386
were shifting out of focus.

1195
01:45:46,141 --> 01:45:49,303
Must I thank you too?

1196
01:45:55,015 --> 01:45:57,965
Thank you for this gift?

1197
01:46:02,180 --> 01:46:06,431
A life in which
there wasn't enough time

1198
01:46:06,556 --> 01:46:13,297
for something mediocre to slip in,
neither lies nor cruelty.

1199
01:46:14,346 --> 01:46:17,719
So swift that the ordinary gremlins,

1200
01:46:17,844 --> 01:46:20,720
that sneak into everyday life,

1201
01:46:20,845 --> 01:46:23,713
haven't had the chance to get to us.

1202
01:46:25,053 --> 01:46:30,042
They met a shut door:

1203
01:46:34,344 --> 01:46:36,748
""Closed for a death"".

1204
01:46:36,926 --> 01:46:39,301
So annoying for them.

1205
01:46:39,426 --> 01:46:41,925
Nothing for them in the will.

1206
01:46:42,050 --> 01:46:45,176
A life, a body, untouched,

1207
01:46:45,301 --> 01:46:50,124
on which I never saw the first signs

1208
01:46:51,800 --> 01:46:54,004
of lovelessness,

1209
01:46:57,591 --> 01:46:59,960
abandon

1210
01:47:00,174 --> 01:47:02,627
or relinquishment.

1211
01:47:07,840 --> 01:47:13,341
A real fairy-tale, one of them
falls asleep

1212
01:47:13,466 --> 01:47:15,834
and never changes.

1213
01:47:16,505 --> 01:47:19,670
There's no greater gift.

1214
01:47:22,006 --> 01:47:24,246
Shall I thank you?

1215
01:47:26,504 --> 01:47:28,495
I thank you.

1216
01:47:29,336 --> 01:47:31,244
Thank you.

1217
01:47:31,670 --> 01:47:33,707
Thank you.

1218
01:47:42,920 --> 01:47:45,324
I never saw Laura again.

1219
01:47:45,585 --> 01:47:48,209
The workshop seemed unchanged,

1220
01:47:48,334 --> 01:47:49,794
the machines were on,

1221
01:47:49,919 --> 01:47:51,710
as if she had just stepped out.

1222
01:47:51,835 --> 01:47:55,833
Our loyal screensaver cat kept watch.

1223
01:47:55,958 --> 01:47:59,876
And the OWL mail page was open.

1224
01:48:00,001 --> 01:48:02,869
Without thinking, I typed in her name.

1225
01:48:09,500 --> 01:48:12,664
He didn't know that either.

Under the patronage of

4
00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:41,160
in collaboration with

5
00:00:41,330 --> 00:00:45,880
This film was only made thanks to the work
of director Ferruccio Castronuovo

6
00:00:45,999 --> 00:00:50,775
on the sets of Fellini's ""City of Women"",
""The Ship Sails On"" and ""Ginger and Fred"".

7
00:00:50,994 --> 00:00:54,840
These films, the ""Specials"",
were used to promote upcoming films.

8
00:00:55,080 --> 00:00:57,999
Now they've been restored,
after more than 40 years

9
00:00:58,360 --> 00:01:00,279
at the Cineteca Nazionale.

10
00:01:01,239 --> 00:01:03,919
To Ferruccio the greatest gratitude
for this unique tribute

11
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:06,160
to be carefully preserved.

12
00:01:12,119 --> 00:01:14,319
Get down on your knees to see better.

13
00:01:14,479 --> 00:01:16,080
It's not amusing.

14
00:01:16,160 --> 00:01:19,039
Keep it that way,
we'll add something later.

15
00:01:19,119 --> 00:01:20,119
Go! Quick!

16
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:30,039
All directors do the shot,
the reverse shot and wide shot,

17
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:32,720
but with him, this is just the beginning.

18
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:40,160
Take a seat, ma'am.

19
00:01:40,814 --> 00:01:41,920
How are you?

20
00:01:46,399 --> 00:01:47,800
Look at the camera.

21
00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:56,119
Rosina, who comes from Verrucchio,

22
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:59,760
is the first one to come out of the heap!

23
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:03,520
I’m a Bette Davis lookalike.

24
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:05,560
I’m Lucio Dalla’s double.

25
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:10,080
Wait! Stop everything!

26
00:02:10,679 --> 00:02:12,920
Slow down!

27
00:02:13,119 --> 00:02:18,720
We stay here, from morning till night,
trapped together. We create a world apart.

28
00:02:18,832 --> 00:02:20,240
It's a ""Fellinopolis"".

29
00:02:22,279 --> 00:02:23,999
Scene 33/5/5.

30
00:02:50,999 --> 00:02:55,320
Stage 5 in Cinecittà is the ideal place.
The utmost excitement.

31
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:57,880
Thrilling, entrancing...

32
00:02:58,679 --> 00:03:01,480
That's what I feel
in front of the empty stage.

33
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:05,680
A space to fill, a world to build.

34
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:21,240
Please try to hold the positions
you have been given,

35
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:23,706
Roll camera! Clear the scene!

36
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:27,600
Too much smoke! Stop it!

37
00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:30,279
Roll camera.

38
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:32,440
Action, Marcello!

39
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:37,600
Move forward!

40
00:03:38,239 --> 00:03:40,279
Get out! Get out!

41
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:48,520
Louder! Shout louder!

42
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:52,439
Come forward! Come on! Come on!

43
00:03:52,999 --> 00:03:55,679
Go this way! This way! Go!

44
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:59,119
Ferocious, ferocious!

45
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:04,640
Stop! Thank you.

46
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:08,480
Flora Mastroianni, Marcello's wife,

47
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:12,559
was my friend since school.

48
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:17,080
It was at her house that I met Fellini.

49
00:04:17,279 --> 00:04:19,400
Get down on your knees to see better.

50
00:04:20,279 --> 00:04:22,039
You recognize him, you scream.

51
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:24,680
Stand up. Stand up!

52
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:35,120
There he is!

53
00:04:35,121 --> 00:04:36,121
I first met Fellini on the set
of ""Satyricon"",

54
00:04:36,122 --> 00:04:37,122
on which I worked as the assistant
of Luigi Schiaccianoce.

55
00:04:37,123 --> 00:04:40,600
I met him in his kingdom, Cinecittà.

56
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:46,960
I met Federico in 1963.

57
00:04:47,159 --> 00:04:49,200
I used to go RAI television

58
00:04:49,359 --> 00:04:52,799
and ask if there were any chances

59
00:04:52,959 --> 00:04:55,039
to have an internship.

60
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:57,320
There I met Federico Fellini.

61
00:04:57,479 --> 00:05:00,959
""Excuse me, you make a lot of movies,

62
00:05:01,039 --> 00:05:06,279
may I have a chance to work with you?""

63
00:05:06,399 --> 00:05:07,919
After that meeting,

64
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,760
I worked with him from 1963 to 1993.

65
00:05:11,839 --> 00:05:17,200
You all stand up and you come
just about where you are now.

66
00:05:17,279 --> 00:05:23,440
At one point in my life
I decided to start working in movies.

67
00:05:25,839 --> 00:05:27,800
I had a stroke of luck,

68
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:30,120
because I met Maurizio Mein.

69
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:33,760
Please try to hold the positions
you have been given.

70
00:05:33,839 --> 00:05:36,719
He was Fellini's assistant.

71
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:42,080
I implored him: ""Maurizio,
please introduce me to Fellini.""

72
00:05:42,359 --> 00:05:45,920
On a Friday afternoon, I got a phone call.

73
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:50,200
""Ferruccio, are you free
on Monday morning?""

74
00:05:50,279 --> 00:05:50,960
""Yes.""

75
00:05:51,080 --> 00:05:54,640
""Then come to Cinecittà.
Fellini wants to meet you"".

76
00:05:55,159 --> 00:05:57,640
""Fellini wants to meet me? Bugger off!""

77
00:05:57,839 --> 00:06:00,520
I thought a friend
was playing a joke on me.

78
00:06:00,599 --> 00:06:06,240
""No, I'm Norman,
the production manager of Casanova.""

79
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:09,120
""Casanova""?! Holy shit!

80
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:13,280
I didn't sleep for two nights.

81
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:17,440
One afternoon, which I will never forget,

82
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:19,880
the phone rang and a voice said:

83
00:06:22,279 --> 00:06:27,200
""Good morning,
I am Fellini's assistant director.

84
00:06:27,279 --> 00:06:32,120
The Master would like
to meet you tomorrow morning

85
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:35,520
in the offices of Stage 5
at Cinecittà film studios.""

86
00:06:36,039 --> 00:06:37,599
I took it as a joke

87
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:40,400
and I answered: ""Sure, I'll be there.""

88
00:06:42,479 --> 00:06:45,399
Then, luckily, I had some doubt
and the following morning

89
00:06:45,479 --> 00:06:49,080
I went to the offices
of Stage 5 in Cinecittà.

90
00:06:50,399 --> 00:06:54,120
We spoke in his office.

91
00:06:55,799 --> 00:06:59,000
From that day on,
with the exceptional unaffectedness

92
00:06:59,080 --> 00:07:03,320
that he was able
to infuse in any relationship,

93
00:07:04,447 --> 00:07:08,200
I worked with him, we spoke
on the phone, we exchanged views...

94
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:10,920
nearly every day for 11 years.

95
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:36,959
I worked in the costume
department laboratory.

96
00:07:36,959 --> 00:07:40,200
I dealt with aging, among other tasks.

97
00:07:40,279 --> 00:07:43,840
I supervised the seamstresses,
the making of stage costumes.

98
00:07:45,959 --> 00:07:51,680
I was Gabriella Pescucci's assistant
for ""City of Women"".

99
00:07:56,919 --> 00:07:59,080
Bark. You have to bark.

100
00:08:01,599 --> 00:08:04,479
What if we do it yellow
instead of this color?

101
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:06,000
Golden?

102
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:23,080
There was a lot to do, we had to create
the feminists' costumes...

103
00:08:23,159 --> 00:08:26,039
We had to invent quite a bit.

104
00:08:39,577 --> 00:08:42,296
Try playing, turn towards me. That's it!

105
00:08:43,079 --> 00:08:44,840
The other way.

106
00:08:44,919 --> 00:08:47,360
Good, that's it. All the way!

107
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:49,800
Play like this.

108
00:09:01,439 --> 00:09:07,319
Later on, as a set manager,
I was almost always there, at his side.

109
00:09:07,399 --> 00:09:09,920
We got on instantly.

110
00:09:21,319 --> 00:09:24,800
Take a seat, I'll set you up later.

111
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:27,960
All right. Then?

112
00:09:28,279 --> 00:09:30,600
Thank you.
We'll see you later. Goodbye.

113
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:53,720
I wanted to tell
the whole story, the work,

114
00:09:53,799 --> 00:09:55,800
the set of Fellini's films.

115
00:10:01,919 --> 00:10:04,120
Lower the trunk!

116
00:10:08,919 --> 00:10:13,360
I started to look for the best
framing I could imagine.

117
00:10:13,439 --> 00:10:15,560
Raise the trunks!

118
00:10:24,079 --> 00:10:26,199
Pull up the trunks!

119
00:10:26,399 --> 00:10:28,760
That's it!
Roll camera, let's go!

120
00:10:29,679 --> 00:10:31,240
Scene 33/3/1.

121
00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:33,640
Don't move!

122
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:37,720
The challenge of portraying
the story of ""City of Women""

123
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:43,159
didn't prove easy, also
because I didn't know the script.

124
00:10:43,319 --> 00:10:46,480
I didn't know what exactly
Fellini wanted to tell.

125
00:10:46,679 --> 00:10:48,559
The more money, the more rounds!

126
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:52,160
Inside this shack, you can watch
the most dangerous exercises...

127
00:10:55,079 --> 00:10:57,120
I chose to tell the film

128
00:10:57,279 --> 00:11:02,319
in a much more explicit way

129
00:11:02,422 --> 00:11:05,200
than just doing interviews here and there.

130
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:10,039
In fact, there's no narrator.

131
00:11:10,520 --> 00:11:11,960
It's all direct sound.

132
00:11:15,199 --> 00:11:17,000
Later we plug them in here.

133
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:20,600
Bring the pulley back here!

134
00:11:29,439 --> 00:11:31,399
The fateful Saturday comes along,

135
00:11:31,679 --> 00:11:34,279
and Fellini wants
to see the material I shot.

136
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:40,159
Gianni, I'll arrange the bulbs
to be put here on the sides.

137
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:43,120
I saw Fellini controlling everything.

138
00:11:43,199 --> 00:11:47,360
He tore up all the photos:
""This is bad... this is bad"".

139
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:49,000
I was shaking.

140
00:11:49,199 --> 00:11:50,520
Fellini's examination,

141
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:53,679
when check what you shot
at the editing table

142
00:11:54,159 --> 00:11:55,600
is a terrible moment!

143
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:57,640
He came in and watched.

144
00:12:05,799 --> 00:12:08,439
Every now and then
he turned and looked at me.

145
00:12:09,199 --> 00:12:11,480
I would smile, shyly.

146
00:12:17,559 --> 00:12:19,279
He would restart the Moviola.

147
00:12:19,919 --> 00:12:22,440
Then he'd stop and say:
""Where were you here?""

148
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:25,439
Take 2-6

149
00:12:25,960 --> 00:12:29,279
Then we saw what was going on
in front of Fellini.

150
00:12:29,640 --> 00:12:31,799
Attention, please! We are ready!

151
00:12:33,159 --> 00:12:34,840
Don't move!

152
00:12:35,640 --> 00:12:37,480
Rolling camera!

153
00:12:43,439 --> 00:12:44,640
He's coming down.

154
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:49,399
Brake! Slow down!

155
00:12:51,399 --> 00:12:53,840
The rope is too loose, leave it on!

156
00:12:55,199 --> 00:12:57,319
- Did you hurt?
- Slower.

157
00:12:57,520 --> 00:13:02,240
""From now on, you are the only person
allowed to shoot on the set of my films.""

158
00:13:02,679 --> 00:13:05,439
And he kept his word,
because I went on filming.

159
00:13:05,520 --> 00:13:08,640
""City of Women"",
""The Ship Sails On"" and ""Ginger and Fred"".

160
00:13:09,079 --> 00:13:11,520
Mustn't I look at you?

161
00:13:12,159 --> 00:13:15,600
- I don't like the way you to look at me.
- I won't look at you!

162
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:16,960
Fine.

163
00:13:18,559 --> 00:13:19,559
Ready!

164
00:13:20,840 --> 00:13:23,799
You don't like the way I look
at you? I won't look!

165
00:13:29,199 --> 00:13:31,199
Without moving. You should stay...

166
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:34,399
Can you see the camera?

167
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:36,880
If you do this like he does...

168
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:47,840
Ready!

169
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:52,760
I was an assistant director,
so I would do everything

170
00:13:52,840 --> 00:13:56,439
as assistants are expected to do.

171
00:13:56,640 --> 00:13:58,080
Music, Maestro!

172
00:14:10,159 --> 00:14:15,600
This is a particular film,
it didn't cost me any effort to make it.

173
00:14:16,039 --> 00:14:20,319
It almost came about without me
knowing and today it's over.

174
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:41,360
Federico and I were in a taxi
and another car passed by.

175
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:47,160
And inside the other car
there was a ""face"".

176
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:52,520
A face that struck Federico.

177
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,799
He said: ""Follow that car.""

178
00:14:56,880 --> 00:15:00,600
It was an eternal line from the movies.

179
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,319
So I did.

180
00:15:03,159 --> 00:15:07,319
I got out of the car in a hurry,
took another taxi and followed it.

181
00:15:19,079 --> 00:15:23,520
He would have liked to have
all the faces of the world around him.

182
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:25,439
What's your role in this movie?

183
00:15:25,880 --> 00:15:27,520
The role of Saraghina.

184
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:31,000
- Do you know that ""Saraghina"" is a fish?
- Yes.

185
00:15:31,079 --> 00:15:32,840
And it's a pretty skinny fish!

186
00:15:33,399 --> 00:15:35,799
The charm of Federico

187
00:15:36,279 --> 00:15:39,799
and his world. Those extraordinary faces

188
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
that you didn't see in other movies.

189
00:15:42,199 --> 00:15:44,360
It's a Noah's ark, no more, no less.

190
00:15:44,640 --> 00:15:49,120
Look at all the characters,
they're more like animals.

191
00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:54,640
We're all animals. I'm a beast too.

192
00:15:54,960 --> 00:15:59,600
He's got all these incredible characters,
like in a wax museum.

193
00:15:59,880 --> 00:16:02,640
When someone asked:
""Where do you find them?""

194
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:06,399
He would reply:
""I have a shop where I pick them up.""

195
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:09,840
Both with professional
and non-professional actors,

196
00:16:09,919 --> 00:16:14,159
I'm affected by a form of gratitude
for the mere fact that they permit me

197
00:16:14,439 --> 00:16:18,559
to see the incarnation,
the embodiment of characters

198
00:16:18,640 --> 00:16:22,039
who until a month earlier,
lived only in my imagination.

199
00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:25,840
They were impalpable,
like visions from a dream.

200
00:16:26,039 --> 00:16:27,520
It’s really them, now.

201
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:30,880
One of these minor characters
amuses me very much,

202
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:32,919
because he's always so snooty.

203
00:16:33,399 --> 00:16:35,520
He argued about everything.

204
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:40,159
I made him wear
a long white mane, kind of like Einstein

205
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:43,559
and that upset him a lot.

206
00:16:43,640 --> 00:16:46,919
One day, he said to me:
""I look like an old man!""

207
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:50,279
So I asked: ""Why? How old are you?""
He replied: ""78.""

208
00:16:50,360 --> 00:16:54,760
I have hair like Giuseppe Verdi,
Pirandello's goatee,

209
00:16:55,159 --> 00:16:57,120
I'm in disguise!

210
00:16:59,159 --> 00:17:03,919
The characters were there, and there were
indications as to what they represented,

211
00:17:04,120 --> 00:17:06,319
but he used to invent things every day.

212
00:17:06,399 --> 00:17:10,039
We know nothing,
because we see just fragments

213
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:14,840
and we just work with fragments,
without knowing what will come out.

214
00:17:15,039 --> 00:17:18,240
He invents. He will invent something.

215
00:17:20,440 --> 00:17:24,839
Using his own words,
something ""supernatural"",""magical"",

216
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:27,840
from the depths of the subconscious.

217
00:17:33,599 --> 00:17:40,000
When we were out looking for faces,
he didn't have a definite script.

218
00:17:51,279 --> 00:17:54,400
Do you reckon, do you understand

219
00:17:54,639 --> 00:17:57,920
the lines in the script?
Do you get it wrong sometime?

220
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:01,960
There are no lines,
because there's no script.

221
00:18:02,680 --> 00:18:04,279
- Not at all?
- No!

222
00:18:04,520 --> 00:18:09,840
It wasn't clear what he was getting at.

223
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:14,359
The character will become clear
as the film develops.

224
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:21,400
Do the seductive
'Fumagalli smile', like that time.

225
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:25,240
Give me that little smile...

226
00:18:27,160 --> 00:18:30,279
There was a script, it did exist,

227
00:18:30,359 --> 00:18:34,839
he just didn't always stick to it.

228
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:38,839
He would invent lines at the last minute,

229
00:18:38,920 --> 00:18:43,639
totally different from the original ones,
and this frightened some of the actors.

230
00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:45,319
In ""The Ship Sails On""

231
00:18:45,680 --> 00:18:49,359
there was a big group of British actors,

232
00:18:49,839 --> 00:18:54,000
used to know exactly what was going on.

233
00:18:54,079 --> 00:18:57,319
Well, that didn't happen with Federico.

234
00:18:57,400 --> 00:19:00,639
Yes, he was on a schedule, but nobody knew

235
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:04,520
where he was going to start
and when he was going to finish.

236
00:19:06,680 --> 00:19:07,680
Ready.

237
00:19:10,079 --> 00:19:11,279
Roll camera.

238
00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:14,279
Scene 21/47/4.

239
00:19:15,599 --> 00:19:17,680
Entirely spontaneous.

240
00:19:18,319 --> 00:19:22,000
He expresses exactly what he wants.

241
00:19:24,879 --> 00:19:27,520
What I demand and I try to defend,

242
00:19:27,599 --> 00:19:29,879
is not the freedom of improvisation,

243
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:36,240
but rather that inexpressible margin,
which I find vitally necessary,

244
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:41,079
not to suffocate the characters
and their story

245
00:19:41,160 --> 00:19:45,920
through a programme
utterly pre-arranged and organized.

246
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,160
When I showed up for this movie,

247
00:19:49,279 --> 00:19:52,119
I said: ""But Federico, I can't sing!""

248
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:57,119
""You don't need to sing!
You're an actor, you make gestures.""

249
00:19:57,279 --> 00:20:00,559
During the shooting, he didn't waste time,

250
00:20:00,639 --> 00:20:03,000
though he was a perfectionist.

251
00:20:03,079 --> 00:20:05,039
I once heard one of the actresses

252
00:20:05,119 --> 00:20:07,559
repeat a line...

253
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,520
...12 times!

254
00:20:22,359 --> 00:20:27,639
During the shooting of ""Amarcord"",
we were at the table with Pupella Maggio,

255
00:20:27,839 --> 00:20:30,240
Bruno Zanin and other actors.

256
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:34,000
We were shooting the scene
where I had to eat a chicken leg.

257
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:36,799
I made a mistake, then Pupella made one,

258
00:20:36,879 --> 00:20:39,319
then Bruno Zanin.

259
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:42,240
After the eighteenth or nineteenth take,

260
00:20:42,799 --> 00:20:46,559
I begged him: ""Federico can I pretend
and just eat a little piece?""

261
00:20:46,639 --> 00:20:48,920
""No, you have to eat it all!""

262
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:51,680
Twenty-three chicken legs!

263
00:20:52,160 --> 00:20:56,760
Unless things weren't perfectly in line
with his head and heart,

264
00:20:57,247 --> 00:20:58,767
he kept doing it over and over.

265
00:21:11,359 --> 00:21:12,960
Scene 21/28/2.

266
00:21:13,119 --> 00:21:15,639
Pull up the tubes, good.

267
00:21:16,119 --> 00:21:17,079
Action Vittorio!

268
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:18,319
No, wait!

269
00:21:18,599 --> 00:21:20,240
Turn! Smile!

270
00:21:21,039 --> 00:21:24,559
Put your hand on the wheel.
Lift your head.

271
00:21:38,039 --> 00:21:42,400
Will you pass me a life jacket, please?
I'm about to drown. Seriously!

272
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:47,680
I turned his dreams into scenic design.

273
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:50,520
Everything he wanted.

274
00:21:56,720 --> 00:22:00,839
And he listened to me, because having
worked together for a long time,

275
00:22:00,920 --> 00:22:04,120
we were on the same wavelength.

276
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:10,079
I addressed him with respect,
even if he always put me at ease.

277
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:12,000
I was his tool

278
00:22:12,119 --> 00:22:16,960
to accomplish what he had in mind,
what went through his head.

279
00:22:29,240 --> 00:22:31,599
Get very close together.

280
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:35,599
Look over there,
everybody look to your right.

281
00:22:36,119 --> 00:22:40,279
Swing left and right, slowly.
Not with your head!

282
00:22:58,639 --> 00:23:02,000
I've been kidnapped for almost 15 years,

283
00:23:02,520 --> 00:23:04,200
with him, day and night,

284
00:23:04,279 --> 00:23:07,280
at Cinecittà, also known
as ""Guantanamo Bay"".

285
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:34,400
Two years later, he started
to conceive ""The Ship Sails On"".

286
00:23:34,639 --> 00:23:37,200
He thought of me as costume designer.

287
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:56,079
I, of course, didn't want to,
I didn't feel ready.

288
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:59,279
It was too demanding,
it was a period film.

289
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:01,360
It was a huge thing.

290
00:24:02,559 --> 00:24:05,920
I... lost sleep.

291
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,039
But he was adamant.

292
00:24:08,119 --> 00:24:10,000
He called me every day.

293
00:24:10,079 --> 00:24:12,400
""You have to do it!""

294
00:24:12,680 --> 00:24:16,480
I was really worried sick.

295
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:18,799
Too big a thing.

296
00:24:18,879 --> 00:24:22,320
It was my first film as head
of the costume department.

297
00:24:22,599 --> 00:24:23,599
Let's see.

298
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:27,079
You must wear black gloves.
You'll have them on set.

299
00:24:27,160 --> 00:24:29,720
- So is that all right?
- Yeah, all right.

300
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:33,760
But then he guided me,
took me by the hand

301
00:24:33,839 --> 00:24:37,279
and it proved a wonderful experience.

302
00:24:38,079 --> 00:24:40,440
- Ready!
- Scene 1/6/2.

303
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:42,400
Action!

304
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:44,839
At one point, there's a character

305
00:24:44,920 --> 00:24:47,520
flipping through a photo album.

306
00:24:47,839 --> 00:24:50,520
There were photos and film clips.

307
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:55,960
After two months preparation, he said:
""Let's start taking photos

308
00:24:56,039 --> 00:24:59,079
and shoot the vintage footage"", suddenly.

309
00:25:00,639 --> 00:25:03,240
I'm still convinced,

310
00:25:03,319 --> 00:25:05,799
he wanted to test me,

311
00:25:05,879 --> 00:25:09,400
see if I would be able to make it or not.

312
00:25:11,839 --> 00:25:15,760
It was a film within the film,
shooting lasted one month.

313
00:25:15,839 --> 00:25:20,680
There was the filming of three operas,
with costumes typical of the period

314
00:25:20,760 --> 00:25:23,119
in which the action took place,

315
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:26,599
the early 20th Century, 1905-1906.

316
00:25:26,680 --> 00:25:28,720
It wasn't at all easy.

317
00:25:28,799 --> 00:25:32,160
Then the singer's departure,

318
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:36,799
and all the various characters,
as seen in the film.

319
00:25:36,879 --> 00:25:42,200
Singers, opera supervisors, dancers...

320
00:25:42,279 --> 00:25:43,960
So, a real feat.

321
00:25:44,160 --> 00:25:46,360
And... I succeeded.

322
00:26:04,728 --> 00:26:07,800
I'm fat and I'm a banker with Fellini.

323
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:11,799
An opera singer
who loves cooking and women.

324
00:26:12,079 --> 00:26:13,440
I am a volunteer.

325
00:26:13,680 --> 00:26:16,400
My profession: Women's hairdresser.

326
00:26:16,599 --> 00:26:20,879
Unfortunately, the ""Fellini State""
prosecutors play jokes on you,

327
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:24,920
sending you to a golden island
that's the equivalent of a jail.

328
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:27,160
We stay here from morning till night,

329
00:26:27,279 --> 00:26:30,839
trapped together,
we create a world apart.

330
00:26:31,160 --> 00:26:35,319
We've had good days and bad days.

331
00:26:35,480 --> 00:26:38,520
We're going to have
an election to nominate a Mayor,

332
00:26:38,599 --> 00:26:39,760
a city council...

333
00:26:39,839 --> 00:26:43,040
This is a separate nation
inhabited by ""Fellinian people"".

334
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:47,799
It's well worth going to work with Fellini

335
00:26:48,359 --> 00:26:49,599
who is a great man.

336
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:51,799
Let's go, guys.

337
00:26:54,160 --> 00:26:57,760
Is that a wide angle?
Are you going to give me a huge nose?

338
00:26:57,839 --> 00:27:01,559
Then you see...
These eyebrows are fake.

339
00:27:01,879 --> 00:27:02,920
I'm all fake.

340
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:06,639
Go on stage, go on stage!

341
00:27:07,879 --> 00:27:08,879
Action.

342
00:27:09,079 --> 00:27:13,400
I had to rebuild
the whole ship inside Stage 5.

343
00:27:13,480 --> 00:27:18,079
It was assembled on a big platform
and mounted on a mechanism,

344
00:27:18,160 --> 00:27:20,600
giving the impression of a ship at sea.

345
00:27:29,559 --> 00:27:31,120
The ship moved.

346
00:27:33,720 --> 00:27:35,879
It simulated the pitch

347
00:27:36,200 --> 00:27:38,839
thanks to the hydraulic systems
underneath.

348
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:44,800
The scale of the model was about 45-50%,
so practically half a real size ship.

349
00:27:51,960 --> 00:27:53,960
You'd get on, and once on board,

350
00:27:54,039 --> 00:27:57,680
you couldn't get off
until the shooting was over.

351
00:27:57,760 --> 00:28:01,639
The funny thing was,
that once they had built

352
00:28:01,720 --> 00:28:05,039
that big moving ship,

353
00:28:05,319 --> 00:28:10,720
he said: ""Guys, do whatever you want,
but don't move the ship. I get seasick.""

354
00:28:10,799 --> 00:28:16,559
He never stepped on the ship,
but directed from a scaffold on the side.

355
00:28:16,639 --> 00:28:21,000
So, the poor actors
and the whole crew, were forced

356
00:28:21,160 --> 00:28:27,480
to take pills against the sea-sickness
they developed after getting on board.

357
00:28:27,559 --> 00:28:30,920
It went on for a long time
because the filming

358
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:34,440
on the ship's deck
lasted well over four months.

359
00:28:36,599 --> 00:28:37,639
For Fellini,

360
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:43,800
the sea was a sort of suggestion
to be conveyed to the viewer.

361
00:28:51,960 --> 00:28:54,119
It was spectacular.

362
00:28:54,200 --> 00:28:57,720
Visitors came from all over the world.

363
00:28:57,799 --> 00:29:02,440
There was always a queue at Cinecittà,
everyone wanted to come and see Fellini.

364
00:29:02,520 --> 00:29:07,960
I remember the Swedish Royal Family,
the Italian intelligentsia,

365
00:29:08,039 --> 00:29:09,920
from Moravia to Ginsburg...

366
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:14,720
A lot of American directors,
actors, producers...

367
00:29:14,799 --> 00:29:18,000
It was a never-ending flow.

368
00:29:22,119 --> 00:29:25,680
Being on a Fellini set
was such a privilege.

369
00:29:45,879 --> 00:29:49,839
Fellini doesn't want
a rhino that looks real.

370
00:29:50,039 --> 00:29:51,480
He said to me:

371
00:29:51,559 --> 00:29:56,160
""I must have the feeling
of seeing an overturned truck.""

372
00:29:56,359 --> 00:30:00,639
I think Fellini chose it because
it is the most fascinating animal

373
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:02,559
in the world.

374
00:30:02,799 --> 00:30:07,360
This ear, for example,
is a wrap, a parcel.

375
00:30:07,920 --> 00:30:09,799
I can give it various positions.

376
00:30:09,879 --> 00:30:13,920
This one could be when
it is lying in the cargo hold.

377
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:18,160
This animal can adopt
an infinite number of postures.

378
00:30:18,359 --> 00:30:21,680
Fellini has named me
the rhino's guardian.

379
00:30:22,359 --> 00:30:26,359
Keep calm, Ciccillo, keep calm.
Everything will be fine, don't worry.

380
00:30:26,440 --> 00:30:27,799
Keep calm, Ciccillo.

381
00:30:27,879 --> 00:30:32,559
We're taking it into Noah's Ark
to save it from the Great Flood.

382
00:30:32,639 --> 00:30:38,559
It's an invention to collapse an age,
a world, and create a new one.

383
00:30:38,639 --> 00:30:41,039
It's a kind of E.T. of ancient history.

384
00:30:48,119 --> 00:30:52,119
Fellini was definitely my master,
but also a master of manipulation,

385
00:30:52,200 --> 00:30:55,720
because he was a master of lies.

386
00:30:56,319 --> 00:30:58,680
Federico?! An incorrigible liar!

387
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:06,360
As Giulietta used to say, he turned
red in shame when he told the truth.

388
00:31:06,760 --> 00:31:11,599
Of course, Federico, like many
artists, almost all of them...

389
00:31:12,680 --> 00:31:14,160
was a big liar.

390
00:31:15,119 --> 00:31:20,319
I used to tell him lots of fibs,
because he liked to hear them.

391
00:31:20,400 --> 00:31:24,639
He knew I was a liar too,
but for him this was fine,

392
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:28,680
because he liked not to hear true things,

393
00:31:28,767 --> 00:31:31,680
but interesting lies.

394
00:31:32,119 --> 00:31:35,799
Keep your head down and look there.

395
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:38,240
Your eyes must to look up.
Even when...

396
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:39,480
Yes.

397
00:31:40,119 --> 00:31:41,839
Yes, even when you talk...

398
00:31:42,639 --> 00:31:48,279
You have to be someone between
a priest, a judge and a son of a bitch.

399
00:31:48,680 --> 00:31:52,200
Don't move your head, just smile.
Close your mouth, smile.

400
00:31:52,879 --> 00:31:56,760
Deep down he wasn't so much lying,
but rather inventing his own truth.

401
00:31:57,279 --> 00:32:01,359
His truth was what
he represented in the cinema.

402
00:32:01,680 --> 00:32:08,079
He's always been himself in the movie
industry, it has been shown wide and far.

403
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:12,920
He has been presented in various ways,
but he held his own personality.

404
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:18,760
In short, he was always Fellini.
Fortunately, I might add.

405
00:32:21,680 --> 00:32:24,400
11/5/4.

406
00:32:24,879 --> 00:32:28,079
For a small director like me,

407
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:32,400
finding myself in front of actors
like Fellini, Mastroianni, Masina,

408
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:36,760
the elite, the best of cinema
you could ever meet,

409
00:32:36,839 --> 00:32:40,039
was one of the most beautiful things,
the greatest luck

410
00:32:40,119 --> 00:32:43,119
I could have in life.

411
00:32:44,039 --> 00:32:46,400
Ballet rehearsal at Stage 15.

412
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:48,359
11/5/1

413
00:32:48,680 --> 00:32:49,960
Do you remember it?

414
00:32:50,319 --> 00:32:53,200
Yes, of course, in the end
it changes into a waltz.

415
00:33:17,920 --> 00:33:20,480
- Very nice.
- We're not done yet.

416
00:33:20,559 --> 00:33:22,319
The best is to come.

417
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:26,400
The first thing a movie actor
should know is how to dance.

418
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:30,879
When you tell an actor:
""Come in like this, take that light...""

419
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:34,480
That's dance!
""Hurry up, walk slowly, then speed up...""

420
00:33:34,799 --> 00:33:38,440
It's a fundamental thing,
dominance, mastery,

421
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:42,400
the awareness of one's body's
how to move one's limbs.

422
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:45,720
That's the very first thing
a movie actor has to do.

423
00:33:45,799 --> 00:33:49,520
The first film I set to music for Fellini
was ""Ginger and Fred"",

424
00:33:49,599 --> 00:33:54,599
but before that, I had set
some of his commercials to music.

425
00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:57,839
When he proposed them to me, I remember

426
00:33:57,920 --> 00:34:02,760
that very naively and with a good degree
of presumption, I told him:

427
00:34:03,119 --> 00:34:07,319
""Federico I don't like commercials,
I've never done them.""

428
00:34:07,599 --> 00:34:10,920
And he replied: ""Me neither!
I don't like them either.""

429
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:14,920
In this way he defused
all possible objections you might offer.

430
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:18,719
So he said to me:
""Let's consider this a system,

431
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:22,199
to get to know each other,
to see how we work

432
00:34:22,280 --> 00:34:25,559
and what we can do together.""

433
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:11,239
""Ginger and Fred""
has a final part that takes place

434
00:35:11,320 --> 00:35:13,840
inside a TV variety show studio.

435
00:35:19,039 --> 00:35:22,960
At the first work meeting,
I was used to taking notes...

436
00:35:23,199 --> 00:35:26,159
He told me: ""You know,
we could use a type of music

437
00:35:26,360 --> 00:35:31,480
like the ones employed in those
cynical TV shows... a cynical music.

438
00:35:31,639 --> 00:35:33,599
Meanwhile I noted 'cynical'.

439
00:35:33,679 --> 00:35:38,280
""Also quite a repetitive music,
because, you know...

440
00:35:39,639 --> 00:35:41,960
...this kind of music keeps repeating.""

441
00:35:42,039 --> 00:35:44,119
So I wrote 'repetitive'.

442
00:35:45,360 --> 00:35:51,199
""With the pompous banality
typical of those TV shows.""

443
00:35:51,320 --> 00:35:53,960
So I wrote 'banal, pompous.'

444
00:35:54,039 --> 00:35:57,759
When he got up to leave,
I looked at my notes and saw that I had

445
00:35:57,840 --> 00:35:59,880
to write a banal,

446
00:35:59,960 --> 00:36:04,719
cloying, repetitive, conceited, cynical,
unpleasant and annoying music.

447
00:36:05,039 --> 00:36:09,159
He turned back and said:
""But please, make it beautiful.""

448
00:36:16,039 --> 00:36:19,400
The music had to be
the credible music of a TV show,

449
00:36:19,639 --> 00:36:25,440
but inside it, dwelled a virus
that he put in every shot.

450
00:36:25,520 --> 00:36:27,679
Even if it's not musically plausible,

451
00:36:27,800 --> 00:36:30,880
remember to move together, as one,

452
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:34,039
with your trombones,
fully extending your arms.

453
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:41,400
If pre-existing music was used in a film,
he would never use the recorded music,

454
00:36:41,679 --> 00:36:43,719
we recorded it again in the studio,

455
00:36:45,039 --> 00:36:48,280
magnifying a detail
or reducing another one.

456
00:36:48,360 --> 00:36:53,880
Hurray! My little tripe
just arrived from outer space!

457
00:36:55,800 --> 00:36:58,679
Applaud, everyone! Go, Federico, go!

458
00:36:58,759 --> 00:37:01,719
The last three are research films.

459
00:37:01,960 --> 00:37:05,800
This has not been
well understood at the time.

460
00:37:05,880 --> 00:37:10,800
Today, the research value of those movies
it's pretty obvious to everyone.

461
00:37:10,888 --> 00:37:15,968
Kundera mentioned it recently,
giving the final word

462
00:37:16,199 --> 00:37:18,400
on the value of that research.

463
00:37:18,920 --> 00:37:22,840
Smile, adjust the collar of your shirt.

464
00:37:23,119 --> 00:37:24,320
Look at the camera.

465
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:27,880
Those last three films,
which I set to music,

466
00:37:27,960 --> 00:37:33,159
are three films which,
as anyone might imagine,

467
00:37:33,639 --> 00:37:37,079
I'm more than fond of.
I love them so much.

468
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:01,759
""Ginger and Fred"", I could say

469
00:38:01,840 --> 00:38:05,000
was an emblematic movie.

470
00:38:05,079 --> 00:38:09,119
The intuition of the arrival
of television democracy.

471
00:38:09,400 --> 00:38:16,320
He sensed that a disaster was coming,
the disaster of television.

472
00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:17,639
Roll Camera!

473
00:38:17,719 --> 00:38:18,719
Silence!

474
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:33,159
He only had fun when he was working.

475
00:38:33,239 --> 00:38:37,679
Work is what always
entertained him so much.

476
00:38:37,759 --> 00:38:42,080
Work is fun if you like it,
especially creative work like his.

477
00:39:08,039 --> 00:39:13,000
It's a complicated picture,
but it will be a big hit in Viterbo.

478
00:39:13,079 --> 00:39:15,759
Fellini wasn't a 'senior' artist.

479
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:18,920
He wasn't the revered master
repeating himself,

480
00:39:19,199 --> 00:39:21,520
but someone continuing to research.

481
00:39:30,719 --> 00:39:33,759
One of the phrases I most
often heard from him

482
00:39:34,199 --> 00:39:38,240
when I gave a suggestion,
was: ""But I've done that.""

483
00:39:46,840 --> 00:39:50,280
Andrea, try to look in the hole.
Hold it right there!

484
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:52,599
Go! Quick, here!

485
00:39:53,840 --> 00:39:54,920
Stop.

486
00:39:56,480 --> 00:39:58,159
Can we do a test, please?

487
00:39:59,199 --> 00:40:00,199
All right.

488
00:40:00,440 --> 00:40:06,599
I've never seen anything done in a movie
and repeated in another one.

489
00:40:06,840 --> 00:40:08,159
Go!

490
00:40:08,239 --> 00:40:09,239
Turn around!

491
00:40:09,840 --> 00:40:12,039
Every time was something new,

492
00:40:12,119 --> 00:40:18,520
nothing was quite like the things
already done in his past films.

493
00:40:18,840 --> 00:40:20,400
Further, towards me.

494
00:40:20,599 --> 00:40:27,440
There wasn't a movie that used
the same camera movements.

495
00:40:41,559 --> 00:40:44,719
Go, Marcellino. Make them run away!

496
00:40:45,840 --> 00:40:46,840
Get up.

497
00:40:53,159 --> 00:40:54,440
Damn you!

498
00:40:55,320 --> 00:40:56,320
Stop!

499
00:40:56,400 --> 00:40:57,400
It ran away!

500
00:40:57,960 --> 00:41:02,159
It should stay here or disappear,
or come to you, turn around here,

501
00:41:02,239 --> 00:41:05,719
It's a walking dog,
not one that goes to see who's there.

502
00:41:06,039 --> 00:41:12,440
He had a powerful view of the contemporary
world, always focused on ""today"".

503
00:41:39,840 --> 00:41:41,720
He enjoyed getting me involved.

504
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:47,480
Excuse me, where is the toilet?

505
00:41:49,639 --> 00:41:51,119
Give me some wind!

506
00:41:58,759 --> 00:42:02,160
What was important to me
was to capture Fellini's smile.

507
00:42:02,679 --> 00:42:03,679
Ready.

508
00:42:05,239 --> 00:42:09,159
He talked to me like I was
the greatest musician in the world.

509
00:42:09,239 --> 00:42:13,960
That helps. You can't really relax,
because you're working with Fellini,

510
00:42:14,039 --> 00:42:19,759
but it takes away any performance
anxiety, any distressing attitude

511
00:42:20,400 --> 00:42:23,199
and it leads you to take
on a playful attitude.

512
00:42:24,480 --> 00:42:27,520
Go ladies, quickly, hurry!

513
00:43:03,280 --> 00:43:06,759
Part of his work in films

514
00:43:06,840 --> 00:43:10,280
was like the work of the
model railway for children.

515
00:43:10,679 --> 00:43:13,960
It was the construction
of a fairy tale, of magic.

516
00:43:14,360 --> 00:43:15,719
Switch on.

517
00:43:16,119 --> 00:43:19,280
A complete rehearsal.
Do you see her well?

518
00:43:23,039 --> 00:43:24,880
- Ready?
- Yes, Maestro.

519
00:43:24,960 --> 00:43:26,920
Go! Special effects! Train!

520
00:44:27,559 --> 00:44:29,599
He was beyond any argument

521
00:44:29,679 --> 00:44:31,599
about markets,

522
00:44:31,679 --> 00:44:35,759
quotas, Americans,
what people want to know...

523
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:39,800
No, the reality was
to remain on another cloud.

524
00:44:45,759 --> 00:44:48,840
I'm Menuccio, Fellini's key grip.

525
00:44:48,920 --> 00:44:51,920
The key grip is the person

526
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:56,199
who has big responsibilities,
because he has to do the movements

527
00:44:56,280 --> 00:44:59,239
with the dolly, with the crane.

528
00:44:59,400 --> 00:45:02,520
I've been with him
for twenty-five, twenty-six years.

529
00:45:02,599 --> 00:45:07,679
And even though I'm 82 years old,
he wants me with him every time.

530
00:45:07,920 --> 00:45:13,199
I've taken care of him
like one does with a son.

531
00:45:13,280 --> 00:45:19,440
In fact, he used to say that
I was like a mom, not the key grip.

532
00:45:19,600 --> 00:45:24,239
He had a great connection with the crew,
everyone spoke to him as a close friend.

533
00:45:24,840 --> 00:45:28,599
He was, first of all, a great playmate.

534
00:45:30,079 --> 00:45:33,480
I saw him as a brother,
an uncle, a father,

535
00:45:33,559 --> 00:45:38,239
I addressed him with respect,
even if he always put me at ease.

536
00:45:38,320 --> 00:45:40,920
He really had a special ability

537
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:46,039
in building relationships of friendship,
of intimacy, of solidarity

538
00:45:47,400 --> 00:45:49,000
with all his collaborators.

539
00:45:49,320 --> 00:45:54,639
There really was a relationship,
a family relationship.

540
00:45:54,719 --> 00:46:00,199
I need a lot of harmony around me,
to create in the crew, among work mates,

541
00:46:00,280 --> 00:46:03,239
a sense of a journey, of an outing...

542
00:46:03,639 --> 00:46:06,119
of an extraordinary adventure.

543
00:46:06,360 --> 00:46:09,239
We've always had a lot of fun.

544
00:46:10,039 --> 00:46:14,960
We've always done things with gaiety.

545
00:46:15,039 --> 00:46:16,039
That's it.

546
00:46:16,119 --> 00:46:19,679
One, two, three and four.

547
00:46:20,119 --> 00:46:24,079
Then there's him. Five, six and four.

548
00:46:24,159 --> 00:46:27,400
A relationship that has grown
slowly over time,

549
00:46:27,480 --> 00:46:32,639
developing until you reach
a sort of personal intimacy.

550
00:46:33,400 --> 00:46:35,000
A kind of complicity,

551
00:46:35,280 --> 00:46:37,520
that others couldn't understand.

552
00:46:37,719 --> 00:46:42,880
As a man, more than intelligent,
more than sensitive,

553
00:46:42,960 --> 00:46:44,880
a connoisseur of the human soul,

554
00:46:46,639 --> 00:46:52,480
he realized that making
a collaborator feel comfortable,

555
00:46:53,880 --> 00:46:57,920
inspires him to cooperate better.

556
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:02,559
You need to be able
to convey in yourself some projection

557
00:47:02,639 --> 00:47:07,679
of trust, of empathy,
of compliance and of cooperation.

558
00:47:07,759 --> 00:47:11,119
This is part of the charisma
that you can create,

559
00:47:11,199 --> 00:47:15,640
the way you impose yourself,
the way you propose your game.

560
00:47:16,159 --> 00:47:17,880
Ave, Marcello!

561
00:47:17,960 --> 00:47:21,119
Rosina, who comes from Verrucchio,

562
00:47:21,199 --> 00:47:25,199
is the first one to come out of the heap!

563
00:47:25,920 --> 00:47:28,920
Stay still, just move these.

564
00:47:29,880 --> 00:47:31,239
One more time.

565
00:47:31,520 --> 00:47:34,599
Confronted with this scenario,

566
00:47:34,679 --> 00:47:38,920
I tried to imagine different solutions
to animate it in different way.

567
00:47:53,960 --> 00:47:58,840
Acting on the images and the characters
that Fellini was maneuvering,

568
00:47:59,159 --> 00:48:01,800
has been an exceptional opportunity.

569
00:48:07,440 --> 00:48:09,079
See you in a bit.

570
00:48:10,280 --> 00:48:14,320
The freedom Fellini gave me
wasn't granted to anyone else.

571
00:48:14,400 --> 00:48:18,920
He should be here in a moment.
We'll try to stop him. We might get lucky.

572
00:48:19,559 --> 00:48:20,719
There he is!

573
00:48:21,039 --> 00:48:22,119
Marcello! Marcello!

574
00:48:22,719 --> 00:48:25,719
I'd like to briefly interview
you for the ""Special"".

575
00:48:25,800 --> 00:48:27,639
Another time, I'm late. Angela!

576
00:48:27,920 --> 00:48:29,880
A little question.

577
00:48:29,960 --> 00:48:33,119
I had to be ready at 10. It's after 11.
Another time.

578
00:48:33,199 --> 00:48:35,920
All right then, I'll come later.

579
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:37,480
Yes, later.

580
00:48:37,840 --> 00:48:41,079
One of Fellini's habits,
not just with me,

581
00:48:42,119 --> 00:48:46,880
was to make a phone call early
in the morning, around 8:00-8:30.

582
00:48:46,960 --> 00:48:51,119
It was rarely a phone call like:
""We have to edit the music""

583
00:48:51,199 --> 00:48:53,280
or something concerning the work.

584
00:48:53,360 --> 00:48:57,719
It usually was: ""Did you hear
what Craxi said on TV last night?""

585
00:48:57,920 --> 00:49:00,199
Or a comment on a matter of manners.

586
00:49:00,280 --> 00:49:04,120
And he went on for a long time.

587
00:49:06,119 --> 00:49:07,119
Go, Marcello.

588
00:49:07,880 --> 00:49:09,759
It's a lie, your invention!

589
00:49:11,559 --> 00:49:13,280
You want me to change?

590
00:49:15,440 --> 00:49:17,880
Those conversations over the phone

591
00:49:17,960 --> 00:49:20,480
made you appreciate

592
00:49:20,559 --> 00:49:24,920
how much importance he gave to words,
what wealth he possessed

593
00:49:25,159 --> 00:49:29,360
in describing something,
even when he was joking.

594
00:49:29,559 --> 00:49:30,559
Flowers!

595
00:49:30,639 --> 00:49:32,000
Second group!

596
00:49:32,079 --> 00:49:33,440
Third group!

597
00:49:35,920 --> 00:49:38,480
I once told him:

598
00:49:38,559 --> 00:49:45,079
""I come to work with a genius and
then I find in the edit room,

599
00:49:45,159 --> 00:49:48,920
a very childlike
and beautiful atmosphere.""

600
00:49:49,360 --> 00:49:50,360
He said:

601
00:49:50,440 --> 00:49:55,920
""Don't offend me! Childlike?
Collegiate, if you must!""

602
00:49:56,400 --> 00:50:00,679
That's the precision of his use
of adjectives. He was right!

603
00:50:01,800 --> 00:50:05,520
It wasn't a childish environment,
but that of a high school,

604
00:50:05,599 --> 00:50:09,360
with students doing their homework
and then playing jokes.

605
00:50:09,639 --> 00:50:12,160
Now, everyone picks their own flower!

606
00:50:20,079 --> 00:50:23,759
Girls, one hour break.
Back here in an hour!

607
00:50:23,920 --> 00:50:25,720
Easy!

608
00:50:30,840 --> 00:50:33,360
Federico, until the last moment,

609
00:50:34,360 --> 00:50:37,639
he didn't prepare for it,
he didn't shout: ""Be quiet!"",

610
00:50:37,719 --> 00:50:39,280
because he needed

611
00:50:39,679 --> 00:50:40,800
to think.

612
00:50:41,119 --> 00:50:44,119
He managed to think

613
00:50:44,199 --> 00:50:45,679
by escaping from the set,

614
00:50:45,759 --> 00:50:49,679
whilst everyone was in conversation
until the last moment.

615
00:50:49,880 --> 00:50:54,119
Only for me, who didn't know
at which point he was going to start,

616
00:50:54,199 --> 00:50:56,239
I was a little apprehensive.

617
00:50:56,320 --> 00:51:00,199
Giving an exact number to each scene
was essential for the editing,

618
00:51:00,320 --> 00:51:02,679
I couldn't afford to be wrong.

619
00:51:03,039 --> 00:51:05,079
Explosion! Scream!

620
00:51:06,159 --> 00:51:07,440
Applause!

621
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:13,880
Then you start slightly rocking.
All of you.

622
00:51:14,280 --> 00:51:15,440
All of you.

623
00:51:16,320 --> 00:51:20,520
But only slightly. It's too
exaggerated, slightly, just barely.

624
00:51:22,400 --> 00:51:24,400
Open up again.

625
00:51:25,320 --> 00:51:26,320
Bravo!

626
00:51:26,719 --> 00:51:29,119
Fellini was a world.

627
00:51:30,480 --> 00:51:34,719
Focus is everything.
Look at the base of the nose. That's it.

628
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:38,599
It was as if you had opened a window

629
00:51:38,960 --> 00:51:44,520
and outside that window, you saw
a panorama that you didn't know was there.

630
00:51:56,360 --> 00:52:01,840
He needed collaborators
to build, to undo, to do everything,

631
00:52:01,920 --> 00:52:05,320
someone really close, capable

632
00:52:05,400 --> 00:52:08,880
of understanding what he had in mind.

633
00:52:08,960 --> 00:52:12,719
A collaborator who not only
did things, which was easy,

634
00:52:12,800 --> 00:52:17,880
but also ready to slow down
when he saw him thinking.

635
00:52:20,039 --> 00:52:23,840
Sometimes he wasn't so sure
about what he wanted.

636
00:52:23,920 --> 00:52:26,759
We often found ways
of delaying the work process,

637
00:52:26,840 --> 00:52:32,520
as so to give him a chance to
reflect for five minutes more.

638
00:52:32,719 --> 00:52:35,840
Again and again the production
managers said to me:

639
00:52:35,920 --> 00:52:39,679
""Tell Federico that we've
already gone over schedule,

640
00:52:39,800 --> 00:52:42,920
we don't have much time.
We should finish by tomorrow.""

641
00:52:43,280 --> 00:52:45,759
I replied that they couldn't prevent

642
00:52:45,840 --> 00:52:49,280
an artist like Federico Fellini
from having ideas,

643
00:52:49,360 --> 00:52:51,320
from making changes or enriching.

644
00:52:51,400 --> 00:52:54,639
Sometimes it wasn't clear
how a sequence would turn out,

645
00:52:54,719 --> 00:52:58,239
but when finished and edited,

646
00:52:58,599 --> 00:53:02,880
you saw the miracle of what he had done.

647
00:53:05,280 --> 00:53:08,199
You go in first, start the burner.

648
00:53:15,440 --> 00:53:17,360
Go with the water on top!

649
00:53:17,840 --> 00:53:19,400
Raise the flame!

650
00:53:20,639 --> 00:53:21,639
Roll camera!

651
00:53:23,199 --> 00:53:24,599
Lower the pumps!

652
00:53:24,679 --> 00:53:26,520
Go with the flame!

653
00:53:28,559 --> 00:53:31,119
Stop! This one, Norma, the last three.

654
00:53:31,599 --> 00:53:36,079
When you worked with Federico,
there was an efficient machine in place

655
00:53:36,800 --> 00:53:38,320
and an expensive one too.

656
00:53:38,400 --> 00:53:42,679
But the results were extraordinary.
He won five Academy Awards.

657
00:53:42,759 --> 00:53:46,440
Recognised by the whole world
as one of the greatest artists

658
00:53:46,520 --> 00:53:47,880
who ever lived.

659
00:53:48,800 --> 00:53:51,320
He achieved all of this
while he was alive,

660
00:53:51,400 --> 00:53:55,239
contrary to many people who only
get recognition after death.

661
00:53:55,320 --> 00:53:58,759
Instead, he's had everything
when he was alive.

662
00:54:08,119 --> 00:54:12,759
He had so many qualities,
he was a very affable man,

663
00:54:12,840 --> 00:54:16,520
a very good man,
and very naughty as well!

664
00:54:16,599 --> 00:54:17,880
Don't look at her!

665
00:54:19,199 --> 00:54:20,920
We'll be here until tomorrow.

666
00:54:21,920 --> 00:54:23,639
Shut up everybody!

667
00:54:24,239 --> 00:54:26,199
Smile, Alberto!

668
00:54:27,440 --> 00:54:32,759
Among the artists, the director is
the most exposed to continuous conflict.

669
00:54:32,840 --> 00:54:38,719
It is a profession that also requires
identifying with a command figure.

670
00:54:39,079 --> 00:54:41,199
Sit down.

671
00:54:42,039 --> 00:54:43,039
Still.

672
00:54:43,119 --> 00:54:46,119
Look at this!
You mustn't laugh. Stay still!!

673
00:54:47,039 --> 00:54:49,039
Then start rocking.

674
00:54:49,119 --> 00:54:53,400
To see that hundred, two hundred,
three hundred, a thousand people

675
00:54:53,480 --> 00:54:55,800
are there to do exactly what you want,

676
00:54:56,320 --> 00:55:00,759
it can create a certain
inflation of your authority.

677
00:55:00,840 --> 00:55:03,400
It is clearly not easy

678
00:55:03,480 --> 00:55:07,119
to force people
to become pure expressive material.

679
00:55:07,199 --> 00:55:10,199
He would sometimes pretend to be gruff.

680
00:55:10,280 --> 00:55:11,880
""Stop! Quiet!""

681
00:55:11,960 --> 00:55:15,920
Then he would turn and
smile to the camera operator.

682
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:19,599
Will you piss off?
Get out the bloody way!

683
00:55:19,679 --> 00:55:22,679
Castronuovo, will you get out
the bloody way?

684
00:55:24,599 --> 00:55:28,920
He first created a big mess, then,
suddenly, he would start screaming:

685
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:32,400
""Silence! I can't take it anymore!""
but then he laughed.

686
00:55:32,480 --> 00:55:38,520
I don't see myself as the kind of director
who screams and acts like a dictator.

687
00:55:38,599 --> 00:55:42,599
There are electricians, grips,
collaborators, actors and extras,

688
00:55:42,880 --> 00:55:47,960
who must fit into
the most rigorous scheme possible.

689
00:55:48,039 --> 00:55:51,480
He'd turn red in the face,
he'd get excited, angry.

690
00:55:51,719 --> 00:55:57,199
Sometimes I resorted
to a little stratagem and would say:

691
00:55:57,280 --> 00:56:00,199
""Stop it, you're going
to have a heart attack!""

692
00:56:00,280 --> 00:56:04,880
That was the only way
to have him calm down.

693
00:56:05,039 --> 00:56:06,520
Raise your eyebrows.

694
00:56:08,079 --> 00:56:09,440
And smile.

695
00:56:15,840 --> 00:56:19,440
One, two, three and four.

696
00:56:22,880 --> 00:56:24,400
Armando, smile!

697
00:56:25,079 --> 00:56:26,079
Come on!

698
00:56:26,159 --> 00:56:28,880
Smile, Armando or I'll clobber you.

699
00:56:29,039 --> 00:56:30,800
Back!

700
00:56:31,039 --> 00:56:33,320
Two, three and four.

701
00:56:33,400 --> 00:56:36,719
One, two, three and four.

702
00:56:39,400 --> 00:56:41,119
Listen, Armando, excuse me...

703
00:56:41,520 --> 00:56:44,480
When I say ""smile"", you have
to smile all the time.

704
00:56:44,559 --> 00:56:47,040
I don't want to repeat it
four hundred times!

705
00:56:47,639 --> 00:56:51,000
When Christopher Columbus
solicited his crew

706
00:56:51,079 --> 00:56:53,679
not to swim back

707
00:56:53,880 --> 00:56:55,880
in the middle of the ocean,

708
00:56:56,719 --> 00:57:00,840
he probably had a dream in his mind

709
00:57:00,920 --> 00:57:03,840
for discovering a new continent.

710
00:57:03,920 --> 00:57:08,559
As modest as your fantasy may be,
if you want to materialize it,

711
00:57:08,639 --> 00:57:14,079
overcoming the conflicts and the obstacles
derived from the community around you,

712
00:57:14,520 --> 00:57:17,320
you must possess
the same fanaticism and...

713
00:57:18,159 --> 00:57:21,360
...faith that Columbus had,

714
00:57:21,599 --> 00:57:25,480
in the belief there
wouldn't just be water

715
00:57:25,559 --> 00:57:29,480
and that eventually
a strip of land would appear.

716
00:57:49,480 --> 00:57:54,599
I always remember the night, of the first
screening, when we watched the first edit.

717
00:57:54,679 --> 00:57:57,000
Do you remember?

718
00:57:57,559 --> 00:58:01,039
And it was the first time
I saw the movie in its entirety.

719
00:58:01,599 --> 00:58:05,440
I didn't really know what I'd done,
but I was very comforted

720
00:58:06,239 --> 00:58:08,079
by your reaction.

721
00:58:08,159 --> 00:58:11,039
The light went on,
you kept quiet for a long time,

722
00:58:11,119 --> 00:58:13,559
then you put your head in your hands,

723
00:58:13,639 --> 00:58:16,440
and I understood you were very moved.

724
00:58:16,520 --> 00:58:20,039
It really struck you who had lived
every moment of it.

725
00:58:23,920 --> 00:58:27,480
He nicely called the circus
""a magic circle"".

726
00:58:28,039 --> 00:58:32,119
And at the centre of this circle
anything could happen.

727
00:58:32,199 --> 00:58:34,480
If you think about it, it's true:

728
00:58:35,360 --> 00:58:40,639
The elephant's stool is round, the tiger's
cage is round, the awning is round.

729
00:58:40,920 --> 00:58:44,240
It's a circle. A magic circle
where anything can happen.

730
00:58:58,920 --> 00:59:02,559
He had a very strong rapport with magic.

731
00:59:02,800 --> 00:59:04,000
Astrology...

732
00:59:07,079 --> 00:59:10,360
...clairvoyance, predictions,
extrasensory perceptions.

733
00:59:10,679 --> 00:59:14,039
Wizards or visionaries

734
00:59:14,119 --> 00:59:17,880
passing through his set.

735
00:59:18,039 --> 00:59:22,520
I'm not an actress, let's say
I'm clairvoyant, a psychic.

736
00:59:23,759 --> 00:59:26,239
I'm here to talk
about ""The Ship Sails On"".

737
00:59:26,440 --> 00:59:29,960
The explanations that
he gave me were fascinating.

738
00:59:30,400 --> 00:59:33,280
He said: ""Nothing is known,
nothing is imagined"".

739
00:59:34,039 --> 00:59:36,400
With his power, with his charisma,

740
00:59:36,480 --> 00:59:40,199
with his enormous power of suggestion

741
00:59:40,679 --> 00:59:43,679
which he also tried
to express in his movies,

742
00:59:44,840 --> 00:59:48,119
he managed to influence
all collaborators around him.

743
00:59:48,199 --> 00:59:52,000
""What did you dream last night?""
At first I'd reply: ""Nothing.""

744
00:59:52,280 --> 00:59:54,719
""What did you dream?""
""Nothing.""

745
00:59:54,800 --> 00:59:59,159
The third time he asked me, I thought
I better start inventing some dreams.

746
00:59:59,840 --> 01:00:06,320
So, I began telling him that I dreamt
about something I thought he'd like.

747
01:00:06,599 --> 01:00:08,679
Other people's dreams are important

748
01:00:08,759 --> 01:00:15,360
if they match what you want to hear.

749
01:00:15,920 --> 01:00:19,119
During a break between
""Casanova"" and ""City of Women"",

750
01:00:20,239 --> 01:00:24,960
suddenly, Paese Sera newspaper
published a short note, just three lines:

751
01:00:25,400 --> 01:00:29,119
""Fellini is preparing a new movie
in Cinecittà 'City of Women'"".

752
01:00:29,599 --> 01:00:32,440
I had a very agitated night,
crowded with dreams,

753
01:00:32,520 --> 01:00:36,360
in which I saw some very precise images.

754
01:00:37,199 --> 01:00:41,119
A kind of big slide made of iron pipes.

755
01:00:41,759 --> 01:00:45,719
Something magical,
mysterious, unclassifiable.

756
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:52,840
Smile. Look over here, Farracino!

757
01:00:54,880 --> 01:00:57,800
Say ""Hello!"" Go, Marcello!

758
01:00:58,159 --> 01:01:00,239
Hat on!

759
01:01:02,039 --> 01:01:03,210
Stop, stop!

760
01:01:06,239 --> 01:01:09,159
Rosina, who comes from Verrucchio,

761
01:01:09,239 --> 01:01:12,199
is the first to come out of the heap!

762
01:01:12,280 --> 01:01:14,360
Farracino smile, hat, smile!

763
01:01:14,759 --> 01:01:15,759
Close it.

764
01:01:20,480 --> 01:01:21,719
In the evening,

765
01:01:21,800 --> 01:01:26,119
when we finished work together
the editing or the mixing,

766
01:01:26,239 --> 01:01:28,599
he asked if I could give him a lift home.

767
01:01:29,079 --> 01:01:32,079
It was a pleasure
to take him to Piazza del Popolo.

768
01:01:35,599 --> 01:01:37,960
Under the arches of the Felice Aqueduct,

769
01:01:38,039 --> 01:01:41,079
he said:
""Turn right! Right in there!""

770
01:01:45,079 --> 01:01:48,039
He started giving me
increasingly vague directions,

771
01:01:48,520 --> 01:01:51,360
until we found ourselves lost in a place

772
01:01:51,440 --> 01:01:57,320
dotted with caravans,
aerials, abandoned refrigerators.

773
01:01:57,400 --> 01:01:58,840
There was a full moon,

774
01:02:00,320 --> 01:02:01,920
and I got a little scared.

775
01:02:09,119 --> 01:02:14,320
He started describing that place
with adjectives that I don't remember.

776
01:02:16,159 --> 01:02:19,480
""Look at this moon.
It could be intimidating,

777
01:02:19,559 --> 01:02:22,079
but instead it has a pastel smile.""

778
01:02:22,159 --> 01:02:27,440
""Look at these aerials,
at these tires scattered around"".

779
01:02:27,520 --> 01:02:31,639
""Look at this incredible landscape.
And what a silence!""

780
01:02:31,719 --> 01:02:34,880
He described the flow
of traffic in the distance,

781
01:02:34,960 --> 01:02:38,320
the call of animals, of crows.

782
01:02:43,159 --> 01:02:46,079
He was enchanted and so was I,

783
01:02:46,159 --> 01:02:50,159
thanks to his special ability
to influence others.

784
01:02:50,480 --> 01:02:52,880
However, as enchanted as I was,

785
01:02:53,039 --> 01:02:55,559
""Federico, it's time
to find our way back.""

786
01:02:55,960 --> 01:02:59,759
We got back in the car we drove
at random for a little while

787
01:03:00,759 --> 01:03:05,960
until we came out exactly
where we had taken the shortcut.

788
01:03:07,119 --> 01:03:11,719
The next day he says:
""Will you take me home?"",""Sure.""

789
01:03:11,800 --> 01:03:17,960
""This time I have the exact directions
of the shortcut and we'll take it.""

790
01:03:18,960 --> 01:03:22,280
I said: ""Federico,
what if we get lost again?""

791
01:03:22,880 --> 01:03:25,639
And he: ""Let's hope so.""

792
01:03:38,759 --> 01:03:39,759
Let's try again.

793
01:03:42,639 --> 01:03:44,559
- Marcello, again?
- Here we are.

794
01:03:44,639 --> 01:03:46,639
Let us drink in peace.

795
01:03:47,039 --> 01:03:51,679
- What I can tell you, Ferruccio?
- It's just for the ""Special"",

796
01:03:51,759 --> 01:03:54,759
tell us something
about the movie, your character...

797
01:03:56,440 --> 01:04:00,880
I can't. It's a military secret.
We'll talk about it another time.

798
01:04:00,960 --> 01:04:04,320
All right, when you find a moment...

799
01:04:05,239 --> 01:04:06,840
Let's see. Next year!

800
01:04:07,079 --> 01:04:09,599
Next year, in 1988.

801
01:04:14,840 --> 01:04:15,960
That's it.

802
01:04:16,039 --> 01:04:19,119
Try to drag him by the hand.

803
01:04:21,000 --> 01:04:22,719
Give me a crafty smile.

804
01:04:26,000 --> 01:04:29,000
Look in front of you and smile.

805
01:04:30,360 --> 01:04:31,400
Smile.

806
01:04:31,679 --> 01:04:34,039
His relationship with women

807
01:04:34,759 --> 01:04:39,159
was primarily one of great
curiosity, because I can't say

808
01:04:39,239 --> 01:04:42,520
that he was just attracted
to beautiful women.

809
01:04:42,599 --> 01:04:46,480
Fellini wanted me,
in some regards, physically.

810
01:04:46,759 --> 01:04:47,759
So...

811
01:04:48,280 --> 01:04:52,920
For example, he started by getting
my eyebrows completely shaved off.

812
01:04:53,440 --> 01:04:56,239
I felt like my face...

813
01:04:57,480 --> 01:05:00,119
was absolutely flat.

814
01:05:00,199 --> 01:05:02,920
And then, he added moles.

815
01:05:03,000 --> 01:05:06,520
A mole here, can you see it?
And one a little further down.

816
01:05:06,800 --> 01:05:09,679
I feel like I've known him my whole life.

817
01:05:09,759 --> 01:05:13,800
There's something
very familiar, very wonderful.

818
01:05:13,880 --> 01:05:16,880
A very intelligent, very kind man.

819
01:05:17,199 --> 01:05:20,840
And, how do you say? He sees big.

820
01:05:21,000 --> 01:05:23,520
Would you do a small part for him?

821
01:05:23,599 --> 01:05:25,679
I would do anything with Federico.

822
01:05:25,759 --> 01:05:30,199
He was such an extraordinary man,
capable of turning

823
01:05:30,360 --> 01:05:33,679
into a gentle knight
even if a woman wasn't that beautiful.

824
01:05:33,759 --> 01:05:37,480
He complimented her
until she felt like a star.

825
01:05:37,559 --> 01:05:42,960
I was amazed, but also looked
at Federico with much fondness,

826
01:05:43,039 --> 01:05:48,039
because he was such a Casanova.
I wish men were all like him!

827
01:05:48,119 --> 01:05:50,679
- How are you?
- Very well, thank you.

828
01:05:51,320 --> 01:05:54,599
- From Switzerland to meet you.
- Please, be my guest.

829
01:05:57,320 --> 01:06:00,520
Women have always been exalted by Fellini,

830
01:06:00,800 --> 01:06:03,759
even when he criticized them,
or made fun of them.

831
01:06:03,840 --> 01:06:09,000
But obviously, women are essential
for Fellini and for all of us.

832
01:06:09,199 --> 01:06:11,079
Federico, what do I say now?

833
01:06:12,079 --> 01:06:15,079
- What do I say?
- I don't know.

834
01:06:15,239 --> 01:06:20,759
It has always been said that
Mastroianni was Fellini's alter ego.

835
01:06:20,840 --> 01:06:22,079
What's the question?

836
01:06:22,159 --> 01:06:25,679
Has anything changed between
""8 & 1/2"" and ""City of Women""?

837
01:06:25,759 --> 01:06:27,639
Talk about the last time you...

838
01:06:28,400 --> 01:06:32,759
- What has changed since ""8 & 1/2""?
- I don't know, Marcello.

839
01:06:32,840 --> 01:06:35,480
They were two companions...

840
01:06:36,800 --> 01:06:39,039
...we can say of the same age.

841
01:06:39,119 --> 01:06:44,800
Mastroianni was a few years younger.

842
01:06:50,079 --> 01:06:51,520
They've become tangled.
Go, Marcellino.

843
01:06:55,280 --> 01:06:57,480
Laugh, talk. That's it.

844
01:06:57,559 --> 01:06:58,960
Thank you, good night.

845
01:06:59,039 --> 01:07:02,679
Come here for a moment, listen.

846
01:07:02,920 --> 01:07:05,000
Girls! Good night.

847
01:07:08,280 --> 01:07:10,880
He's always loved women.

848
01:07:11,599 --> 01:07:14,400
Therefore, also in this film,

849
01:07:14,480 --> 01:07:16,559
which was called ""City of Women"",

850
01:07:17,759 --> 01:07:22,280
it's easy to see the love he felt

851
01:07:23,480 --> 01:07:24,759
for us girls.

852
01:07:25,079 --> 01:07:27,000
Sisters, it was all for nothing.

853
01:07:27,079 --> 01:07:29,480
The eyes of that man, of that male,

854
01:07:29,559 --> 01:07:34,239
who wanders among us with his face
fake-respectful, intelligent,

855
01:07:34,840 --> 01:07:38,440
with the false intent
to get to know each one better.

856
01:07:38,520 --> 01:07:43,119
Because he says that knowing us better,
he can change his relationship with us.

857
01:07:43,599 --> 01:07:47,440
And of all the lies he told,
of all the justifications,

858
01:07:47,520 --> 01:07:51,360
of all lies,
this is the most despicable one!

859
01:07:51,960 --> 01:07:54,520
This text was written by Liliana Betti

860
01:07:54,759 --> 01:07:58,480
to emphasize all the negative attitudes

861
01:07:58,719 --> 01:08:01,960
of Fellini's character towards women.

862
01:08:02,239 --> 01:08:06,960
Then the text was read
by one of the feminists.

863
01:08:07,199 --> 01:08:10,639
The eyes of that man are the
eyes of the male of all time,

864
01:08:10,920 --> 01:08:17,000
that deform everything he sees
in the mirror of slur and mockery.

865
01:08:19,000 --> 01:08:22,320
The rascal is always the same,
he hasn't changed.

866
01:08:22,639 --> 01:08:26,559
If you pretend to care about us,
it is to better control us,

867
01:08:26,639 --> 01:08:30,799
to keep us forever in the
darkness of your harem.

868
01:08:32,040 --> 01:08:35,759
For this intellectual buffoon,
of the worst kind,

869
01:08:36,400 --> 01:08:39,799
who hypocritically proclaims
he wants to support us,

870
01:08:40,200 --> 01:08:42,679
to understand and defend us better.

871
01:08:42,759 --> 01:08:48,799
We are only his pretexts to form
for the umpteenth time his circus...

872
01:08:48,879 --> 01:08:50,200
You lower your head.

873
01:08:50,280 --> 01:08:52,480
...his bestiary. You lower your head.

874
01:08:52,759 --> 01:08:54,160
...his zoo!

875
01:08:56,599 --> 01:08:59,400
And we're there to be clowns, bayaderes.

876
01:09:00,360 --> 01:09:02,360
He wants to make us laugh

877
01:09:02,639 --> 01:09:05,400
about things we couldn't even cry about.

878
01:09:06,559 --> 01:09:07,999
Stop, all right.

879
01:09:08,080 --> 01:09:11,200
The relationship with Giulietta...
She was the Wife.

880
01:09:11,280 --> 01:09:13,919
The wife he respected.

881
01:09:15,120 --> 01:09:17,799
How nice!

882
01:09:18,200 --> 01:09:19,480
Thank you.

883
01:09:19,959 --> 01:09:22,240
Best wishes from the crew.

884
01:09:26,240 --> 01:09:31,679
However, all married people
try to carve out their freedom.

885
01:09:31,759 --> 01:09:35,919
He kept her in high regard,
showed her great respect,

886
01:09:36,559 --> 01:09:38,520
but also apprehension,

887
01:09:38,599 --> 01:09:42,320
because beside being his wife,
she was also his daughter.

888
01:09:42,639 --> 01:09:44,679
They had a baby,

889
01:09:44,759 --> 01:09:50,200
but for a short time,
she lived barely a month.

890
01:09:50,280 --> 01:09:56,400
So, with Giulietta,
he took on a fatherly attitude

891
01:09:56,639 --> 01:09:58,559
becoming protective.

892
01:09:59,240 --> 01:10:01,919
If there was something
which might upset her

893
01:10:01,999 --> 01:10:05,879
he did everything to reassure
her and comfort her.

894
01:10:08,080 --> 01:10:09,919
All right, thank you.

895
01:10:09,999 --> 01:10:13,639
It's our silver wedding anniversary,
see you at the golden one!

896
01:10:14,599 --> 01:10:16,360
Nice wishes!

897
01:10:16,679 --> 01:10:23,080
Recently, I've seen ""Amarcord""
at the House of Cinema in Rome.

898
01:10:23,160 --> 01:10:26,879
That little theatre was
full of people of all ages.

899
01:10:26,959 --> 01:10:31,639
Everyone was moved, I heard them
laughing even more than when it came out,

900
01:10:31,719 --> 01:10:35,280
which means that this film
has became even more enjoyable

901
01:10:35,400 --> 01:10:39,879
compared to when it was first released.

902
01:10:40,080 --> 01:10:44,040
Fellini's films are timeless,

903
01:10:44,559 --> 01:10:46,959
and will always remain timeless.

904
01:10:47,679 --> 01:10:50,879
They've entered
the empyrean realm of great cinema.

905
01:10:50,999 --> 01:10:53,719
They're universal, eternal films.

906
01:10:53,799 --> 01:10:56,759
They can even be defined as philosophical.

907
01:10:56,839 --> 01:10:58,999
But above all, it is the love

908
01:10:59,080 --> 01:11:03,080
for a way
of representing life, the others.

909
01:11:03,160 --> 01:11:06,120
There are some artists

910
01:11:06,200 --> 01:11:11,599
in human history, that go
beyond mere comparison.

911
01:11:11,679 --> 01:11:17,440
They dwell in such a high dimension,
which keeps them outside the debate

912
01:11:17,719 --> 01:11:23,320
of whether they're popular, learned,
intellectual, immediate, appreciated.

913
01:11:23,400 --> 01:11:28,320
They live on another planet,
they go outside, over and beyond.

914
01:11:29,280 --> 01:11:30,320
Like Beethoven.

915
01:11:32,919 --> 01:11:34,879
Then she starts vocalizing.

916
01:11:36,320 --> 01:11:40,839
Last time I saw him before I left

917
01:11:40,919 --> 01:11:43,200
for America to make a movie.

918
01:11:43,280 --> 01:11:46,200
Go, David. David, go to Mr. Dong!

919
01:11:46,280 --> 01:11:50,799
He wasn't well. He felt a little sick.

920
01:11:51,200 --> 01:11:53,400
He was still thinking about projects.

921
01:11:54,320 --> 01:11:59,480
We were out of touch, I'd seen him
a couple of times in Cinecittà.

922
01:11:59,559 --> 01:12:02,759
And at some point I learned
he hadn't been well.

923
01:12:02,839 --> 01:12:07,400
My shyness blocked me, even
though I wanted to go and see him,

924
01:12:07,480 --> 01:12:09,240
to comfort him.

925
01:12:09,599 --> 01:12:10,599
Ready?

926
01:12:14,080 --> 01:12:15,280
Silence.

927
01:12:15,759 --> 01:12:18,120
But I was shy.

928
01:12:18,200 --> 01:12:22,879
I was afraid of such a giant,
such a personality

929
01:12:22,959 --> 01:12:29,080
so full of culture, of images,
of music, of everything.

930
01:12:34,280 --> 01:12:39,799
The last time I saw Federico
he was in hospital.

931
01:12:39,879 --> 01:12:42,759
We chatted and joked.

932
01:12:43,040 --> 01:12:49,320
Even then, he still made flattering
comments, like a great latin lover.

933
01:12:49,799 --> 01:12:51,559
He mentioned Valeria Marini.

934
01:12:51,759 --> 01:12:55,559
He had drawn the beautiful
backside of actress Valeria Marini.

935
01:12:55,879 --> 01:13:01,360
And on that drawing he had written:
""I'd like to live here.""

936
01:13:04,799 --> 01:13:08,799
The last time I saw him
was in a bar where we met

937
01:13:09,040 --> 01:13:11,280
to talk about a film
he had to make in Italy.

938
01:13:11,360 --> 01:13:15,759
Soon after, I got called
to the States for another movie.

939
01:13:15,839 --> 01:13:18,679
And a little later, Federico got sick.

940
01:13:18,879 --> 01:13:24,440
I had a phone call with Giulietta.
She was crying.

941
01:13:24,520 --> 01:13:28,280
I told her I was sorry
to be away in the United States.

942
01:13:28,360 --> 01:13:33,599
She said: ""Don't worry,
he knows how close you are to him.""

943
01:13:37,400 --> 01:13:39,200
I last saw him when...

944
01:13:41,080 --> 01:13:43,160
he wasn't very well...

945
01:13:45,280 --> 01:13:48,639
He was in a clinic in Rome.

946
01:13:49,919 --> 01:13:54,520
I never saw him again...
We talked on the phone.

947
01:13:55,240 --> 01:13:57,679
His voice was no longer his own.

948
01:14:00,480 --> 01:14:03,839
But even so, it is that phone call...

949
01:14:05,240 --> 01:14:06,719
that stays with me.

950
01:14:09,719 --> 01:14:12,839
Eventually, his death was announced.

951
01:14:12,919 --> 01:14:16,320
I was in Lombardy, I was in Milan.

952
01:14:16,919 --> 01:14:20,080
I came to Rome for the funeral.

953
01:14:33,160 --> 01:14:37,280
I remember seeing
on television, in America,

954
01:14:37,440 --> 01:14:40,400
Fellini's funeral inside Stage 5.

955
01:14:40,999 --> 01:14:45,919
I had the opportunity and
the courage to film the funeral.

956
01:15:09,120 --> 01:15:11,160
And that scene of Stage 5...

957
01:15:11,959 --> 01:15:14,919
that sort of official celebration...

958
01:15:14,999 --> 01:15:19,200
I thought Fellini
wouldn't have liked that funeral.

959
01:15:19,839 --> 01:15:23,999
At night, I dreamt of Fellini's funeral
in a complete different way.

960
01:15:24,879 --> 01:15:26,999
I think it came from him.

961
01:15:43,559 --> 01:15:48,360
People like Federico Fellini
won't come again.

962
01:15:48,440 --> 01:15:51,200
There won't be another Fellini.

963
01:15:51,520 --> 01:15:55,959
Surely, his heir
will not be a 'Fellinian'.

964
01:15:56,040 --> 01:16:01,959
He won't be someone that tries to remake
nuns, dwarfs, Rome and the circus,

965
01:16:02,040 --> 01:16:03,959
because Fellini used to say,

966
01:16:04,040 --> 01:16:06,600
after a suggestion:
""I've already done it.""

967
01:16:10,520 --> 01:16:13,440
I never stopped talking to him.

968
01:16:14,080 --> 01:16:18,120
Some people will always
remain imprinted on your mind.

969
01:16:18,200 --> 01:16:23,240
Among them, there is Fellini and a whole
group of directors I've worked with.

970
01:16:23,320 --> 01:16:24,959
It's like with beehives,

971
01:16:25,080 --> 01:16:28,360
some have more honey and some have less.

972
01:16:32,160 --> 01:16:35,520
He's the one who's left me
with so much in life.

973
01:16:37,599 --> 01:16:41,080
And first of all, he taught me so much.

974
01:16:43,719 --> 01:16:46,919
A big loss...

975
01:16:47,599 --> 01:16:51,280
To me, Fellini is not just a memory.

976
01:16:51,839 --> 01:16:55,040
He's something completely alive...

977
01:16:55,120 --> 01:17:00,480
because I keep telling
everything I can about him.

978
01:17:00,719 --> 01:17:05,400
People we loved are always in our hearts.

979
01:17:05,759 --> 01:17:11,200
When a genius dies,
it's as if a light goes out.

980
01:17:11,280 --> 01:17:14,400
And we have one light less.

981
01:17:20,759 --> 01:17:23,480
""City of Women"", final scene 1/1.

982
01:17:29,160 --> 01:17:33,360
When they ask me
in which city I'd like to live

983
01:17:33,839 --> 01:17:37,679
""London? Paris? Rome?""

984
01:17:38,160 --> 01:17:41,520
I say: ""In the end,
if I have to be honest...

985
01:17:42,759 --> 01:17:44,120
...Cinecittà"".

ORIGINAL SCREENPLAY
BY YONNICK FLOT AND SERGE LEROY

2
00:02:38,791 --> 00:02:40,666
Not the stuff on Lyon. Cut that.

3
00:02:43,250 --> 00:02:44,833
Call me the print shop.

4
00:02:46,583 --> 00:02:48,416
Good morning, Mr. Villechaise.

5
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:50,458
What are you waiting for, come in.

6
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,750
What do you have to present to me
for my paper that is not stupid?

7
00:02:56,750 --> 00:02:59,125
- Politics, politics�
- Yes, but it's solid.

8
00:02:59,208 --> 00:03:00,208
Yes, but political.

9
00:03:00,291 --> 00:03:04,041
Attention, for the document on Jordan,
you copy it on tape recorder 2.

10
00:03:04,125 --> 00:03:06,458
Okay, on 2. Here we go.

11
00:03:09,125 --> 00:03:11,625
And the US President's proposal

12
00:03:11,708 --> 00:03:15,750
has been well received
in European capitals,

13
00:03:15,833 --> 00:03:17,708
but in Moscow,

14
00:03:18,291 --> 00:03:20,458
we doubt that he�

15
00:03:22,750 --> 00:03:25,833
""Doubt�"" No, that's not right at all.
No. Cut that.

16
00:03:25,916 --> 00:03:27,000
Remove ""that""�

17
00:03:27,083 --> 00:03:30,125
We doubt the sincerity of his intentions

18
00:03:30,208 --> 00:03:33,625
from our correspondent in Moscow,
Paul Ballard�

19
00:03:35,083 --> 00:03:38,291
There is a hostage situation
at a lawyer's house, should I send Renaud?

20
00:03:39,250 --> 00:03:41,375
No� No.

21
00:03:41,458 --> 00:03:43,791
Not Renaud, send Bertrand and
ask for a direct for the 20 hours.

22
00:03:43,875 --> 00:03:45,125
Okay.

23
00:03:46,333 --> 00:03:48,125
What am I holding today, then�

24
00:03:49,916 --> 00:03:51,791
Could you get me a glass of water?

25
00:03:53,125 --> 00:03:55,250
It's a good time to take hostages,
we had nothing�

26
00:03:55,791 --> 00:03:57,291
Now we have something.

27
00:03:58,083 --> 00:04:00,375
Jean� get me the mic interview.

28
00:04:01,875 --> 00:04:05,250
Okay� Now the mic, Catherine.

29
00:04:06,708 --> 00:04:09,791
Now the weather.

30
00:04:09,875 --> 00:04:12,041
- Good evening.
- Great, everything is fine.

31
00:04:13,333 --> 00:04:16,291
- January six, can you hear me?
- Copy that.

32
00:04:16,375 --> 00:04:19,125
Send two cars, four men,

33
00:04:19,208 --> 00:04:22,375
one at the Monceau-Messine intersection
near Avenue Foch,

34
00:04:22,458 --> 00:04:25,416
the other at Messine-Haussmann
near St Lazare.

35
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:27,000
Roger, I'm transmitting.

36
00:04:33,166 --> 00:04:34,875
- Good evening.
- Good evening, Catherine.

37
00:04:34,958 --> 00:04:36,916
To get three horses, take Tierc� Magazine.

38
00:04:39,875 --> 00:04:42,458
Don't forget the subject about Guinea.

39
00:04:42,541 --> 00:04:43,666
On the air in 20 seconds.

40
00:04:47,041 --> 00:04:48,041
In the kitchen, Chief.

41
00:04:58,833 --> 00:05:01,250
""Xavier Mar�che, the break-in specialist,

42
00:05:01,333 --> 00:05:04,000
escaped the day before yesterday
from Fleury-M�rogis�""

43
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,375
Good evening.

44
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:18,000
""Police forces are currently surrounding
the Parc Monceau area in Paris.

45
00:05:18,583 --> 00:05:20,625
Xavier Mar�che, the break-in specialist,

46
00:05:21,208 --> 00:05:22,833
escaped the day before yesterday

47
00:05:22,916 --> 00:05:26,250
from Fleury-M�rogis,
where he was serving a life sentence.

48
00:05:26,333 --> 00:05:29,166
He took his lawyer,
Mireille Santini, hostage.

49
00:05:29,250 --> 00:05:32,500
It was Santini's young son
who managed to sound the alarm.

50
00:05:32,583 --> 00:05:35,291
On site,
our special correspondent Bertrand Alain.""

51
00:05:35,375 --> 00:05:36,583
Bertrand?

52
00:05:37,291 --> 00:05:39,000
Bertrand? Can you hear me, Bertrand?

53
00:05:39,708 --> 00:05:41,041
Yes, Catherine.

54
00:05:41,125 --> 00:05:44,125
Here, Mar�che is still holding
Ms. Santini hostage,

55
00:05:44,208 --> 00:05:48,333
his secretary and a third person
whose identity is still unknown.

56
00:05:48,416 --> 00:05:51,083
Mar�che demanded a car and the street

57
00:05:51,166 --> 00:05:53,333
to be cleared to allow its departure.

58
00:05:54,833 --> 00:05:58,166
And here is the car,
with two inspectors on board.

59
00:06:00,083 --> 00:06:03,541
They're stopping
in front of the door of the building.

60
00:06:03,625 --> 00:06:06,875
The inspectors get out
with the doors open.

61
00:06:07,833 --> 00:06:10,958
They're taking their positions.
Now we wait for Mar�che.

62
00:06:12,583 --> 00:06:14,958
Nobody shoot, let them pass!

63
00:06:15,041 --> 00:06:19,333
Here comes Mar�che. He's pushing
his hostage towards the car. He is armed.

64
00:06:27,541 --> 00:06:30,708
Mar�che and his hostage are getting into
another car they had the key for.

65
00:06:30,791 --> 00:06:32,416
We still don't know the hostage.

66
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:34,666
Presumably a client of Ms. Santini's.

67
00:06:34,750 --> 00:06:37,833
No Bertrand, the hostage
taken by Mar�che is not an unknown.

68
00:06:37,916 --> 00:06:40,833
Our colleague, the reporter Yves Dorget,
from Paris Matin.

69
00:06:48,958 --> 00:06:50,666
Mom! They're stealing your car!

70
00:07:06,166 --> 00:07:09,875
- Do you know how to use this phone?
- Yes.

71
00:07:10,750 --> 00:07:13,083
- Then call the cops.
- And tell them what?

72
00:07:13,708 --> 00:07:15,666
If they continue to follow us,
I'll shoot you.

73
00:07:19,333 --> 00:07:23,125
- Who are you calling?
- The newspaper. They'll pass it on.

74
00:07:23,208 --> 00:07:26,041
- Paris Matin, good evening.
- Give me the shorthand secretaries.

75
00:07:27,458 --> 00:07:29,500
Hello Jeannine, it's Dorget.

76
00:07:29,583 --> 00:07:31,416
Give the message to Villechaise.

77
00:07:32,125 --> 00:07:35,041
""Mar�che threatened to shoot me

78
00:07:35,125 --> 00:07:39,000
if the police continue to follow us.""
Pass it on, quick, right?

79
00:07:39,083 --> 00:07:42,041
I'll see you tomorrow night at 8 pm,

80
00:07:42,125 --> 00:07:43,541
good evening.

81
00:07:43,625 --> 00:07:44,791
Great.

82
00:07:51,541 --> 00:07:54,250
We're going to the conference now,
we're not waiting.

83
00:07:54,333 --> 00:07:57,375
- Keep me informed about Dorget.
- Are you sure that it's Dorget?

84
00:07:57,458 --> 00:07:59,208
I wouldn't have said it if I wasn't sure.

85
00:08:13,791 --> 00:08:15,166
I think they're letting us go.

86
00:08:17,250 --> 00:08:18,375
Perhaps, yes.

87
00:08:19,625 --> 00:08:23,541
- What are you doing?
- And your article? Don't you want it?

88
00:08:25,750 --> 00:08:26,916
Yes.

89
00:08:27,833 --> 00:08:29,791
Paris Matin, good evening.

90
00:08:30,666 --> 00:08:32,125
Give me the shorthand secretaries.

91
00:08:33,458 --> 00:08:35,250
Hello? It's Dorget.

92
00:08:36,333 --> 00:08:40,000
No, no. Everything's fine, don't worry.
So, are you there?

93
00:08:40,666 --> 00:08:42,208
""Mar�che's gun is pointed at me,

94
00:08:43,333 --> 00:08:45,375
but Mar�che will not shoot.

95
00:08:45,458 --> 00:08:47,458
I am not afraid of him

96
00:08:48,458 --> 00:08:52,291
because this man is not a killer.

97
00:08:53,958 --> 00:08:57,416
Unless, of course�""
No, take that out, it's not good.

98
00:08:58,333 --> 00:09:01,333
""But he could be

99
00:09:02,041 --> 00:09:04,083
if pushed to the limit,

100
00:09:04,166 --> 00:09:06,833
because this man has nothing left to lose

101
00:09:08,291 --> 00:09:11,125
except what he calls his honor.""

102
00:09:11,791 --> 00:09:16,250
No, not ""his horror"", ""his honor""!
With an ""n"", like Napoleon!

103
00:09:16,333 --> 00:09:20,625
Calm down, baby.
Can you hear me? All right.

104
00:09:20,708 --> 00:09:23,541
""Except his honor

105
00:09:23,625 --> 00:09:26,416
that the jurors of the Amiens Court
have taken from him

106
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:29,750
by convicting him
of a violent crime he did not commit.""

107
00:09:29,833 --> 00:09:32,500
So now, Laura,
what's the latest on the weather?

108
00:09:32,583 --> 00:09:34,250
Well, it seems that

109
00:09:34,333 --> 00:09:38,166
the cold front coming from the north
extends as far as the center of France.

110
00:09:38,250 --> 00:09:42,333
We have morning frost in Brittany�

111
00:09:42,416 --> 00:09:46,250
Okay, thank you, goodbye everyone,
so tomorrow, conference�

112
00:09:46,958 --> 00:09:48,375
At 1 pm, is that okay?

113
00:09:48,458 --> 00:09:50,291
- Yeah.
- He was good tonight.

114
00:09:50,375 --> 00:09:52,375
- He was weird.
- Good evening, everyone.

115
00:09:52,458 --> 00:09:53,375
Evening.

116
00:09:55,041 --> 00:09:56,208
- See ya.
- Good evening.

117
00:09:56,875 --> 00:09:58,458
Can I get the final lighting stuff?

118
00:10:00,750 --> 00:10:02,083
I won't be in tomorrow morning.

119
00:10:02,166 --> 00:10:04,625
So take everything
that happens on the oil tanker story

120
00:10:04,708 --> 00:10:07,083
and get the minister
at the beginning of the newspaper.

121
00:10:07,166 --> 00:10:09,666
- Okay?
- Okay. What about the dog topic?

122
00:10:10,833 --> 00:10:14,208
No. No, no, I don't want it.
But anyway, I'll be there at noon.

123
00:10:14,916 --> 00:10:17,041
Let's hurry, Catherine,
they're waiting for us.

124
00:10:17,125 --> 00:10:19,333
No, I'm not going, I canceled, I'm tired.

125
00:10:19,958 --> 00:10:22,875
- I should have warned you, maybe.
- You could have, yes.

126
00:10:22,958 --> 00:10:24,708
But you go ahead, everyone will be there.

127
00:10:24,791 --> 00:10:26,416
- There'll be�
- We'll see, I'll bring you back first.

128
00:10:27,333 --> 00:10:28,750
You don't look so good.

129
00:10:34,125 --> 00:10:36,125
- Do you have a fever?
- No.

130
00:10:36,958 --> 00:10:38,291
What can I do?

131
00:10:39,875 --> 00:10:42,166
Find an open pharmacy.

132
00:10:42,250 --> 00:10:45,250
Journalist Yves Dorget is driving
under the threat of Xavier Mar�che,

133
00:10:45,333 --> 00:10:46,833
who took him hostage.

134
00:10:46,916 --> 00:10:49,875
Our colleague
used the phone in the stolen car

135
00:10:49,958 --> 00:10:54,375
to dictate an article that will be
published tomorrow in his paper.

136
00:10:55,666 --> 00:10:57,541
- Can't you disengage for ten minutes?
- No!

137
00:10:57,625 --> 00:11:01,791
And finally, the weather.
In the southwest, lightning.

138
00:11:03,833 --> 00:11:05,875
Dorget is a friend of mine.

139
00:11:09,958 --> 00:11:12,666
PHARMACY

140
00:11:15,791 --> 00:11:17,666
Did you see? It's Catherine Carr�, there.

141
00:11:19,083 --> 00:11:20,166
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

142
00:11:20,250 --> 00:11:22,916
Excuse me, Miss Carr�, please,
could you give me an autograph?

143
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,083
Yes.

144
00:11:26,583 --> 00:11:29,083
- Here you go. Thank you.
- Thank you very much. Goodbye.

145
00:11:30,125 --> 00:11:32,916
This job is impossible.
These people are killing me.

146
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,083
We'll redo the front page
with a 4-column photo.

147
00:11:35,166 --> 00:11:37,750
But no, not Santini,
we don't care about Ms. Santini!

148
00:11:37,833 --> 00:11:40,958
Yeah, the kid coming out of the building,
on page 3, frame it like that.

149
00:11:41,041 --> 00:11:43,875
- What's the title?
- How long can we hold out?

150
00:11:43,958 --> 00:11:45,833
For the title? 23 hours.

151
00:11:45,916 --> 00:11:48,583
In Paris, we can change until 2 am,
but only in Paris.

152
00:11:49,458 --> 00:11:51,875
Yes. And what will we look like
tomorrow morning

153
00:11:51,958 --> 00:11:55,125
if Mar�che shoots Dorget at 3:00? Huh?

154
00:11:57,083 --> 00:11:58,541
Dorget is my friend.

155
00:11:59,666 --> 00:12:01,041
Dorget is part of the newspaper.

156
00:12:02,750 --> 00:12:08,166
Anyway, we have to find a title.
So. The title. ""Mar�che told me�""

157
00:12:08,250 --> 00:12:12,000
And below that:
""Yves Dorget's last words.""

158
00:12:12,083 --> 00:12:14,458
That's it. Last! That's what counts, last.

159
00:12:14,541 --> 00:12:17,208
With last words, we're all set.
We're covered!

160
00:12:18,333 --> 00:12:20,875
You agree? Agreed.

161
00:12:24,583 --> 00:12:27,041
As soon as you see a nice car, stop.

162
00:12:27,666 --> 00:12:30,916
- Which brand?
- I don't care, as long as it's fast.

163
00:13:00,916 --> 00:13:01,875
Thank you.

164
00:13:28,583 --> 00:13:31,375
MARECHE TOLD ME YVES DORGET'S LAST WORDS

165
00:13:31,458 --> 00:13:34,708
- Hey, Renard? You got a second?
- Yeah, yeah, I'll be right there.

166
00:13:36,875 --> 00:13:39,625
- What make is the car?
- I didn't get a good look.

167
00:13:40,458 --> 00:13:42,291
Foreign, in any case.

168
00:13:43,166 --> 00:13:44,125
The color?

169
00:13:46,041 --> 00:13:49,666
Oh� Dark, maybe. Yes, dark.

170
00:13:50,333 --> 00:13:53,833
- The numbers�?
- Oh� I'll stop.

171
00:13:54,625 --> 00:13:56,625
- Where was it?
- In Blainville.

172
00:13:58,708 --> 00:13:59,583
Good.

173
00:14:00,875 --> 00:14:02,333
It's not much.

174
00:14:02,916 --> 00:14:06,625
Too bad you gave in. If he had taken
another car, we would have had him.

175
00:14:06,708 --> 00:14:08,958
- Goodbye, gentlemen.
- Chief, may I take you home?

176
00:14:09,041 --> 00:14:10,208
No need, thank you.

177
00:14:11,083 --> 00:14:14,125
- I don't like this guy.
- Apparently, the feeling is mutual.

178
00:14:14,833 --> 00:14:16,875
You know I haven't recovered?

179
00:14:16,958 --> 00:14:20,500
- Recovered from what?
- From your nighttime stroll.

180
00:14:20,583 --> 00:14:21,916
But I was scared to death, man!

181
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,875
You still haven't lost your cool,
hats off to you for the title, eh!

182
00:14:24,958 --> 00:14:26,541
""Yves Dorget's last words"", good.

183
00:14:26,625 --> 00:14:28,166
- Is it true?
- Oh yes.

184
00:14:28,250 --> 00:14:31,916
- We sold well, I hope?
- Yes, all the radio stations picked us up.

185
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,916
So you continue with your papers,
naturally,

186
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,083
and if you're good tonight,
we'll make a killing.

187
00:14:36,166 --> 00:14:38,541
No, Andr�, I'm not going to go on TV.

188
00:14:38,625 --> 00:14:40,500
Listen Yves, be serious, eh?

189
00:14:40,583 --> 00:14:41,750
Yes, pass it to me.

190
00:14:41,833 --> 00:14:44,041
I mean, it's unexpected publicity,
you can't do that.

191
00:14:44,125 --> 00:14:46,333
- Which TV, first of all?
- Catherine Carr�.

192
00:14:46,416 --> 00:14:48,125
Yes, well, she was the first to call me.

193
00:14:48,208 --> 00:14:49,416
Hey.

194
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:51,666
We made 35,000 on Paris Surface. So?

195
00:14:51,750 --> 00:14:54,541
Catherine Carr�.
She remembers us, all of a sudden.

196
00:14:56,125 --> 00:14:57,000
Yes, thank you.

197
00:14:57,708 --> 00:14:59,958
I know. It bugs you.

198
00:15:01,333 --> 00:15:03,791
Go ahead! Come on.

199
00:15:06,333 --> 00:15:09,583
To you, old friend.

200
00:15:09,666 --> 00:15:13,416
Your old accomplice sees you coming,
imagine that.

201
00:15:16,375 --> 00:15:18,000
These lights hurt my eyes.

202
00:15:20,375 --> 00:15:22,750
Sorry, I bumped you.
I'm sorry, but we're running late.

203
00:15:22,833 --> 00:15:24,583
There's no rush, it's only 7:45.

204
00:15:24,666 --> 00:15:27,250
Yes, but we're busy tonight,
everyone has to go to makeup.

205
00:15:27,333 --> 00:15:31,208
- I don't need makeup.
- It's mandatory for technicals.

206
00:15:31,291 --> 00:15:33,625
I don't give a damn about the technicals!

207
00:15:35,166 --> 00:15:36,250
Enter.

208
00:15:36,333 --> 00:15:39,875
- I said no!
- I told you, it's mandatory!

209
00:15:39,958 --> 00:15:42,958
- What's going on?
- Mr. Dorget refuses to be made up.

210
00:15:45,708 --> 00:15:46,875
Is this true, Mr. Dorget?

211
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,958
That's right. I refuse.

212
00:15:54,166 --> 00:15:55,916
And why do you want to be ugly?

213
00:15:56,583 --> 00:15:57,625
I'm not a clown.

214
00:15:57,708 --> 00:16:00,666
A little anti-shine powder
won't take but a second.

215
00:16:02,958 --> 00:16:03,875
Just powder, okay?

216
00:16:03,958 --> 00:16:05,791
- Just a little.
- Right.

217
00:16:15,541 --> 00:16:18,833
- You've changed your hair.
- A little, yes.

218
00:16:22,541 --> 00:16:25,500
I knew a lady who changed her hair
every time she changed lovers.

219
00:16:26,750 --> 00:16:28,958
I once knew a man who hated beards.

220
00:16:29,500 --> 00:16:31,375
They didn't know what they were missing.

221
00:16:33,041 --> 00:16:34,416
This is my veil.

222
00:16:35,750 --> 00:16:37,291
It's good, it looks good on you.

223
00:16:38,708 --> 00:16:42,666
Be careful later, don't talk too fast,
don't wave your hands�

224
00:16:42,750 --> 00:16:46,291
Don't say hello to your granddaughter
or your friends from the 14th�

225
00:16:46,916 --> 00:16:51,041
- Good morning, Miss Carr�.
- Mr. Minister. Yves Dorget.

226
00:16:51,125 --> 00:16:52,125
Minister.

227
00:16:52,208 --> 00:16:55,625
Congratulations, sir, you have displayed
exemplary courage in this matter.

228
00:16:55,708 --> 00:16:57,916
Quite remarkable.
B�raut, president of the network.

229
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,000
- See you on the set, Minister.
- Fine.

230
00:17:00,083 --> 00:17:03,250
- Where are we seating the prime minister?
- Here, Mr. President.

231
00:17:03,333 --> 00:17:05,375
- Over there.
- Thank you.

232
00:17:09,958 --> 00:17:13,208
I put my sad face in your hands, Miss.

233
00:17:13,291 --> 00:17:15,625
Camera Three, close-up on Catherine.

234
00:17:15,708 --> 00:17:19,291
One on the minister.
Two, stay on Catherine.

235
00:17:21,625 --> 00:17:24,291
- Who is the minister?
- The government spokesperson.

236
00:17:24,375 --> 00:17:26,916
- I'm writing all this down?
- Yes, Catherine wants it done.

237
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:30,958
- Is there an ""s"" in ""words""?
- I don't know, man!

238
00:17:31,875 --> 00:17:33,625
We're on the air in 20 seconds.

239
00:17:33,708 --> 00:17:36,291
- Hey, don't forget about my insert, okay?
- Yeah, okay.

240
00:17:36,375 --> 00:17:38,833
- Thank you.
- � and our guest of honor Alain Roger.

241
00:17:38,916 --> 00:17:40,208
Good morning, Mr. Chairman.

242
00:17:40,291 --> 00:17:43,041
�with our great adventure film,

243
00:17:43,125 --> 00:17:45,833
but first, Info 20 with Catherine Carr�.

244
00:17:59,708 --> 00:18:01,458
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.

245
00:18:01,541 --> 00:18:06,375
Three headlines in this newspaper,
the elections in Mexico, the Mar�che case,

246
00:18:06,458 --> 00:18:09,791
and the sale
of two nuclear power plants by France.

247
00:18:10,291 --> 00:18:12,958
Thank you, Minister,
for being with us tonight.

248
00:18:13,041 --> 00:18:15,750
Two nuclear power plants
is a very big contract for France.

249
00:18:15,833 --> 00:18:17,958
Yes, it is. It's a very big contract.

250
00:18:18,708 --> 00:18:21,666
Which should be valued not only
in dollars, since the dollar

251
00:18:21,750 --> 00:18:24,958
is the international unit of exchange,
alas,

252
00:18:25,583 --> 00:18:29,750
but also in hours of work,
in jobs, in prestige

253
00:18:29,833 --> 00:18:31,833
for our engineers and technicians.

254
00:18:31,916 --> 00:18:36,041
Yes, but this contract was handled
by the government of a general president

255
00:18:36,125 --> 00:18:38,666
who is known to be undermined
by the internal rebellion.

256
00:18:38,750 --> 00:18:42,208
So it begs the question:
will this contract go through?

257
00:18:42,750 --> 00:18:44,375
Of course it will.

258
00:18:44,458 --> 00:18:47,833
It has nothing to do with the internal
affairs of a sovereign nation.

259
00:18:48,791 --> 00:18:52,333
Is it to ensure the future of the contract
that France sends arms to the FLNRS?

260
00:18:52,416 --> 00:18:54,041
That is, to the rebels.

261
00:18:54,833 --> 00:18:58,125
France never supplied arms to the FLNRS.

262
00:19:00,083 --> 00:19:02,041
I solemnly affirm this.

263
00:19:02,750 --> 00:19:05,458
According to a rumor
that was echoed by a weekly newspaper,

264
00:19:05,541 --> 00:19:09,541
it is said that there was a meeting
between an emissary of our government

265
00:19:09,625 --> 00:19:12,125
and the leader of the rebellion,
Halim Djavaoui.

266
00:19:13,083 --> 00:19:15,208
People say many things, Ms. Carr�.

267
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:19,750
I am sorry that you too obey
such a detestable habit.

268
00:19:20,666 --> 00:19:22,583
I have no idea what you are suggesting.

269
00:19:22,666 --> 00:19:25,416
I'm not suggesting anything,
Minister. I'm asking you a question.

270
00:19:25,916 --> 00:19:30,166
Was there any official contact
between France and the FLNRS?

271
00:19:30,250 --> 00:19:31,416
It's a yes or no question.

272
00:19:32,791 --> 00:19:34,125
My answer is no.

273
00:19:34,208 --> 00:19:36,916
Three times, no. Is that clear?

274
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,833
That's very clear, Minister.
And I thank you.

275
00:19:40,458 --> 00:19:41,916
Thank you.

276
00:19:42,916 --> 00:19:44,333
The Mar�che case.

277
00:19:44,416 --> 00:19:46,791
Mar�che, the gangster on the run,
is still at large.

278
00:19:46,875 --> 00:19:49,333
""Police forces are now canvassing
the Normandy region

279
00:19:49,416 --> 00:19:51,666
where it seems that he has found refuge

280
00:19:51,750 --> 00:19:54,458
after stealing a car
in front of his hostage,

281
00:19:54,541 --> 00:19:56,666
our colleague from Paris Matin,
Yves Dorget.

282
00:19:56,750 --> 00:19:59,916
Yves Dorget is with us tonight
on Info 20.""

283
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,000
- Good evening.
- Good evening.

284
00:20:02,083 --> 00:20:05,541
How does it feel
to spend three hours at gunpoint?

285
00:20:05,625 --> 00:20:10,666
Well� Let's just say
I've been in more comfortable situations.

286
00:20:11,458 --> 00:20:12,375
Were you scared?

287
00:20:14,500 --> 00:20:16,833
Fear� No.

288
00:20:17,916 --> 00:20:19,125
No, not really. No.

289
00:20:19,958 --> 00:20:21,875
Mar�che has never
committed a violent crime.

290
00:20:21,958 --> 00:20:24,041
- That's not the opinion of the court.
- No, but it's mine.

291
00:20:25,666 --> 00:20:28,708
Mar�che stole, but he didn't kill.

292
00:20:30,291 --> 00:20:31,416
Weren't you scared?

293
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,166
- How was I?
- Very good, convincing.

294
00:20:35,791 --> 00:20:38,250
It was time to stop this ridiculous rumor.

295
00:20:38,333 --> 00:20:40,875
I'm glad I could help you.

296
00:20:40,958 --> 00:20:43,166
The harm that irresponsible press can do�

297
00:20:43,708 --> 00:20:47,416
Don't you think success
has gone to Catherine Carr�'s head?

298
00:20:47,500 --> 00:20:50,250
You've got to keep her in line. But I am.

299
00:20:52,208 --> 00:20:56,000
The elections in Mexico did not bring
the change the opposition had hoped for.

300
00:20:56,500 --> 00:20:58,333
The government keeps its majority�

301
00:20:58,416 --> 00:21:00,375
Catherine would like you to wait for her.

302
00:21:00,458 --> 00:21:02,458
No, I can't. I don't have time. Thank you.

303
00:21:02,541 --> 00:21:05,375
- But she�
- I don't have time!

304
00:21:11,541 --> 00:21:15,833
HALIM DJAVAOUI ASSASSINATED

305
00:21:15,916 --> 00:21:22,291
THE BODY OF THE FLNRS LEADER

306
00:21:22,375 --> 00:21:27,000
HALIM DJAVAOUI WAS FOUND

307
00:21:27,083 --> 00:21:30,791
RIDDLED WITH SIX BULLETS

308
00:21:30,875 --> 00:21:35,250
IN AN APARTMENT IN PARIS.

309
00:21:36,416 --> 00:21:40,916
It seems that the cold front coming from
the north is spreading to the center.

310
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,583
General temperatures are falling

311
00:21:43,666 --> 00:21:47,000
and there will be a risk of ice
in the north and east.

312
00:21:47,083 --> 00:21:49,250
But it will get better during the week.

313
00:21:49,333 --> 00:21:52,958
Some temperatures:
45 in Brest, 48 in Paris,

314
00:21:53,041 --> 00:21:57,833
41 in Lille, 36 in Mulhouse, 36 in Metz,

315
00:21:57,916 --> 00:21:59,166
37 in Nancy,

316
00:21:59,250 --> 00:22:02,125
55 in Perpignan and 59 in Ajaccio.

317
00:22:02,708 --> 00:22:04,833
I hope you still have a great weekend.

318
00:22:05,458 --> 00:22:08,000
- Here's Catherine, for the weather.
- Thank you, Laura.

319
00:22:08,083 --> 00:22:11,291
I have just been told that Halim Djavaoui
was assassinated Paris.

320
00:22:11,875 --> 00:22:15,166
He was the leader of the FLNRS
we were speaking about earlier.

321
00:22:15,250 --> 00:22:18,083
- Send the picture.
- Here you go.

322
00:22:18,166 --> 00:22:21,291
A figure of the fundamentalist rebellion
who has died at under 40 years of age.

323
00:22:22,375 --> 00:22:25,208
I met him two years ago
in the Middle East,

324
00:22:25,791 --> 00:22:28,708
he enjoyed great prestige
among the youth of his country.

325
00:22:29,916 --> 00:22:33,250
It is even said that in the last few
months, he had found support in the army.

326
00:22:34,708 --> 00:22:36,333
Djavaoui was an unusual force,

327
00:22:36,416 --> 00:22:38,625
- and his caution�
- She's good at improvising.

328
00:22:38,708 --> 00:22:41,041
Yeah, she's a pro,
but we're still going over 20:30.

329
00:22:41,125 --> 00:22:42,833
No, she'll skip the last subject.

330
00:22:42,916 --> 00:22:45,291
�that seems most surprising
in this assassination.

331
00:22:46,125 --> 00:22:49,500
So much for this last minute news
that we won't miss

332
00:22:49,583 --> 00:22:51,833
to develop in our next editions,
I'll see you tomorrow

333
00:22:51,916 --> 00:22:54,166
- at 8 pm. See you tomorrow.
- What'd I tell you?

334
00:22:54,250 --> 00:22:56,333
- Credits.
- Here we go.

335
00:23:05,083 --> 00:23:08,875
- See you all tomorrow, thank you.
- Good evening Catherine, thank you all.

336
00:23:08,958 --> 00:23:10,541
- Where is he?
- You amazed me.

337
00:23:10,625 --> 00:23:12,875
- That's my job. Where is he?
- In my office.

338
00:23:12,958 --> 00:23:15,166
- Who are you talking about?
- Maret.

339
00:23:15,250 --> 00:23:16,666
I'm talking about Dorget.

340
00:23:16,750 --> 00:23:18,291
- Did he leave?
- He was in a hurry�

341
00:23:18,375 --> 00:23:21,000
- I told you he was waiting for me!
- Well, I told him!

342
00:23:31,500 --> 00:23:32,458
Hi.

343
00:23:34,208 --> 00:23:35,500
- Hello.
- Hello.

344
00:23:35,583 --> 00:23:37,083
- Hi, Gabriel.
- How are you, Yves?

345
00:23:37,166 --> 00:23:40,208
- Good.
- You're back from your trip with Mar�che?

346
00:23:40,875 --> 00:23:43,291
Yes, it's getting better, yes.
So what's going on here?

347
00:23:43,375 --> 00:23:46,625
The cops forbade us to enter the apartment
where Djavaoui was killed.

348
00:23:46,708 --> 00:23:48,833
- Who's on the case?
- Chief Giovanetti.

349
00:23:48,916 --> 00:23:50,083
Ah! Giovanetti!

350
00:23:50,166 --> 00:23:52,916
He had to make a statement,
and it's been two hours.

351
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:54,500
- Well, good luck guys, see you.
- OK.

352
00:24:10,958 --> 00:24:13,125
- Your card, sir!
- Piss off.

353
00:24:21,833 --> 00:24:23,125
Hey, Giova.

354
00:24:24,375 --> 00:24:25,583
All I needed was you.

355
00:24:25,666 --> 00:24:28,208
Well, I knew you were going
to give a press conference.

356
00:24:28,291 --> 00:24:30,583
What's up? Shall I come?

357
00:24:31,333 --> 00:24:33,875
- He couldn't keep you, Mar�che?
- Well, no.

358
00:24:35,083 --> 00:24:36,500
He released me.

359
00:24:41,166 --> 00:24:43,458
Okay. What do you want?

360
00:24:45,041 --> 00:24:48,083
It seems impossible to me
that Djavaoui let his guard down.

361
00:24:48,875 --> 00:24:50,958
He'd only have opened for someone he knew.

362
00:24:52,041 --> 00:24:53,458
He didn't open anything at all.

363
00:24:56,250 --> 00:24:58,083
The doors were broken into.

364
00:24:59,416 --> 00:25:02,500
The one in the entrance
and the one in the apartment.

365
00:25:03,958 --> 00:25:05,833
It was a pro job.

366
00:25:06,666 --> 00:25:12,000
- Like Mar�che.
- Mar�che� Say, that's a bit much.

367
00:25:12,500 --> 00:25:13,833
It is possible.

368
00:25:14,416 --> 00:25:17,208
When you find money
and a good passport, why not?

369
00:25:17,833 --> 00:25:19,750
But he still didn't kill Djavaoui.

370
00:25:33,083 --> 00:25:34,666
Why are you telling me this?

371
00:25:40,375 --> 00:25:43,125
Because you won't talk about it
until you have proof.

372
00:25:45,166 --> 00:25:46,291
No.

373
00:25:47,458 --> 00:25:48,458
Yes.

374
00:25:50,250 --> 00:25:51,125
Yes.

375
00:25:52,875 --> 00:25:53,916
Yes, yes.

376
00:25:55,791 --> 00:25:56,708
No.

377
00:26:01,916 --> 00:26:02,875
Yes.

378
00:26:04,666 --> 00:26:05,708
Yes.

379
00:26:07,333 --> 00:26:08,583
Uh� no.

380
00:26:10,458 --> 00:26:12,583
- Yes. Ah, she's beautiful, there.
- Yes, isn't she?

381
00:26:12,666 --> 00:26:15,833
Well, that's enough. No? For a cover.

382
00:26:15,916 --> 00:26:18,583
Yes, yes. I'm quite happy.

383
00:26:19,208 --> 00:26:21,666
- You're charging a lot for this, right?
- Yes.

384
00:26:21,750 --> 00:26:25,458
- I'm doing this for you, baby.
- I know it.

385
00:26:25,541 --> 00:26:29,041
No, but it's good, it's very nice.
You're doing better and better.

386
00:26:29,125 --> 00:26:30,208
Thank you.

387
00:26:32,458 --> 00:26:33,791
I have a little gift for you.

388
00:26:34,791 --> 00:26:36,000
A gift for me?

389
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:50,833
- It's all bullshit.
- You're telling me.

390
00:26:50,916 --> 00:26:53,625
No, but you can take 30 seconds
for the Japanese demonstration.

391
00:26:53,708 --> 00:26:55,416
Then you put the headlines and�

392
00:26:55,500 --> 00:26:58,083
- You wanted to show me something?
- Oh yes, in my office.

393
00:26:58,166 --> 00:27:00,875
- I'll give you five minutes, no more.
- That's more than enough.

394
00:27:11,166 --> 00:27:12,333
Where did you get this?

395
00:27:14,500 --> 00:27:16,208
It was sent anonymously.

396
00:27:17,125 --> 00:27:19,458
- And what do you plan to do with it?
- I don't know.

397
00:27:20,125 --> 00:27:21,708
I'm thinking.

398
00:27:21,791 --> 00:27:24,791
But you're wasting your time.
You'll get nothing out of it, you know?

399
00:27:24,875 --> 00:27:26,750
- You think so?
- Oh, I'm sure.

400
00:27:26,833 --> 00:27:29,000
Yes, but the minister made a fool of me.

401
00:27:29,958 --> 00:27:33,208
""I answer you no, three times no,
no contact with Djavaoui�

402
00:27:33,291 --> 00:27:34,541
Is that clear?""

403
00:27:35,041 --> 00:27:37,166
Well, maybe he didn't know.

404
00:27:37,250 --> 00:27:40,791
A government spokesman?
That'd really be something.

405
00:27:41,416 --> 00:27:43,000
No, he was playing with me.

406
00:27:43,791 --> 00:27:45,875
Really. And therefore, yours.

407
00:27:45,958 --> 00:27:49,583
- Don't make everything personal.
- Oh, I'm not.

408
00:27:51,375 --> 00:27:52,833
I don't like the ridiculous.

409
00:27:52,916 --> 00:27:55,958
Well, you know that nobody
remembers what they say on television.

410
00:27:56,041 --> 00:27:57,916
Except when the newspapers reproduce it.

411
00:27:58,833 --> 00:28:02,833
- Give me that. Give me that!
- No! It's mine!

412
00:28:02,916 --> 00:28:04,708
Don't act like a child.

413
00:28:05,791 --> 00:28:09,333
- You're here to see the demonstration?
- Yes.

414
00:28:09,416 --> 00:28:10,333
Goodbye.

415
00:28:35,750 --> 00:28:37,000
It doesn't make sense, dear.

416
00:28:38,458 --> 00:28:41,250
I haven't seen Halim Djavaoui
in two years.

417
00:28:41,333 --> 00:28:44,666
Maybe more. You were right to warn me.

418
00:28:45,208 --> 00:28:48,958
- I only did my duty, sir.
- I'll remember that.

419
00:28:49,458 --> 00:28:50,875
Goodbye.

420
00:29:01,750 --> 00:29:03,208
Hello.

421
00:29:03,291 --> 00:29:05,791
Do you have anything on Catherine Carr�?

422
00:29:05,875 --> 00:29:09,333
Television, yes. I want a complete file.

423
00:29:11,583 --> 00:29:14,833
He'll never know why�

424
00:29:14,916 --> 00:29:15,916
Oh shit�

425
00:29:18,750 --> 00:29:20,375
You've been robbed, Cathie.

426
00:29:32,750 --> 00:29:35,291
Shit�

427
00:29:37,750 --> 00:29:39,708
No, but it wasn't money he wanted.

428
00:29:39,791 --> 00:29:41,916
When they find it, they take it anyway.
I'll call the police.

429
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:43,750
No!

430
00:29:43,833 --> 00:29:46,791
No, I'll call tomorrow. It's too late now.

431
00:29:52,166 --> 00:29:55,041
- You're not working this week.
- Not on the air, but I am working.

432
00:29:58,541 --> 00:30:00,916
Leave it.

433
00:30:01,666 --> 00:30:03,666
I'd rather you went home to sleep tonight.

434
00:30:11,791 --> 00:30:15,208
- Do you love me?
- I love you as much as I can.

435
00:30:16,458 --> 00:30:18,875
- Will you accompany me to the trials?
- Go away.

436
00:30:18,958 --> 00:30:22,833
Yes, I'll go with you to the trials
if you promise to win.

437
00:30:22,916 --> 00:30:26,250
Come on, don't be mad at me.
Don't be mad at me, huh?

438
00:30:26,333 --> 00:30:27,541
Say!

439
00:30:42,166 --> 00:30:44,833
Yes, hello Yves, did I wake you?
It's Catherine.

440
00:30:45,625 --> 00:30:46,875
Catherine.

441
00:30:47,750 --> 00:30:49,833
Catherine Carr�, does that ring a bell?

442
00:30:50,750 --> 00:30:54,375
No no, it's okay, but I need to talk
to you tomorrow.

443
00:30:56,083 --> 00:31:00,708
If you want, at home, before 11 o'clock.
Okay. Sorry to have� woken you up.

444
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:35,208
What can be said at this point of the case
is that Chief Giovanetti's statements

445
00:31:35,291 --> 00:31:38,250
have not been cleared up,

446
00:31:38,333 --> 00:31:41,083
but we will do our best to do so.

447
00:31:41,166 --> 00:31:43,958
- Hello.
- Hello, it's open.

448
00:31:49,666 --> 00:31:53,666
- I'm late, a little.
- Yes. A little, yes.

449
00:31:54,250 --> 00:31:56,250
I finished my paper, I was about to leave.

450
00:31:57,291 --> 00:32:00,625
- You live alone here, if I understand.
- Yes, and?

451
00:32:01,958 --> 00:32:04,208
I don't know.

452
00:32:09,750 --> 00:32:13,375
- What do you want?
- I need some advice.

453
00:32:14,208 --> 00:32:16,250
- Advice? You?
- Yes.

454
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:19,375
Look at that.

455
00:32:19,916 --> 00:32:22,875
- What is it about?
- Well, I'll explain.

456
00:32:22,958 --> 00:32:24,666
What did you do with your wife?

457
00:32:26,916 --> 00:32:29,916
She politely fired me, if you must know.

458
00:32:31,541 --> 00:32:34,291
- Because of you, by the way.
- Because of me?

459
00:32:35,083 --> 00:32:36,708
Don't tell me I was the first.

460
00:32:37,291 --> 00:32:41,250
Well, since I got married, yes,
I was a good father and husband.

461
00:32:41,333 --> 00:32:42,583
And a good lover.

462
00:32:42,666 --> 00:32:44,791
- Well, I really have to go.
- No, Yves.

463
00:32:45,541 --> 00:32:49,375
- I'm on to something big.
- Me too, actually.

464
00:32:49,458 --> 00:32:51,750
Then you can explain it all to me later.

465
00:32:51,833 --> 00:32:54,250
- But where are you going?
- To Honfleur!

466
00:32:55,625 --> 00:32:56,541
How long for?

467
00:32:56,625 --> 00:32:59,250
No.t long I go back and forth,
get a paper, come back.

468
00:32:59,333 --> 00:33:01,083
- Well then, I'll go with you.
- Oh no, no.

469
00:33:01,166 --> 00:33:03,125
- No.
- Yes! Yes, I will talk to you on the way.

470
00:33:03,208 --> 00:33:06,333
- There's no heat in the car.
- I love that.

471
00:33:06,416 --> 00:33:08,500
What a pain in the ass!

472
00:33:11,541 --> 00:33:13,500
- Where's your car?
- That one there.

473
00:33:13,583 --> 00:33:16,750
- This? We'll take mine, then.
- No.

474
00:33:16,833 --> 00:33:19,125
- Yes, yes, you'll drive, come on.
- No!

475
00:33:22,166 --> 00:33:25,625
You must make a good living on TV.

476
00:33:25,708 --> 00:33:26,875
Get in.

477
00:33:27,833 --> 00:33:30,000
No, I have connections
in the car industry.

478
00:33:30,083 --> 00:33:33,500
Yes, that's right, the runner.
He must be a great conversationalist.

479
00:33:34,291 --> 00:33:36,583
Conversation isn't what I ask him for.

480
00:33:38,833 --> 00:33:39,833
Get out.

481
00:33:42,375 --> 00:33:46,583
- Why?
- It's for the best. We'll bicker.

482
00:33:46,666 --> 00:33:49,791
I don't feel like bickering,
I'd love to go to Deauville with you.

483
00:33:49,875 --> 00:33:52,208
Well, too bad,
because we're going to Honfleur.

484
00:33:52,291 --> 00:33:56,333
- Yes. It's the same thing.
- Not at all! Then not at all!

485
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:03,000
Mareche mustn't have had such a fun time
with you for two hours.

486
00:34:08,583 --> 00:34:12,666
You're a snake. Right? You really are.

487
00:34:15,500 --> 00:34:17,875
You've still got your pretty little
snake mouth on you.

488
00:34:19,291 --> 00:34:20,500
What a shame.

489
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:03,875
It's her, it's her!

490
00:35:10,250 --> 00:35:12,291
- Are you Catherine Carr�?
- Yes, it's me.

491
00:35:12,375 --> 00:35:14,458
It's nice to see you like this
in the flesh.

492
00:35:14,541 --> 00:35:15,625
I told you it was her!

493
00:35:15,708 --> 00:35:18,041
- Excuse him, he admires you so much.
- Hello.

494
00:35:19,458 --> 00:35:23,291
200 francs.
Say, is that Catherine Carr� with you?

495
00:35:23,375 --> 00:35:27,083
- Yes, so what?
- Nothing, I was just saying that�

496
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:35,833
An autograph, please.

497
00:35:38,125 --> 00:35:39,708
Thank you.

498
00:35:42,666 --> 00:35:45,958
- You like that, don't you?
- I'm not going to bite them.

499
00:35:46,041 --> 00:35:50,333
Well, no. No, but you could do this. Look.

500
00:35:52,375 --> 00:35:54,041
There.

501
00:35:54,125 --> 00:35:56,333
- It's worse with the dark glasses.
- Is that so?

502
00:35:56,416 --> 00:35:58,791
Really? People get curious
about who's behind them.

503
00:36:05,125 --> 00:36:08,833
- Does it go with the hat?
- You look good in it.

504
00:36:39,416 --> 00:36:43,041
- It's open. Very well. Thank you.
- Hello.

505
00:36:48,083 --> 00:36:51,791
- Ma'm, can we have lunch?
- Ah, it's too late, sir.

506
00:36:51,875 --> 00:36:54,166
In this season, after two,
we don't serve anymore.

507
00:36:54,250 --> 00:36:56,125
Oh, please, ma'am�

508
00:36:58,208 --> 00:37:00,000
Catherine Carr�

509
00:37:00,833 --> 00:37:04,625
Wow.

510
00:37:04,708 --> 00:37:08,041
- Is it really you?
- Yes.

511
00:37:08,125 --> 00:37:11,125
- Then please, have a seat.
- Thank you.

512
00:37:12,416 --> 00:37:14,750
They'll make a real effort for you
in the kitchen.

513
00:37:14,833 --> 00:37:17,250
Would you like to start
with a porcini omelette?

514
00:37:17,333 --> 00:37:20,416
- Yes, very good.
- I'll have a pitcher of wine brought over.

515
00:37:20,500 --> 00:37:21,666
Is the omelet okay for you?

516
00:37:21,750 --> 00:37:25,291
Yes. I would have preferred morels.
But anyway�

517
00:37:25,375 --> 00:37:28,291
I'm cold, look. My nose is frozen.

518
00:37:34,416 --> 00:37:36,291
What are you playing at, Catherine?

519
00:37:38,291 --> 00:37:39,625
I don't know.

520
00:37:40,291 --> 00:37:41,625
We'll find out.

521
00:37:44,166 --> 00:37:45,375
Here is the bread.

522
00:37:46,541 --> 00:37:49,750
- I know you too.
- Ah, I've been here before.

523
00:37:49,833 --> 00:37:53,958
- I have a house in the country.
- No, it's not that. That's not it at all.

524
00:37:55,083 --> 00:38:00,166
You are� You are the gangster
who took the journalist hostage.

525
00:38:00,250 --> 00:38:03,000
No, I'm the journalist
that the gangster took hostage.

526
00:38:03,083 --> 00:38:06,166
- Yes, well, it's the same thing.
- Yes, I guess.

527
00:38:06,250 --> 00:38:08,416
Yes, what I mean is, you were on TV.

528
00:38:08,500 --> 00:38:11,208
- Once, yes, just once.
- That's enough.

529
00:38:12,208 --> 00:38:13,166
Yes.

530
00:38:15,625 --> 00:38:16,750
Thank you.

531
00:38:16,833 --> 00:38:18,708
Miss, I am very honored.

532
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:22,791
So you're the journalist�

533
00:38:23,666 --> 00:38:24,875
Uh, yes.

534
00:38:25,375 --> 00:38:28,375
May I shake your hand? You were brave.

535
00:38:28,458 --> 00:38:32,083
Oh, you're sweet, no.
You know, there's not much to do.

536
00:38:32,166 --> 00:38:34,666
He could have bumped you off too.

537
00:38:34,750 --> 00:38:38,958
- No� Well, yes.
- There's no respect anymore.

538
00:38:39,041 --> 00:38:41,333
Mr. George? The check please.

539
00:38:42,750 --> 00:38:45,041
See how nice it is to be famous?

540
00:38:45,833 --> 00:38:47,250
You didn't bite them either.

541
00:38:59,541 --> 00:39:01,541
At noon, I watch the tape by myself.

542
00:39:02,208 --> 00:39:04,833
At three, I show it to the president
who turns apple green.

543
00:39:05,875 --> 00:39:08,750
And in the evening I get broken into,
all the tapes are gone.

544
00:39:08,833 --> 00:39:12,666
- Maybe it's just a coincidence.
- Maybe.

545
00:39:13,541 --> 00:39:18,083
- So was this morning's information.
- What information?

546
00:39:18,166 --> 00:39:21,583
They're buying the two nuclear plants
from us. It's a done deal.

547
00:39:21,666 --> 00:39:23,958
So it's quid pro quo.

548
00:39:24,666 --> 00:39:27,416
We do them the service of killing Djavaoui
or let him be killed,

549
00:39:27,500 --> 00:39:30,250
and they thank us,
they buy the plants from us, maybe.

550
00:39:30,333 --> 00:39:33,458
- It's hard to verify.
- Well, we have to find Mar�che.

551
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:35,000
Why Mar�che?

552
00:39:35,083 --> 00:39:38,458
Because it was he
who opened the door to Djavaoui.

553
00:39:39,375 --> 00:39:41,083
The police told me.

554
00:39:41,583 --> 00:39:44,208
And somewhere
I have the address of Mar�che's wife,

555
00:39:44,291 --> 00:39:47,125
I need to get my hands on it again,
that's why I came here.

556
00:39:47,208 --> 00:39:49,208
Yes, but what do I do with my tape?

557
00:39:49,958 --> 00:39:51,958
I feel like I have a grenade in my hands.

558
00:39:52,583 --> 00:39:55,500
The problem with grenades is,
you can't blow up with them.

559
00:40:25,958 --> 00:40:27,541
I could never get a fire started.

560
00:40:28,166 --> 00:40:29,375
Let me.

561
00:40:29,458 --> 00:40:32,458
Fine.

562
00:40:33,250 --> 00:40:34,708
You were never a boy scout.

563
00:40:35,500 --> 00:40:37,333
- You were a scout?
- Yes.

564
00:40:38,500 --> 00:40:40,375
- Do you have any matches?
- Here.

565
00:40:41,708 --> 00:40:43,791
I should have known better, though.

566
00:40:43,875 --> 00:40:46,250
- Girl Scout leader, I bet.
- Absolutely, that's right.

567
00:40:46,791 --> 00:40:49,083
I was 13 years old,
with a round hat and small braids.

568
00:40:49,166 --> 00:40:53,291
Small braids and small teeth,
already long, long, long�

569
00:40:53,375 --> 00:40:55,083
You'll always amaze me.

570
00:40:55,166 --> 00:40:58,833
Good luck. I love this stuff.
And it's going to get hard,

571
00:40:58,916 --> 00:41:01,000
unless Mar�che kidnaps me,
you're way ahead.

572
00:41:01,083 --> 00:41:04,916
Oh, don't talk nonsense Catherine,
you're getting on my nerves!

573
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:07,083
I abhor competition.

574
00:41:07,791 --> 00:41:11,208
- Easy to say when you've already won.
- What have I won?

575
00:41:11,291 --> 00:41:13,166
A reputation for courage.

576
00:41:13,250 --> 00:41:15,625
Reputation
is the echo of other people's stupidity.

577
00:41:16,833 --> 00:41:20,000
- How kind.
- No, listen, Catherine. You're pushy�

578
00:41:20,083 --> 00:41:21,833
No, I am ambitious.

579
00:41:21,916 --> 00:41:23,000
- If you want.
- I want.

580
00:41:23,083 --> 00:41:27,916
So you're ambitious? And you've attained
a celebrity that fulfills you?

581
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:31,291
- With more advantages than disadvantages.
- At what price?

582
00:41:31,375 --> 00:41:32,958
What does that mean, at what price?

583
00:41:35,291 --> 00:41:36,958
Why did you leave me, Catherine?

584
00:41:39,166 --> 00:41:40,666
How can one know such a thing?

585
00:41:41,291 --> 00:41:45,791
- I loved you until�
- Until I loved you?

586
00:41:48,541 --> 00:41:50,375
That's part of it.

587
00:41:51,875 --> 00:41:54,708
Remember what I posted in my office
at the newspaper?

588
00:41:54,791 --> 00:41:56,250
Oh yes. And I remember that.

589
00:41:57,125 --> 00:42:02,000
""Do you really want to climb the ladder?
If you're going to end up hanged?""

590
00:42:02,083 --> 00:42:04,333
- It's by Michaux.
- Yes, it's stupid anyway.

591
00:42:06,250 --> 00:42:09,750
I like winners.
It's nothing to be ashamed of.

592
00:42:09,833 --> 00:42:13,833
Is it shameful to sleep with winners
to make a career?

593
00:42:15,250 --> 00:42:19,083
- You have to be a woman to answer that.
- Exactly, you have to be a woman.

594
00:42:21,583 --> 00:42:23,333
And believe me, it's not that simple.

595
00:42:25,208 --> 00:42:28,791
My career was made by the audience.
I don't sleep with them.

596
00:42:29,625 --> 00:42:33,000
I respect them.
I work, I work my ass off for them.

597
00:42:33,083 --> 00:42:35,833
I do too. And I don't brag about it.

598
00:42:37,083 --> 00:42:39,500
- It wouldn't have the same effect.
- You're wrong.

599
00:42:40,250 --> 00:42:42,750
- Women would like you.
- So you think.

600
00:42:43,458 --> 00:42:46,083
Well, yes. I liked you.

601
00:42:46,666 --> 00:42:48,041
Go ahead.

602
00:42:49,416 --> 00:42:52,875
Scratch. You can have fun, baby.

603
00:42:54,541 --> 00:42:56,208
The scar is healed.

604
00:42:58,833 --> 00:43:01,208
I don't know where I put it.

605
00:43:01,291 --> 00:43:03,291
Mar�che's wife's address.

606
00:43:04,291 --> 00:43:07,166
Oh. Here it is.

607
00:43:08,750 --> 00:43:10,250
We can go.

608
00:43:26,500 --> 00:43:32,291
Grandma!

609
00:43:38,500 --> 00:43:42,291
I know I can trust you, Mr. Dorget.
That's not the point�

610
00:43:44,791 --> 00:43:46,833
But do you realize
if something happens to him?

611
00:43:46,916 --> 00:43:50,125
But for God's sake, I might be
the only one left who can still help him!

612
00:43:50,208 --> 00:43:53,291
I know! But�

613
00:43:56,250 --> 00:43:59,375
I can't. I can't!

614
00:44:03,541 --> 00:44:04,666
Good!

615
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:09,291
Good, good.

616
00:44:11,041 --> 00:44:12,375
Too bad.

617
00:44:13,500 --> 00:44:17,083
- I thought we'd be regulars here.
- Why are you telling me this?

618
00:44:19,125 --> 00:44:21,291
You know why I'm telling you this.

619
00:44:25,458 --> 00:44:26,916
Mr. Dorget!

620
00:44:30,541 --> 00:44:32,458
Put an ad in your newspaper.

621
00:44:34,083 --> 00:44:36,875
""Peggy will be waiting for Bob
at the station at 3:00.""

622
00:44:37,625 --> 00:44:39,166
You specify the date.

623
00:44:40,875 --> 00:44:44,833
- Gare de l'Est. Platform 25.
- Thank you.

624
00:45:15,250 --> 00:45:21,000
NEWS

625
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:57,875
- What do you want from me?
- Djavaoui.

626
00:45:57,958 --> 00:45:59,250
Are you in on it?

627
00:46:00,291 --> 00:46:03,500
Yes, I opened the doors,
but I didn't shoot.

628
00:46:03,583 --> 00:46:04,708
Who was the shooter?

629
00:46:06,333 --> 00:46:07,375
I don't know.

630
00:46:10,708 --> 00:46:12,333
Who were you working for?

631
00:46:14,166 --> 00:46:15,375
I can't tell you that.

632
00:46:16,083 --> 00:46:18,625
The secret service?

633
00:46:18,708 --> 00:46:22,125
- French?
- No, DEMETEC.

634
00:46:23,541 --> 00:46:24,875
Don't ask me more.

635
00:46:26,500 --> 00:46:28,333
You're not the type to do that.

636
00:46:29,666 --> 00:46:31,583
A real passport is priceless.

637
00:46:33,458 --> 00:46:36,125
Okay. Thank you.

638
00:46:38,333 --> 00:46:39,583
That's okay, we're even.

639
00:46:41,041 --> 00:46:43,583
- Have you seen my kids?
- Yes. They're fine.

640
00:46:44,375 --> 00:46:46,416
Take care of yourself.

641
00:46:46,500 --> 00:46:48,833
You can't trust these people.

642
00:47:08,958 --> 00:47:13,833
MARECHE TOLD ME: I SAW DJAVAOUI SHOT

643
00:47:13,916 --> 00:47:15,541
You're taking me for a ride, Dorget!

644
00:47:15,625 --> 00:47:17,875
Not at all, Chief,
I'm protecting my sources.

645
00:47:17,958 --> 00:47:19,750
- Your source is an murderer.
- No.

646
00:47:19,833 --> 00:47:22,875
- Yes!
- He's a burglar, not a killer.

647
00:47:24,750 --> 00:47:27,041
- You won't put me in touch with him?
- No.

648
00:47:27,125 --> 00:47:28,250
We refuse.

649
00:47:29,416 --> 00:47:30,500
Very well.

650
00:47:32,125 --> 00:47:37,166
Mr. Dorget,
you'll be brought before a judge.

651
00:47:37,250 --> 00:47:39,833
And you will be cited as an accomplice.
Goodbye, gentlemen.

652
00:47:40,541 --> 00:47:42,708
Where are we headed?

653
00:47:42,791 --> 00:47:45,458
He could put you on the lam.

654
00:47:45,541 --> 00:47:48,583
Yeah, it's not up to him.
He'll have me hauled in, and then�

655
00:47:48,666 --> 00:47:51,666
And then what? What if you get a judge
who doesn't like the press?

656
00:47:51,750 --> 00:47:53,250
But we have to stop this right now!

657
00:47:53,333 --> 00:47:55,708
Call me the Interior Minister!

658
00:47:55,791 --> 00:47:57,291
I don't want to stop you there.

659
00:47:57,375 --> 00:47:59,208
Readers are interested in
what you have to say.

660
00:47:59,291 --> 00:48:03,000
Either I am very wrong
or the minister will send you packing.

661
00:48:03,083 --> 00:48:05,708
They're using Mar�che
to cover up a conspiracy!

662
00:48:05,791 --> 00:48:09,125
I'm telling you! Andre! Poor Mar�che.

663
00:48:09,208 --> 00:48:12,958
- You're not going soft, are you?
- No!

664
00:48:13,583 --> 00:48:15,125
Thank you, Miss.

665
00:48:15,208 --> 00:48:16,833
Yes, hello, Minister.

666
00:48:16,916 --> 00:48:19,083
I'm taking the liberty of disturbing you
for something�

667
00:48:19,166 --> 00:48:20,916
One of my colleagues, Yves Dorget,

668
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:23,916
is being unfairly pursued
by Chief Berchner.

669
00:48:24,625 --> 00:48:25,958
Yves Dorget, yes.

670
00:48:27,708 --> 00:48:29,291
Ah, you see what this is about?

671
00:48:31,708 --> 00:48:34,041
Yes, certainly, yes. When?

672
00:48:35,291 --> 00:48:38,458
Okay. Okay, thank you, Minister.

673
00:48:41,625 --> 00:48:44,750
Yes well, he wants to see me.
I don't like that.

674
00:49:38,458 --> 00:49:40,000
Dorget was arrested.

675
00:49:55,958 --> 00:49:58,083
No, put it in the archives.

676
00:50:33,291 --> 00:50:35,375
It's nice of you to come
and have lunch with me.

677
00:50:36,166 --> 00:50:38,750
Thank you for seeing me so quickly,
Mr. Minister.

678
00:50:38,833 --> 00:50:41,166
Please. Come on, please.

679
00:50:42,208 --> 00:50:43,333
Hello.

680
00:50:47,791 --> 00:50:51,250
I saw your president yesterday,
and he is very proud of you.

681
00:50:51,333 --> 00:50:54,000
- Is that true?
- Oh yes. And I can see why.

682
00:50:55,958 --> 00:51:01,291
- You're sort of his creation, aren't you?
- He's the one who gave me my segment.

683
00:51:02,375 --> 00:51:06,208
- People must be jealous.
- Some people don't like me.

684
00:51:06,291 --> 00:51:09,291
- They tell you?
- Rarely, but they write to me.

685
00:51:10,083 --> 00:51:13,125
""I don't like your voice."" Thank you.
""You have a silly smile.""

686
00:51:13,750 --> 00:51:16,541
""I don't like your red dress.""
And a little bit of everything.

687
00:51:17,916 --> 00:51:21,583
- But the majority is with you.
- The polls are good, yes.

688
00:51:22,166 --> 00:51:23,875
I wish I could say the same
for the government.

689
00:51:25,125 --> 00:51:28,875
- Things are not going well right now.
- What's on your mind?

690
00:51:29,416 --> 00:51:32,250
Well, nothing� The political climate.

691
00:51:33,458 --> 00:51:34,666
The economic situation�

692
00:51:35,250 --> 00:51:39,791
- And the assassination of Djavaoui?
- Less so.

693
00:51:41,083 --> 00:51:42,916
- And you?
- Me?

694
00:51:43,958 --> 00:51:46,791
No. No, but it's a big deal.

695
00:51:47,375 --> 00:51:50,750
No, Ms. Carr�, it's not a big deal.

696
00:51:51,541 --> 00:51:53,208
This is a commonplace incident.

697
00:51:53,750 --> 00:51:54,625
A mobster's crime

698
00:51:54,708 --> 00:51:57,250
is being blown out of proportion
by your friend Dorget.

699
00:51:57,333 --> 00:51:59,083
Yes, that's the Interior's version.

700
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:02,208
The version. ""The version.""

701
00:52:03,208 --> 00:52:05,208
You journalists are amazing.

702
00:52:05,291 --> 00:52:08,916
Between the Interior Minister
and a gangster's word,

703
00:52:09,458 --> 00:52:11,083
who do you trust?

704
00:52:12,833 --> 00:52:15,291
- The gangster?
- I didn't say that, Minister.

705
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:19,625
But I'm saddened
that a colleague of mine was arrested.

706
00:52:20,625 --> 00:52:23,958
- It seems that you like Dorget.
- Yes, I like him.

707
00:52:27,083 --> 00:52:28,875
But the whole press likes Dorget.

708
00:52:29,916 --> 00:52:32,333
- If I were his friend�
- You wouldn't have put him in jail.

709
00:52:33,416 --> 00:52:34,708
I had nothing to do with it.

710
00:52:34,791 --> 00:52:36,791
The investigating judge is independent.

711
00:52:36,875 --> 00:52:39,583
But he still couldn't let this challenge
to common sense go by.

712
00:52:40,666 --> 00:52:41,916
One must denounce evildoers.

713
00:52:43,791 --> 00:52:47,916
I find it hard to believe that you
would turn in all the criminals you know.

714
00:52:53,041 --> 00:52:55,666
But you know very well
that Dorget is mistaken in this matter.

715
00:52:56,250 --> 00:52:57,916
Dorget is a hunting dog.

716
00:52:59,583 --> 00:53:01,500
When he gets a lead, he follows it.

717
00:53:01,583 --> 00:53:05,000
The hunt is over, where he is now.
And it'll stay over as long as necessary.

718
00:53:06,625 --> 00:53:08,916
Do you intend to keep him in prison
for long?

719
00:53:09,583 --> 00:53:11,125
As long as the judge needs.

720
00:53:15,708 --> 00:53:18,208
You will have the whole press against you.
Do you know that?

721
00:53:19,083 --> 00:53:20,125
I'm used to it.

722
00:53:21,750 --> 00:53:25,500
- Be careful, dear Catherine Carr�.
- Me?

723
00:53:26,500 --> 00:53:27,708
Your president's time is up.

724
00:53:28,958 --> 00:53:30,500
He will have to be replaced.

725
00:53:31,250 --> 00:53:32,458
The cupboards will open.

726
00:53:32,541 --> 00:53:36,000
You never know how the chips will fall.

727
00:53:38,083 --> 00:53:39,916
It's all Greek to me, sir.

728
00:53:41,208 --> 00:53:44,291
I'm sure you understand everything,
smart as you are.

729
00:53:45,291 --> 00:53:46,166
Even Greek.

730
00:53:51,208 --> 00:53:53,000
- You're never careful�
- It's okay.

731
00:53:53,083 --> 00:53:55,916
All right, quiet! Quiet!

732
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:59,541
- Dorget will not give in! You know him.
- Well, I hope he won't give in!

733
00:53:59,625 --> 00:54:01,125
He told the judge to go to hell,

734
00:54:01,208 --> 00:54:03,250
and since the judge won't give in either,

735
00:54:03,333 --> 00:54:05,125
this kind of crap can last a long time.

736
00:54:05,208 --> 00:54:07,666
The government has to.
We still have a free press, right?

737
00:54:07,750 --> 00:54:10,500
Judge Yorel is a first-rate hypocrite,
that's well known.

738
00:54:10,583 --> 00:54:12,833
Dorget is right. This is about funding.

739
00:54:12,916 --> 00:54:14,500
- I would like to say...
- They'll be on his side!

740
00:54:14,583 --> 00:54:16,458
You have to go to the Minister of Justice!

741
00:54:16,541 --> 00:54:18,333
- We are the 4th power.
- I would like to say...

742
00:54:18,416 --> 00:54:20,583
We have to act now. It's now or never.

743
00:54:20,666 --> 00:54:23,666
- I would like to say...
- We must put the politicians in jail.

744
00:54:23,750 --> 00:54:25,750
Jail isn't the issue.
This is about principles.

745
00:54:25,833 --> 00:54:27,375
- I would like to say...
- When principles go out the window,

746
00:54:27,458 --> 00:54:28,375
you do something about it.

747
00:54:28,458 --> 00:54:30,166
- I would like to say!
- Let's take to the streets!

748
00:54:30,250 --> 00:54:32,666
- I would like to say!
- Yes, well say it!

749
00:54:34,208 --> 00:54:35,541
I don't agree.

750
00:54:36,375 --> 00:54:37,875
What do you disagree with?

751
00:54:39,125 --> 00:54:41,833
I don't agree with the interview
of a mobster on the run.

752
00:54:41,916 --> 00:54:45,000
- Oh, my�
- We're not going to do this again�

753
00:54:45,083 --> 00:54:48,083
Listen, we'll send you to the Turks,
you'll see if they agree.

754
00:54:48,166 --> 00:54:49,791
You're a bit fascist, aren't you?

755
00:54:49,875 --> 00:54:51,958
What are you even doing at this paper?

756
00:54:52,041 --> 00:54:56,000
Enough. What about the truth?
What about the truth?

757
00:54:56,750 --> 00:54:59,083
The reader? Who cares about the people?

758
00:54:59,750 --> 00:55:03,250
We're telling them that the leader
of the FLNRS was assassinated by mistake!

759
00:55:03,333 --> 00:55:05,958
By mistake. Do you find that moral?

760
00:55:07,958 --> 00:55:08,958
No.

761
00:55:09,708 --> 00:55:13,375
- Well, I would like to say...
- Now you've said it! So enough!

762
00:55:13,958 --> 00:55:16,250
The truth is like onions,
it has 18 layers!

763
00:55:16,333 --> 00:55:18,875
But it can also emerge
from the mouth of a gangster!

764
00:55:18,958 --> 00:55:20,833
Commentary is free, but facts are sacred.

765
00:55:20,916 --> 00:55:22,500
- True.
- Okay.

766
00:55:22,583 --> 00:55:26,375
So I propose that a delegation be received
by the Minister of Justice, tomorrow.

767
00:55:26,458 --> 00:55:28,958
- Amen.
- I couldn't agree more.

768
00:55:56,833 --> 00:55:59,458
I didn't think it was that hard
to get a visitor's permit.

769
00:55:59,541 --> 00:56:00,916
It depends on the judge.

770
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:03,583
If your minister intervened,
it mustn'have made things better.

771
00:56:03,666 --> 00:56:05,041
On the contrary. Here, try this.

772
00:56:09,666 --> 00:56:10,583
How's that?

773
00:56:13,625 --> 00:56:16,625
The license, the professional card.

774
00:56:16,708 --> 00:56:18,708
The visiting permit, you show this.

775
00:56:19,416 --> 00:56:21,625
Leave the card at the front desk.

776
00:56:21,708 --> 00:56:23,208
- They give it back on your way out.
- Okay.

777
00:56:24,250 --> 00:56:25,458
Jacket.

778
00:56:26,708 --> 00:56:28,083
They know it well.

779
00:56:29,250 --> 00:56:30,375
And my briefcase.

780
00:56:32,291 --> 00:56:34,416
Thank you. Thank you very much.

781
00:56:35,541 --> 00:56:38,166
I'm doing this for Dorget.
I owe him that much.

782
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:42,666
I warn you, if you get caught,
I will accuse you of theft.

783
00:56:42,750 --> 00:56:45,000
Yes. Yes, I know.

784
00:56:48,208 --> 00:56:49,625
You know, I have�

DETENTION CENTER

786
00:57:43,166 --> 00:57:45,666
COURTS ADMINISTRATION

787
00:57:45,750 --> 00:57:46,833
Good morning.

788
00:57:47,458 --> 00:57:49,666
Please take Ms. Santini
to the visiting room.

789
00:58:46,625 --> 00:58:47,666
Well, it's you.

790
00:58:48,750 --> 00:58:53,041
I had to warn you. They're after you,
and they won't let you go.

791
00:58:55,875 --> 00:58:59,708
- Are they keeping me for six months?
- If it suits them.

792
00:59:05,041 --> 00:59:06,000
Do you understand?

793
00:59:08,333 --> 00:59:10,208
How do you keep busy here?

794
00:59:11,666 --> 00:59:13,166
I work.

795
00:59:13,958 --> 00:59:15,750
When I was six years old, I started a book

796
00:59:15,833 --> 00:59:20,000
on the press in the 19th century:
Hugo, his son, etc.

797
00:59:20,083 --> 00:59:21,416
So here, I have time to work.

798
00:59:23,416 --> 00:59:25,708
You're funny with your little hat.

799
00:59:26,500 --> 00:59:28,333
You're no fun as a convict.

800
00:59:29,625 --> 00:59:34,291
- What can I do to get you out of here?
- Nothing. You have to stand on principle.

801
00:59:34,375 --> 00:59:35,750
That's all.

802
00:59:35,833 --> 00:59:38,916
A gagged journalist,
300,000 readers blinded.

803
00:59:39,000 --> 00:59:42,000
But they're protesting,
and so is the press.

804
00:59:42,708 --> 00:59:46,166
We have already been politely asked
not to talk about you anymore.

805
00:59:47,375 --> 00:59:51,166
- And you obeyed?
- We do what we can. Really!

806
00:59:51,250 --> 00:59:52,375
Catherine�

807
00:59:56,833 --> 00:59:58,208
Don't get upset.

808
01:00:00,208 --> 01:00:03,458
They'll let me go when they get Mar�che.

809
01:00:03,541 --> 01:00:05,291
But they won't get him.

810
01:00:05,375 --> 01:00:06,958
They'll get him.

811
01:00:08,041 --> 01:00:11,083
They'll get him when they want to.
He's small fry.

812
01:00:11,166 --> 01:00:14,458
We made him into what he became.
Us, the press!

813
01:00:15,291 --> 01:00:18,833
- You sound like a minister.
- Ministers aren't necessarily stupid.

814
01:00:20,041 --> 01:00:21,541
They're powerless, but not stupid.

815
01:00:22,458 --> 01:00:25,583
In the meantime, he's the one cheating,
and you're the one in jail.

816
01:00:25,666 --> 01:00:27,958
Listen, don't play your Tosca, Catherine.

817
01:00:28,041 --> 01:00:31,083
They're not going to execute me.
Besides, ministers come and go.

818
01:00:31,166 --> 01:00:34,291
Journalists� They last.

819
01:00:35,250 --> 01:00:37,166
This is how you see things?

820
01:00:37,250 --> 01:00:39,958
I see this as one more episode

821
01:00:40,041 --> 01:00:42,250
in the old struggle
between the press and the state.

822
01:00:43,166 --> 01:00:47,666
The old struggle in which you,
TV journalists, are spectators.

823
01:00:52,291 --> 01:00:53,916
Goodbye.

824
01:03:26,416 --> 01:03:32,250
WRONGDOER XAVIER MARECHE

825
01:03:32,333 --> 01:03:38,458
KILLED IN THE DAMASCUS AIRPORT

826
01:03:45,666 --> 01:03:47,125
- No, don't cut!
- Yes!

827
01:03:47,208 --> 01:03:50,291
No, leave it! There! There, you cut.

828
01:03:50,791 --> 01:03:51,958
How much is that?

829
01:03:52,041 --> 01:03:55,000
Well, all in all, one minute twelve.

830
01:03:55,083 --> 01:03:56,208
Yes.

831
01:03:57,625 --> 01:04:00,875
- Mar�che was killed.
- Really?

832
01:04:01,500 --> 01:04:03,583
- Are we doing a short with an insert?
- No, no.

833
01:04:05,416 --> 01:04:06,708
No, it's worth much more.

834
01:04:07,916 --> 01:04:09,541
We're in a hurry.

835
01:04:13,625 --> 01:04:17,208
Attention please, on air in 20 seconds,
thank you.

836
01:04:17,291 --> 01:04:19,500
- You know what you're risking?
- Me? Nothing.

837
01:04:19,583 --> 01:04:22,625
- I'm just following orders.
- Thank you.

838
01:04:24,541 --> 01:04:25,666
Here we go.

839
01:04:30,625 --> 01:04:32,333
Come on, come on, let's get moving!

840
01:04:41,666 --> 01:04:43,125
Good evening.

841
01:04:43,750 --> 01:04:46,750
Xavier Mar�che was shot dead today
at Damascus airport

842
01:04:46,833 --> 01:04:48,958
by security services.

843
01:04:49,041 --> 01:04:51,291
His death will not help
the ongoing investigation

844
01:04:51,375 --> 01:04:53,541
into the murder of Halim Djavaoui.

845
01:04:54,375 --> 01:04:57,666
Indeed, the police services held Mar�che
as the main person responsible

846
01:04:57,750 --> 01:05:00,625
for the murder of the leader of the FLNRS.

847
01:05:01,583 --> 01:05:06,166
However, Mar�che had specified
during an interview granted to Yves Dorget

848
01:05:06,250 --> 01:05:08,916
that he had seen Halim Djavaoui shot.

849
01:05:09,958 --> 01:05:13,583
For having collected this interview,
Yves Dorget is still in prison.

850
01:05:14,583 --> 01:05:18,625
Here, in this complex case,
you will see an exceptional document.

851
01:05:20,708 --> 01:05:25,041
This is Halim Djavaoui,
received on Thursday, March 14

852
01:05:25,125 --> 01:05:28,958
on the back steps of Matignon
by the Prime Minister.

853
01:05:29,916 --> 01:05:32,208
This video contradicts

854
01:05:32,291 --> 01:05:35,458
the statement made in this room
by the State Minister

855
01:05:35,541 --> 01:05:37,708
that there has never been official contact

856
01:05:37,791 --> 01:05:40,958
- between the state and Halim Djavaoui.
- She's nuts!

857
01:05:41,750 --> 01:05:43,000
Qualification tests�

858
01:05:43,083 --> 01:05:46,375
- What's wrong?
- Something serious.

859
01:05:46,458 --> 01:05:49,083
- When are you coming back?
- When I find a job.

860
01:06:04,375 --> 01:06:06,333
Cut. Thanks everyone.

861
01:06:07,583 --> 01:06:08,791
- Give me the tape.
- What tape?

862
01:06:08,875 --> 01:06:13,666
Don't play dumb.
This story is going to cost you.

863
01:06:13,750 --> 01:06:16,125
- What story?
- I want the radio copy.

864
01:06:16,208 --> 01:06:17,333
Sorry, we're not allowed.

865
01:06:17,416 --> 01:06:19,416
I'll tell you what you're allowed to do.

866
01:06:19,500 --> 01:06:22,750
We don't release that copy.

867
01:06:47,958 --> 01:06:53,500
- You're expected at the conference.
- Do it without me. Like grown-ups.

868
01:06:54,958 --> 01:06:55,916
All right.

869
01:06:57,708 --> 01:06:59,500
Everything will be fine, thank you G�rard.

870
01:07:14,458 --> 01:07:15,583
Where are you going?

871
01:07:19,333 --> 01:07:22,208
- I'm expected for dinner.
- They'll wait.

872
01:07:25,250 --> 01:07:29,625
- So you're happy with yourself, are you?
- Yes.

873
01:07:30,375 --> 01:07:34,708
I've been supporting you for years.
You're not that well-liked here.

874
01:07:35,500 --> 01:07:38,875
The higher-ups even less.

875
01:07:38,958 --> 01:07:41,625
They've been waiting for you to screw up
for a while, me too.

876
01:07:41,708 --> 01:07:44,541
And you give them your head like that,
on a silver platter.

877
01:07:45,166 --> 01:07:47,166
But why on earth, why?

878
01:07:48,958 --> 01:07:53,208
Throwing it all away
for three minutes of fun?

879
01:07:53,291 --> 01:07:55,000
Why did you do that?

880
01:07:56,250 --> 01:07:59,916
Why the hell did you do that?

881
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:03,250
- You wouldn't understand.
- I'm too stupid, is that it?

882
01:08:04,250 --> 01:08:05,750
No, but you're too old.

883
01:08:06,875 --> 01:08:09,916
Here. Goodbye.

884
01:08:18,291 --> 01:08:20,000
Hello.

885
01:08:20,083 --> 01:08:22,041
- How are you?
- Good.

886
01:08:22,125 --> 01:08:23,666
No, I'm keeping it.

887
01:08:27,958 --> 01:08:31,375
How are you, Cathie?
You're the first one, they're late.

888
01:08:31,916 --> 01:08:35,500
- Did you see the paper?
- The piece on me was nice.

889
01:08:35,583 --> 01:08:37,083
No, I'm talking about television.

890
01:08:38,208 --> 01:08:41,041
- Sorry, I was working late�
- Didn't you look?

891
01:08:41,708 --> 01:08:44,625
Listen, I watch you every night Cathie,
today I couldn't.

892
01:08:44,708 --> 01:08:47,958
- You could say you're unlucky.
- Am I unlucky?

893
01:08:48,041 --> 01:08:51,333
- I have a nice car, a mistress�
- You had a mistress.

894
01:08:51,916 --> 01:08:53,916
Catherine, what's wrong?

895
01:08:57,291 --> 01:08:59,208
- Good evening.
- You were wonderful, Catherine.

896
01:08:59,291 --> 01:09:02,166
That's nice, but I have to go now.
But Remi is here.

897
01:09:02,250 --> 01:09:04,541
We'll talk later. Goodbye.

898
01:09:07,708 --> 01:09:11,208
Good evening R�mi. Catherine
was fantastic tonight. Did you see her?

899
01:09:11,291 --> 01:09:12,541
No, I haven't seen it.

900
01:09:13,708 --> 01:09:16,291
No, I haven't seen it.
Once in six months, I'm allowed, right?

901
01:09:17,125 --> 01:09:21,208
DETENTION CENTER

902
01:09:30,166 --> 01:09:32,541
- You didn't put on your little hat?
- No.

903
01:09:32,625 --> 01:09:35,000
You're not here for a story?

904
01:09:35,083 --> 01:09:36,875
- So you came looking for me.
- Yes.

905
01:09:58,416 --> 01:10:00,916
I thought you had Catherine Carr�
on a tight leash.

906
01:10:01,750 --> 01:10:05,916
With women, you never know.
We were wrong to put her on TV.

907
01:10:06,000 --> 01:10:09,916
Don't be ridiculous.
Are you network president or not?

908
01:10:11,041 --> 01:10:13,416
- Yes.
- So you are responsible!

909
01:10:14,250 --> 01:10:16,500
Mr. Minister, I don't understand.

910
01:10:16,583 --> 01:10:18,208
When I told the Prime Minister,

911
01:10:18,291 --> 01:10:20,916
I told her that Catherine Carr�
had this tape.

912
01:10:21,750 --> 01:10:23,875
You are mistaken,
you never met the Prime Minister.

913
01:10:26,125 --> 01:10:28,375
You knew of the nature of this film.

914
01:10:28,458 --> 01:10:30,625
- Do you admit it?
- Naturally, since it's me�

915
01:10:30,708 --> 01:10:32,208
You have no excuse!

916
01:10:34,250 --> 01:10:37,375
You won't be reappointed.

917
01:10:38,458 --> 01:10:42,541
Mr. Minister, I did everything I could
to prevent this incident.

918
01:10:42,625 --> 01:10:46,750
It's Mrs. Carr� who planned it,
she even bribed a technician!

919
01:10:46,833 --> 01:10:48,333
And if anyone should pay, it's her.

920
01:10:48,416 --> 01:10:51,000
And if I pay, she'll pay!

921
01:10:51,083 --> 01:10:53,458
That's very clever, right when that bitch

922
01:10:53,541 --> 01:10:55,083
is being made a national hero!

923
01:10:55,166 --> 01:10:58,416
74% of French people
approve of her showing this document!

924
01:10:58,500 --> 01:10:59,375
How does that sound?

925
01:11:01,958 --> 01:11:04,125
All that's left
is to make her a martyr now.

926
01:11:05,291 --> 01:11:09,333
If I may say so, Mr. Minister,
we need to come up with a response.

927
01:11:11,750 --> 01:11:13,708
- Do you have an idea?
- I think so.

928
01:11:18,166 --> 01:11:20,000
Bourret, show the president out.

929
01:11:27,416 --> 01:11:29,541
Go ahead.

930
01:11:29,625 --> 01:11:33,125
Mar�che is dead, so no more witnesses.

931
01:11:33,208 --> 01:11:34,375
And the tape?

932
01:11:34,916 --> 01:11:38,958
- We'll say it was from two years ago.
- Why two years ago?

933
01:11:39,041 --> 01:11:41,083
Because two years ago, the Prime Minister

934
01:11:41,166 --> 01:11:44,125
actually met Djavaoui at Matignon.

935
01:11:46,333 --> 01:11:47,875
That's not bad.

936
01:11:48,500 --> 01:11:50,791
You ask to be heard out,

937
01:11:50,875 --> 01:11:53,625
you set the record straight,

938
01:11:53,708 --> 01:11:56,541
and we discredit Catherine Carr�
in the process.

939
01:12:03,083 --> 01:12:06,000
That's good. That's very good.

940
01:12:14,208 --> 01:12:17,333
- So I was right?
- Yes.

941
01:12:19,916 --> 01:12:24,041
- You're pleased with your student?
- Yes.

942
01:12:24,750 --> 01:12:26,375
I'm your sweetheart?

943
01:12:26,958 --> 01:12:30,000
Who else? Yes, you.

944
01:12:30,083 --> 01:12:32,708
Do you call all women that?

945
01:12:33,208 --> 01:12:34,791
No.

946
01:12:37,541 --> 01:12:38,625
You're lying.

947
01:12:40,458 --> 01:12:41,875
Yes, I'm lying.

948
01:12:44,791 --> 01:12:47,208
Like you sweet women.

949
01:12:49,125 --> 01:12:51,416
I guess you could say
I got more than I bargained for.

950
01:12:55,208 --> 01:12:58,416
- I'm hungry.
- I'll take you to dinner.

951
01:13:04,375 --> 01:13:07,416
- What are you going to do now?
- I'm going to get fired.

952
01:13:07,500 --> 01:13:11,208
- They won't dare.
- Yes, they will. Yes, they will.

953
01:13:11,291 --> 01:13:14,708
I'm going to get paid, but in a closet.

954
01:13:16,541 --> 01:13:18,791
The French approve of Catherine Carr�.

955
01:13:18,875 --> 01:13:22,125
74% of those surveyed

956
01:13:22,208 --> 01:13:24,833
say they approve
of the release of the document

957
01:13:24,916 --> 01:13:29,208
showing the meeting of the Prime Minister
and the leader of the FLNRS.

958
01:13:29,291 --> 01:13:31,166
This massive approval

959
01:13:31,250 --> 01:13:33,583
comes as our colleague

960
01:13:33,666 --> 01:13:36,416
was the victim
of an misinformation campaign.

961
01:13:37,416 --> 01:13:41,541
The document you have seen
was indeed filmed by a foreign network,

962
01:13:41,625 --> 01:13:42,916
but two years ago.

963
01:13:43,000 --> 01:13:46,083
The Prime Minister
did indeed meet with Mr. Halim Djavaoui.

964
01:13:46,166 --> 01:13:48,458
- But that was 23 months ago.
- That son of a bitch.

965
01:13:48,541 --> 01:13:49,875
That bastard.

966
01:13:49,958 --> 01:13:52,916
I don't quite understand.
The Italian photographer tricked you?

967
01:13:53,000 --> 01:13:55,875
No! I'm sure of it.

968
01:13:55,958 --> 01:13:59,166
- I checked it all out.
- How sure are you?

969
01:13:59,250 --> 01:14:02,666
The guy behind the Prime Minister.
You remember, the bald guy.

970
01:14:02,750 --> 01:14:03,750
- Do you know him?
- No.

971
01:14:03,833 --> 01:14:06,333
Michel Barrer, the chief of staff.

972
01:14:06,416 --> 01:14:10,250
And how long has Barrer been at Matignon?
For two months. Not 23.

973
01:14:11,291 --> 01:14:12,333
Oh the bastard�

974
01:14:13,500 --> 01:14:15,875
Now what do I look like?

975
01:14:15,958 --> 01:14:18,166
You look like you wanted to make a move
and missed.

976
01:14:18,250 --> 01:14:21,333
- But you know that's not true!
- Yes, but I don't matter.

977
01:14:23,666 --> 01:14:27,375
- I'm going to get taken down tomorrow.
- They'll certainly go after you.

978
01:14:28,250 --> 01:14:30,458
You can do something for me.

979
01:14:30,541 --> 01:14:33,541
- Something important.
- Name it. What do you want?

980
01:14:35,541 --> 01:14:40,416
You have to write in your newspaper
that my information was good,

981
01:14:41,291 --> 01:14:45,000
and that I did my duty by passing it on.

982
01:14:45,791 --> 01:14:47,750
If you back me,

983
01:14:48,416 --> 01:14:50,958
- with your credit�
- No, I can't do that, Catherine.

984
01:14:51,041 --> 01:14:54,208
Why? Villechaise won't stop you.

985
01:14:54,291 --> 01:14:57,125
- No, I don't think he'd refuse, but�
- But what?

986
01:14:58,875 --> 01:15:00,500
Are you afraid I'm wrong?

987
01:15:00,583 --> 01:15:02,833
Well, go check it out for yourself.

988
01:15:02,916 --> 01:15:05,250
Go and ask
how long Barrer has been at Matignon.

989
01:15:07,083 --> 01:15:09,583
23 months ago, he was in Washington!

990
01:15:09,666 --> 01:15:12,291
That's good, but not enough.
What we need is to authenticate

991
01:15:12,375 --> 01:15:14,416
the exact date of the meeting.

992
01:15:17,750 --> 01:15:18,833
Exact date.

993
01:15:22,375 --> 01:15:25,375
Yes? No, I don't have a statement to make.

994
01:15:26,208 --> 01:15:27,666
No, no comment!

995
01:15:35,625 --> 01:15:37,125
Don't answer!

996
01:15:39,500 --> 01:15:42,250
No, she's not in. I don't know.

997
01:15:42,958 --> 01:15:45,250
They're not going
to stop bothering you now.

998
01:15:45,333 --> 01:15:47,166
If you want peace and quiet,
go to Honfleur.

999
01:15:47,750 --> 01:15:49,958
- Nobody will find you.
- In Honfleur?

1000
01:15:50,833 --> 01:15:52,375
I'll see what I can do for you.

1001
01:16:10,166 --> 01:16:12,041
- Do you have five minutes?
- For you, yes.

1002
01:16:12,125 --> 01:16:15,375
Get back to the attack. What's the point
of talent on the fifth line

1003
01:16:15,458 --> 01:16:18,166
if the reader doesn't get past the third?

1004
01:16:18,250 --> 01:16:21,250
Oh, what a bunch� What's up?

1005
01:16:21,333 --> 01:16:22,875
What do we do about Catherine Carr�?

1006
01:16:22,958 --> 01:16:26,333
We have a short article
with a blurb on the front page. Maybe.

1007
01:16:27,041 --> 01:16:30,375
- Who's on it?
- Barbara, and she'll be tough.

1008
01:16:31,041 --> 01:16:33,208
- Let me write it.
- You?

1009
01:16:33,291 --> 01:16:35,041
Not very classy, after what happened.

1010
01:16:35,125 --> 01:16:38,166
Exactly. I would have liked to defend her.

1011
01:16:38,250 --> 01:16:41,916
We can't defend her,
she's forgotten all she learned here!

1012
01:16:42,000 --> 01:16:45,500
- Andr�, I know that her document is good.
- Oh yes, and how do you know?

1013
01:16:45,583 --> 01:16:48,291
- The Prime Minister is dirty!
- Do you have proof?

1014
01:16:48,375 --> 01:16:50,125
Listen� Trust me.

1015
01:16:50,208 --> 01:16:52,875
Don't treat me with Catherine, please.

1016
01:16:52,958 --> 01:16:54,958
If I bring you a proof?

1017
01:16:55,041 --> 01:16:58,416
I'm publishing tonight because I don't
give a shit about the Prime Minister!

1018
01:16:58,500 --> 01:17:00,625
But I need it to be rock solid!

1019
01:17:00,708 --> 01:17:02,666
- Yves! I'll give you two hours.
- Okay.

1020
01:17:02,750 --> 01:17:03,583
Okay.

1021
01:17:10,833 --> 01:17:13,250
- What are you looking at?
- Legs.

1022
01:17:14,791 --> 01:17:19,041
- Can't you wait until I leave?
- But you've already left, Bruno.

1023
01:17:21,583 --> 01:17:22,541
Go and see.

1024
01:17:34,375 --> 01:17:36,750
- Yes?
- I would like to speak to Bruno Brunolli.

1025
01:17:36,833 --> 01:17:38,958
- He's upstairs.
- Pardon me.

1026
01:17:39,750 --> 01:17:42,666
- Brunolli?
- Yes?

1027
01:17:42,750 --> 01:17:45,083
- Yves Dorget.
- Oh, right.

1028
01:17:45,166 --> 01:17:47,166
I was just on my way out.

1029
01:17:47,250 --> 01:17:49,708
- Yes, I see, where are you going?
- To Milan.

1030
01:17:49,791 --> 01:17:51,916
- For long?
- I don't know yet.

1031
01:17:52,000 --> 01:17:54,500
Well, you're going to delay your departure
by a few minutes.

1032
01:17:54,583 --> 01:17:57,375
- No!
- Oh, but yes.

1033
01:17:58,791 --> 01:18:00,208
Why are you here?

1034
01:18:00,833 --> 01:18:04,125
- Because I need your testimony.
- My testimony? About what?

1035
01:18:04,208 --> 01:18:06,083
About the tape
you gave to Catherine Carr�.

1036
01:18:06,166 --> 01:18:08,458
Me? I never give her anything.

1037
01:18:08,541 --> 01:18:12,125
- The tape you sold her!
- Sold? To Catherine?

1038
01:18:12,208 --> 01:18:13,208
I don't rat on friends.

1039
01:18:13,291 --> 01:18:16,083
Did you or did you not give her a tape?

1040
01:18:16,166 --> 01:18:19,625
I don't know what you're talking about,
I'm in a hurry, I have a plane to catch.

1041
01:18:19,708 --> 01:18:21,500
There are no flights to Milan right now.

1042
01:18:21,583 --> 01:18:23,958
- Who said I was going to Milan?
- You did!

1043
01:18:24,875 --> 01:18:29,333
Well, I said that to trick you.

1044
01:18:31,000 --> 01:18:33,000
Listen to me, Brunolli.

1045
01:18:34,750 --> 01:18:36,250
I don't want to hurt you.

1046
01:18:38,041 --> 01:18:40,958
- Do you understand that?
- Yes.

1047
01:18:42,125 --> 01:18:45,458
- Just write 10 lines.
- Write what?

1048
01:18:45,541 --> 01:18:49,291
Ten lines stating
that the tape you gave to Catherine

1049
01:18:49,375 --> 01:18:51,083
was shot on the 14th of the month.

1050
01:18:51,166 --> 01:18:54,208
- No.
- It wasn't shot on Thursday the 14th?

1051
01:18:56,125 --> 01:18:58,625
Mr. Dorget, you are a journalist, right?

1052
01:18:59,125 --> 01:19:02,458
So when you're asked
to give up your sources, you refuse.

1053
01:19:02,541 --> 01:19:06,291
And you prefer to go to jail,
even when it's a gangster.

1054
01:19:06,375 --> 01:19:08,333
And for that, I salute you.

1055
01:19:08,416 --> 01:19:11,375
And if Catherine tells the cops
that I gave her that tape,

1056
01:19:11,458 --> 01:19:15,375
- then she can go to hell!
- She didn't tell the cops!

1057
01:19:16,541 --> 01:19:19,916
And who is the statement for?
For your grandmother?

1058
01:19:20,000 --> 01:19:24,708
Brunolli, I need proof
that this tape was shot last week!

1059
01:19:25,708 --> 01:19:30,041
- You'll get nothing.
- I'll beat the shit out of you!

1060
01:19:34,041 --> 01:19:35,458
You're not the type.

1061
01:19:36,833 --> 01:19:40,000
Look, I won't say anything.

1062
01:19:40,083 --> 01:19:44,625
I'm Italian, and sometimes it's best
to have the courage to be a coward.

1063
01:19:45,916 --> 01:19:48,458
When the wave passes, you lower your head

1064
01:19:49,083 --> 01:19:53,666
and when you stand up,
you're a little dirty.

1065
01:19:57,000 --> 01:20:00,000
Stay if you want. Me, ciao.

1066
01:20:20,833 --> 01:20:26,291
- It won't do you any good. I won't tell!
- I know, Brunolli.

1067
01:20:30,291 --> 01:20:32,166
Do you have a VCR somewhere?

1068
01:20:32,250 --> 01:20:33,583
- Yes, in archives.
- Thank you.

1069
01:20:43,166 --> 01:20:45,958
- Hey, Morot. Where's the VCR?
- Evening.

1070
01:20:46,041 --> 01:20:48,375
- It's over there in the back. Why?
- I'd like to see it.

1071
01:20:48,458 --> 01:20:50,500
- Do you know how to use it?
- No, I don't.

1072
01:20:50,583 --> 01:20:51,791
- Is it urgent?
- Yeah.

1073
01:20:56,500 --> 01:20:57,791
That's it.

1074
01:20:57,875 --> 01:20:59,875
�declare in their turn that
on pain of death�

1075
01:20:59,958 --> 01:21:01,583
Go back upstairs.

1076
01:21:14,791 --> 01:21:17,125
Stop. Rewind.

1077
01:21:25,416 --> 01:21:29,416
- That's what we saw last night.
- Yes, this is the original. Fast-forward.

1078
01:21:32,333 --> 01:21:35,000
Stop, stop, stop. Go back.

1079
01:21:38,083 --> 01:21:40,708
Stop.

1080
01:21:41,416 --> 01:21:43,750
- Do you see the newspaper?
- Yeah.

1081
01:21:43,833 --> 01:21:46,458
- What's on the paper?
- Well, a car.

1082
01:21:46,541 --> 01:21:49,791
Yes, a Renault GT Turbo.

1083
01:21:49,875 --> 01:21:53,833
- They presented it to the press a week go.
- So?

1084
01:21:53,916 --> 01:21:57,333
So, it's a great car, Morot!
Give me the tape.

1085
01:21:57,416 --> 01:21:59,083
- You're welcome.
- Thank you very much.

1086
01:21:59,166 --> 01:22:03,458
- Rock-solid proof.
- Shut the door.

1087
01:22:03,541 --> 01:22:05,875
No, I'm fine, thank you, I'll shave.

1088
01:22:05,958 --> 01:22:09,333
The proof
that her document is eight days old.

1089
01:22:09,416 --> 01:22:10,750
- That's interesting.
- Here.

1090
01:22:10,833 --> 01:22:12,083
Come in!

1091
01:22:12,916 --> 01:22:15,041
Give me five minutes in peace!

1092
01:22:15,125 --> 01:22:17,041
You asked me for a bio
of Michel Barrer, here!

1093
01:22:17,125 --> 01:22:19,041
- I didn't ask for anything!
- No, I did.

1094
01:22:19,125 --> 01:22:21,625
Listen Yves, it's not urgent,
we'll see about it tomorrow.

1095
01:22:22,375 --> 01:22:24,541
- Michel Barrer's photos.
- What the hell is going on?

1096
01:22:24,625 --> 01:22:27,333
- What the hell?
- It's my fault.

1097
01:22:27,416 --> 01:22:29,750
But it's urgent. You'll have
Catherine dragged through

1098
01:22:29,833 --> 01:22:32,916
- the mud by that imbecile Barbara.
- No, we're not cutting it.

1099
01:22:33,000 --> 01:22:35,708
What? Why?

1100
01:22:35,791 --> 01:22:39,125
- The info, but with no editorial.
- Let me do the editorial!

1101
01:22:39,208 --> 01:22:43,916
No Yves, not tonight!
I need more time to think it over.

1102
01:22:44,000 --> 01:22:46,041
The paper's ready,
bar the first and last pages.

1103
01:22:46,125 --> 01:22:49,583
We go to press at 10.
This job is impossible now.

1104
01:22:49,666 --> 01:22:51,958
At least look at this and listen to me!

1105
01:22:52,041 --> 01:22:55,875
- Yves, there's no rush!
- Yes, there is!

1106
01:22:58,500 --> 01:23:00,875
- Yes, sir?
- Tell my wife I'll meet her there.

1107
01:23:02,166 --> 01:23:03,666
What do you have in there?

1108
01:23:06,875 --> 01:23:10,416
Proof that the meeting between
the Prime Minister and Djavaoui took place

1109
01:23:10,500 --> 01:23:13,500
eight days ago, not two years ago,
like they want us to believe!

1110
01:23:13,583 --> 01:23:16,000
Interesting. Was this just you?

1111
01:23:16,083 --> 01:23:18,916
- For now, yes.
- Keep it fresh, and we'll see tomorrow.

1112
01:23:20,333 --> 01:23:22,750
You can't keep this fresh.

1113
01:23:23,625 --> 01:23:26,666
So we lured Djavaoui to France
and betrayed him. Is that it?

1114
01:23:26,750 --> 01:23:29,875
Let's say we neglected, in quotes,

1115
01:23:29,958 --> 01:23:32,291
to ensure his safety. Here you go.

1116
01:23:33,416 --> 01:23:37,375
- The mistake was to deny the meeting.
- It's always their first instinct.

1117
01:23:38,750 --> 01:23:43,000
Come in early tomorrow
and we'll see how we can handle this.

1118
01:23:43,083 --> 01:23:45,375
But Djavaoui, no one cares.

1119
01:23:45,458 --> 01:23:49,750
On the other hand, Catherine
against the Prime Minister is funny.

1120
01:23:58,916 --> 01:24:01,833
Hey, Yves.
I thought it was over, you and Catherine.

1121
01:24:01,916 --> 01:24:04,583
Let's just say that for once
you don't have the latest info.

1122
01:24:05,625 --> 01:24:08,875
Get an interview with Catherine.
Exclusive.

1123
01:24:13,250 --> 01:24:17,625
Catherine? Yes. Good news.

1124
01:24:17,708 --> 01:24:20,375
No, not exactly.

1125
01:24:20,458 --> 01:24:23,250
Yes. I'll explain. I'm leaving right away.

1126
01:24:42,458 --> 01:24:44,333
- Bravo!
- Yes!

1127
01:24:48,750 --> 01:24:50,916
Who says so?

1128
01:24:51,000 --> 01:24:53,375
- So you're feeling better?
- Yes, much better.

1129
01:24:53,458 --> 01:24:55,041
This will warm your hands up.

1130
01:24:55,125 --> 01:24:58,458
- Sorry, it's a little noisy tonight.
- It's okay. Give us the same thing.

1131
01:24:58,541 --> 01:25:00,041
- Be nice.
- Yes.

1132
01:25:00,125 --> 01:25:04,166
But we're gonna have fun, we'll fight.
We're gonna fight together!

1133
01:25:04,250 --> 01:25:08,041
- We'll fight against whom?
- Not against, for!

1134
01:25:08,833 --> 01:25:11,583
So that these little politicians
stop saying

1135
01:25:11,666 --> 01:25:13,625
whatever they want with impunity.

1136
01:25:14,958 --> 01:25:18,125
So that your TV friends won't live
with their heads in a noose anymore!

1137
01:25:29,083 --> 01:25:31,041
- Here you are.
- Thank you.

1138
01:25:31,875 --> 01:25:32,750
- Here.
- To honor.

1139
01:25:32,833 --> 01:25:34,541
The lost honor of Catherine Carr�.

1140
01:25:36,000 --> 01:25:37,416
You're going to get it back.

1141
01:25:38,416 --> 01:25:40,541
As poor Mar�che used to say.

1142
01:25:41,333 --> 01:25:44,750
Yes. But� Are you sure about Villechaise?

1143
01:25:46,000 --> 01:25:47,875
Ah, for a case like this, absolutely, yes.

1144
01:25:47,958 --> 01:25:50,500
As long as he has readers,
he will be a free man.

1145
01:25:50,583 --> 01:25:53,208
And since we have readers, knock on wood.

1146
01:25:53,875 --> 01:25:55,916
- You're going to go for it.
- There are two methods.

1147
01:25:56,000 --> 01:25:59,000
The photo with the headline.

1148
01:25:59,625 --> 01:26:03,291
- Shock treatment.
- Or we go slower, 10 lines,

1149
01:26:03,375 --> 01:26:06,291
""Catherine Carr�
alleges she has proof,"" etc.

1150
01:26:06,375 --> 01:26:10,000
""When questioned,
she refused to deny or confirm�""

1151
01:26:10,583 --> 01:26:12,458
That's the drip-drip method.

1152
01:26:12,541 --> 01:26:15,083
We'll see tomorrow with Villechaise,
won't we? It'll be fun.

1153
01:26:15,166 --> 01:26:19,625
A national hero, Ms. Carr�
pushes the Prime Minister to his limit!

1154
01:26:21,500 --> 01:26:24,750
- He'll never forgive me.
- Nor will his spokesperson.

1155
01:26:25,708 --> 01:26:29,333
- No network will hire me after this.
- No one anywhere.

1156
01:26:30,291 --> 01:26:34,500
And in six months�
Everyone will have forgotten me.

1157
01:26:38,583 --> 01:26:39,666
Not me.

1158
01:26:41,083 --> 01:26:42,291
Not me.

1159
01:26:45,875 --> 01:26:49,208
You are beautiful. I like you.

1160
01:26:51,333 --> 01:26:52,166
I am happy.

1161
01:26:52,250 --> 01:26:56,000
Tango, Jeannot! Tango, Jeannot!

1162
01:26:56,083 --> 01:26:57,916
Yeah!

1163
01:26:58,000 --> 01:26:59,250
Come on, let's work a little?

1164
01:27:01,541 --> 01:27:02,833
Mr. Dorget! Telephone.

1165
01:27:03,500 --> 01:27:04,791
Excuse me.

1166
01:27:19,416 --> 01:27:22,250
- Can you turn on the lights?
- Right away.

1167
01:27:22,333 --> 01:27:23,708
Go ahead, Jeannot!

1168
01:27:23,791 --> 01:27:26,708
Take the cabin on the other side.
Hold on, sir. Please hold on.

1169
01:27:26,791 --> 01:27:29,291
- Isn't that Catherine Carr�, over there?
- Yes, it is.

1170
01:27:29,375 --> 01:27:31,166
- Hello, Yves?
- Yes, I'm here, listening.

1171
01:27:31,250 --> 01:27:33,250
What are you doing in Honfleur?

1172
01:27:34,375 --> 01:27:38,333
Well, I have something to ask you,
something annoying.

1173
01:27:38,416 --> 01:27:40,708
- Something bad has happened.
- What's happened?

1174
01:27:40,791 --> 01:27:43,583
I need someone to cover Amman.
How well do you know the Middle East?

1175
01:27:43,666 --> 01:27:47,875
You scared me. I thought you didn't want
the Catherine interview anymore.

1176
01:27:47,958 --> 01:27:49,583
Sorry, go ahead.

1177
01:27:49,666 --> 01:27:52,833
- Yves, have you been drinking or what?
- I haven't been drinking.

1178
01:27:52,916 --> 01:27:54,000
You have to go to Jordan.

1179
01:28:12,166 --> 01:28:14,041
Are you Catherine Carr�?

1180
01:28:15,041 --> 01:28:16,750
- Yes.
- Yes?

1181
01:28:16,833 --> 01:28:18,333
Please�

1182
01:28:20,041 --> 01:28:22,875
Things are cracking down in Amman.
I need you to cover it.

1183
01:28:22,958 --> 01:28:25,208
- When do I leave?
- Tomorrow.

1184
01:28:25,291 --> 01:28:28,875
There's a flight at 2 pm.
I'll get you an open ticket, either way.

1185
01:28:28,958 --> 01:28:30,791
- Tomorrow? I can't.
- Why?

1186
01:28:30,875 --> 01:28:33,083
Because I'm not going
to leave Catherine right now.

1187
01:28:33,166 --> 01:28:36,250
Look, Catherine can wait!
It's not that urgent.

1188
01:28:39,166 --> 01:28:41,500
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

1189
01:28:42,958 --> 01:28:44,250
Thank you.

1190
01:28:46,125 --> 01:28:48,083
All of them?

1191
01:28:49,000 --> 01:28:50,791
For Charlotte.

1192
01:28:50,875 --> 01:28:54,166
- No, try someone else.
- I am trying, but there's no one.

1193
01:28:54,958 --> 01:28:56,958
You're such a pain in the ass.

1194
01:28:58,208 --> 01:29:00,375
But I don't care about Jordan.

1195
01:29:00,458 --> 01:29:03,958
Nobody cares about Jordan, by the way!

1196
01:29:05,375 --> 01:29:07,916
I'm bringing Catherine's interview
tomorrow.

1197
01:29:08,791 --> 01:29:10,666
Just wait and see.

1198
01:29:13,791 --> 01:29:15,916
No, it's going to make a lot of noise,
you'll see.

1199
01:29:16,000 --> 01:29:18,416
I won't see anything!
Because tomorrow you're on a plane.

1200
01:29:18,500 --> 01:29:21,416
No! No, I won't go.

1201
01:29:27,875 --> 01:29:31,250
That bastard Villechaise
wants to send me to Jordan.

1202
01:29:31,333 --> 01:29:34,000
Go ahead.
What's happening there is interesting.

1203
01:29:34,083 --> 01:29:36,333
No, I'm interested in
what's going on here.

1204
01:29:36,416 --> 01:29:38,541
Come on. First question.

1205
01:29:38,625 --> 01:29:43,333
Catherine Carr�,
did you apologize to the minister?

1206
01:29:43,916 --> 01:29:46,000
- No.
- No.

1207
01:29:46,625 --> 01:29:50,375
Do you plan to apologize publicly
when you go back on the air?

1208
01:29:50,875 --> 01:29:53,916
I will not apologize for making a mistake
that I did not make.

1209
01:29:55,583 --> 01:29:57,666
In your job, it is a mistake

1210
01:29:57,750 --> 01:30:00,125
to get a member of the government
in hot water, right?

1211
01:30:01,500 --> 01:30:04,291
He got himself into trouble
by denouncing an untruth

1212
01:30:04,375 --> 01:30:05,833
and I only rectified it.

1213
01:30:08,375 --> 01:30:11,666
You know that if you maintain
your version of events,

1214
01:30:13,583 --> 01:30:15,916
you will be fired from the newspaper?

1215
01:30:17,541 --> 01:30:19,833
- I've already taken that risk.
- Yes, that's good.

1216
01:30:20,416 --> 01:30:22,375
You have to be specific about it.

1217
01:30:23,500 --> 01:30:26,125
You're going to make a splash.
Resign, maybe.

1218
01:30:26,208 --> 01:30:28,416
No. I won't quit.

1219
01:30:29,166 --> 01:30:32,458
Anyway, you will be replaced
by someone more docile.

1220
01:30:33,000 --> 01:30:35,791
No, not ""docile"".
Don't write ""docile"". We're not docile.

1221
01:30:35,875 --> 01:30:38,958
Understanding. Is ""understanding"" okay?

1222
01:30:39,041 --> 01:30:41,666
It's up to each person to judge
how to do this kind of job.

1223
01:30:42,666 --> 01:30:44,000
Yes.

1224
01:30:45,166 --> 01:30:47,041
One of our colleagues said to me:

1225
01:30:47,833 --> 01:30:50,583
""Sometimes you have to have the courage
to be a coward.""

1226
01:30:50,666 --> 01:30:53,375
""You lower your head, the wave passes,

1227
01:30:53,458 --> 01:30:55,916
and when you get up,
you're a little dirty, and that's it.""

1228
01:30:56,458 --> 01:30:58,875
- Who told you that?
- It doesn't matter.

1229
01:30:59,958 --> 01:31:01,833
So what do you say to that?

1230
01:31:01,916 --> 01:31:05,916
- You need something snappy.
- ""The courage to be a coward�""

1231
01:31:09,625 --> 01:31:11,541
I should have had that.

1232
01:31:12,375 --> 01:31:14,166
That's not going to work at all.

1233
01:31:15,666 --> 01:31:16,666
What's wrong with it?

1234
01:31:17,583 --> 01:31:19,750
Well, because it sound like
you regret what you did!

1235
01:31:21,125 --> 01:31:23,833
Yes, but I do regret it,
what do you think?

1236
01:31:23,916 --> 01:31:27,500
That I should congratulate myself?
It's the biggest mistake of my life.

1237
01:31:28,125 --> 01:31:32,125
I had everything.
Everything that makes me happy.

1238
01:31:32,708 --> 01:31:36,166
And to� I don't know, to impress you, to�

1239
01:31:36,875 --> 01:31:38,666
Playing the vestal virgin of the news,

1240
01:31:38,750 --> 01:31:41,875
to the hardcore journalist,
to be harder and purer than you,

1241
01:31:41,958 --> 01:31:44,833
I just screwed everything up.

1242
01:31:47,291 --> 01:31:50,333
Yes. I regret it, yes.

1243
01:31:53,166 --> 01:31:54,458
No, that's not true.

1244
01:31:56,250 --> 01:31:57,708
You want my truth, right?

1245
01:31:59,750 --> 01:32:03,166
Well, that's the truth.

1246
01:32:05,833 --> 01:32:07,208
Catherine!

1247
01:32:22,791 --> 01:32:25,125
If I could fix it everything, I would.

1248
01:32:28,416 --> 01:32:29,583
I'd get on hands and knees.

1249
01:32:31,375 --> 01:32:35,250
- You would?
- Yes.

1250
01:32:35,750 --> 01:32:40,166
Don't give me a lesson in virtue,
I'm not willing to hear it.

1251
01:32:43,125 --> 01:32:44,833
I am unhappy, Yves.

1252
01:32:47,833 --> 01:32:49,291
I am unhappy.

1253
01:33:12,208 --> 01:33:16,041
Here. With this,

1254
01:33:17,416 --> 01:33:19,458
you've got the minister
by the short hairs.

1255
01:33:21,041 --> 01:33:22,416
If you want to negotiate.

1256
01:33:25,166 --> 01:33:28,750
Tell him you'll give up the tape
as long as you get your job back.

1257
01:33:29,916 --> 01:33:32,833
You can even ask for a raise
while you're at it.

1258
01:33:36,000 --> 01:33:37,625
That's called blackmail.

1259
01:33:39,958 --> 01:33:41,791
It's tried and true.

1260
01:34:00,041 --> 01:34:01,750
Yves, come on.

1261
01:34:03,791 --> 01:34:05,875
If you leave now, Catherine,
we will never see each other again.

1262
01:34:06,458 --> 01:34:07,791
We will.

1263
01:34:09,083 --> 01:34:09,958
No.

1264
01:34:11,416 --> 01:34:12,375
Never.

1265
01:35:23,750 --> 01:35:25,458
Can you give me a ride?

1266
01:35:26,583 --> 01:35:28,208
- Where are you going?
- To Jordan.

1267
01:35:28,291 --> 01:35:30,750
- I'm not headed that way.
- To Paris. Is that okay?

1268
01:35:30,833 --> 01:35:31,708
Get in.

1269
01:35:41,041 --> 01:35:44,083
- The news? Are you interested?
- Yes.

1270
01:35:45,750 --> 01:35:50,458
In Brussels, the representatives
of Nuremberg have not yet agreed�

1271
01:35:52,583 --> 01:35:55,750
Another terrorist attack in Beirut,
a bomb explodes in the city center�

1272
01:35:55,833 --> 01:35:57,625
I hope it's calmer in Jordan.

1273
01:35:59,208 --> 01:36:03,666
In a statement, Matignon said
that the Catherine Carr� case is closed.

1274
01:36:03,750 --> 01:36:07,333
The management of the channel
confirms that the popular journalist

1275
01:36:07,416 --> 01:36:12,000
will tell on air tonight
how she was victim of an impostor.

1276
01:36:12,083 --> 01:36:14,250
What does that mean, an impostor?

1277
01:36:15,083 --> 01:36:18,916
An impostor is a man who tries
to pass himself off as something he isn't.

1278

A man� or a woman.

00:04:15,429 --> 00:04:18,083
Hello and welcome

2
00:04:18,258 --> 00:04:21,173
to the history of gardening.
In this video,

3
00:04:21,348 --> 00:04:23,268
I will show you how to build
a garden of your own

4
00:04:23,350 --> 00:04:25,787
by using techniques
from thousands of years ago.

5
00:04:26,614 --> 00:04:27,702
Let us begin.

6
00:04:28,180 --> 00:04:29,660
In 10,000 BC...

7
00:04:39,322 --> 00:04:41,411
Attention, Private.

8
00:04:41,585 --> 00:04:44,022
You're about to learn
the history of the US Military,

9
00:04:44,196 --> 00:04:47,809
the meanest, the baddest, the most
powerful military the world has ever seen.

10
00:04:47,983 --> 00:04:49,419
Time to untuck your manhood.

11
00:04:49,593 --> 00:04:51,203
Listen up,
you miserable son of a...

12
00:05:07,263 --> 00:05:11,398
Welcome to the history
of proctology.

13
00:06:13,503 --> 00:06:17,377
What is the history
of metal and horror?

14
00:06:18,203 --> 00:06:19,596
Let's find out.

15
00:06:35,395 --> 00:06:39,224
Throughout this film,
we will examine the origins

16
00:06:39,399 --> 00:06:42,053
of both heavy metal and horror,

17
00:06:42,750 --> 00:06:46,406
and how the two ultimately
became intertwined.

18
00:06:47,058 --> 00:06:50,192
Have you ever noticed
how fans of metal,

19
00:06:50,366 --> 00:06:51,672
more often than not,

20
00:06:52,194 --> 00:06:55,066
are also fans of horror,
and vice versa.

21
00:06:55,632 --> 00:06:57,504
With the help of some friends,

22
00:06:57,678 --> 00:07:00,507
we will dig deep
into these genres

23
00:07:00,681 --> 00:07:03,597
and uncover their roots
and evolution.

24
00:07:04,162 --> 00:07:06,600
In order to understand
how this all began,

25
00:07:06,774 --> 00:07:09,254
let us step into the darkness

26
00:07:09,429 --> 00:07:13,345
and explore
the history of horror.

27
00:07:14,782 --> 00:07:16,871
All cultures value storytelling.

28
00:07:17,045 --> 00:07:18,394
Storytelling is one of our,

29
00:07:18,568 --> 00:07:20,614
our major impulses
as human beings.

30
00:07:20,788 --> 00:07:22,920
There are also the dark side,
the tales,

31
00:07:23,094 --> 00:07:24,792
the warnings
that we need to share,

32
00:07:24,966 --> 00:07:26,446
the verboten,
""We must not go there.""

33
00:07:26,620 --> 00:07:29,057
Even in the pictographs,

34
00:07:29,231 --> 00:07:32,626
as far back as we could go,
were horror stories.

35
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:35,324
As long as
there has been storytelling,

36
00:07:35,498 --> 00:07:40,111
people have used monsters to
explain things they don't understand

37
00:07:40,285 --> 00:07:43,245
and to express things they
don't know how to articulate.

38
00:07:43,419 --> 00:07:47,989
If the Bible is a base text for
most of European civilization,

39
00:07:48,163 --> 00:07:52,036
we've wanted the same kind of
mix of, like, horror and gore,

40
00:07:52,210 --> 00:07:55,126
as well as morally
uplifting stuff ever since.

41
00:07:55,300 --> 00:07:58,478
The dark side
of we, what we have,

42
00:07:58,652 --> 00:08:01,742
that's an internal part of us,
started to externalize it.

43
00:08:01,916 --> 00:08:05,180
And characters became
the dark side.

44
00:08:05,354 --> 00:08:10,098
It all stems
from Greek classical tragedy,

45
00:08:10,707 --> 00:08:15,538
and splits off
into Roman melodrama,

46
00:08:15,712 --> 00:08:20,021
then up through
Medieval morality plays

47
00:08:20,195 --> 00:08:23,067
into Elizabethan
revenge tragedy,

48
00:08:23,241 --> 00:08:27,245
then into Edwardian times
where they write melodramas.

49
00:08:27,419 --> 00:08:30,945
One of the ways in which you can
talk about very real things

50
00:08:31,772 --> 00:08:35,906
or very controversial things
is to dress them up as monsters.

51
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:41,129
So, you get
to Frankenstein, 1818,

52
00:08:41,303 --> 00:08:43,697
And in one sense,
it's a very literal story

53
00:08:43,871 --> 00:08:47,614
about a guy
who stitches together

54
00:08:47,788 --> 00:08:51,269
another being
out of corpse parts,

55
00:08:51,443 --> 00:08:55,970
and runs a huge jolt of electricity
through him, and creates a monster.

56
00:08:56,144 --> 00:08:59,321
The Strange Case Of Dr. Jekyll
and Mr. Hyde is published in 1886,

57
00:08:59,495 --> 00:09:03,847
which is five years after the
Ripper murders had terrorized

58
00:09:04,021 --> 00:09:06,763
not just London
but the whole world.

59
00:09:06,937 --> 00:09:10,506
Jack the Ripper is the archetype
of all subsequent slashers.

60
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:12,987
Name me a slasher movie
that doesn't draw

61
00:09:13,161 --> 00:09:16,207
on some aspect of,
of Jack the Ripper.

62
00:09:16,381 --> 00:09:21,256
And, of course, Bram Stoker was the
theater impresario who put that on stage.

63
00:09:21,430 --> 00:09:22,953
Bram Stoker'sDracula,

64
00:09:23,606 --> 00:09:26,435
not the first vampire story
by any means.

65
00:09:26,609 --> 00:09:28,916
You've had things
like Varney the Vampire,

66
00:09:29,090 --> 00:09:32,397
which was part of a
penny-dreadful story that came out.

67
00:09:32,572 --> 00:09:35,487
But Bram Stoker broke
really new ground,

68
00:09:35,662 --> 00:09:37,577
uh, by using old tropes.

69
00:09:37,751 --> 00:09:42,277
Film then was the natural place
to take over.

70
00:09:42,451 --> 00:09:45,497
In silent films,
and then in talkies.

71
00:09:45,672 --> 00:09:50,590
That structure
of how is the good guy

72
00:09:50,764 --> 00:09:52,853
gonna defeat the externalization

73
00:09:53,027 --> 00:09:54,898
of what the dark side in him

74
00:09:55,072 --> 00:09:57,292
in a character
has been realized?

75
00:09:57,466 --> 00:09:59,424
We can hate that person,

76
00:09:59,599 --> 00:10:03,211
who is really ourselves
externalized.

77
00:10:04,168 --> 00:10:07,519
That's the structure
of melodrama and horror.

78
00:10:07,694 --> 00:10:12,612
So much of it to me is the art direction,
and that's what those films were.

79
00:10:12,786 --> 00:10:15,155
You know, because for me, in
those films, that's what determines

80
00:10:15,179 --> 00:10:17,138
what makes them classic
and what doesn't.

81
00:10:21,011 --> 00:10:25,059
Well, of course, uh, my
great-grandfather being Lon Chaney Sr.

82
00:10:25,233 --> 00:10:29,063
Was very well renowned
in the horror genre.

83
00:10:29,237 --> 00:10:31,500
You can look at him,
and you see his influence

84
00:10:31,674 --> 00:10:33,676
all over Hollywood
even to this day.

85
00:10:33,850 --> 00:10:37,201
And he was the founding father
of the entire genre.

86
00:10:37,375 --> 00:10:41,510
In early 1930s, you have the very famous
versions of Draculaand Frankenstein,

87
00:10:41,684 --> 00:10:45,775
which set the look of the
monsters for generations to come.

88
00:10:45,949 --> 00:10:49,953
The character Dracula described
by Bram Stoker in his book

89
00:10:50,127 --> 00:10:53,827
was a, a horrific,
ugly kind of a being.

90
00:10:54,349 --> 00:10:57,134
Whereas my father brought
his own interpretation.

91
00:10:57,308 --> 00:10:59,702
He did his own makeup,
his mode of dress,

92
00:10:59,876 --> 00:11:03,053
his form of speech, his eyes.

93
00:11:03,227 --> 00:11:06,840
My dad's portrayal really
inspired a whole movement.

94
00:11:07,014 --> 00:11:10,713
The Goth movement has got even
carried over into the music world

95
00:11:10,887 --> 00:11:12,672
with, for example, Bauhaus.

96
00:11:12,846 --> 00:11:16,632
It was, uh, you know,
a dark, sinister,

97
00:11:16,806 --> 00:11:19,156
evil personification

98
00:11:19,983 --> 00:11:25,206
that crossed both worlds
from the films to music.

99
00:11:25,380 --> 00:11:28,644
And the same with Frankenstein
and Boris Karloff.

100
00:11:28,818 --> 00:11:31,865
You have the square head,
you have the bolts in the neck,

101
00:11:32,039 --> 00:11:34,432
the ragged coat that comes down

102
00:11:34,606 --> 00:11:38,480
because his arms are clearly taken
from somebody with very long arms.

103
00:11:38,654 --> 00:11:41,483
It was so different

104
00:11:41,657 --> 00:11:45,182
from anything the audiences
had ever seen before.

105
00:11:45,356 --> 00:11:48,272
It was startling.
Pushed so many envelopes.

106
00:11:48,446 --> 00:11:50,144
It was mesmerizing
because, you know,

107
00:11:50,318 --> 00:11:52,755
that film has
no music whatsoever.

108
00:11:52,929 --> 00:11:54,801
Only in the beginning
and in the end.

109
00:11:54,975 --> 00:11:57,542
And so when you really,
really think about it,

110
00:11:57,717 --> 00:12:01,895
it's a very, like,
empty-sounding film, you know,

111
00:12:02,069 --> 00:12:03,723
and I was intrigued by that.

112
00:12:03,897 --> 00:12:05,986
It just sucked me in, and I,

113
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:08,553
I've just been in,
in this world ever since.

114
00:12:08,728 --> 00:12:12,514
I like the scene where the
little girl gives him the flower,

115
00:12:12,688 --> 00:12:16,170
and then he picks her up and
fucking hums her. I love that.

116
00:12:16,344 --> 00:12:20,261
I like the moment that he
realizes that he's a fucking monster,

117
00:12:20,435 --> 00:12:23,351
and that he's been reanimated
and forced to live.

118
00:12:23,525 --> 00:12:25,919
That's how we feel,
forced to live.

119
00:12:26,484 --> 00:12:29,270
And then, of course,
Chaney Jr. did The Wolf Man.

120
00:12:29,444 --> 00:12:33,535
And so, it was this wonderful
chain of horror films

121
00:12:33,709 --> 00:12:38,192
that captured the imagination
of film fans around the world.

122
00:12:38,366 --> 00:12:41,108
When Gramps would talk
about The Wolf Man,

123
00:12:41,282 --> 00:12:44,894
or roles that he would play, I
always thought they were so cool

124
00:12:45,068 --> 00:12:46,983
because he was
such a wonderful storyteller.

125
00:12:47,157 --> 00:12:49,037
People asked him,
""What was your favorite role?""

126
00:12:49,072 --> 00:12:50,900
And of course,
I think The Wolf Man

127
00:12:51,074 --> 00:12:53,250
has to come first
for me personally,

128
00:12:53,424 --> 00:12:57,124
It was a role meant
for my grandfather to make.

129
00:12:57,298 --> 00:13:01,302
My favorites by far, if anybody
knows me, it's the Universal Monsters.

130
00:13:01,476 --> 00:13:02,956
That's my whole life.

131
00:13:03,130 --> 00:13:05,523
Dracula, Frankenstein,
Invisible Man,

132
00:13:05,697 --> 00:13:10,093
The Mummy, Creature, Wolf Man.
I love those series.

133
00:13:10,267 --> 00:13:14,097
But I loved all the classic, uh,
Universal Monster movies that I saw.

134
00:13:14,271 --> 00:13:16,186
I love the Creature
from the Black Lagoon.

135
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:18,188
Love the giant monster movies.

136
00:13:18,362 --> 00:13:21,191
They're awesome.
Tarantula, that kind of thing.

137
00:13:21,670 --> 00:13:25,369
I, at first, really didn't know
what to make of horror movies.

138
00:13:25,543 --> 00:13:28,895
I was very frightened.
But in later years,

139
00:13:29,721 --> 00:13:33,900
I've got to really enjoy
the '50s creature movies.

140
00:13:34,074 --> 00:13:37,599
My favorite of that time
was probably Them!

141
00:13:38,469 --> 00:13:39,949
You know, about giant ants.

142
00:13:40,123 --> 00:13:42,691
So I first started
getting interested in horror

143
00:13:42,865 --> 00:13:46,608
because I really was engaged
in those kind of creature movies

144
00:13:46,782 --> 00:13:49,306
and those kind of Atomic Age
fear movies.

145
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:52,919
Are Japanese monster movies
considered horror films?

146
00:13:53,093 --> 00:13:56,748
'Cause that's, that's, that's
where my heart, true heart lies.

147
00:13:56,923 --> 00:14:00,187
It's like Godzilla
Vs. King Kongand stuff.

148
00:14:00,361 --> 00:14:02,754
- Yeah.
- -Just all the, like, model type of scenes

149
00:14:02,929 --> 00:14:07,020
and guys in lizard suits,
I love that stuff.

150
00:14:10,110 --> 00:14:12,939
With the evolution
of teen culture in the 1950s,

151
00:14:13,113 --> 00:14:16,203
you had, for the first time,
forms of entertainment

152
00:14:16,377 --> 00:14:18,509
that were unique
to young people.

153
00:14:18,683 --> 00:14:23,297
And I don't think it was for almost
20 years or a generation after that,

154
00:14:23,471 --> 00:14:26,648
the people really realized
the amount of room they had

155
00:14:26,822 --> 00:14:28,650
to spread out
and express themselves.

156
00:14:28,824 --> 00:14:31,435
One of the things that also
develops in the 1950s in the UK

157
00:14:31,609 --> 00:14:33,350
is the Hammer House of Horror.

158
00:14:33,524 --> 00:14:37,441
Nobody has quite mastered
branding like Hammer did.

159
00:14:37,615 --> 00:14:40,880
Like, if you see
Hammer House of Horror

160
00:14:43,926 --> 00:14:45,797
on a movie,
you know what you're getting.

161
00:14:45,972 --> 00:14:47,688
Curse Of Frankenstein,
and Teenage Frankenstein,

162
00:14:47,712 --> 00:14:49,560
and I would watch them,
of course, covering my face,

163
00:14:49,584 --> 00:14:51,934
but I had to see what
Frankenstein looked like, you know.

164
00:14:52,108 --> 00:14:55,329
My introduction to horror
came through Hammer.

165
00:14:55,503 --> 00:14:59,768
So that was my introduction,
really, to Dracula and Frankenstein,

166
00:15:00,551 --> 00:15:02,989
and then kind of
worked backwards

167
00:15:03,163 --> 00:15:07,428
discovering the, the classic Universal
movies, um, subsequent to that.

168
00:15:11,388 --> 00:15:13,390
You can't really talk
about horror

169
00:15:13,564 --> 00:15:15,653
without talking about
Hitchcock and Psycho.

170
00:15:15,827 --> 00:15:18,700
It helps set the paradigm
for our subsequent obsession

171
00:15:18,874 --> 00:15:20,093
with serial killers in film.

172
00:15:20,267 --> 00:15:21,964
I always loved Hitchcock.

173
00:15:22,138 --> 00:15:24,575
I thought that
his stuff was amazing

174
00:15:24,749 --> 00:15:27,056
because, you know,
there was, uh, attention

175
00:15:27,230 --> 00:15:31,539
to the, uh, just the whole
story line that, you know...

176
00:15:31,713 --> 00:15:35,064
Like, the Bates Motel,
you know, it was a creepy hotel.

177
00:15:35,238 --> 00:15:39,286
Dude's mom's dead, and, you know,
he cross-dresses and kills people.

178
00:15:39,460 --> 00:15:42,289
That's really cool when you can
have a story that's that simple.

179
00:15:42,463 --> 00:15:45,770
They did such a good job
in the early days of, mm,

180
00:15:45,945 --> 00:15:49,252
you know, ""Don't come if you
have a problem with your heart,""

181
00:15:49,426 --> 00:15:51,863
and these great gimmicks
about that, you know,

182
00:15:52,038 --> 00:15:54,605
""There will be a nurse
in attendance, and...""

183
00:15:54,779 --> 00:15:56,129
Of course, that sucked us in.

184
00:15:56,303 --> 00:15:58,479
You know,
we wanted to go see that.

185
00:15:59,045 --> 00:16:01,656
They're coming
to get you, Barbara.

186
00:16:01,830 --> 00:16:04,374
Towards the tail end of the '60s,
you have Night Of The Living Dead,

187
00:16:04,398 --> 00:16:06,139
and it's a terrifying movie.

188
00:16:06,313 --> 00:16:09,403
Not only because it introduces
a new type of monster,

189
00:16:09,577 --> 00:16:14,799
but because it suggests
that we as human beings,

190
00:16:14,974 --> 00:16:16,976
at some point,
we'll lose agency,

191
00:16:17,150 --> 00:16:18,716
we'll lose sentience.

192
00:16:18,890 --> 00:16:21,371
Jesus Christ. It's, like,
right in your face, like...

193
00:16:21,545 --> 00:16:23,721
Which is not typical
of a black and white movie.

194
00:16:23,895 --> 00:16:26,309
You just sort of, ""Oh, it's black and
white. It's probably going to be slow.

195
00:16:26,333 --> 00:16:27,813
I've heard it's great,
but we'll see.""

196
00:16:27,856 --> 00:16:29,466
And then it just explodes.
You know,

197
00:16:29,640 --> 00:16:31,680
like, ""Holy fuck."" You know,
and it's just, it's on.

198
00:16:31,773 --> 00:16:34,384
Zombies weren't very frightening

199
00:16:34,558 --> 00:16:36,212
until we made
Night Of The Living Dead.

200
00:16:36,386 --> 00:16:38,432
You've lost a loved one,

201
00:16:38,606 --> 00:16:42,262
but now that loved one's out
to get you, actually devour you.

202
00:16:42,436 --> 00:16:45,743
And if you get bitten by one,
you can turn into one.

203
00:16:45,917 --> 00:16:51,184
In a way, it combines the
vampire myth and the zombie myth.

204
00:16:51,358 --> 00:16:53,490
We saw a lot of horror stories,

205
00:16:53,664 --> 00:16:55,971
like, during the,
the war in Nam.

206
00:16:56,145 --> 00:16:58,147
It was a big time
for horror films,

207
00:16:58,321 --> 00:17:01,672
and that all came out of that Nam
period and our return from Nam.

208
00:17:01,846 --> 00:17:04,216
Blood and destruction on television
had become so commonplace

209
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:06,088
that it couldn't help
but make it into the films.

210
00:17:06,112 --> 00:17:08,549
And I think
that had a profound effect

211
00:17:08,723 --> 00:17:12,944
on why horror gets so gory
in the 1970s.

212
00:17:13,119 --> 00:17:16,339
Because people have seen it
in the real world.

213
00:17:16,513 --> 00:17:18,167
My two favorite movies are

214
00:17:18,341 --> 00:17:19,951
Texas Chainsaw Massacre
I and II.

215
00:17:20,126 --> 00:17:22,389
I just remember this scene
in Texas Chainsaw

216
00:17:22,563 --> 00:17:24,130
when, when, uh,

217
00:17:24,782 --> 00:17:27,568
what I believe is Kurt or
whatever is going into the house,

218
00:17:27,742 --> 00:17:30,179
and he just whacks him
in the head as...

219
00:17:30,353 --> 00:17:33,617
And he just falls. You see
his legs kicking. Hits him again.

220
00:17:33,791 --> 00:17:36,577
And this, the slamming
of that door was just like,

221
00:17:36,751 --> 00:17:40,189
""What the fuck was that?""

222
00:17:40,363 --> 00:17:42,931
Leatherface and his situation
are kind of emblematic

223
00:17:43,105 --> 00:17:45,760
of extreme elements in life,

224
00:17:45,934 --> 00:17:48,241
and that may be part
of his appeal.

225
00:17:48,415 --> 00:17:52,462
In a way, Chainsaw Massacre
is about the end of the world,

226
00:17:52,636 --> 00:17:56,553
and I think that might be
part of Leatherface

227
00:17:56,727 --> 00:18:00,731
and Chainsaw Massacre'sappeal
in heavy metal.

228
00:18:00,905 --> 00:18:03,778
That it really is apocalyptic,

229
00:18:03,952 --> 00:18:06,520
and Leatherface
is an apocalyptic character,

230
00:18:06,694 --> 00:18:10,263
and I think there,
you begin to see an overlap

231
00:18:10,437 --> 00:18:12,700
in the interests
of a lot of heavy metal music.

232
00:18:12,874 --> 00:18:15,877
The Exorcist.
I was both kind of

233
00:18:16,051 --> 00:18:17,618
terrified by it
and shocked by it,

234
00:18:17,792 --> 00:18:21,187
and, and, uh, moved, uh,
disturbed, and compelled.

235
00:18:21,361 --> 00:18:23,580
Totally wanted to see more.

236
00:18:23,754 --> 00:18:26,670
Just the, the tone of it
and the denigration

237
00:18:26,844 --> 00:18:29,238
of the priest by Regan
and all of that.

238
00:18:29,412 --> 00:18:31,675
Just the way she looked, man.
It was just fucked up.

239
00:18:31,849 --> 00:18:35,114
You know what I mean? And
her voice, it was just, it was scary.

240
00:18:35,288 --> 00:18:37,203
I don't know.
I think it scared everybody.

241
00:18:39,683 --> 00:18:44,340
My mom took me to see the
original Jaws when I was really young,

242
00:18:44,514 --> 00:18:47,822
and it scarred me for life.

243
00:18:47,996 --> 00:18:52,000
It traumatized me. I mean, I
was f... I was fucked because I...

244
00:18:53,219 --> 00:18:55,980
Even in a pool, at that... and when I
was younger, I was, like, freaking out.

245
00:18:56,004 --> 00:18:58,124
""It's like a fucking pool.
Like, what's gonna happen?""

246
00:18:58,180 --> 00:19:00,878
But I don't know. It's just weird
the way it just did that to me.

247
00:19:01,052 --> 00:19:04,317
Like, that first scene when she
goes out swimming in the night,

248
00:19:04,491 --> 00:19:06,145
yeah, that never left me.
So that was a...

249
00:19:07,494 --> 00:19:09,452
That's one fear
that I still have.

250
00:19:09,626 --> 00:19:11,237
The first VHS tape
I ever had to have

251
00:19:11,411 --> 00:19:12,194
was Dawn Of The Dead,

252
00:19:12,368 --> 00:19:13,368
and I used to let it play

253
00:19:13,456 --> 00:19:14,849
over and over all day long.

254
00:19:15,023 --> 00:19:16,938
I must have watched it
thousands of times.

255
00:19:17,112 --> 00:19:18,853
It was always on,

256
00:19:19,027 --> 00:19:21,638
and I don't know why
that gave me such comfort,

257
00:19:21,812 --> 00:19:24,859
just having Dawn Of The Dead
playing constantly, but it did.

258
00:19:25,033 --> 00:19:30,081
Dawn Of The Deadwas, you know, like, one of
the big first splatter fest involving zombies.

259
00:19:30,256 --> 00:19:32,475
I mean, now, I mean,
everything is zombies.

260
00:19:32,649 --> 00:19:35,130
This is...
Now we're in the zombie decade.

261
00:19:35,304 --> 00:19:37,848
Uh, a lot of it has to do with the
number one show on television,

262
00:19:37,872 --> 00:19:40,614
Walking Dead,
with my protégé, Greg Nicotero.

263
00:19:40,788 --> 00:19:44,835
So that, obviously,
is an influence of my stuff.

264
00:19:45,009 --> 00:19:48,143
Phantasm. The first one really
left an impression on me.

265
00:19:48,317 --> 00:19:50,319
But the part
that scared me the most,

266
00:19:50,493 --> 00:19:52,800
'cause I didn't, um, understand,

267
00:19:52,974 --> 00:19:55,213
and when it was explained
to me, it, like, kind of hit home.

268
00:19:55,237 --> 00:19:56,978
The ball goes
in the guy's forehead,

269
00:19:57,152 --> 00:19:58,936
and it drills in,
and he falls down.

270
00:19:59,110 --> 00:20:01,939
I mean, he's obviously dead.
But they show him that he pees.

271
00:20:03,245 --> 00:20:06,117
And then I asked,
like, ""Why is he peeing?""

272
00:20:06,292 --> 00:20:08,511
He said, ""Well, you release
your bowels after you die.""

273
00:20:09,686 --> 00:20:13,473
I was like, ""Well, I'm gonna
shit my pants when, when I die.""

274
00:20:13,647 --> 00:20:15,668
That's terrifying. That scared
the bejesus out of me.

275
00:20:15,692 --> 00:20:17,955
That was just more evidence
of actual death.

276
00:20:18,129 --> 00:20:20,567
The Omen. The first, um...
Both of them were really good,

277
00:20:20,741 --> 00:20:23,352
but I like the one with
Gregory Peck and Lee Remick.

278
00:20:23,526 --> 00:20:26,268
I thought that the story
was really well written

279
00:20:26,442 --> 00:20:31,012
and very, very scary
and very evil and creepy.

280
00:20:31,186 --> 00:20:33,536
The Omen, that was the only one

281
00:20:33,710 --> 00:20:36,931
that really made me
have some, uh, nightmares

282
00:20:37,105 --> 00:20:39,150
as, uh, as far as
I can remember.

283
00:20:39,325 --> 00:20:43,111
The, uh, connection
with horror and myself

284
00:20:43,285 --> 00:20:46,201
really does start
with Halloween, you know,

285
00:20:46,375 --> 00:20:49,030
in terms of any active interest
in the genre.

286
00:20:49,204 --> 00:20:52,860
I don't think they had any idea
how big Myers himself would be.

287
00:20:53,034 --> 00:20:55,428
That character
has become pretty big.

288
00:20:55,602 --> 00:20:58,692
It's a hell of a franchise, and
I'm proud to be a part of it.

289
00:20:58,866 --> 00:21:02,565
Michael Myers, uh,
became a famous creature

290
00:21:02,739 --> 00:21:05,307
because he wore a mask, and
because he was completely evil.

291
00:21:05,481 --> 00:21:06,917
He's really a simple character.

292
00:21:07,091 --> 00:21:09,659
He doesn't have
much of a backstory

293
00:21:09,833 --> 00:21:11,357
to land the movies that I did.

294
00:21:11,531 --> 00:21:14,273
He is just a force of evil
out to get you.

295
00:21:14,447 --> 00:21:18,364
The idea of an expressionless,
blank, uh, human being

296
00:21:18,538 --> 00:21:20,931
is really pretty devastating.

297
00:21:21,105 --> 00:21:22,977
It is almost like,
""What is he thinking?

298
00:21:23,151 --> 00:21:26,023
What's going on
in that strange person's brain

299
00:21:26,197 --> 00:21:29,026
that we can't decipher,
'cause we can't look inside.""

300
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:31,246
Alien, when it came out,

301
00:21:31,420 --> 00:21:33,204
you didn't see
much of the monster.

302
00:21:33,988 --> 00:21:36,904
But it was all
the build up to it.

303
00:21:37,078 --> 00:21:39,167
And then landing on that planet,

304
00:21:39,341 --> 00:21:41,212
and then the Facehugger,

305
00:21:41,387 --> 00:21:43,432
that, that scared
the shit out of me.

306
00:21:43,606 --> 00:21:45,652
The movie
that affected me the most,

307
00:21:46,305 --> 00:21:49,612
that I actually jumped out
of my chair was Salem's Lot.

308
00:21:50,744 --> 00:21:53,312
And I'm watching it, and they
keep talking about Mr. Barlow.

309
00:21:53,486 --> 00:21:56,271
Three quarters through the
movie, you don't see Mr. Barlow,

310
00:21:56,445 --> 00:22:00,841
and then all of a sudden,
the entire scream is Barlow.

311
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:05,062
And it's the most evil-looking
vampire of all time.

312
00:22:05,236 --> 00:22:08,892
The '80s has to be possibly
the greatest era of horror,

313
00:22:09,066 --> 00:22:13,723
because you have a lot of great
minds working within the genre.

314
00:22:13,897 --> 00:22:18,554
You have amazing advances in special
effects, which mean that you could...

315
00:22:18,728 --> 00:22:22,732
Literally, something like
The Thing, which is '82,

316
00:22:22,906 --> 00:22:27,128
shows stuff that people
had never even imagined.

317
00:22:27,302 --> 00:22:31,088
Rob Bottin's effects were just
so ahead of their time,

318
00:22:31,262 --> 00:22:34,657
and still to this day, probably
the best practical makeup

319
00:22:34,831 --> 00:22:36,224
ever done in a movie.

320
00:22:36,398 --> 00:22:38,400
One scene I remember
from my childhood was

321
00:22:38,574 --> 00:22:42,012
um, in The Thing, the thing
is eating, um, the dogs,

322
00:22:42,186 --> 00:22:45,712
and to me, I, I saw that,
and it was so horrifying

323
00:22:45,886 --> 00:22:48,802
as a child to see
that kind of, you know, carnage.

324
00:22:48,976 --> 00:22:50,369
The Shining, man.

325
00:22:51,239 --> 00:22:55,417
My God, that film
is a lesson in isolation

326
00:22:55,896 --> 00:23:00,161
and how maddening
your, your, your mind can go

327
00:23:00,335 --> 00:23:04,165
when you're just completely cut
off from outside stimuli, you know,

328
00:23:04,339 --> 00:23:05,862
and you're left
to your own devices

329
00:23:06,036 --> 00:23:08,604
in this fucking monstrous,

330
00:23:08,778 --> 00:23:12,086
basically just a fucking castle,
you know.

331
00:23:12,956 --> 00:23:14,523
Anyone would go fucking mad.

332
00:23:14,697 --> 00:23:17,265
When they first realize,
you know, that he's losing...

333
00:23:17,439 --> 00:23:18,875
You first see it in the film.

334
00:23:19,049 --> 00:23:22,139
You know, he's, he's going,
his mind is gone.

335
00:23:22,313 --> 00:23:24,054
You know, and it's like
he's sitting there.

336
00:23:24,228 --> 00:23:26,293
- And then she starts thumbing...
- That's too much like real life.

337
00:23:26,317 --> 00:23:28,668
Thumbing through the shit,
you know.

338
00:23:28,842 --> 00:23:31,642
""All work and no play,"" like, you
know, the big stack, and you're like,

339
00:23:31,801 --> 00:23:35,283
""Oh, it's on now, man,""
you know.

340
00:23:35,457 --> 00:23:37,522
'Cause that is... it has to be
one of the greatest movies

341
00:23:37,546 --> 00:23:39,156
ever made from every aspect.

342
00:23:39,330 --> 00:23:40,525
You know, the actors,
and the casting,

343
00:23:40,549 --> 00:23:41,709
and the photo and everything.

344
00:23:41,811 --> 00:23:43,422
- Yeah.
- But still I meet people,

345
00:23:43,596 --> 00:23:45,756
when people don't dig it,
I find it hard to trust them.

346
00:23:45,902 --> 00:23:47,600
Yeah.

347
00:23:47,774 --> 00:23:49,471
The Shininghas
this cult following,

348
00:23:49,645 --> 00:23:50,820
which is great.

349
00:23:50,994 --> 00:23:52,953
I feel fortunate
to have been in it.

350
00:23:53,127 --> 00:23:55,521
And, uh, I guess,
my guess would be that

351
00:23:55,695 --> 00:23:58,480
it was probably playing on cable
when all those guys were kids.

352
00:23:58,654 --> 00:24:03,180
And so, they were probably
frightened by it like many other people.

353
00:24:03,354 --> 00:24:05,531
The third Omenmovie,
when he's in the, in the room

354
00:24:05,705 --> 00:24:07,228
with the statue of Jesus.

355
00:24:08,229 --> 00:24:11,450
""Show man instead the raptures
of Thy kingdom."" Oh, it's so...

356
00:24:11,624 --> 00:24:13,843
Ooh, when he puts his hands
on the thing, and it bleeds,

357
00:24:14,017 --> 00:24:16,897
and they make the, the blood, you
know, symbolize Jesus crying, whatever.

358
00:24:17,368 --> 00:24:20,371
Oh, I would have just let him
wi... the anti-Christ win.

359
00:24:20,546 --> 00:24:22,591
Halloween III,
Season Of The Witch.

360
00:24:22,765 --> 00:24:24,165
And people
either love it or hate it

361
00:24:24,201 --> 00:24:25,681
because it doesn't have
Michael Myers.

362
00:24:25,768 --> 00:24:27,335
But that didn't bother me at all

363
00:24:27,509 --> 00:24:28,989
when I was a kid,
I was so young,

364
00:24:29,163 --> 00:24:31,252
I wasn't kind of expecting
to see Michael Myers.

365
00:24:31,426 --> 00:24:33,515
And I look at it
as a separate movie.

366
00:24:33,689 --> 00:24:35,386
As a movie, a standalone movie.

367
00:24:35,561 --> 00:24:37,084
Halloween Illis incredible.

368
00:24:37,258 --> 00:24:39,739
And I always liked it
as a standalone movie.

369
00:24:39,913 --> 00:24:42,481
Not because I was the assassin
ripping people's heads off

370
00:24:42,655 --> 00:24:44,570
mind you, but, anyway...

371
00:24:44,744 --> 00:24:48,051
Evil Dead Part I, Sam Raimi.

372
00:24:49,531 --> 00:24:50,967
Atmosphere,

373
00:24:51,794 --> 00:24:53,100
attitude,

374
00:24:53,274 --> 00:24:55,885
gore, soundtrack,

375
00:24:56,059 --> 00:24:58,366
hands down, got to be...

376
00:25:03,023 --> 00:25:05,504
the The Black Rainbow of horror.

377
00:25:06,505 --> 00:25:09,986
To me, the real,
the real classics,

378
00:25:10,160 --> 00:25:12,554
the ones that came out,
like that Basket Case,

379
00:25:12,728 --> 00:25:15,818
my friends and I still talk
about Belial to this day.

380
00:25:15,992 --> 00:25:18,792
And when it was cool, then you
could show the girls to get them scared.

381
00:25:18,908 --> 00:25:21,191
And then plus, still, you went
through the classics, you know,

382
00:25:21,215 --> 00:25:23,130
all the Friday the 13th
and that sort of thing.

383
00:25:23,304 --> 00:25:26,263
People wanted to see
violence and blood,

384
00:25:26,437 --> 00:25:28,614
and the people that were bad,

385
00:25:28,788 --> 00:25:32,095
that were having premarital sex,
and drinking,

386
00:25:32,269 --> 00:25:35,795
and smoking pot or whatever die.

387
00:25:35,969 --> 00:25:39,581
As soon as they say, ""Jason,""
everybody knows the hockey mask.

388
00:25:39,755 --> 00:25:44,717
I don't think that was expected, uh, when
part one came out, part two, part three,

389
00:25:44,891 --> 00:25:48,982
but when the first person, which was
Richard, that donned the hockey mask,

390
00:25:49,156 --> 00:25:51,288
I think it was just one
of those things that took off.

391
00:25:51,462 --> 00:25:54,422
This is a character
that had six movies

392
00:25:55,249 --> 00:25:58,557
uh, before I ever got involved,

393
00:25:58,731 --> 00:26:01,472
and so everybody knew the
character's name around the world.

394
00:26:02,038 --> 00:26:04,780
It was almost like
each successive movie

395
00:26:05,389 --> 00:26:07,522
had to do honor
to the previous ones

396
00:26:07,696 --> 00:26:12,788
by coming up with inventive,
crazy, over-the-top kills.

397
00:26:12,962 --> 00:26:15,574
People are still looking back
saying, ""Well, that's Leatherface.

398
00:26:15,748 --> 00:26:20,100
That's Jason, Michael Myers,
and Freddie, of course.""

399
00:26:20,274 --> 00:26:23,886
One of my favorite movies is the
Nightmare On Elm Street, the first one.

400
00:26:24,713 --> 00:26:27,542
I still get scared of that fucking
movie. It's, that was so awesome.

401
00:26:27,716 --> 00:26:31,502
The first one was actually
the most interesting for me.

402
00:26:31,677 --> 00:26:33,548
Just the dynamics of the film,

403
00:26:33,722 --> 00:26:38,335
of this whole town
keeping a secret, this guilt.

404
00:26:38,901 --> 00:26:43,253
That kind of was like a
representation of humanity, uh,

405
00:26:43,427 --> 00:26:46,430
keeping secrets and not letting
certain things out.

406
00:26:46,605 --> 00:26:49,520
I think there's a big reputation
of that and how it can come back

407
00:26:49,695 --> 00:26:53,176
to have these repercussions
on, on them.

408
00:26:53,350 --> 00:26:54,874
You're a vampire, Michael.

409
00:26:55,048 --> 00:26:57,180
My own brother.
A goddamn shit-sucking vampire.

410
00:26:57,354 --> 00:27:01,315
Lost Boysis one of my
all-time favorites movies ever.

411
00:27:01,489 --> 00:27:04,753
And the connection
between rock and roll,

412
00:27:04,927 --> 00:27:07,626
long-haired dudes,
leather dudes,

413
00:27:07,800 --> 00:27:10,411
hot chicks, great music,

414
00:27:10,585 --> 00:27:12,413
and killing people
because you have to

415
00:27:12,587 --> 00:27:15,459
'cause you're a vampire
in beautiful California.

416
00:27:15,634 --> 00:27:19,028
That was, like, one of the first ones
that really made it cool and young,

417
00:27:19,202 --> 00:27:21,291
uh, with, with the,
with vampires.

418
00:27:21,465 --> 00:27:23,487
I'm really fond of a movie
called Prince Of Darkness.

419
00:27:23,511 --> 00:27:25,339
This is, like, tremendous.

420
00:27:25,513 --> 00:27:27,036
That ending has to be
one of my most

421
00:27:27,210 --> 00:27:28,472
favorite endings in the world.

422
00:27:28,647 --> 00:27:31,345
I recommend that movie highly.

423
00:27:31,519 --> 00:27:33,913
It scared me, and I thought
about it for a while.

424
00:27:34,087 --> 00:27:36,002
John Carpenter and I
were good friends.

425
00:27:36,524 --> 00:27:39,570
And I said, ""I wanna come down
and watch you do some of the filming.""

426
00:27:39,745 --> 00:27:41,505
And he says, ""Okay, yeah,
just come on down.""

427
00:27:41,572 --> 00:27:43,618
I put Alice
in Prince Of Darkness

428
00:27:43,792 --> 00:27:45,533
basically because he showed up.

429
00:27:45,707 --> 00:27:47,666
I said, ""Oh, here. Get in here.""

430
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:50,146
He says, ""You know that thing
you do with the mic stand,

431
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:54,107
where you stick it through the guy on
stage and it comes out the other end?

432
00:27:54,281 --> 00:27:55,911
""Could we do that with a bicycle
through this guy?""

433
00:27:55,935 --> 00:27:57,284
And I went, ""Sure.""

434
00:27:57,458 --> 00:28:00,461
Next thing I know,
now, I'm in the movie.

435
00:28:00,635 --> 00:28:03,290
It was a lot of fun to work
with him. He's a great guy.

436
00:28:04,073 --> 00:28:05,814
Hellraiseris another
massive great film,

437
00:28:05,988 --> 00:28:07,749
and I remember watching that
for the first time

438
00:28:07,773 --> 00:28:09,731
and being totally blown away
with it.

439
00:28:09,905 --> 00:28:11,951
And it had this kind
of pornography to it.

440
00:28:12,125 --> 00:28:13,755
Especially the second one
as well. They took it

441
00:28:13,779 --> 00:28:15,379
a little stage further
in the second one.

442
00:28:15,519 --> 00:28:18,914
And I think it was,
uh, sort of S-M, bondage,

443
00:28:19,088 --> 00:28:22,004
demonic, dark fantasy, I guess.

444
00:28:22,178 --> 00:28:24,528
There is nothing like it,

445
00:28:24,703 --> 00:28:27,140
I don't think, anywhere else
in horror movies.

446
00:28:27,314 --> 00:28:29,359
It's human. It's not human.

447
00:28:30,099 --> 00:28:32,362
And then there's
this little matter

448
00:28:32,536 --> 00:28:35,322
of having a whole bunch of nails
banged into your head,

449
00:28:35,496 --> 00:28:38,629
which sounds like,
sounds like a crazy idea.

450
00:28:38,804 --> 00:28:40,980
Pet Sematary. Big film.

451
00:28:41,154 --> 00:28:44,331
I remember very, very clearly
when, you know, it sort of came out

452
00:28:44,505 --> 00:28:47,508
and, and how it was spoken about

453
00:28:47,682 --> 00:28:51,381
amongst the, the friends that I had
that were allowed to sort of watch.

454
00:28:51,555 --> 00:28:53,688
I mean, we were eight years old
at that point,

455
00:28:54,645 --> 00:28:56,365
So it was like,
""Have you seen Pet Sematary?

456
00:28:56,517 --> 00:28:59,955
""It's like the, the most
frightening film ever.""

457
00:29:00,129 --> 00:29:02,915
That scene in Pet Sematary
with the, the sister

458
00:29:03,089 --> 00:29:05,744
who's got spinal meningitis,
that's a real thing.

459
00:29:05,918 --> 00:29:08,838
And you watch that and, you know,
you get, like, goose... I get goosebumps

460
00:29:08,921 --> 00:29:11,290
even thinking about it, 'cause
that's this classic scene of that movie.

461
00:29:11,314 --> 00:29:12,315
Terrifying, you know.

462
00:29:12,489 --> 00:29:14,927
Stephen King is a Ramones fan,

463
00:29:15,101 --> 00:29:19,061
and, uh, we did the video,
""Pet Sematary,""

464
00:29:19,235 --> 00:29:21,629
where me, Joey,
and the rest of the band

465
00:29:22,586 --> 00:29:25,807
are, uh, going down
into the grave.

466
00:29:25,981 --> 00:29:27,853
Dee Dee decided
to write the song,

467
00:29:28,027 --> 00:29:29,308
and then it ended up
in the movies.

468
00:29:29,332 --> 00:29:30,899
So did
""Sheena Is a Punk Rocker.""

469
00:29:31,073 --> 00:29:33,293
In the truck
while the guy's driving,

470
00:29:33,467 --> 00:29:35,991
and then the baby comes out
on the highway and...

471
00:29:36,165 --> 00:29:39,603
No!

472
00:29:39,778 --> 00:29:42,234
Once White Zombie got... started
going, it was starting to get from records,

473
00:29:42,258 --> 00:29:44,043
and there was money to be had,

474
00:29:44,217 --> 00:29:46,175
I started directing
the music videos,

475
00:29:46,349 --> 00:29:50,571
and I, ""Okay, okay.
This will be my sort of in.""

476
00:29:50,745 --> 00:29:53,617
So, when the opportunity
came up to make a film,

477
00:29:53,792 --> 00:29:55,924
which was House Of 1000 Corpses,
it was like...

478
00:29:56,098 --> 00:29:57,658
That's why that movie,
of all my movies,

479
00:29:57,708 --> 00:30:00,233
has the most elements
of, like, music video.

480
00:30:00,407 --> 00:30:03,236
He had this little movie called
House Of 1000 Corpses

481
00:30:03,410 --> 00:30:05,760
that had been green-lit
by Universal Studios.

482
00:30:06,456 --> 00:30:09,546
And he asked me if I wanted to
play, uh, this character, Otis Driftwood.

483
00:30:09,720 --> 00:30:11,244
And I said, ""Yeah.""

484
00:30:11,418 --> 00:30:13,376
And then, of course,
that then, you know,

485
00:30:13,550 --> 00:30:17,032
got refined and amplified
in Devil's Rejects.

486
00:30:17,206 --> 00:30:19,121
Devil's Rejects,
still such a killer movie.

487
00:30:19,295 --> 00:30:22,124
And so glad Sid Haig was
introduced to the world again

488
00:30:22,298 --> 00:30:24,387
as Captain Spaulding character.
Maybe...

489
00:30:25,345 --> 00:30:26,999
Probably the coolest character
to come out

490
00:30:27,173 --> 00:30:29,392
and I really, like,
since the old guys.

491
00:30:29,566 --> 00:30:32,918
I see how people

492
00:30:33,092 --> 00:30:36,138
have been affected
by what it is that I do,

493
00:30:36,312 --> 00:30:39,011
and it's, it's,
it's very flattering.

494
00:30:39,185 --> 00:30:43,711
Captain Spaulding triggered
the rebellious nature of people

495
00:30:43,885 --> 00:30:47,933
because he just, Spaulding
just does not give a shit, okay?

496
00:30:48,411 --> 00:30:51,066
And that is kind of
the attitude that goes along

497
00:30:51,240 --> 00:30:54,287
with metal and horror,

498
00:30:54,461 --> 00:30:58,160
is like, ""You know,
I'm gonna do what I'm gonna do.

499
00:30:58,334 --> 00:31:00,989
If you don't like it,
tough shit, okay?""

500
00:31:01,163 --> 00:31:03,078
I think what makes
effective horror is that

501
00:31:03,252 --> 00:31:06,429
it registers the anxiety of the
humans that are watching them.

502
00:31:06,603 --> 00:31:08,214
That's what horror does best.

503
00:31:08,388 --> 00:31:09,737
It makes meaning in the same way

504
00:31:09,911 --> 00:31:12,522
melodrama and great opera
makes meaning.

505
00:31:12,696 --> 00:31:15,786
It thrives on humans' anxiety.

506
00:31:15,961 --> 00:31:17,005
Horror films,

507
00:31:17,919 --> 00:31:20,574
politically, philosophically,

508
00:31:20,748 --> 00:31:25,709
emotionally,
psychologically, spiritually,

509
00:31:26,710 --> 00:31:28,930
depending on the film
and the person,

510
00:31:29,104 --> 00:31:32,238
there is a horror film
that has affected them

511
00:31:32,412 --> 00:31:35,371
and never, ever
left their psyche.

512
00:31:35,545 --> 00:31:38,418
And no other field does that.

513
00:31:39,288 --> 00:31:42,683
And there you have a little
history of the art of horror.

514
00:31:42,857 --> 00:31:44,815
We've heard
from many heavy metal artists

515
00:31:44,990 --> 00:31:47,644
as they shared with us
their favorite horror films.

516
00:31:47,818 --> 00:31:49,908
Let's take a step back
and find out

517
00:31:50,778 --> 00:31:54,390
when their obsession
with the genre first began.

518
00:31:55,565 --> 00:31:59,308
On Saturday, you and your
buddies would go to the east town,

519
00:31:59,482 --> 00:32:01,702
and Mom would drop you off
in the morning,

520
00:32:01,876 --> 00:32:04,096
and it would be
It Came From Outer Space

521
00:32:04,270 --> 00:32:05,836
and The Brain That Wouldn't Die.

522
00:32:06,011 --> 00:32:08,839
And that was
the rite of passage.

523
00:32:09,014 --> 00:32:11,146
That's how you, that,
we grew up on those movies.

524
00:32:11,320 --> 00:32:14,367
The first, uh, monster movie
that I saw was

525
00:32:14,541 --> 00:32:17,587
7th Voyage Of Sinbad,
uh, with the cyclops.

526
00:32:18,588 --> 00:32:22,636
Every time I'd wake up, I think
he'd be, uh, out my window

527
00:32:23,202 --> 00:32:25,508
ready to just, you know,
put his head through it.

528
00:32:25,682 --> 00:32:28,903
It was movies like that
that really, uh,

529
00:32:29,077 --> 00:32:32,080
left an impression in, in me
as a young boy.

530
00:32:32,254 --> 00:32:35,040
When you are a 10-year-old,
you have an 11-year-old friend

531
00:32:35,214 --> 00:32:38,304
who has a 12-year-old friend that
has a 13-year-old, so, so on and so on,

532
00:32:38,478 --> 00:32:41,524
from that 18-year-old that had
Cannibal Holocaust, you know, so...

533
00:32:42,308 --> 00:32:44,155
The first... Uh, no, I didn't see
that. I didn't want to,

534
00:32:44,179 --> 00:32:45,876
but you know
the, the whole principle.

535
00:32:46,051 --> 00:32:48,662
I got introduced
to weird shit too early.

536
00:32:48,836 --> 00:32:53,188
They used to have big, giant, like, kind
of coffee table books about horror movies,

537
00:32:53,362 --> 00:32:55,930
and I, I would always ask for
those for Christmas, you know.

538
00:32:56,104 --> 00:32:59,151
And I subscribed to Famous
Monstersmagazine, Forrest Ackerman.

539
00:32:59,325 --> 00:33:03,416
Before I knew anything else, I was always
really, really, really into horror movies.

540
00:33:03,590 --> 00:33:08,551
I think as a kid, we all get
excited about Halloween

541
00:33:08,725 --> 00:33:10,814
and, and the different types
of monsters

542
00:33:10,989 --> 00:33:12,512
and watching cartoons and stuff.

543
00:33:12,686 --> 00:33:15,645
We kind of graduated
into stuff like, you know,

544
00:33:15,819 --> 00:33:19,214
watching Dracula,
the Wolf Man, Frankenstein,

545
00:33:19,388 --> 00:33:21,738
The Mummy,
the Creature Of Black Lagoon.

546
00:33:21,912 --> 00:33:24,002
You know,
all these classic flicks.

547
00:33:24,176 --> 00:33:26,197
Strangely enough, when I was in,
like, second grade or something,

548
00:33:26,221 --> 00:33:28,484
they brought in a,
the big reels and showed us

549
00:33:28,658 --> 00:33:31,835
Phantom Of The Opera, the silent
version, which seems like an odd thing.

550
00:33:32,010 --> 00:33:33,620
It was very exciting,
but it seemed like,

551
00:33:33,794 --> 00:33:35,511
seems like an odd movie
for a bunch of second graders.

552
00:33:35,535 --> 00:33:37,363
My dad used to call it
the Super Saturday,

553
00:33:37,537 --> 00:33:39,254
and I was like, ""Well, how many
days of Super Saturday?""

554
00:33:39,278 --> 00:33:41,976
He's like, ""Two more days,""
and I'm like, ""Yes.""

555
00:33:42,150 --> 00:33:47,460
It was just all this, just
almost like overload of cartoons

556
00:33:47,634 --> 00:33:50,898
and the Groovie Goolies were
on. I was obsessed with that show.

557
00:33:51,072 --> 00:33:54,728
It didn't seem that different to me, the
Bugs Bunny or the Frankenstein. Like,

558
00:33:54,902 --> 00:33:57,557
it really was a natural
kind of thing, you know.

559
00:33:57,731 --> 00:34:00,864
So, uh, that's really was
the monsters in Addams Family.

560
00:34:01,039 --> 00:34:03,128
Like, that's really kind
of where, where it started.

561
00:34:03,302 --> 00:34:04,912
I was raised
in foster homes as a kid.

562
00:34:05,086 --> 00:34:06,686
There was a little TV
in the living room,

563
00:34:06,827 --> 00:34:09,047
and on Saturday nights,
there was this show,

564
00:34:09,221 --> 00:34:11,223
and the show was called
Jeepers Creepers.

565
00:34:11,397 --> 00:34:14,095
And it showed all these,
the really bad, you know,

566
00:34:14,269 --> 00:34:16,489
Plan 9 From Outer Space,
you know.

567
00:34:16,663 --> 00:34:18,162
It's a good way
to dump the foster kids.

568
00:34:18,186 --> 00:34:19,709
We just watched
monster movies all day.

569
00:34:19,883 --> 00:34:21,929
I remember from a very early age

570
00:34:22,103 --> 00:34:24,540
watching Chiller Theatre
and Creature Features,

571
00:34:24,714 --> 00:34:27,239
which were, like, on Channel 5

572
00:34:27,413 --> 00:34:29,545
and/or Channel 11
on Saturday mornings.

573
00:34:29,719 --> 00:34:33,332
So, of course, like most kids, I
was watching cartoons on Saturdays,

574
00:34:33,506 --> 00:34:35,508
but I was also watching
horror movies,

575
00:34:36,074 --> 00:34:37,597
uh, because my mom did.

576
00:34:37,771 --> 00:34:39,618
My mom loved horror movies
since she was little.

577
00:34:39,642 --> 00:34:44,386
Uh, when I was small,
I mean, probably four or five,

578
00:34:44,560 --> 00:34:46,910
I was, uh, we would
watch Creature Features

579
00:34:47,085 --> 00:34:50,827
and, um, Chiller Theatre
with the fucking, the hand.

580
00:34:51,001 --> 00:34:53,265
I think it had six fingers.
We always tried to count it.

581
00:34:53,917 --> 00:34:55,745
Sometimes even The 4:30 Movie.
Remember that?

582
00:34:55,919 --> 00:34:58,096
Then they would have,
like, Dracula

583
00:34:58,270 --> 00:35:00,228
on The 4:30 Movie,
or Frankenstein.

584
00:35:00,402 --> 00:35:02,926
We build
all those Aurora models.

585
00:35:03,536 --> 00:35:07,105
Like crazy. I must have built
five of each of them, you know.

586
00:35:07,279 --> 00:35:09,281
That's... just loved that shit.

587
00:35:09,455 --> 00:35:11,631
They had this TV show
called Ghost Host Theatre.

588
00:35:11,805 --> 00:35:16,897
I believe it came on somewhere
10:00-ish to, like, 4:00-ish,

589
00:35:17,071 --> 00:35:19,421
and it would play, like,
two to three horror movies.

590
00:35:19,595 --> 00:35:21,704
I remember a few times they
played, like, Godzilla, you know,

591
00:35:21,728 --> 00:35:23,947
then The Blob,
and we used to just watch them.

592
00:35:24,122 --> 00:35:26,472
And that made me
wanna watch more movies.

593
00:35:26,646 --> 00:35:31,216
They had this thing called
the Sunday Morning Movie,

594
00:35:31,390 --> 00:35:33,870
that mixed with Twilight Zone

595
00:35:34,044 --> 00:35:38,048
mixed with Outer Limits
mixed with Night Gallery.

596
00:35:38,223 --> 00:35:40,660
That was a lot of ammo
to throw at a child,

597
00:35:40,834 --> 00:35:43,271
and, and, uh, uh,

598
00:35:43,445 --> 00:35:45,534
I, I adored it, I loved it.

599
00:35:45,708 --> 00:35:48,276
I know that it must have been
when I was around three,

600
00:35:48,450 --> 00:35:51,323
because I remember
it was our in our old apartment.

601
00:35:51,497 --> 00:35:54,935
I know that we saw Funhouse.
I was so afraid.

602
00:35:55,109 --> 00:35:57,590
I mean, there's this,
like, robotic clown

603
00:35:57,764 --> 00:36:00,245
that comes through a tunnel
with, like, a corpse.

604
00:36:00,419 --> 00:36:04,118
That, that's, that is still,
like, stuck with me forever.

605
00:36:04,292 --> 00:36:07,077
I, I think I took chances in
horror when I was really young.

606
00:36:07,252 --> 00:36:08,992
I started watching
Faces Of Death,

607
00:36:09,167 --> 00:36:10,951
and the reality ones
that you see

608
00:36:11,125 --> 00:36:13,345
people getting chopped up,
shit like that.

609
00:36:13,910 --> 00:36:16,790
I don't know how the fuck I got a
hold of them, but it kind of warped me.

610
00:36:18,611 --> 00:36:19,960
But that's what
I liked watching.

611
00:36:20,134 --> 00:36:22,267
My dad took us
to see Poltergeist.

612
00:36:22,441 --> 00:36:26,009
I was, like, maybe six or
something when that movie came out,

613
00:36:26,184 --> 00:36:28,795
and, uh, he took us to see it
'cause we just asked him to.

614
00:36:28,969 --> 00:36:30,275
And he was like, ""Okay.""

615
00:36:30,449 --> 00:36:32,146
He wasn't like,
""This is inappropriate

616
00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:34,627
for a six-year-old at all.""

617
00:36:34,801 --> 00:36:37,673
I would stay up late
in my, um, in my bedroom,

618
00:36:37,847 --> 00:36:40,023
and I had a tiny black and white
television, you know,

619
00:36:40,198 --> 00:36:43,549
that you had to, that I'd get the
reception and to stay up late and watch.

620
00:36:44,114 --> 00:36:47,988
They would show trailers
for Friday The 13th I and II.

621
00:36:48,162 --> 00:36:50,817
And the fact that it was,
the TV was in black and white,

622
00:36:50,991 --> 00:36:52,775
and, and, and gritty and grainy

623
00:36:53,341 --> 00:36:54,951
just made it even more scary.

624
00:36:55,125 --> 00:36:56,605
To me, this was actually more,

625
00:36:56,779 --> 00:36:58,477
it seemed more of a documentary,

626
00:36:58,651 --> 00:37:00,783
'cause I didn't know
that movies didn't happen.

627
00:37:01,306 --> 00:37:03,525
You know, I just figured
people had cameras,

628
00:37:03,699 --> 00:37:05,875
and they just happened
to be around

629
00:37:06,049 --> 00:37:07,529
when all this bad stuff
was happening.

630
00:37:07,573 --> 00:37:09,401
There were these orange books,

631
00:37:09,575 --> 00:37:10,967
and they were the monster books,

632
00:37:11,141 --> 00:37:12,882
like, you know,
Frankenstein, Dracula,

633
00:37:13,056 --> 00:37:16,321
Invisible man,
uh, Wolf Man, King Kong,

634
00:37:16,495 --> 00:37:20,107
and, and it was made by
this company called Crestwood.

635
00:37:20,281 --> 00:37:23,371
And I loved these books. I would
check them out every single day.

636
00:37:23,545 --> 00:37:25,417
Check them out
every day, every day.

637
00:37:25,591 --> 00:37:27,114
And I, I just worshipped
these books.

638
00:37:27,288 --> 00:37:28,768
So my mom got me the whole set.

639
00:37:29,508 --> 00:37:33,251
And, um, that's what really got
me into it at such a young age.

640
00:37:33,425 --> 00:37:36,645
I was around, uh, eight years
old, and I saw, um,

641
00:37:36,819 --> 00:37:39,431
one of the first Draculafilms
in a walk-in theater.

642
00:37:39,605 --> 00:37:41,520
We went shopping
with my mom or something.

643
00:37:41,694 --> 00:37:43,304
She dropped us off
at the theater.

644
00:37:43,478 --> 00:37:45,611
We walked in there,
and Christopher Lee comes

645
00:37:45,785 --> 00:37:48,440
rising out of the carpet,
and we went, ""Aah!""

646
00:37:48,614 --> 00:37:51,617
It just was, just, just that opening
scene where I was, like, horrified.

647
00:37:51,791 --> 00:37:55,229
It must have been
about 1981 or 1982.

648
00:37:55,403 --> 00:37:58,928
We went to my Aunt Donna's house
to watch American Werewolf In London.

649
00:37:59,102 --> 00:38:01,516
My dad was like, ""You're gonna
love this movie. I read about it.

650
00:38:01,540 --> 00:38:03,340
It's supposed to be
this cool werewolf movie.""

651
00:38:03,498 --> 00:38:05,892
And, of course,
the transformation scene

652
00:38:06,066 --> 00:38:08,286
just blew my mind.
It was the greatest thing ever.

653
00:38:08,460 --> 00:38:13,291
The recurring dream sequences
were, were literally truly terrifying.

654
00:38:13,465 --> 00:38:16,424
Especially with the Nazi werewolves
that burst into the living room

655
00:38:16,598 --> 00:38:19,819
and, like, you know, just totally
gunned down the entire family.

656
00:38:19,993 --> 00:38:22,343
Really, really freaked me out.

657
00:38:22,517 --> 00:38:25,041
You know, that's what began
my love affair with horror was that.

658
00:38:25,215 --> 00:38:28,871
I think that was the defining
moment. It was like riding, you know,

659
00:38:29,045 --> 00:38:30,569
a dangerous switchback railway.

660
00:38:30,743 --> 00:38:33,572
It was like,
""Wow, I wanna go again.""

661
00:38:33,746 --> 00:38:37,706
Started watching Dark Shadows
when I was probably about three.

662
00:38:37,880 --> 00:38:39,926
It was a serial,
like a soap opera,

663
00:38:40,100 --> 00:38:41,101
like General Hospital.

664
00:38:41,275 --> 00:38:43,669
It ran from '66 to '71,

665
00:38:43,843 --> 00:38:46,541
and it was about a vampire
named Barnabas Collins.

666
00:38:46,715 --> 00:38:48,978
So I started watching horror,
and my mother watched it,

667
00:38:49,152 --> 00:38:52,547
and so probably, yeah,
about three or four years old.

668
00:38:53,287 --> 00:38:56,464
I was probably about, uh,

669
00:38:56,638 --> 00:38:58,423
I'm gonna say five or six,

670
00:38:58,597 --> 00:39:01,774
and my mom took me
to see Buck Rogers.

671
00:39:01,948 --> 00:39:04,187
Like, you know the movie with,
uh, with Gil Gerard, right?

672
00:39:04,211 --> 00:39:06,866
Like the,
the disco sci-fi flick.

673
00:39:07,040 --> 00:39:09,477
My mom was like, ""Well,
you know, he liked Star Wars.

674
00:39:09,651 --> 00:39:11,044
Maybe he'll like this,
you know.""

675
00:39:11,218 --> 00:39:13,481
The trailer
for the original Halloween

676
00:39:13,655 --> 00:39:15,309
was attached to the movie,

677
00:39:15,483 --> 00:39:17,833
and I was so transfixed.

678
00:39:18,878 --> 00:39:19,966
That was it for me.

679
00:39:20,706 --> 00:39:25,406
Whether it is literature,
painting, or film,

680
00:39:25,580 --> 00:39:27,930
there is always
a dark side to art.

681
00:39:28,801 --> 00:39:32,892
Let us take a look
at the darker side of music.

682
00:39:33,545 --> 00:39:36,635
Let us explore
the history of metal.

683
00:39:38,463 --> 00:39:40,769
Music, right? I mean,
music was around forever.

684
00:39:40,943 --> 00:39:43,990
But the origins of metal
are from the blues.

685
00:39:44,164 --> 00:39:49,430
Robert Johnson could get
credited for inventing rock and roll.

686
00:39:49,604 --> 00:39:51,650
When you see
in the '60s and '70s,

687
00:39:51,824 --> 00:39:55,305
the emergence of progressive
rock and heavy metal.

688
00:39:55,480 --> 00:39:57,320
Things were louder,
things were more dangerous.

689
00:39:57,482 --> 00:40:00,006
Metal is under
the rock umbrella,

690
00:40:00,180 --> 00:40:04,489
but metal, metal, metal started
with Black Sabbath.

691
00:40:04,663 --> 00:40:06,142
Black Sabbath
when they first started

692
00:40:06,316 --> 00:40:08,120
was a band called Earth,
and they were a blues band,

693
00:40:08,144 --> 00:40:10,079
and they kind of took that,
even Led Zeppelin as well,

694
00:40:10,103 --> 00:40:12,888
they kind of took those themes
and that style of music,

695
00:40:13,062 --> 00:40:16,631
and put it into this different
kind of musical genre.

696
00:40:16,805 --> 00:40:19,286
The song ""Black Sabbath,""
the album Black Sabbath.

697
00:40:19,460 --> 00:40:21,177
There was stuff that was
heavy music before that,

698
00:40:21,201 --> 00:40:24,987
but to me, that's the official
birth of heavy metal.

699
00:40:25,161 --> 00:40:29,296
They fused horror
and, and heavy music together.

700
00:40:29,470 --> 00:40:32,081
You know, Black Sabbath
was a Boris Karloff film, right?

701
00:40:32,255 --> 00:40:34,455
You know, that's where they got
the name, from the film,

702
00:40:34,606 --> 00:40:37,566
and they combined it with heavy music,
and that's how heavy metal was born.

703
00:40:37,609 --> 00:40:39,151
Black Sabbathwas playing
in a movie theater.

704
00:40:39,175 --> 00:40:40,370
There was a line
around the block,

705
00:40:40,394 --> 00:40:41,743
and they were all looking like,

706
00:40:41,917 --> 00:40:43,658
""People wanna be scared.
Look at that line.""

707
00:40:43,832 --> 00:40:45,965
Let's change it. And they got
the name from the movie.

708
00:40:46,139 --> 00:40:48,422
You know, that's when they made
a turn from Earth to Black Sabbath.

709
00:40:48,446 --> 00:40:50,448
Anybody who says that
Black Sabbath didn't fucking

710
00:40:50,622 --> 00:40:52,667
invent heavy metal
is a fucking idiot.

711
00:40:52,841 --> 00:40:55,148
You shut your mouth, dick bags.

712
00:40:55,844 --> 00:40:58,760
I'll give credit where credit is
due to bands who have helped,

713
00:40:59,282 --> 00:41:01,371
but Black Sabbath
set the template.

714
00:41:01,546 --> 00:41:02,808
After Black Sabbath, I mean,

715
00:41:02,982 --> 00:41:05,201
there was bands
like Judas Priest.

716
00:41:05,375 --> 00:41:07,639
You know,
little later, Iron Maiden.

717
00:41:07,813 --> 00:41:10,076
I mean, these bands took

718
00:41:10,250 --> 00:41:13,601
what Sabbath started doing
and made it faster.

719
00:41:13,775 --> 00:41:15,342
I mean, you can say
metal to somebody,

720
00:41:15,516 --> 00:41:18,606
and it could mean anything
from Poison and Bon Jovi

721
00:41:18,780 --> 00:41:23,219
to Carcass to Slayer
to Metallica to Guns N' Roses.

722
00:41:23,393 --> 00:41:25,753
You had the birth of thrash.
You had the influence, I think,

723
00:41:25,874 --> 00:41:27,441
of punk and hardcore
on it as well.

724
00:41:27,615 --> 00:41:29,051
That sort of meshed in
a little bit.

725
00:41:29,225 --> 00:41:32,141
And now you have probably
20 sub-genres of it,

726
00:41:32,315 --> 00:41:34,970
that it means something different
to so many different people.

727
00:41:35,144 --> 00:41:36,885
So, I think it's just,
it's just had

728
00:41:37,059 --> 00:41:39,105
so many bastard children
along the way.

729
00:41:40,280 --> 00:41:41,977
Isn't history fascinating?

730
00:41:42,761 --> 00:41:45,459
Now that you've learned a
little history of metal and horror,

731
00:41:46,286 --> 00:41:49,985
let us see how horror
influenced the musicians.

732
00:41:50,682 --> 00:41:52,858
Let the convergence begin.

733
00:41:54,120 --> 00:41:56,775
In the '50s and early '60,
there were actually, uh,

734
00:41:56,949 --> 00:42:00,387
there were all kind of, like,
minor hits, like novelty rock things,

735
00:42:00,561 --> 00:42:02,607
but they were actually
quite a bit of them.

736
00:42:02,781 --> 00:42:05,392
Started then. It's where
the horror rock started.

737
00:42:05,566 --> 00:42:08,047
I guess the first one
that really got me was

738
00:42:08,221 --> 00:42:11,224
was Screamin' Jay Hawkins, who
had wrote ""I Put A Spell On You.""

739
00:42:11,398 --> 00:42:13,922
Bryan Ferry's done it.
Marilyn Manson's done it.

740
00:42:14,096 --> 00:42:16,229
It will be done
a hundred more times.

741
00:42:16,403 --> 00:42:18,797
Screaming Lord Sutch,
I knew him as the guy

742
00:42:18,971 --> 00:42:21,531
who appeared in photographs
with the toilet seat around his neck.

743
00:42:21,582 --> 00:42:24,846
I met him on the top
of a double-decker bus,

744
00:42:25,412 --> 00:42:28,981
and he impressed me
as a very intelligent man

745
00:42:30,156 --> 00:42:33,072
who knew exactly
how to market himself.

746
00:42:35,161 --> 00:42:37,032
I guess, as a music fan,
a lot of the time,

747
00:42:37,206 --> 00:42:39,513
you kind of proceed in, in

748
00:42:40,166 --> 00:42:44,344
""What the fuck"" moments when
something new suddenly comes along,

749
00:42:44,518 --> 00:42:46,694
and I have
a very fixed memory of that.

750
00:42:46,868 --> 00:42:50,655
Watching Top Of The Pops
and on comes this

751
00:42:51,438 --> 00:42:54,006
creature with his head on fire,

752
00:42:54,180 --> 00:42:56,225
and I was absolutely mesmerized,

753
00:42:56,399 --> 00:43:00,055
and that was The Crazy World
Of Arthur Brown.

754
00:43:00,229 --> 00:43:03,319
Although this shock that we were
actually putting out there

755
00:43:03,493 --> 00:43:06,801
was to get beneath
the daily level of the mind

756
00:43:06,975 --> 00:43:09,412
that every, you know,
that numbs everybody.

757
00:43:09,587 --> 00:43:14,766
The education gives you that,
that, uh, daily existence demands

758
00:43:14,940 --> 00:43:16,985
of what is there beneath that,

759
00:43:17,159 --> 00:43:20,423
so that that was what,
what it was about.

760
00:43:20,598 --> 00:43:23,818
So I made characters. One of the
characters was the God of Hellfire.

761
00:43:23,992 --> 00:43:26,734
It was very shocking
at that time.

762
00:43:28,214 --> 00:43:29,781
It isn't now.

763
00:43:29,955 --> 00:43:31,957
We did some shows together.
It was kind of great.

764
00:43:32,131 --> 00:43:34,133
He had one of the best voices
of anybody.

765
00:43:34,307 --> 00:43:36,396
He had the greatest range.

766
00:43:36,570 --> 00:43:38,964
You know,
he could sing way up here

767
00:43:39,138 --> 00:43:41,662
and way down here
like an operatic voice.

768
00:43:41,836 --> 00:43:43,708
So, I always really liked
Arthur Brown.

769
00:43:43,882 --> 00:43:45,884
Arthur, Arthur Brown was,
was great.

770
00:43:46,058 --> 00:43:48,234
Alice, yeah, you know,
I could see that.

771
00:43:48,408 --> 00:43:52,020
And I could see that also,
he took it in his own direction

772
00:43:52,194 --> 00:43:54,022
and made something great
out of it.

773
00:43:54,196 --> 00:43:56,503
I think Alice can take you
to another place

774
00:43:56,677 --> 00:44:00,072
because of all the creepy,
macabre kind of stuff.

775
00:44:00,246 --> 00:44:04,380
He had everything that I wanted 'cause
I really wanted it to be horror influence.

776
00:44:04,554 --> 00:44:06,252
There was a darkness
to the other bands,

777
00:44:06,426 --> 00:44:08,602
and it's kind of
get the elements,

778
00:44:08,776 --> 00:44:11,692
but the Alice Cooper stuff,
it's just, like, right there.

779
00:44:11,866 --> 00:44:14,739
You know, ""Ballad of Dwight
Fry,"" it's so right there.

780
00:44:14,913 --> 00:44:19,178
Alice Cooper, you know, is
an iconic example of, of horror.

781
00:44:19,352 --> 00:44:21,702
His stage show is
and always will be amazing.

782
00:44:21,876 --> 00:44:24,836
It's a, you know,
a real-life horror show.

783
00:44:25,401 --> 00:44:28,404
Where everybody was Peter Pan,
Alice needed to be Captain Hook.

784
00:44:29,188 --> 00:44:31,190
You know, you had
so many rock heroes out there,

785
00:44:31,364 --> 00:44:33,164
and I kept going,
""Where's the rock villains?""

786
00:44:33,453 --> 00:44:35,020
There really aren't
any villains.

787
00:44:35,194 --> 00:44:39,067
So a rock audience,
seeing a Broadway play,

788
00:44:39,677 --> 00:44:42,375
fully blown up,
but it's a horror show.

789
00:44:42,549 --> 00:44:44,769
And it's really well done
with lights,

790
00:44:44,943 --> 00:44:47,336
and characters, and, and music.

791
00:44:48,642 --> 00:44:50,644
It shocked everybody.
It was very shocking.

792
00:44:50,818 --> 00:44:53,212
But he is a little bit
spooky on stage.

793
00:44:53,386 --> 00:44:55,040
He's got that
monster thing going,

794
00:44:55,214 --> 00:44:58,173
and it's macabre, and
the chopping up of the heads,

795
00:44:58,347 --> 00:45:02,221
and hanging himself, and cutting
his own head off, and all that stuff.

796
00:45:02,395 --> 00:45:05,050
I could see even way back
when in the '70s,

797
00:45:05,224 --> 00:45:08,618
they started bringing in
these monsters with music.

798
00:45:08,793 --> 00:45:10,533
I remember, like,
when I was six years old,

799
00:45:10,708 --> 00:45:14,233
my dad... opened this magazine,
he's like,

800
00:45:14,929 --> 00:45:16,583
""This is the fucking shit, man.""

801
00:45:16,757 --> 00:45:18,977
It was a, it was
a big picture of Kiss.

802
00:45:19,151 --> 00:45:22,241
He showed me videos, and I was
like, ""Oh, it's amazing.""

803
00:45:22,415 --> 00:45:24,765
When I first
got into Kiss in '75,

804
00:45:25,853 --> 00:45:27,899
you know, I was already
into horror movies,

805
00:45:28,073 --> 00:45:31,467
and I was well into comic books
and music, and I was into rock,

806
00:45:31,641 --> 00:45:34,514
so Kiss was kind of,
like, the whole package.

807
00:45:34,688 --> 00:45:36,646
Off the brown aisle
scoop the Kiss.

808
00:45:36,821 --> 00:45:41,042
To me, that was the epitome
of horror, originality.

809
00:45:41,216 --> 00:45:42,696
The beginnings.

810
00:45:42,870 --> 00:45:46,439
I respect that
because they did it first.

811
00:45:46,613 --> 00:45:48,373
My best friend in the business
is Rob Zombie.

812
00:45:48,441 --> 00:45:50,922
Rob and I are good friends,
and he's a director now.

813
00:45:51,096 --> 00:45:55,404
I mean, he directs horror. And he has
the same attitude towards horror that I do.

814
00:45:56,057 --> 00:45:57,537
That it's comedy.

815
00:45:57,711 --> 00:45:59,365
Well, just the way
Rob Zombie looks

816
00:45:59,539 --> 00:46:01,386
and the way his band looks
and the way his stages

817
00:46:01,410 --> 00:46:03,804
and these robots and these
things that he's doing.

818
00:46:03,978 --> 00:46:06,198
He really, I think,
embodies everything

819
00:46:06,372 --> 00:46:08,243
that it is to merge
metal and horror.

820
00:46:08,417 --> 00:46:09,679
When I was in White Zombie,

821
00:46:09,854 --> 00:46:11,377
I mean,
just the name itself was...

822
00:46:12,639 --> 00:46:15,381
from a great Lugosi film, and
I thought the name is so classic.

823
00:46:15,555 --> 00:46:18,079
It's like, ""Oh, it's so obvious.
This is like Black Sabbath.

824
00:46:18,253 --> 00:46:20,453
It's like White Zombie.
It's the perfect name for band.""

825
00:46:20,603 --> 00:46:23,060
Even before there was a band, I
was like, ""If there's ever a band,

826
00:46:23,084 --> 00:46:25,130
this is what I wanna call it.""
I knew that forever.

827
00:46:25,304 --> 00:46:27,915
And then once I was on my own,
and I could do whatever I wanted,

828
00:46:28,089 --> 00:46:30,449
that's when like, ""Oh, I'm
gonna have giant robots on stage.

829
00:46:30,570 --> 00:46:33,529
I'm gonna have all kinds of creatures.
I'm gonna have giant screens.""

830
00:46:33,703 --> 00:46:35,444
Whatever I thought of
was what I did.

831
00:46:35,618 --> 00:46:38,230
Lyrically, horror definitely
has had a big influence,

832
00:46:38,404 --> 00:46:41,973
uh, on what I've done in
my life, that's, that's for sure.

833
00:46:42,147 --> 00:46:45,454
The song ""Among The Living,""
the title track of the album,

834
00:46:45,628 --> 00:46:47,848
is about,
based off of The Stand.

835
00:46:48,022 --> 00:46:49,763
And it's about Randall Flagg in,

836
00:46:49,937 --> 00:46:51,547
um, the Stephen King character.

837
00:46:51,721 --> 00:46:55,638
The song ""Lone Justice,""
off of Spreading the Disease,

838
00:46:55,813 --> 00:46:57,858
influenced by
The Dark Towerseries.

839
00:46:58,032 --> 00:47:00,600
I wrote about things I knew,
and that was

840
00:47:00,774 --> 00:47:02,863
King books and comics and,

841
00:47:03,037 --> 00:47:05,823
uh, that was it.

842
00:47:05,997 --> 00:47:08,913
We had a song, ""I Don't Wanna
Go Down To The Basement,""

843
00:47:09,087 --> 00:47:11,002
Texas Chainsaw Massacre.

844
00:47:11,176 --> 00:47:13,482
So, we were influenced
by those movies,

845
00:47:13,656 --> 00:47:15,876
to be able to write about them.

846
00:47:16,050 --> 00:47:18,183
Lizzie Borden?
Who's this girl, you know?

847
00:47:18,357 --> 00:47:20,402
What does she want,
you know? Even though

848
00:47:20,576 --> 00:47:24,406
it was the O.J. Simpson trial
of that time,

849
00:47:24,580 --> 00:47:26,017
a lot of kids never heard of it.

850
00:47:26,582 --> 00:47:28,082
And now, of course,
they're doing movies and stuff

851
00:47:28,106 --> 00:47:29,977
of the real Lizzie Borden.

852
00:47:30,151 --> 00:47:34,590
I saw The Omen. And when
Thorn wipes the kid's cheek

853
00:47:34,764 --> 00:47:37,419
with the fox blood, 'cause
he killed his first hound,

854
00:47:37,593 --> 00:47:39,378
I just love that, you know.

855
00:47:39,552 --> 00:47:41,206
And so, I brought that
into my show.

856
00:47:41,380 --> 00:47:42,990
And I do that
all over the world,

857
00:47:43,164 --> 00:47:45,471
and every kid wants blood
on their faces.

858
00:47:45,645 --> 00:47:47,212
When we did
our ""Sandpaper"" video,

859
00:47:47,386 --> 00:47:49,016
we thought we should do
a homage to Evil Dead.

860
00:47:49,040 --> 00:47:51,040
You know, what if our band
was possessed by demons,

861
00:47:51,129 --> 00:47:53,044
people who know Evil Dead
will go,

862
00:47:53,218 --> 00:47:55,350
""That's a homage
to Evil Dead. We like this.""

863
00:47:55,524 --> 00:47:58,179
There was always that vibe too.

864
00:47:58,353 --> 00:48:02,575
If it was cheaply done,
well done, made it even scarier.

865
00:48:02,749 --> 00:48:06,709
Everything about what we do
is completely influenced

866
00:48:06,884 --> 00:48:09,408
by horror movies or comics.

867
00:48:09,582 --> 00:48:13,064
There's a character in Redneck
Zombies called the Tobacco Man,

868
00:48:13,238 --> 00:48:15,936
and he wears a hood, and I think
you're supposed to think

869
00:48:16,110 --> 00:48:18,025
that he's got, like, cancer
or something.

870
00:48:18,199 --> 00:48:22,638
He's, like, rotting, and that was
where we got the idea for that.

871
00:48:22,812 --> 00:48:25,467
Over the years,
I've got various requests

872
00:48:25,641 --> 00:48:30,472
to work, um, with metal bands,
usually through my agent.

873
00:48:30,646 --> 00:48:34,433
The only one of those that ever
came to fruition was Cradle of Filth.

874
00:48:34,607 --> 00:48:36,348
Well, we did an album
called Midian,

875
00:48:36,522 --> 00:48:40,221
which is based
on Clive Barker's book Cabal,

876
00:48:40,395 --> 00:48:42,963
which then was obviously
the Nightbreedmovie.

877
00:48:43,137 --> 00:48:45,618
So we thought that if we're
gonna have a narrative in it,

878
00:48:45,792 --> 00:48:49,535
it would be good to have someone
from the Clyde Barker world of horror.

879
00:48:49,709 --> 00:48:52,494
It was great
to have dug himself,

880
00:48:52,668 --> 00:48:56,281
and, and we immediately, like,
affected his voice to sound like Pinhead...

881
00:48:56,455 --> 00:49:00,067
So I did four albums
with Cradle.

882
00:49:00,241 --> 00:49:02,241
I was suggesting that
they should change their name

883
00:49:02,330 --> 00:49:04,463
to Doug Bradley
and Cradle of Filth.

884
00:49:04,637 --> 00:49:08,119
When I discovered metal, I was
just a few years into my sort of

885
00:49:09,120 --> 00:49:12,297
being very much into horror,
as soon as I discovered metal,

886
00:49:12,471 --> 00:49:17,171
I totally embraced it and totally
understood how one embraced the other.

887
00:49:17,345 --> 00:49:21,001
Everything we've done has
that vampiric element to it as well.

888
00:49:21,175 --> 00:49:22,611
Not so much for Korn,
but I did, uh,

889
00:49:22,785 --> 00:49:25,527
I had a alter ego J Devil
when I was doing DJing.

890
00:49:25,701 --> 00:49:27,181
And I did a song
called ""Lick Me,""

891
00:49:27,355 --> 00:49:29,662
and it takes samples
from The Exorcist.

892
00:49:29,836 --> 00:49:33,405
When the little girl was banging
herself. She's goes ""Lick me!""

893
00:49:33,579 --> 00:49:35,739
So, I mean, uh, shit like that,
using samples like that

894
00:49:35,798 --> 00:49:37,931
and stuff like that
are really intense.

895
00:49:38,105 --> 00:49:41,282
I used the music,
a lot of metal music,

896
00:49:41,456 --> 00:49:43,937
for listening to
in between violent scenes.

897
00:49:44,111 --> 00:49:45,765
It just helps my energy.

898
00:49:45,939 --> 00:49:49,203
I used one song
in particular a lot,

899
00:49:49,377 --> 00:49:51,379
and that was ""Enter Sandman,""

900
00:49:51,553 --> 00:49:53,816
my favorite
Metallica song still.

901
00:49:54,295 --> 00:49:56,471
For years and years,
I've been a fan of Metallica.

902
00:49:57,037 --> 00:49:58,256
I just think they're awesome.

903
00:49:58,821 --> 00:50:02,738
And, uh, love their, uh, album,
uh, ""Enter Sandman.""

904
00:50:02,912 --> 00:50:04,436
That one is unbelievable.

905
00:50:04,610 --> 00:50:06,177
I've had my guitar, you know,

906
00:50:06,351 --> 00:50:08,309
I clicked my guitar in,
you know,

907
00:50:08,483 --> 00:50:10,833
and I noodle sometimes
when I'm watching movies.

908
00:50:11,008 --> 00:50:12,879
Sometimes I find myself

909
00:50:13,575 --> 00:50:16,187
kind of, like, playing
to the flow of the film,

910
00:50:16,361 --> 00:50:19,799
and I kind of... trying to anticipate
what's gonna happen next.

911
00:50:19,973 --> 00:50:22,715
I'll write a riff,
and I go, ""Oh, goddamn.

912
00:50:22,889 --> 00:50:26,110
That sounds like Godzilla
walking through Tokyo, you know?""

913
00:50:27,154 --> 00:50:29,074
If you're writing heavy metal
and you have a riff

914
00:50:29,200 --> 00:50:31,289
that sounds like Godzilla
is walking through Tokyo,

915
00:50:31,463 --> 00:50:33,769
that's yum.
You're on the right track.

916
00:50:33,943 --> 00:50:36,555
Wendy O. Williams, you know, who
we're named after,

917
00:50:36,729 --> 00:50:38,426
the band is an ode to Wendy O.

918
00:50:38,600 --> 00:50:41,299
You know, it's like
just blowing up the cars

919
00:50:41,473 --> 00:50:44,563
and chainsawing things in half

920
00:50:44,737 --> 00:50:49,785
and making it a real horror
show, um, and real shocking.

921
00:50:49,959 --> 00:50:53,137
And I think that that, uh, obviously
has been a huge influence.

922
00:50:53,311 --> 00:50:56,096
We were very influenced
by horror and a lot of the songs

923
00:50:56,270 --> 00:50:58,577
that we wrote were about,
you know, serial killers

924
00:50:58,751 --> 00:51:02,320
and real-life experiences
that would scare you.

925
00:51:02,494 --> 00:51:04,844
And I think that horror

926
00:51:05,018 --> 00:51:08,500
and the things that scare us are still
a running theme in all of our songs.

927
00:51:08,674 --> 00:51:11,329
The fact that we do metal
of a darker and heavier sort

928
00:51:11,503 --> 00:51:13,026
make us slightly close
to horror movie

929
00:51:13,200 --> 00:51:15,289
and then maybe them
to Teletubbies, I don't know.

930
00:51:15,463 --> 00:51:16,899
Sometimes we try
to scare people,

931
00:51:17,074 --> 00:51:18,988
make people uncomfortable

932
00:51:19,163 --> 00:51:20,270
in the stuff
we are trying to tell.

933
00:51:20,294 --> 00:51:22,209
And lots of that imagery

934
00:51:22,383 --> 00:51:24,124
comes from horror movie,
then obviously.

935
00:51:24,298 --> 00:51:26,605
Well, Skinny Puppy
started as, uh,

936
00:51:26,779 --> 00:51:29,651
an electronic band that didn't
wanna just stand up on stage

937
00:51:29,825 --> 00:51:32,828
and do a little dance because
electronic music can be quite sterile.

938
00:51:33,002 --> 00:51:37,050
So our weekends were composed of
taking a lot of hallucinogenics

939
00:51:37,224 --> 00:51:39,835
and watching horror film,
after horror film, after horror film

940
00:51:40,009 --> 00:51:41,663
until they actually
blended together.

941
00:51:41,837 --> 00:51:44,013
Fulci really hit me hard
because there is

942
00:51:44,188 --> 00:51:46,059
an abstract nature to his films

943
00:51:46,233 --> 00:51:49,715
that I didn't understand, but in
the altered state that we were in,

944
00:51:49,889 --> 00:51:55,112
it was incredibly effective of
inducing inspiration for stage effects.

945
00:51:55,677 --> 00:52:00,595
I think if you grow up enough with listening
to horror themes and stuff like that,

946
00:52:01,074 --> 00:52:02,597
within your music,

947
00:52:02,771 --> 00:52:05,818
let you be writing
darker material.

948
00:52:06,297 --> 00:52:09,343
It's gonna come out of you. It's
gonna come out of you, you know?

949
00:52:09,952 --> 00:52:12,303
Uh, Necrophagia,
the stuff I wrote for them.

950
00:52:12,477 --> 00:52:14,479
The Christ Inversion.

951
00:52:14,957 --> 00:52:18,178
Bands like that,
I've always, you know...

952
00:52:18,700 --> 00:52:19,745
Not to mention...

953
00:52:21,355 --> 00:52:23,357
the name of the second band's
uh, record is

954
00:52:23,531 --> 00:52:25,185
Vulgar Display of Power.

955
00:52:26,839 --> 00:52:28,145
And I ripped that off...

956
00:52:29,363 --> 00:52:30,669
from The Exorcist.

957
00:52:31,409 --> 00:52:34,238
That's much too vulgar
display of power, Karras.

958
00:52:34,412 --> 00:52:36,022
My band,
Charred Walls of the Damned,

959
00:52:36,196 --> 00:52:37,676
we've made a couple of videos,

960
00:52:37,850 --> 00:52:39,895
and they were both horror theme.

961
00:52:40,069 --> 00:52:42,942
One was called ""Ghost Town""
and one was called ""Zerospan.""

962
00:52:43,116 --> 00:52:45,379
These music videos
offer a chance to make a,

963
00:52:45,553 --> 00:52:47,729
you know, three or
four-minute short horror film.

964
00:52:47,903 --> 00:52:49,992
When we did, um...

965
00:52:51,037 --> 00:52:52,995
an album based
on Dante Alighieri's,

966
00:52:53,170 --> 00:52:54,736
uh, The Divine Comedy.

967
00:52:55,215 --> 00:52:58,000
It was about the story
of Dante traveling from,

968
00:52:58,175 --> 00:53:00,351
you know, hell
through purgatory to paradise.

969
00:53:00,525 --> 00:53:03,180
We had a video
""Convicted in Life,""

970
00:53:03,354 --> 00:53:07,532
and it was using a lot
of imagery from that actual book

971
00:53:07,706 --> 00:53:09,360
that translated
into this imagery.

972
00:53:09,534 --> 00:53:11,710
That was really incredible
in what he was writing,

973
00:53:11,884 --> 00:53:15,192
and he used that in the imagery
of the actual video.

974
00:53:15,844 --> 00:53:17,844
I love all the dark side
of things, I actually have

975
00:53:17,890 --> 00:53:19,848
another thrash band
with my sons, Hatriot.

976
00:53:20,022 --> 00:53:23,722
And we did a song
about the Countess Báthory,

977
00:53:23,896 --> 00:53:25,830
called ""And Your Children
to Be Damned,"" and we were

978
00:53:25,854 --> 00:53:28,422
completely drenched in blood
through the whole video.

979
00:53:28,596 --> 00:53:30,996
And people didn't like it. But
I liked it because I was like,

980
00:53:31,120 --> 00:53:33,098
""Well, I never got to be in a
horror movie, so I wanted to be

981
00:53:33,122 --> 00:53:34,863
drenched in blood
and something.""

982
00:53:35,037 --> 00:53:37,649
So I made the director drench us
all in blood and it was cool.

983
00:53:37,823 --> 00:53:39,651
So it's, it's,
it's always been a part of it.

984
00:53:39,825 --> 00:53:43,132
I write... my stuff is usually
about that, that, that,

985
00:53:43,307 --> 00:53:45,352
that darker side of things,
you know?

986
00:53:45,526 --> 00:53:47,417
We had a band a long time ago
that existed for, like, a minute

987
00:53:47,441 --> 00:53:48,834
called Haunted Garage.

988
00:53:49,008 --> 00:53:51,053
The lead singer's name is
Dukey Flyswatter.

989
00:53:51,228 --> 00:53:54,840
He ended up being in Jim Rose
Circus Sideshow thing for a while.

990
00:53:55,014 --> 00:53:57,295
So they're still doing it
out there, and he's still, like,

991
00:53:57,451 --> 00:54:00,038
he's done a bunch of acting, a
bunch of, like, low-grade horror movies

992
00:54:00,062 --> 00:54:02,432
and stuff, so they're still out
there doing stuff. So it's funny.

993
00:54:02,456 --> 00:54:04,458
They're kind of
on the same wavelength as GWAR,

994
00:54:04,632 --> 00:54:06,373
but they were
a little more psychological.

995
00:54:06,547 --> 00:54:08,984
It was like they would perform
autopsies on stage.

996
00:54:09,158 --> 00:54:11,900
Like, I mean,
it was dark, dark shit.

997
00:54:12,074 --> 00:54:13,748
But I can remember seeing that,
and just being

998
00:54:13,772 --> 00:54:16,818
like, ""Whoa!"" You know?
""What the hell is this?""

999
00:54:16,992 --> 00:54:21,736
We, like, dove right into the
whole concept that we were, like, uh,

1000
00:54:21,910 --> 00:54:25,218
a B horror movie on steroids,

1001
00:54:25,392 --> 00:54:28,569
Ghost is just like Papa.

1002
00:54:28,743 --> 00:54:30,703
The singer's got his face
painted up like a skull,

1003
00:54:30,876 --> 00:54:32,617
and he's dressed
like the priest.

1004
00:54:32,791 --> 00:54:35,750
That's awesome, you know,
that's like horror rock

1005
00:54:35,924 --> 00:54:37,484
or shock rock,
or what everyone call it.

1006
00:54:37,622 --> 00:54:40,581
We tend to go
retrospectively back

1007
00:54:40,755 --> 00:54:45,064
in order to recreate a lot of visual
elements that we just find pleasing.

1008
00:54:45,717 --> 00:54:47,517
As much as we were influenced
by horror films,

1009
00:54:47,675 --> 00:54:49,895
it was also a fascination

1010
00:54:50,069 --> 00:54:53,028
with, uh, musicals, actually.

1011
00:54:53,202 --> 00:54:55,944
Simple example is obviously
The Phantom of the Opera.

1012
00:54:56,423 --> 00:54:57,772
You don't know who's underneath,

1013
00:54:57,946 --> 00:54:59,818
and it could be
whatever you like.

1014
00:55:00,340 --> 00:55:02,995
Marilyn and I jousted in the
press when he first came out

1015
00:55:03,169 --> 00:55:07,260
because he was
the, uh, Priest in the satanic,

1016
00:55:07,434 --> 00:55:09,871
you know, Anton LaVey's thing,
all that whole thing.

1017
00:55:10,394 --> 00:55:11,394
And I'm Christian.

1018
00:55:11,917 --> 00:55:12,917
And, you know,

1019
00:55:13,745 --> 00:55:15,137
I, I kind of, uh,

1020
00:55:15,312 --> 00:55:17,488
our theology
didn't match up at all.

1021
00:55:17,662 --> 00:55:20,839
And then we toured together.
And had a great time.

1022
00:55:21,013 --> 00:55:23,885
I think the scariest thing
about Marilyn was the videos.

1023
00:55:24,364 --> 00:55:27,236
The girl that did the videos
was really good.

1024
00:55:27,759 --> 00:55:30,544
Really cemented
what Marilyn was about there.

1025
00:55:30,718 --> 00:55:33,808
I have been kissed
by Marilyn Manson.

1026
00:55:33,982 --> 00:55:36,420
You don't get over that
in a hurry.

1027
00:55:36,594 --> 00:55:38,552
I recently met Jeordie White,

1028
00:55:38,726 --> 00:55:41,642
who actually is
in the Marilyn Manson's group.

1029
00:55:41,816 --> 00:55:44,776
He was influenced
by the horror genre.

1030
00:55:45,254 --> 00:55:47,344
As was, I guess, Marilyn.

1031
00:55:47,518 --> 00:55:48,519
We're more...

1032
00:55:49,476 --> 00:55:52,392
interested in, like,
the chaos, and the shock,

1033
00:55:52,566 --> 00:55:56,135
and the sexuality,
and confusion,

1034
00:55:56,309 --> 00:55:59,399
which is always somewhere
between Texas Chainsaw Massacre

1035
00:55:59,573 --> 00:56:01,923
and the Pink Flamingos
and John Waters' movie.

1036
00:56:02,097 --> 00:56:04,926
You know, those are the movies
that we would watch to get inspired by.

1037
00:56:05,100 --> 00:56:08,408
I really loved the whole,

1038
00:56:08,930 --> 00:56:11,150
the dark, outrageous,

1039
00:56:11,324 --> 00:56:13,631
cool look, great songs.

1040
00:56:14,632 --> 00:56:17,025
So I was really, um,
into the band

1041
00:56:17,199 --> 00:56:20,551
before I got into the band,
and luckily, you know,

1042
00:56:20,725 --> 00:56:22,727
it just, everything just
came together.

1043
00:56:22,901 --> 00:56:26,252
I don't wanna look like
a regular dude.

1044
00:56:26,426 --> 00:56:27,949
And I, I love,

1045
00:56:28,733 --> 00:56:32,171
you know, the makeup, like Jack
Pierce would do, all the Universal stuff,

1046
00:56:32,345 --> 00:56:36,697
and I really, really was so
influenced by him and his genius.

1047
00:56:36,871 --> 00:56:39,308
And luckily, being with Zombie,

1048
00:56:39,483 --> 00:56:41,354
it's just exactly what I grew up

1049
00:56:41,528 --> 00:56:43,661
loving and wanting to be,

1050
00:56:43,835 --> 00:56:46,185
and it's like a monster
with a guitar.

1051
00:56:46,838 --> 00:56:48,709
Wednesday 13
is really good at it.

1052
00:56:48,883 --> 00:56:51,016
He's fantastic.
Nobody turns a pun like he does

1053
00:56:51,190 --> 00:56:52,757
when it comes to horror,
you know?

1054
00:56:52,931 --> 00:56:55,194
And his music is great.
He's passionate about it.

1055
00:56:55,368 --> 00:56:56,693
And I think that's one
of the things you have to be.

1056
00:56:56,717 --> 00:56:58,197
You have to be passionate
about it.

1057
00:56:58,371 --> 00:57:01,243
The first Murderdolls single
that we did, uh,

1058
00:57:01,418 --> 00:57:04,551
was a song called ""Dead In
Hollywood,"" which originally was,

1059
00:57:04,725 --> 00:57:07,336
was on Frankenstein Drag Queens'
third album.

1060
00:57:07,511 --> 00:57:09,591
And it was originally called
""Hooray for Horrorwood,""

1061
00:57:09,687 --> 00:57:13,342
which I got from famous monsters
or creepy magazine

1062
00:57:13,517 --> 00:57:15,127
because there's a line
where it says,

1063
00:57:15,301 --> 00:57:18,783
""You can knock on Ed Wood,
but it won't do you no good.

1064
00:57:18,957 --> 00:57:20,785
Hey, Leatherface,
remove my face.""

1065
00:57:20,959 --> 00:57:23,614
And we had a part in the video
where Joe's a woman.

1066
00:57:23,788 --> 00:57:26,094
And he rips the face off,
and he's screaming,

1067
00:57:26,268 --> 00:57:28,183
You know? So we did
a little homage to that.

1068
00:57:28,357 --> 00:57:30,708
As far as horror goes
with what Wednesday 13

1069
00:57:30,882 --> 00:57:33,537
is it's just like,
""I'm just getting started.""

1070
00:57:33,711 --> 00:57:35,626
And I'm really
just getting started with it.

1071
00:57:35,800 --> 00:57:40,021
I have ideas and things that
I've never seen anybody do before

1072
00:57:40,195 --> 00:57:42,197
that I want to, to try.

1073
00:57:42,371 --> 00:57:43,677
Slayer, obviously

1074
00:57:44,199 --> 00:57:45,984
one of my favorite bands.

1075
00:57:46,506 --> 00:57:49,074
Extremely horror influence
throughout the year.

1076
00:57:49,248 --> 00:57:50,554
Many, many songs written

1077
00:57:50,728 --> 00:57:53,600
about horrible things,
serial killers.

1078
00:57:53,774 --> 00:57:55,950
And if a band could be
a horror movie, it would...

1079
00:57:56,124 --> 00:57:57,204
For me, it would be Slayer.

1080
00:57:57,343 --> 00:57:58,343
Jack the Ripper.

1081
00:57:58,387 --> 00:57:59,127
There's a lot of people

1082
00:57:59,301 --> 00:58:00,433
that have stories

1083
00:58:00,607 --> 00:58:03,654
based on that particular killer.

1084
00:58:03,828 --> 00:58:07,484
When you think about Iron Maiden Killers,
same thing. Eddie, with his hatchet.

1085
00:58:07,658 --> 00:58:10,443
There's, uh, several songs that
they have about that whole period,

1086
00:58:10,617 --> 00:58:13,707
roaming the streets, ""Murders
In the Rue Morgue,"" stuff like that.

1087
00:58:13,881 --> 00:58:16,481
A band that's doing really
interesting work right now is Behemoth.

1088
00:58:16,536 --> 00:58:19,147
It's kind of half artsy
and half horror movie.

1089
00:58:19,670 --> 00:58:21,256
You know, they're working
with this company named

1090
00:58:21,280 --> 00:58:23,120
and they're just doing
an amazing graphic work.

1091
00:58:23,195 --> 00:58:24,195
And we talked to Nergal.

1092
00:58:24,239 --> 00:58:25,284
He's obviously a massive,

1093
00:58:25,458 --> 00:58:26,938
massive fan of horror stuff.

1094
00:58:27,721 --> 00:58:30,724
So they're kind of incorporating
with... the lyrics with these crazy images.

1095
00:58:30,898 --> 00:58:32,813
That imagery has
always been there, you know?

1096
00:58:32,987 --> 00:58:34,728
The, the demons and the, uh,

1097
00:58:34,902 --> 00:58:37,252
all of that shit, you know?
It kind of goes hand in hand.

1098
00:58:37,426 --> 00:58:39,994
Type O Negative,
'cause they're just rule.

1099
00:58:40,168 --> 00:58:41,953
I would say
they were horror influenced.

1100
00:58:42,127 --> 00:58:43,432
- Totally.
- Yeah.

1101
00:58:43,607 --> 00:58:45,347
Dudes like Frankenstein, man.

1102
00:58:45,522 --> 00:58:47,393
Another band that has been

1103
00:58:47,567 --> 00:58:49,917
influential in many ways,

1104
00:58:50,091 --> 00:58:54,052
um, that I also strongly, like,
connect with, with, you know,

1105
00:58:54,226 --> 00:58:56,750
horror metal is definitely
The Misfits.

1106
00:58:57,359 --> 00:58:59,231
It might not be
super apparent in our music,

1107
00:58:59,405 --> 00:59:03,278
but it, it's melodically
and attitude-wise, it's...

1108
00:59:04,018 --> 00:59:07,239
I've always been
very influenced by Misfits.

1109
00:59:07,413 --> 00:59:11,069
It was the best combination of
punk and horror that I'd ever heard.

1110
00:59:11,635 --> 00:59:13,811
I mean, it doesn't get
much better than ""Vampira.""

1111
00:59:13,985 --> 00:59:15,726
It doesn't get much better
than ""Skulls.""

1112
00:59:15,900 --> 00:59:17,704
It doesn't get much better
than ""Horror Business.""

1113
00:59:17,728 --> 00:59:20,165
""Psycho '78,""
unless you saw the movie,

1114
00:59:20,339 --> 00:59:22,559
how the hell are you gonna
put that together, you know?

1115
00:59:22,733 --> 00:59:24,517
That's the stuff
that I love, man.

1116
00:59:24,691 --> 00:59:28,260
- It's that, that wry little...
- you know?

1117
00:59:28,434 --> 00:59:29,957
When I first heard
the Misfits, I heard

1118
00:59:30,131 --> 00:59:31,698
the music first, I...

1119
00:59:31,872 --> 00:59:34,527
Pretty cool. But then when I saw
what they looked like,

1120
00:59:35,223 --> 00:59:37,269
I was like,
""Okay, I totally get it.

1121
00:59:37,443 --> 00:59:39,488
I totally get
where they are coming from.""

1122
00:59:39,663 --> 00:59:42,361
I saw the album, you know,
their Mars, you know?

1123
00:59:42,535 --> 00:59:44,624
And the background
is a bat-rat-spider-crab

1124
00:59:44,798 --> 00:59:46,234
from Angry Red Planet.

1125
00:59:46,408 --> 00:59:48,628
I just thought
it was the most coolest thing,

1126
00:59:48,802 --> 00:59:51,544
'cause that's what
I wanted to do, you know?

1127
00:59:51,718 --> 00:59:54,068
It's just imagery. It's art.
It's, you know,

1128
00:59:54,242 --> 00:59:56,288
I can't write about puppies,
flowers, and rainbows.

1129
00:59:56,462 --> 00:59:57,637
Nobody's going to buy it.

1130
00:59:57,811 --> 00:59:59,552
And you want
that 15-year-old kid

1131
00:59:59,726 --> 01:00:01,641
to read the lyrics, and be like,

1132
01:00:01,815 --> 01:00:05,079
""Sick. These guys are fucked-up.
This is nuts."" You know? And...

1133
01:00:05,776 --> 01:00:07,908
It's all just imagery, man.
It's, it's art.

1134
01:00:08,692 --> 01:00:10,650
I remember when I was
probably like 19 or 20,

1135
01:00:10,824 --> 01:00:13,348
my friend was telling me, ""You
gotta go see this bang GWAR.""

1136
01:00:13,522 --> 01:00:16,202
I just heard they dress up of these
costumes, and it's a crazy show.

1137
01:00:16,351 --> 01:00:18,351
And then, When they still had
the girl in the band,

1138
01:00:18,484 --> 01:00:20,355
she wound up giving birth
on stage to a baby,

1139
01:00:20,529 --> 01:00:21,985
and they put it
through the wood chipper.

1140
01:00:22,009 --> 01:00:23,689
I thought that was
the greatest thing ever.

1141
01:00:23,881 --> 01:00:24,988
- And then...
- Did you take a date?

1142
01:00:25,012 --> 01:00:26,274
Huh? No, I didn't have a date.

1143
01:00:26,448 --> 01:00:27,848
Yeah. No girl wanted
to go see that.

1144
01:00:27,885 --> 01:00:29,445
GWAR for somebody
who is so over the top

1145
01:00:29,538 --> 01:00:31,584
and so silly
that it just worked.

1146
01:00:32,106 --> 01:00:33,412
It's pretty obvious

1147
01:00:34,152 --> 01:00:35,240
that it has...

1148
01:00:36,415 --> 01:00:38,983
comic books, horror films,

1149
01:00:39,636 --> 01:00:40,985
bloodlust,

1150
01:00:41,550 --> 01:00:43,161
Dungeons and Dragons,

1151
01:00:43,944 --> 01:00:45,511
Soupy Sales.

1152
01:00:46,251 --> 01:00:48,383
The horror expression
on someone's face

1153
01:00:48,557 --> 01:00:49,950
when, when we murder them

1154
01:00:50,124 --> 01:00:51,909
and they're bleeding and dying,

1155
01:00:52,083 --> 01:00:54,607
and, and it's just
a really happy moment.

1156
01:00:54,781 --> 01:00:58,437
But horror is, uh, you know,
it's a great genre. We love it.

1157
01:00:58,611 --> 01:01:00,918
It's a great way
to make meaning, and we're lucky

1158
01:01:01,092 --> 01:01:03,529
to be a part of... I don't know
what the fuck I'm saying.

1159
01:01:03,703 --> 01:01:06,227
There's a band that I really
love called Cannibal Corpse,

1160
01:01:06,401 --> 01:01:08,273
and they do a lot of horror,
kind of, like,

1161
01:01:08,795 --> 01:01:12,059
lyrics about chopping up people
and all that kind of stuff.

1162
01:01:12,233 --> 01:01:13,974
Every one of their words
in their songs

1163
01:01:14,148 --> 01:01:16,107
are like mini horror stories.

1164
01:01:16,281 --> 01:01:19,240
Mini killing stories,
murder stories.

1165
01:01:19,414 --> 01:01:23,723
Real sick, twisted,
bloody, gory tales

1166
01:01:23,897 --> 01:01:27,379
told in three-minute
blast beats.

1167
01:01:27,553 --> 01:01:31,209
And with these lyrics that are
like, ""Oh, my God, a comic book.""

1168
01:01:31,383 --> 01:01:33,515
We'd look at our stuff
as just like...

1169
01:01:34,603 --> 01:01:36,301
um, brutal...

1170
01:01:37,128 --> 01:01:41,045
metal soundtrack over horror
stories, you know? Horror movies.

1171
01:01:41,219 --> 01:01:43,619
Some of them being graphic,
some of them being psychological,

1172
01:01:43,787 --> 01:01:45,907
and some of them, you know,
some of our songs are just

1173
01:01:46,006 --> 01:01:47,486
fucking Fulci.
You know what I mean?

1174
01:01:47,660 --> 01:01:49,531
Some of them are,
you know, dead alive.

1175
01:01:49,706 --> 01:01:51,229
Just, you know,
just blood and gore.

1176
01:01:51,403 --> 01:01:53,492
And some of them are
more psychological.

1177
01:01:53,666 --> 01:01:55,189
You know, where it's just,

1178
01:01:55,363 --> 01:01:58,323
you know, it's the, the, the f...
The horror and the fear,

1179
01:01:58,497 --> 01:02:00,629
certain things and,
and them happening.

1180
01:02:00,804 --> 01:02:04,895
King Diamond is probably very
underrated when it comes to that stuff,

1181
01:02:05,069 --> 01:02:07,462
But look at his albums,
his albums or movies.

1182
01:02:07,636 --> 01:02:09,290
And he will paint that all day.

1183
01:02:09,464 --> 01:02:14,295
King is probably
the heir apparent to Alice.

1184
01:02:14,469 --> 01:02:17,124
But I do believe that Alice
heavily influenced him.

1185
01:02:17,603 --> 01:02:20,214
Portal, hands down.

1186
01:02:20,388 --> 01:02:23,957
They to me, sound like

1187
01:02:24,828 --> 01:02:28,701
the chaotic, swaying...

1188
01:02:30,137 --> 01:02:32,531
off kilter world

1189
01:02:32,705 --> 01:02:36,013
that Lovecraft invented

1190
01:02:36,187 --> 01:02:39,581
and their lyrics are fucking...

1191
01:02:40,539 --> 01:02:41,932
genius.

1192
01:02:42,106 --> 01:02:44,935
I'm sorry. Hands down, Portal.

1193
01:02:45,109 --> 01:02:48,634
Death is one of the bands. All the
old Death songs and, and, and, um,

1194
01:02:48,808 --> 01:02:51,593
you know, ""Scream Bloody Gore""
is reanimated, you know.

1195
01:02:51,768 --> 01:02:54,771
Um, and then they have the song ""Evil
Dead,"" you know? So extremely gore.

1196
01:02:54,945 --> 01:02:57,599
Definitely you can see
throughout that whole album.

1197
01:02:57,774 --> 01:03:02,256
We're at Knotfest, idiot. Of course,
Slipknot stands out as a horror band.

1198
01:03:02,430 --> 01:03:04,669
They've been around for a long
fucking time paying their dues.

1199
01:03:04,693 --> 01:03:06,478
I mean, it's fucking good shit.

1200
01:03:06,652 --> 01:03:08,785
Yeah, they're badass musicians.

1201
01:03:09,437 --> 01:03:13,224
And they're fucking, their masks are
pretty sick. They're pretty scary, right?

1202
01:03:13,398 --> 01:03:16,140
I mean, they're not as scary
as us, but they're pretty scary.

1203
01:03:16,314 --> 01:03:18,925
I think Slipknot's probably the
best example of a modern-day band

1204
01:03:19,099 --> 01:03:21,232
that's kind of adapted
that Kiss imagery.

1205
01:03:21,406 --> 01:03:23,625
It also gives them
a uniform look, which I liked.

1206
01:03:23,800 --> 01:03:25,821
There was that thing about Kiss. I mean,
even though they had these garish costumes,

1207
01:03:25,845 --> 01:03:28,108
they were a gang.
You could see this.

1208
01:03:28,282 --> 01:03:30,154
I think,
because I was a horror fan,

1209
01:03:30,328 --> 01:03:32,939
and all the guys in the band
were horror fans,

1210
01:03:33,113 --> 01:03:36,551
we knew how to set that tone.

1211
01:03:36,725 --> 01:03:39,380
We knew how to set that mood
of foreboding, you know,

1212
01:03:39,554 --> 01:03:41,469
and just closing people in.

1213
01:03:41,643 --> 01:03:44,733
You know, the masks, there's
always been this byproduct

1214
01:03:44,908 --> 01:03:46,648
where people have always assumed

1215
01:03:46,823 --> 01:03:49,521
that we started wearing them
for shock value.

1216
01:03:49,695 --> 01:03:52,132
But it was always
so much more artistic than that.

1217
01:03:52,306 --> 01:03:54,439
It was about letting
that other person out,

1218
01:03:54,613 --> 01:03:58,486
which I think is very much in line
with why Michael Myers wore it.

1219
01:03:58,660 --> 01:04:01,707
He put it on
so he could let that beast out.

1220
01:04:01,881 --> 01:04:04,710
This music is coming
from a person inside me

1221
01:04:04,884 --> 01:04:07,887
that I may not be able to show
the world around me.

1222
01:04:08,453 --> 01:04:11,282
So I put this mask on.
And then all of a sudden, boom.

1223
01:04:11,456 --> 01:04:13,197
There he is.

1224
01:04:19,377 --> 01:04:23,337
Metal and horror work so well
together, don't they?

1225
01:04:24,599 --> 01:04:25,949
Don't they, Christopher?

1226
01:04:29,387 --> 01:04:31,955
Oh, yes, I can see you.

1227
01:04:35,132 --> 01:04:36,307
How are you doing this?

1228
01:04:37,743 --> 01:04:41,007
Let's just say
I'm not a prerecorded video.

1229
01:04:41,747 --> 01:04:43,227
I am a messenger.

1230
01:04:44,184 --> 01:04:46,970
Have a seat, so we may continue

1231
01:04:47,579 --> 01:04:48,579
your lesson.

1232
01:04:54,020 --> 01:04:57,154
You are the lone survivor
of the apocalypse, Christopher.

1233
01:04:58,372 --> 01:05:02,028
The last one to acquire the
knowledge that I have to share.

1234
01:05:03,638 --> 01:05:04,857
I'm the only survivor?

1235
01:05:06,163 --> 01:05:07,294
Yes.

1236
01:05:08,034 --> 01:05:11,559
You're the lone survivor
of an empty, desolate world.

1237
01:05:12,212 --> 01:05:13,866
The last remaining human...

1238
01:05:15,433 --> 01:05:16,956
to absorb this knowledge.

1239
01:05:19,089 --> 01:05:21,134
Hasn't there been enough horror
in the world?

1240
01:05:21,918 --> 01:05:23,789
This is hell.

1241
01:05:24,790 --> 01:05:26,879
We all need an escape
from time to time.

1242
01:05:27,401 --> 01:05:29,186
It's entertainment, Christopher.

1243
01:05:29,360 --> 01:05:31,710
Let us move forward.

1244
01:05:31,884 --> 01:05:33,930
We will now cover
a few segments,

1245
01:05:34,104 --> 01:05:38,238
starting with the use of
horror artwork on album covers.

1246
01:05:38,891 --> 01:05:41,589
And the creation
of horror film soundtracks.

1247
01:05:42,068 --> 01:05:44,636
Then, we will take a look
at the meeting grounds

1248
01:05:44,810 --> 01:05:47,639
for the fans of metal and horror

1249
01:05:48,205 --> 01:05:50,294
in the form of conventions.

1250
01:05:50,468 --> 01:05:51,730
Here we go.

1251
01:05:52,426 --> 01:05:56,082
What I liked was
the horror movie imagery

1252
01:05:56,256 --> 01:05:58,693
on the stage,
on the album covers.

1253
01:05:58,867 --> 01:06:01,609
I mean, Iron Maiden, still one
of my all-time favorite bands.

1254
01:06:01,783 --> 01:06:03,524
One of my
top three favorite bands,

1255
01:06:03,698 --> 01:06:06,745
with thebest marketing idea
ever. Of Eddie.

1256
01:06:06,919 --> 01:06:09,008
You see the imagery of Eddie,
you know what it is.

1257
01:06:09,182 --> 01:06:12,446
Every album,
Eddie's got a new, uh, look.

1258
01:06:12,620 --> 01:06:14,622
They go to space,
Somewhere in Time.

1259
01:06:14,796 --> 01:06:16,973
They go to Egypt, Powerslave,
he's the mummy Eddie.

1260
01:06:17,147 --> 01:06:18,757
You go to Canada,
He's a Mountie.

1261
01:06:18,931 --> 01:06:20,802
You go to Russia,
he's a Bolshevik.

1262
01:06:20,977 --> 01:06:23,109
Anywhere you go
around the world,

1263
01:06:23,283 --> 01:06:26,199
Eddie can be something
from that culture

1264
01:06:26,373 --> 01:06:28,114
that comes directly
from horror movies.

1265
01:06:28,288 --> 01:06:30,608
We've seen Eddie so much,
but he's a zombie with long hair.

1266
01:06:31,161 --> 01:06:33,554
But he's Eddie.
He's become so classic.

1267
01:06:33,728 --> 01:06:35,489
Well, I remember
the first Iron Maiden record.

1268
01:06:35,513 --> 01:06:36,905
As little kids, we took our,

1269
01:06:37,080 --> 01:06:38,840
well, me and my friends,
uh, went on our bikes

1270
01:06:38,864 --> 01:06:41,016
to this record store, um,
and I saw the first Iron Maiden.

1271
01:06:41,040 --> 01:06:43,080
I'm like, ""This has to be good.
Look at this cover.""

1272
01:06:43,216 --> 01:06:45,479
And it was like $7.99.
I'm gonna take a chance on it.

1273
01:06:45,653 --> 01:06:48,133
Like, I get back home and listen
to it and it was amazing so...

1274
01:06:48,787 --> 01:06:51,227
Th... It'll definitely, a cover
would definitely do it for me.

1275
01:06:51,311 --> 01:06:55,185
I bought that record without knowing it
at, at all what Iron Maiden sounded like.

1276
01:06:55,968 --> 01:06:58,057
But I see a zombie on the cover.

1277
01:06:58,231 --> 01:07:00,842
And this really cool font
for a logo.

1278
01:07:01,452 --> 01:07:04,977
And it was in the metal section
in the store. This was in 1980.

1279
01:07:05,456 --> 01:07:07,129
So, I, I... ""All right,
all right, it's a metal band.

1280
01:07:07,153 --> 01:07:08,763
And look at that guy
on the cover.

1281
01:07:08,937 --> 01:07:10,678
Holy shit! Look at that dude.""

1282
01:07:10,852 --> 01:07:14,595
Eddie trans... He, he, like,
transformed Iron Maiden.

1283
01:07:14,769 --> 01:07:16,902
It's like, obviously,
he became that icon.

1284
01:07:17,076 --> 01:07:19,948
Just like Megadeth has their
icon. Everyone was looking for, like,

1285
01:07:20,123 --> 01:07:22,723
""Who are we going to have for our
'symbol' of the band?"" You know?

1286
01:07:22,777 --> 01:07:25,606
The inspiration for our mascot,
Vic Rattlehead, is really simple.

1287
01:07:25,780 --> 01:07:28,740
I think a lot of people
have looked at it and missed it.

1288
01:07:28,914 --> 01:07:32,352
It's so in your face. It's, ""See no
evil, speak no evil, hear no evil.""

1289
01:07:32,526 --> 01:07:34,093
That's it. I drew the guy,

1290
01:07:34,876 --> 01:07:36,052
then we...

1291
01:07:37,227 --> 01:07:40,882
put the bones behind it
for being kind of like a pirate.

1292
01:07:41,057 --> 01:07:43,320
And then we changed
his head to it.

1293
01:07:43,494 --> 01:07:45,800
So that, you know,
you're stuck to this lifestyle

1294
01:07:45,974 --> 01:07:47,454
because, you know,
as troubadours,

1295
01:07:47,628 --> 01:07:50,153
we really are marauders
going from town to town.

1296
01:07:50,327 --> 01:07:53,547
I think an album cover artwork,
its purpose is to say,

1297
01:07:53,721 --> 01:07:55,288
""You can't hear me,
but look at me.

1298
01:07:55,462 --> 01:07:57,116
I'm cool enough,
you wanna hear me.""

1299
01:07:57,290 --> 01:08:00,076
It wouldn't be much different
from how movie theaters

1300
01:08:00,250 --> 01:08:01,773
would drag people in, you know?

1301
01:08:01,947 --> 01:08:06,212
Um, or billboards or, you know,

1302
01:08:06,386 --> 01:08:08,040
film posters,
especially the '80s...

1303
01:08:08,214 --> 01:08:10,260
Well, late '70s, early '80s,

1304
01:08:10,434 --> 01:08:13,828
always dripping with blood,
and people love that kind of thing.

1305
01:08:14,002 --> 01:08:16,092
There's been a band
called Ghost,

1306
01:08:16,266 --> 01:08:17,963
which I'd... I took a liking to,

1307
01:08:18,137 --> 01:08:22,098
and then I saw the cover,
their first album.

1308
01:08:22,272 --> 01:08:24,535
I saw and I'm like,
""Wow, this is Salem's Lot.""

1309
01:08:24,709 --> 01:08:27,015
I just loved
the whole aesthetic of that,

1310
01:08:27,538 --> 01:08:31,411
of that group, you know? It
just has everything that I love.

1311
01:08:31,585 --> 01:08:34,806
I remember walking through
Sears department store

1312
01:08:34,980 --> 01:08:37,852
and seeing Kiss Love Gun.
It just came out.

1313
01:08:38,026 --> 01:08:41,552
I remember it was like
this music group of monsters.

1314
01:08:41,726 --> 01:08:45,556
And so I bought it just on the
cover, and it interchanged my life.

1315
01:08:45,730 --> 01:08:50,996
The Brain Drainalbum cover of
the Ramones is art work of a ghost.

1316
01:08:51,170 --> 01:08:54,391
It would attract the buyer
to the album

1317
01:08:54,565 --> 01:08:58,525
that obviously was a horror or sci-fi
fan, or metal, or punk. Whatever it is.

1318
01:08:58,699 --> 01:09:02,094
Well, Cannibal Corpse definitely
has the most grotesque

1319
01:09:02,268 --> 01:09:04,183
horror album covers ever.

1320
01:09:04,357 --> 01:09:07,404
You know, people being
disemboweled and all kinds of crazy stuff.

1321
01:09:07,578 --> 01:09:09,536
They, they probably take
the cake as far

1322
01:09:09,710 --> 01:09:12,713
as gory album covers.

1323
01:09:12,887 --> 01:09:16,630
When I recently got Cannibal
Corpse Tomb of the Mutilatedon vinyl,

1324
01:09:16,804 --> 01:09:21,157
it's one of the most horrific and
shocking album covers that you'll ever see,

1325
01:09:21,331 --> 01:09:24,334
and I love it
because it's shocking as hell.

1326
01:09:24,508 --> 01:09:27,989
Yeah, I think about the covers
we have, some of them are just...

1327
01:09:29,339 --> 01:09:31,882
Butchered at Birth, I mean, come
on. And, and that pisses people off

1328
01:09:31,906 --> 01:09:33,169
like to no end, you know?

1329
01:09:33,343 --> 01:09:34,798
You start messing
with babies and stuff.

1330
01:09:34,822 --> 01:09:37,085
Ozzy Osbourne, Blizzard of Ozz

1331
01:09:37,260 --> 01:09:38,739
is one that sticks in my mind

1332
01:09:38,913 --> 01:09:40,698
as far as just being
an amazing album.

1333
01:09:40,872 --> 01:09:42,917
Uh, Bark at the Moonis like,

1334
01:09:43,091 --> 01:09:46,007
obviously him as a werewolf
was pretty fucking cool.

1335
01:09:46,182 --> 01:09:49,097
Diary of a Madmancover had the
upside-down cross at the background.

1336
01:09:49,272 --> 01:09:51,361
Ozzy's bloody. He's got
a little kid over there.

1337
01:09:51,535 --> 01:09:53,841
So that was
a little, a little frightening.

1338
01:09:54,015 --> 01:09:56,148
Album covers are
just like posters, you know?

1339
01:09:56,322 --> 01:09:58,063
They're like movie posters.
They're like,

1340
01:09:58,237 --> 01:10:00,326
""Hey, if there is,
if it's a good album cover,

1341
01:10:00,500 --> 01:10:03,242
it's gonna give you a flavor of
what you're gonna be listening to.""

1342
01:10:03,416 --> 01:10:05,592
I think the late '70s

1343
01:10:05,766 --> 01:10:09,205
and right through the '80s
became such a fertile time.

1344
01:10:09,379 --> 01:10:12,904
You had people on one hand
doing horror music,

1345
01:10:13,078 --> 01:10:15,646
and you had people on the
other hand doing horror film.

1346
01:10:15,820 --> 01:10:19,258
And then somewhere in the middle,
where these two circles crossed,

1347
01:10:19,432 --> 01:10:20,694
you had a hybrid.

1348
01:10:20,868 --> 01:10:22,696
The one that kicked it off
for me was

1349
01:10:22,870 --> 01:10:24,394
Phantom of the Paradise.

1350
01:10:24,568 --> 01:10:26,134
That was heavy metal,

1351
01:10:26,309 --> 01:10:28,920
rock and roll, horror.

1352
01:10:29,094 --> 01:10:31,575
And that, to me, was

1353
01:10:31,749 --> 01:10:34,839
the piece that said it
that everybody had to go to.

1354
01:10:35,013 --> 01:10:37,798
Then you had things like Kiss
Meets the Phantom of the Park.

1355
01:10:37,972 --> 01:10:39,800
That was 1978.

1356
01:10:39,974 --> 01:10:42,281
So it wasn't really metal,
but it was Kiss

1357
01:10:42,455 --> 01:10:45,458
and it was a lot of their stuff,

1358
01:10:45,632 --> 01:10:47,199
so that kind of kicked it off.

1359
01:10:47,373 --> 01:10:48,722
But they have a film,

1360
01:10:48,896 --> 01:10:52,160
the first metal exploitation
horror film.

1361
01:10:53,161 --> 01:10:55,381
1980, Terror on Tour.

1362
01:10:55,555 --> 01:10:58,558
Then 1984, Alice Cooper,
Monster Dog.

1363
01:10:58,732 --> 01:11:01,082
Hard Rock Zombies, 1985.

1364
01:11:01,257 --> 01:11:04,260
Also, about 1986,
Maximum Overdrive,

1365
01:11:04,434 --> 01:11:06,958
Rock 'n' Roll Nightmare,
Black Roses,

1366
01:11:07,132 --> 01:11:10,135
Shock 'Em Dead,
A Nightmare on Elm Street 3.

1367
01:11:10,309 --> 01:11:13,747
I tend to like um, you know, that,
the whole Freddy Krueger thing.

1368
01:11:13,921 --> 01:11:15,619
I thought it was really
a great series.

1369
01:11:15,793 --> 01:11:18,186
And I remember
being so jealous at George Lynch

1370
01:11:18,361 --> 01:11:22,234
and, and Dokken for having
a song in that series.

1371
01:11:22,408 --> 01:11:24,821
They'd already titled the movie.
A lot of people think we came up

1372
01:11:24,845 --> 01:11:26,760
with the song ""Dream Warriors,""
but we didn't.

1373
01:11:26,934 --> 01:11:29,334
And that was the first time
somebody ever come to me and say,

1374
01:11:29,807 --> 01:11:33,027
""You write a song, but it has
to be called 'Dream Warriors, '

1375
01:11:33,201 --> 01:11:35,900
and the title 'Dream Warriors'
must be in the chorus.""

1376
01:11:36,074 --> 01:11:38,685
Dokken's ""Dream Warriors,""
they actually incorporated,

1377
01:11:38,859 --> 01:11:40,315
there's footage
in the video for that song

1378
01:11:40,339 --> 01:11:42,341
- of Freddy Krueger...
- Right.

1379
01:11:42,515 --> 01:11:45,233
And that was actually, that was
really something that was paired up,

1380
01:11:45,257 --> 01:11:46,824
I think, pretty, uh, directly,

1381
01:11:46,998 --> 01:11:48,565
as opposed
to where the other films

1382
01:11:48,739 --> 01:11:50,697
may have just licensed songs
or whatever.

1383
01:11:50,871 --> 01:11:52,917
Yeah, ""The Man Behind the Mask""
from Alice Cooper,

1384
01:11:53,091 --> 01:11:54,788
and the Friday the 13thmovie.

1385
01:11:54,962 --> 01:11:57,095
When you had
your new horror characters,

1386
01:11:57,269 --> 01:11:59,445
your Jasons
and your Michael Myers,

1387
01:11:59,619 --> 01:12:01,447
the new slasher films

1388
01:12:01,621 --> 01:12:03,841
sort of happened the same time
as metal did.

1389
01:12:04,450 --> 01:12:05,843
So there was a connection there.

1390
01:12:06,017 --> 01:12:10,238
If you saw
an action scene with Jason

1391
01:12:10,413 --> 01:12:14,895
and Freddy Krueger fighting, well, it
certainly wasn't gonna be violin music.

1392
01:12:15,635 --> 01:12:18,856
It was going to be...

1393
01:12:19,030 --> 01:12:22,338
aggressive kind of, uh, music.

1394
01:12:22,512 --> 01:12:24,577
That, and it worked together.
It just works together.

1395
01:12:24,601 --> 01:12:26,733
The bands are influenced
by horror movies

1396
01:12:26,907 --> 01:12:30,520
also because many horror movies,
they use the heavy metal.

1397
01:12:30,694 --> 01:12:34,654
Uh, included Dario, Dario Argento
use a lot of heavy metal for his film.

1398
01:12:34,828 --> 01:12:38,484
Dario Argento used it
really well and early.

1399
01:12:39,442 --> 01:12:41,095
And if you see his movie called
Phenomena,

1400
01:12:41,269 --> 01:12:44,795
he used heavy metal in that
really to a great effect.

1401
01:12:44,969 --> 01:12:47,754
If you listen to the soundtracks, or
if you go through the soundtracks

1402
01:12:47,928 --> 01:12:49,234
of The Return
of the Living Dead,

1403
01:12:49,408 --> 01:12:51,018
it was basically
a compilation of rock

1404
01:12:51,192 --> 01:12:54,761
and... punk songs.

1405
01:12:55,240 --> 01:12:57,198
When I watch
The Return of the Living Dead,

1406
01:12:57,373 --> 01:12:58,809
I still get goose bumps

1407
01:12:58,983 --> 01:13:02,029
when the skeleton comes up
and starts saying,

1408
01:13:02,203 --> 01:13:04,815
""Do you want a party?""

1409
01:13:04,989 --> 01:13:08,079
It was like, ""Okay,
now chaos is gonna ensue.""

1410
01:13:08,253 --> 01:13:10,864
Soundtracks for films

1411
01:13:11,038 --> 01:13:14,085
of the singles
were selling as well,

1412
01:13:14,259 --> 01:13:16,740
if not better than soundtracks

1413
01:13:16,914 --> 01:13:19,786
that were the composed score
to the, to the film.

1414
01:13:19,960 --> 01:13:21,571
Music is like the,

1415
01:13:22,093 --> 01:13:25,488
the unsung hero
of horror movies.

1416
01:13:25,662 --> 01:13:28,099
Especially you look at Psycho,
you look at Jaws,

1417
01:13:28,273 --> 01:13:31,363
you look at Halloween,
you look at Friday the 13th,

1418
01:13:31,537 --> 01:13:34,279
they really kind of
push the boundaries,

1419
01:13:34,453 --> 01:13:37,238
and I think that's one of the
reasons why horror is always

1420
01:13:37,413 --> 01:13:40,067
so at the forefront of,
musically,

1421
01:13:40,241 --> 01:13:42,592
just being able to kind of
get away with murder.

1422
01:13:50,164 --> 01:13:53,211
Every week of the year,

1423
01:13:53,777 --> 01:13:55,909
you can go
to a horror convention.

1424
01:13:56,083 --> 01:13:57,781
Can't go
to a romance convention,

1425
01:13:57,955 --> 01:13:59,391
can't go
to a Western convention,

1426
01:13:59,565 --> 01:14:02,176
can't even go
to a Star Warsconvention

1427
01:14:02,350 --> 01:14:03,439
every week of the year.

1428
01:14:03,613 --> 01:14:04,657
But every week of the year

1429
01:14:04,831 --> 01:14:06,964
in the United States, someplace,

1430
01:14:07,138 --> 01:14:08,531
there's a horror convention.

1431
01:14:08,705 --> 01:14:10,968
How and when
did horror conventions begin?

1432
01:14:11,142 --> 01:14:13,405
Well, I mean, I can tell you
when they began for me.

1433
01:14:13,579 --> 01:14:15,625
They began for me in the '80s,
uh, when magazines

1434
01:14:15,799 --> 01:14:18,279
like Fangoria,
Chiller Convention

1435
01:14:18,454 --> 01:14:20,499
and all of those
East Coast entities

1436
01:14:20,673 --> 01:14:22,303
started putting on a show
so everybody could be together.

1437
01:14:22,327 --> 01:14:25,373
But before that,
with Famous Monsters of Filmland

1438
01:14:25,548 --> 01:14:27,463
with James Warren
and Forrest J Ackerman,

1439
01:14:27,637 --> 01:14:29,552
they began in the 1970s,

1440
01:14:29,726 --> 01:14:31,606
when they held their
very first-ever convention,

1441
01:14:31,641 --> 01:14:34,557
I think in 1974
in New York City.

1442
01:14:34,731 --> 01:14:36,291
As they started to come up,
you're like,

1443
01:14:36,428 --> 01:14:39,126
""Wow, we have a history
of horror."" You know?

1444
01:14:39,300 --> 01:14:41,496
And that's why I think, you
know, things like Monsterpalooza

1445
01:14:41,520 --> 01:14:43,609
are thriving now
because they're showing you,

1446
01:14:43,783 --> 01:14:45,823
like, these are the people
who have done the makeup.

1447
01:14:45,959 --> 01:14:47,439
These are people
who are in the films.

1448
01:14:47,570 --> 01:14:49,090
And then here are
the films themselves.

1449
01:14:49,136 --> 01:14:51,138
So you have
a full-rounded presentation,

1450
01:14:51,312 --> 01:14:52,376
and that's something
for everyone.

1451
01:14:52,400 --> 01:14:53,967
My partner, Eben, is

1452
01:14:54,141 --> 01:14:56,622
the one that is
the brain trust of Mad Monster,

1453
01:14:56,796 --> 01:15:00,147
and his vision was to make
an old-school convention

1454
01:15:00,321 --> 01:15:03,194
because what we are selling
and what we're buying

1455
01:15:03,368 --> 01:15:05,849
is not stuff, it's memories.

1456
01:15:06,023 --> 01:15:09,417
I put to the rock and roll and
the horror movies thing together.

1457
01:15:10,375 --> 01:15:11,419
Sure, I am.

1458
01:15:11,594 --> 01:15:12,899
A friend of mine, Kevin Barbary,

1459
01:15:13,073 --> 01:15:14,771
who was
already attending conventions

1460
01:15:14,945 --> 01:15:17,425
way before... I ever did.

1461
01:15:17,600 --> 01:15:20,080
He brought the idea to us
to have a convention

1462
01:15:20,254 --> 01:15:22,605
up here where we added
a music festival

1463
01:15:22,779 --> 01:15:24,345
to the horror convention
as well.

1464
01:15:24,520 --> 01:15:27,000
This convention, I liked it
'cause we got to play

1465
01:15:27,740 --> 01:15:31,178
and, um, all great friends of
mine, and it was great to see 'em.

1466
01:15:31,352 --> 01:15:33,485
And it's cool
to have the show too.

1467
01:15:33,659 --> 01:15:38,098
I never had any interest
in throwing a festival before.

1468
01:15:38,621 --> 01:15:40,753
I just enjoyed showing
my friends horror films.

1469
01:15:40,927 --> 01:15:43,408
We're not like
the biggest festival,

1470
01:15:43,582 --> 01:15:46,803
but I think
we are a unique festival.

1471
01:15:46,977 --> 01:15:49,457
I think we show
killer fucking movies.

1472
01:15:49,980 --> 01:15:53,374
I know we have
killer fucking bands

1473
01:15:53,549 --> 01:15:55,420
year in and year out.

1474
01:15:55,594 --> 01:15:57,204
That's Housecore.

1475
01:15:57,378 --> 01:16:00,643
We're about to bring up
some badasses to the stage.

1476
01:16:00,817 --> 01:16:01,817
Who are...

1477
01:16:02,688 --> 01:16:04,168
dudes highly respected

1478
01:16:04,342 --> 01:16:07,954
in the worlds
of rock and roll and horror.

1479
01:16:08,128 --> 01:16:10,348
This will be
my second year in a row

1480
01:16:10,522 --> 01:16:13,090
hosting Kirk Hammett's
Fear FestEvil.

1481
01:16:13,264 --> 01:16:16,659
It's an honor, man. It's like my
community service to get to do that

1482
01:16:16,833 --> 01:16:18,835
because I'm able to get up
on stage and talk

1483
01:16:19,009 --> 01:16:21,925
about how much
these two worlds mean to me.

1484
01:16:22,099 --> 01:16:24,144
The Kirk Hammett's show, um,

1485
01:16:24,318 --> 01:16:27,017
yes, I was on stage
with those guys, so...

1486
01:16:27,191 --> 01:16:30,237
A lot of the metal guys,
you know, have been inspired

1487
01:16:30,411 --> 01:16:32,239
by some of the movies I do.

1488
01:16:32,413 --> 01:16:33,937
Fear FestEvil was great.

1489
01:16:34,111 --> 01:16:36,853
Um, I got to go up
with my buddy Joel Harlow,

1490
01:16:37,027 --> 01:16:40,247
the fucking genius
makeup affects guy.

1491
01:16:40,421 --> 01:16:42,075
He's Johnny Depp's guy.

1492
01:16:42,641 --> 01:16:46,471
He did a live application
on stage in front of an audience

1493
01:16:46,645 --> 01:16:48,473
and turned me
into Jack the Ripper.

1494
01:16:48,647 --> 01:16:50,867
I would just sit in a chair
just so I could get made up,

1495
01:16:51,041 --> 01:16:53,652
look at myself in the mirror,
and then take a picture of it

1496
01:16:53,826 --> 01:16:55,266
and go, ""Wow,
look what I did today.""

1497
01:16:55,349 --> 01:16:56,949
Like it's the coolest
thing in the world.

1498
01:16:57,090 --> 01:17:00,006
I think like in Kirk's case,
when I first met him,

1499
01:17:00,180 --> 01:17:02,182
he gave me a signed copy
of his book

1500
01:17:02,356 --> 01:17:03,836
Too Much Horror Business,

1501
01:17:04,010 --> 01:17:05,751
and I right away read that book,

1502
01:17:05,925 --> 01:17:09,059
and I learned that Kirk
as a child, you know,

1503
01:17:09,233 --> 01:17:12,149
grew up with an intense interest
in horror films.

1504
01:17:12,323 --> 01:17:14,368
I was invited to his show,

1505
01:17:15,108 --> 01:17:17,371
uh, several years ago
in San Francisco

1506
01:17:17,545 --> 01:17:20,070
and had an absolutely
wonderful time there.

1507
01:17:20,244 --> 01:17:24,596
And then, I had the opportunity
to see a large portion

1508
01:17:24,770 --> 01:17:27,643
of his magnificent collection.

1509
01:17:27,817 --> 01:17:29,166
I don't know if I ever realized

1510
01:17:29,340 --> 01:17:30,907
what kind of
a collection he has,

1511
01:17:31,081 --> 01:17:33,823
and I think I've still only seen
just a portion of it.

1512
01:17:33,997 --> 01:17:37,522
I was privileged to attend
the convention.

1513
01:17:38,523 --> 01:17:41,004
And a concert that he put on
where he performed on stage.

1514
01:17:41,178 --> 01:17:43,963
And, and it was really
quite an experience.

1515
01:17:44,137 --> 01:17:46,377
I know there, there are people
out there who love horror.

1516
01:17:46,531 --> 01:17:48,359
I know there are people
who love heavy metal.

1517
01:17:48,533 --> 01:17:50,173
And I know there are people
who love both.

1518
01:17:50,230 --> 01:17:53,930
And basically,
I'm reaching out to those people

1519
01:17:54,104 --> 01:17:57,455
and saying, ""Hey, man, I'm into
it too. And I got a lot of cool stuff.

1520
01:17:57,629 --> 01:18:00,240
You can just come over and
check it out. And you know what?

1521
01:18:00,414 --> 01:18:02,001
I got a great guild
that I have assembled

1522
01:18:02,025 --> 01:18:04,288
of some really great cool bands

1523
01:18:04,462 --> 01:18:06,943
filled with guys
who love horror movies as well.

1524
01:18:07,117 --> 01:18:08,596
And, you know,
these are my buds.

1525
01:18:08,771 --> 01:18:10,729
And at the end,
we're gonna have a big old jam

1526
01:18:10,903 --> 01:18:12,775
because we just all love
the same stuff.""

1527
01:18:12,949 --> 01:18:14,167
And what it really is,

1528
01:18:14,341 --> 01:18:15,908
Fear FestEvil's
just a celebration

1529
01:18:16,082 --> 01:18:18,650
of both things,
horror and heavy metal.

1530
01:18:18,824 --> 01:18:21,784
I go to several conventions
a year.

1531
01:18:21,958 --> 01:18:26,223
And there really does seem to be a real
strong link between heavy metal and horror.

1532
01:18:26,397 --> 01:18:29,400
Lots of, uh,
what we would call metal heads

1533
01:18:29,574 --> 01:18:30,880
come to my table.

1534
01:18:31,054 --> 01:18:33,752
I see them everywhere, though.

1535
01:18:33,926 --> 01:18:35,246
Yeah, I see it
all over the world.

1536
01:18:35,406 --> 01:18:39,279
Every person that is not wearing
a horror T-shirt

1537
01:18:39,453 --> 01:18:42,152
is wearing a heavy metal
T-shirt, that's for sure.

1538
01:18:42,326 --> 01:18:47,026
It is the same kind of people,
I think the same clientele

1539
01:18:47,200 --> 01:18:49,289
that, that goes
to both of these things.

1540
01:18:49,463 --> 01:18:51,901
Horror movies
and heavy metal concerts.

1541
01:18:52,075 --> 01:18:54,991
They are quite, quite wonderful,

1542
01:18:55,513 --> 01:18:58,168
uh, and, uh, I love them all.

1543
01:18:58,864 --> 01:19:00,387
From the bottom of my heart...

1544
01:19:01,475 --> 01:19:02,475
thank you.

1545
01:19:04,827 --> 01:19:05,827
Thoughts?

1546
01:19:07,830 --> 01:19:09,222
Why does this matter now?

1547
01:19:10,267 --> 01:19:11,703
Horror conventions?

1548
01:19:11,877 --> 01:19:13,115
There are no more people around

1549
01:19:13,139 --> 01:19:15,054
to go to horror conventions.

1550
01:19:15,751 --> 01:19:17,927
But what great experiences
they were.

1551
01:19:18,536 --> 01:19:20,103
Men, women and children

1552
01:19:20,277 --> 01:19:22,409
from all over the world
came together

1553
01:19:22,583 --> 01:19:24,281
to share their mutual love

1554
01:19:24,455 --> 01:19:26,674
for such brilliant art forms.

1555
01:19:26,849 --> 01:19:29,416
But it's all gone now.

1556
01:19:31,157 --> 01:19:34,117
It's all gone,
and this is all pointless.

1557
01:19:37,033 --> 01:19:38,382
I, I'm done with this bullshit.

1558
01:19:40,950 --> 01:19:43,256
No need for hostility,
Christopher.

1559
01:19:44,301 --> 01:19:46,651
I am merely trying to share
my knowledge with you.

1560
01:19:47,870 --> 01:19:49,219
As it stands,

1561
01:19:49,872 --> 01:19:51,612
I am the only friend you have.

1562
01:19:52,700 --> 01:19:55,138
So please take a seat.

1563
01:19:56,487 --> 01:19:59,882
We have arrived at the
conclusion of your lesson.

1564
01:20:00,056 --> 01:20:01,666
The most crucial chapter.

1565
01:20:02,362 --> 01:20:04,103
Now is the time to find out

1566
01:20:04,277 --> 01:20:07,367
exactly why metal and horror
work so well together.

1567
01:20:07,541 --> 01:20:09,848
What is it that makes
these two genres

1568
01:20:10,022 --> 01:20:11,807
so compatible with one another?

1569
01:20:12,285 --> 01:20:15,462
It has all been
leading up to this.

1570
01:20:17,856 --> 01:20:19,858
Horror has become very visible.

1571
01:20:20,032 --> 01:20:22,078
And this is
where it gets interesting

1572
01:20:22,252 --> 01:20:24,384
in terms of sort of censors
trying to come in.

1573
01:20:24,558 --> 01:20:29,085
We had the, um, big videotape
censorship scandal in the, in the UK

1574
01:20:29,259 --> 01:20:31,179
with the, uh, the whole concept
of video nasties.

1575
01:20:31,304 --> 01:20:34,264
The efforts in the UK
were to look at extreme movies,

1576
01:20:34,438 --> 01:20:36,875
and put a lot
of these same boundaries

1577
01:20:37,049 --> 01:20:38,703
around these films

1578
01:20:38,877 --> 01:20:41,140
as you would
around pornography titles.

1579
01:20:41,314 --> 01:20:46,493
So all of a sudden, you have the
Evil Dead being treated the same way

1580
01:20:46,667 --> 01:20:48,321
as a woman blowing a donkey.

1581
01:20:48,495 --> 01:20:51,063
This fear that, that people
were watching stuff like

1582
01:20:51,237 --> 01:20:53,065
Driller Killeron video
in their homes

1583
01:20:53,239 --> 01:20:55,459
and they couldn't be trusted
with this material.

1584
01:20:55,633 --> 01:20:57,809
And it was opening up
their dark side,

1585
01:20:57,983 --> 01:20:59,463
and it would lead
to copycat killings.

1586
01:20:59,550 --> 01:21:01,117
Horror and, and, and metal

1587
01:21:01,291 --> 01:21:05,077
really became co-defendants

1588
01:21:05,251 --> 01:21:09,255
in the Satanic Panic scandal
of the late 1980s, early '90s,

1589
01:21:09,429 --> 01:21:10,798
People use that phrase
""Satanic Panic.""

1590
01:21:10,822 --> 01:21:13,564
They always focus
on the ""Satanic"" part.

1591
01:21:13,738 --> 01:21:16,436
But this was extreme
or too extreme.

1592
01:21:17,046 --> 01:21:19,570
They never focus
on the ""Panic"" part,

1593
01:21:19,744 --> 01:21:21,746
which is what it really was.

1594
01:21:22,225 --> 01:21:26,098
People overreacting,
misdirected...

1595
01:21:27,230 --> 01:21:30,189
and spending
all their energy freaking out

1596
01:21:30,755 --> 01:21:32,626
and not actually
fixing a problem.

1597
01:21:32,800 --> 01:21:35,673
There was a real sense
that if you watched

1598
01:21:36,152 --> 01:21:38,763
these things or were exposed
to these things,

1599
01:21:38,937 --> 01:21:42,071
it was dangerous, and it twisted
you and it made you into a monster.

1600
01:21:42,245 --> 01:21:45,552
Sometime around late 1984,
early 1985,

1601
01:21:45,726 --> 01:21:48,947
a group of wives
in Washington DC,

1602
01:21:49,121 --> 01:21:50,557
wives of
very influential people,

1603
01:21:50,731 --> 01:21:53,952
business people,
senators, congress people

1604
01:21:54,126 --> 01:21:56,824
were kind of having casual
conversations about the concerns

1605
01:21:56,999 --> 01:21:58,870
about the content of music.

1606
01:21:59,044 --> 01:22:01,786
They thought the lyrics were,
uh, too extreme.

1607
01:22:01,960 --> 01:22:04,223
They thought videos
that were recorded for songs

1608
01:22:04,397 --> 01:22:07,748
were often too graphic to
sexualize these type of things.

1609
01:22:07,923 --> 01:22:10,099
And their solution for this

1610
01:22:10,273 --> 01:22:12,884
was to create a group called the
Parents Music Resource Center.

1611
01:22:13,058 --> 01:22:16,235
They came up with this list,
called ""The Filthy Fifteen,""

1612
01:22:16,409 --> 01:22:19,195
Half of that list
is heavy metal artists.

1613
01:22:19,369 --> 01:22:22,024
So you had Black Sabbath.
You had Judas Priest.

1614
01:22:22,198 --> 01:22:24,287
You had Moötley Cruüe,
W.A.S.P., Venom,

1615
01:22:24,461 --> 01:22:28,247
AC/DC, Twisted Sister,
Def Leppard, Mercyful Fate.

1616
01:22:28,421 --> 01:22:31,424
It culminated
in September of 1985,

1617
01:22:31,598 --> 01:22:34,558
with hearings before the U. S.
Senate Commerce Committee

1618
01:22:34,732 --> 01:22:36,864
to decide what should be done
about this.

1619
01:22:37,039 --> 01:22:39,084
People went to jail
over this stuff.

1620
01:22:39,258 --> 01:22:42,609
People were sued, people had
incredible legal bills

1621
01:22:42,783 --> 01:22:44,481
because of this artwork
they decided to put

1622
01:22:44,655 --> 01:22:46,526
on the inside sleeve
of an album.

1623
01:22:46,700 --> 01:22:48,964
I mean, it destroyed people.

1624
01:22:49,616 --> 01:22:51,488
And it was all over nothing.

1625
01:22:51,662 --> 01:22:54,056
- You cannot legislate morality.
- Mr. Carter.

1626
01:22:54,230 --> 01:22:56,101
- Or music, or people's minds.
- There is no...

1627
01:22:56,275 --> 01:22:58,253
- But we'll bring you down, man.
- I have a teenage

1628
01:22:58,277 --> 01:23:00,117
- daughter.
- We're here. We'll bring you down.

1629
01:23:01,889 --> 01:23:04,370
In 1986, I was in a film
called Trick or Treat,

1630
01:23:04,544 --> 01:23:06,677
with Ozzy Osbourne
and Gene Simmons.

1631
01:23:06,851 --> 01:23:09,090
Two of the biggest names in heavy
metal music brought a lot to the movie.

1632
01:23:09,114 --> 01:23:11,832
I think that's, you know, a big
reason why people went the first place.

1633
01:23:11,856 --> 01:23:14,443
I don't think it was Skippy from
Family Ties who was the big draw.

1634
01:23:14,467 --> 01:23:17,209
It was right at the height
of that whole Tipper Gore,

1635
01:23:17,383 --> 01:23:20,082
anti-heavy metal music
warning labels

1636
01:23:20,256 --> 01:23:23,563
on the album's
trying to turn the tide of,

1637
01:23:23,737 --> 01:23:25,174
I don't know what she expected,

1638
01:23:25,348 --> 01:23:26,716
Pat Boone to come back
into style or something.

1639
01:23:26,740 --> 01:23:29,134
I don't know.
But, um, people forget

1640
01:23:29,308 --> 01:23:30,875
what a big deal that was
at the time.

1641
01:23:31,049 --> 01:23:32,896
And so this movie tapped
into that a little bit.

1642
01:23:32,920 --> 01:23:36,359
Eddie Ragman Weinbauer,
he's not the cool kid.

1643
01:23:36,533 --> 01:23:39,231
He's the heavy metal nerd.

1644
01:23:39,405 --> 01:23:41,965
You know, he decked out the
room and all the heavy metal posters,

1645
01:23:42,017 --> 01:23:43,697
and he had all the T-shirts
and everything.

1646
01:23:43,757 --> 01:23:45,648
You know, the girls don't care
about him and the guys

1647
01:23:45,672 --> 01:23:47,041
hate him, and everybody's
picking on him,

1648
01:23:47,065 --> 01:23:48,893
and he's kind of feeling
all alone.

1649
01:23:49,067 --> 01:23:52,114
And thenhishero comes back
to life in his bedroom,

1650
01:23:52,288 --> 01:23:55,726
through the backward masking
of the records and offers to help.

1651
01:23:55,900 --> 01:23:58,990
And how cool is that? Imagine that.
Who doesn't want someone to help them

1652
01:23:59,556 --> 01:24:00,861
get back at their bullies?

1653
01:24:01,340 --> 01:24:03,821
I think people, uh,
related to the Eddie character

1654
01:24:03,995 --> 01:24:06,606
'cause, uh, they were going
through the same thing, you know?

1655
01:24:06,780 --> 01:24:08,826
They were the outsiders
and the outcasts.

1656
01:24:09,000 --> 01:24:11,481
This movie gave them someone
that was like them.

1657
01:24:11,655 --> 01:24:16,051
The impulse to express yourself
and to explore pain,

1658
01:24:16,573 --> 01:24:18,836
suffering, transgression,

1659
01:24:19,010 --> 01:24:23,362
immorality, these are things
that are in our essential makeup.

1660
01:24:23,536 --> 01:24:25,582
We are interested
in our dark side

1661
01:24:25,756 --> 01:24:29,064
because without understanding
our dark side, we can't control it.

1662
01:24:29,238 --> 01:24:31,631
Heavy metal music
and horror films,

1663
01:24:31,805 --> 01:24:35,157
the people who are attracted to
them, attracted to them because

1664
01:24:35,809 --> 01:24:39,378
what is mainstream and normal
and popular doesn't work for them.

1665
01:24:39,552 --> 01:24:42,381
It doesn't frame the world
that they feel.

1666
01:24:42,555 --> 01:24:44,155
It doesn't frame the world
that they see.

1667
01:24:44,253 --> 01:24:46,603
It's a taboo thing that I think

1668
01:24:46,777 --> 01:24:48,822
connects with young people
because they think

1669
01:24:48,996 --> 01:24:51,477
it's a conduit to something
that they don't understand.

1670
01:24:51,651 --> 01:24:53,697
Or that they want to understand

1671
01:24:53,871 --> 01:24:56,328
and something they wanna see
that they've been forbidden to see.

1672
01:24:56,352 --> 01:24:59,964
The, um, heavy metal music

1673
01:25:00,138 --> 01:25:03,750
and the horror genre in films

1674
01:25:04,229 --> 01:25:10,061
have an interesting relationship
because they both pressed the evil side

1675
01:25:10,801 --> 01:25:11,932
of man.

1676
01:25:12,107 --> 01:25:14,413
The heavy metal artists are

1677
01:25:14,587 --> 01:25:17,416
pushing the frontier
and pushing the envelope

1678
01:25:17,590 --> 01:25:20,593
of their craft and their gift,

1679
01:25:20,767 --> 01:25:22,987
and their creativity.

1680
01:25:23,509 --> 01:25:25,859
There is a dark side
to heavy metal.

1681
01:25:26,686 --> 01:25:30,168
And there certainly is a
dark side to the horror genre.

1682
01:25:30,342 --> 01:25:33,258
The monster characters
scared people.

1683
01:25:33,432 --> 01:25:37,741
First time seeing the phantom on a
screen, or people change their looks.

1684
01:25:37,915 --> 01:25:39,482
They were shocking to people.

1685
01:25:39,656 --> 01:25:41,616
And I think the rock stars
scared a lot of people,

1686
01:25:41,788 --> 01:25:44,008
certainly the generation
before them.

1687
01:25:44,182 --> 01:25:47,446
Maybe that's why there's that
affiliation and associations

1688
01:25:47,620 --> 01:25:49,796
with one another
that they identify

1689
01:25:49,970 --> 01:25:52,625
to some degree, their genres.

1690
01:25:52,799 --> 01:25:56,586
Sometimes the shows are
theatrical, like King Diamond,

1691
01:25:56,760 --> 01:25:59,154
like Alice Cooper,
like Rob Zombie.

1692
01:25:59,328 --> 01:26:00,894
There is a visual feast
that goes along

1693
01:26:01,068 --> 01:26:03,462
with the, the audio, uh, feast.

1694
01:26:03,636 --> 01:26:06,073
People like a show.
And metal bands

1695
01:26:06,248 --> 01:26:09,294
and movies give people a show.
It's escapism.

1696
01:26:09,468 --> 01:26:14,734
As long as there are kids in
their teens going through angst,

1697
01:26:14,908 --> 01:26:16,301
there's gonna be
aggressive music,

1698
01:26:16,475 --> 01:26:18,260
and there's gonna be
aggressive imaging.

1699
01:26:18,434 --> 01:26:19,759
So between horror movies
and metal,

1700
01:26:19,783 --> 01:26:21,872
that certainly plays
a big part in it.

1701
01:26:22,046 --> 01:26:26,529
I think a lot of us in, who,
who chose to play heavy metal,

1702
01:26:26,703 --> 01:26:29,967
uh, or hard rock are
somewhat outcasts.

1703
01:26:30,141 --> 01:26:35,451
And I think we kind of look
at these monsters as, as too.

1704
01:26:35,625 --> 01:26:37,670
But there's something
that draws us together.

1705
01:26:37,844 --> 01:26:41,413
And f... for me, that was one way
of meeting people too.

1706
01:26:41,587 --> 01:26:43,589
Like, you're
a horror fan. Great.

1707
01:26:43,763 --> 01:26:46,363
We're gonna get along just great.
You like metal? Oh. Even better.

1708
01:26:46,462 --> 01:26:47,941
I think people
wanna feel something.

1709
01:26:48,115 --> 01:26:49,987
They wanna feel
something powerful,

1710
01:26:50,161 --> 01:26:52,076
and fear is one of those things.

1711
01:26:52,250 --> 01:26:54,330
And, you know, listening
to music is such an elation.

1712
01:26:54,426 --> 01:26:57,429
And metal, especially,
is so, you know, so angry.

1713
01:26:57,603 --> 01:27:00,171
When you're a kid, you know,
that just feeling something

1714
01:27:00,345 --> 01:27:02,025
is so important for people
who are fans of,

1715
01:27:02,173 --> 01:27:04,219
of metal and horror.

1716
01:27:04,393 --> 01:27:06,960
If you're the nerd in school,
if you're having...

1717
01:27:07,134 --> 01:27:09,659
Your parents are in your case,
or the bullies beaten you up,

1718
01:27:09,833 --> 01:27:12,183
you can go watch a horror movie
and, like, say like,

1719
01:27:12,357 --> 01:27:15,360
""If only this guy could
be killed by Michael Myers.""

1720
01:27:15,534 --> 01:27:18,320
Or listen to some heavy metal
and just get that aggression out.

1721
01:27:18,494 --> 01:27:20,583
Or go into a wrestling character
or something.

1722
01:27:20,757 --> 01:27:24,021
And there is a certain element
of show business that's dark.

1723
01:27:24,195 --> 01:27:26,850
Heavy metal music,
for the most part is, is made

1724
01:27:27,372 --> 01:27:30,506
for the same reasons that horror
movies are made, it's to let loose.

1725
01:27:30,680 --> 01:27:33,073
It's to free that fear,
it's to free that tension.

1726
01:27:33,248 --> 01:27:36,903
You are in this moment with,
with heavy metal music, you know?

1727
01:27:37,077 --> 01:27:38,427
Like in the mosh pit.

1728
01:27:38,601 --> 01:27:40,646
You're just letting go
of so much energy.

1729
01:27:40,820 --> 01:27:43,649
And so much emotion that should
just been sitting on you all day.

1730
01:27:44,302 --> 01:27:46,565
You know,
the escapism of heavy metal

1731
01:27:46,739 --> 01:27:49,742
is the same as the escapism of
just sitting down with your friends

1732
01:27:49,916 --> 01:27:52,310
and watching a shit ton
of fucking horror movies.

1733
01:27:52,484 --> 01:27:54,897
Which is honestly, there's
nothing better than that, you know?

1734
01:27:54,921 --> 01:27:56,836
Metal is violent.
Horror is violent.

1735
01:27:57,010 --> 01:27:58,621
Everybody likes
fucking violence.

1736
01:27:58,795 --> 01:28:00,579
Violence gets people's
dicks hard.

1737
01:28:00,753 --> 01:28:03,147
And when people's dicks
are hard, they have fucking fun.

1738
01:28:03,669 --> 01:28:07,151
- And then we chop them off.
- And then we chop your dick off.

1739
01:28:07,673 --> 01:28:10,807
There's some kind of an
aggressive feeling in the music that

1740
01:28:10,981 --> 01:28:13,679
kind of goes with that feeling
of superiority.

1741
01:28:13,853 --> 01:28:17,640
There's something very
testosterone-driven about metal music.

1742
01:28:17,814 --> 01:28:19,903
And I think that
if you're the killer,

1743
01:28:20,077 --> 01:28:21,861
if you're the monster,

1744
01:28:22,035 --> 01:28:25,604
you're in this place of massive
total annihilating control.

1745
01:28:25,778 --> 01:28:28,322
And I think that that's one of the
things that you feel as a player.

1746
01:28:28,346 --> 01:28:30,174
Rock and roll is the devil.

1747
01:28:30,348 --> 01:28:32,481
And horror is the devil too,

1748
01:28:32,655 --> 01:28:35,048
so it's perfectly natural.

1749
01:28:35,222 --> 01:28:38,051
I think of heavy metal
as really uncompromising.

1750
01:28:38,791 --> 01:28:41,925
You know, there are plenty of people
who don't like heavy metal. So what?

1751
01:28:42,099 --> 01:28:46,669
There are plenty of people who
don't like horror movies, and so what?

1752
01:28:46,843 --> 01:28:50,890
And I think that they share that
sense of ""We are what we are.""

1753
01:28:51,064 --> 01:28:55,242
And the world we represent
and are in is a very extreme one.

1754
01:28:55,417 --> 01:29:00,291
And it's not sweet and pretty like we'd like
to pretend or some people wanna pretend.

1755
01:29:01,423 --> 01:29:03,250
Horror and metal
work so well together

1756
01:29:03,425 --> 01:29:05,775
because of teenage boys.

1757
01:29:05,949 --> 01:29:08,212
We like scary stuff,

1758
01:29:08,386 --> 01:29:10,432
and we like heavy stuff.
It's exciting.

1759
01:29:10,606 --> 01:29:12,738
The whole
heavy metal sound again.

1760
01:29:12,912 --> 01:29:16,699
It's, uh, tempestuous guitars.
A lot of them.

1761
01:29:16,873 --> 01:29:18,440
And the lyrics are usually

1762
01:29:19,092 --> 01:29:24,489
some form of rebellion
and death, uh... danger.

1763
01:29:24,663 --> 01:29:26,491
And it's just slamming at you

1764
01:29:26,665 --> 01:29:29,364
with a beat, with a great beat.
I mean, who doesn't love that?

1765
01:29:29,538 --> 01:29:34,543
Pop music can be with chick flicks
or, or, or things like that, you know,

1766
01:29:34,717 --> 01:29:37,633
they just go hand in hand.
But luckily, we got the horror.

1767
01:29:38,285 --> 01:29:40,853
'Cause I think it's just
about ex... being extreme.

1768
01:29:41,027 --> 01:29:42,942
Extreme gore,
extreme being scared.

1769
01:29:43,116 --> 01:29:44,814
Extreme, it's just extreme.

1770
01:29:44,988 --> 01:29:47,730
Horror fans and metal fans
just are looking for that fix,

1771
01:29:48,383 --> 01:29:50,602
and that's what, you know,
metal and horror does.

1772
01:29:51,516 --> 01:29:55,477
You don't normally have extreme
pop songs that shock people.

1773
01:29:55,651 --> 01:29:57,348
When you want something extreme,

1774
01:29:57,522 --> 01:30:00,656
you take it to the highest level
it can go, which is heavy metal.

1775
01:30:00,830 --> 01:30:06,575
You can't just walk by a metal band
playing and not, ""Holy fuck! Whoa!""

1776
01:30:06,749 --> 01:30:10,100
You know, no matter what kind of music
do you like, horror is the same thing.

1777
01:30:10,274 --> 01:30:13,756
We're the extreme edges
of that art form.

1778
01:30:13,930 --> 01:30:17,586
It's a lot cooler
in the outer limits. Join us.

1779
01:30:17,760 --> 01:30:20,632
I think there's a lot of,
like, shock value with horror.

1780
01:30:20,806 --> 01:30:23,113
And I think with metal,
it's also the same thing.

1781
01:30:23,287 --> 01:30:27,378
You wanna have that impact. They're
gonna make you go to maybe a dark side

1782
01:30:27,552 --> 01:30:30,207
which everyone has
and they don't like to go to.

1783
01:30:30,381 --> 01:30:31,817
But It's kind of
make you realize

1784
01:30:31,991 --> 01:30:35,081
that this is a part
of humanity that exists.

1785
01:30:35,255 --> 01:30:37,170
It's like all the dark,

1786
01:30:37,344 --> 01:30:40,347
unrestrained urges
of destruction.

1787
01:30:40,913 --> 01:30:43,916
Yeah, you've got
plenty of scary images.

1788
01:30:44,700 --> 01:30:46,571
And the more you try
and escape yourself,

1789
01:30:46,745 --> 01:30:48,268
the more you'll see.

1790
01:30:48,878 --> 01:30:50,357
It just meshes well.

1791
01:30:50,532 --> 01:30:54,361
You know, if you have
extremely intense scene

1792
01:30:54,536 --> 01:30:57,843
in a horror film
where it has to be hard-driving,

1793
01:30:58,017 --> 01:31:00,498
scary and suspenseful and stuff,

1794
01:31:00,672 --> 01:31:02,413
I think metal music
works well with it.

1795
01:31:02,587 --> 01:31:06,983
That music is aggressive
and can be in your face.

1796
01:31:07,157 --> 01:31:09,638
And so can
many good horror movies too.

1797
01:31:09,812 --> 01:31:12,945
If you're listening to a heavy
metal album, it's a release.

1798
01:31:13,119 --> 01:31:15,228
People are in the mosh pit,
they're, they're working out

1799
01:31:15,252 --> 01:31:17,036
their angst in a horror movie.

1800
01:31:17,210 --> 01:31:18,884
It's kind of the same thing.
You see people getting,

1801
01:31:18,908 --> 01:31:21,258
you know, and you get all...

1802
01:31:21,432 --> 01:31:23,565
and, uh, in the end,
you know it's not real.

1803
01:31:23,739 --> 01:31:25,194
It's... That's, I think,
the bottom line.

1804
01:31:25,218 --> 01:31:27,090
It's kind of like a fantasy.

1805
01:31:27,264 --> 01:31:30,093
A good heavy metal song...

1806
01:31:31,094 --> 01:31:33,836
should be like
a good horror movie, you know?

1807
01:31:34,010 --> 01:31:38,318
Exciting to watch or listen to
with a lot of dynamics.

1808
01:31:38,493 --> 01:31:40,712
I'm not really sure
where it's gonna take you,

1809
01:31:40,886 --> 01:31:43,498
but once you get there,
you're glad to be there.

1810
01:31:43,672 --> 01:31:47,414
People are curious
about the morbid,

1811
01:31:47,589 --> 01:31:49,504
skittish about the morbid,

1812
01:31:49,678 --> 01:31:52,507
and decided about the morbid,

1813
01:31:52,681 --> 01:31:54,378
and what is considered morbid.

1814
01:31:54,552 --> 01:31:59,035
But their fans out there
of extreme bands

1815
01:31:59,209 --> 01:32:02,821
that play gore influence music,

1816
01:32:03,430 --> 01:32:08,261
that I think would like to live
that lifestyle or whatnot.

1817
01:32:08,435 --> 01:32:11,134
So many different connections.

1818
01:32:11,613 --> 01:32:14,485
The music and the horror genre

1819
01:32:14,659 --> 01:32:17,967
are defiant
against society, okay?

1820
01:32:18,141 --> 01:32:20,273
And those things work together.

1821
01:32:20,447 --> 01:32:24,060
They're just totally opposed
to anything conventional.

1822
01:32:24,234 --> 01:32:26,889
The real hardcore
horror fans are,

1823
01:32:27,063 --> 01:32:30,143
you know, a niche. They're like a
brotherhood. And fans of metal and hard rock

1824
01:32:30,196 --> 01:32:32,547
are very much the same.
They kind of feel like a little bit

1825
01:32:32,721 --> 01:32:36,376
of an outcast and maybe don't get
the attention or respect they deserve,

1826
01:32:36,551 --> 01:32:38,911
and I think they kind of gravitate
towards each other, some.

1827
01:32:39,075 --> 01:32:40,816
I did a music video
with Dee Snider,

1828
01:32:40,990 --> 01:32:44,341
and Alice Cooper called
""Be Chrool to Your Scuel.""

1829
01:32:44,515 --> 01:32:48,345
And Alice talks about Dee Snider
and himself being hard fanatics.

1830
01:32:48,519 --> 01:32:50,105
Every Saturday,
they're at horror movies.

1831
01:32:50,129 --> 01:32:52,654
And so I see a connection
in the heavy metal bands

1832
01:32:52,828 --> 01:32:55,874
of the people that I know
and horror movies.

1833
01:32:56,048 --> 01:32:59,922
Horror is the dark side of,
of, of movies or storytelling,

1834
01:33:00,096 --> 01:33:02,838
and I think our music is the
dark side of everything as well.

1835
01:33:03,012 --> 01:33:04,622
Heavy metal has
always been dark.

1836
01:33:04,796 --> 01:33:06,796
There's no puppy dogs
and ice cream in heavy metal.

1837
01:33:06,885 --> 01:33:10,280
At least alive puppy dogs and
ice cream without blood in it.

1838
01:33:10,454 --> 01:33:12,108
We want that aggression.

1839
01:33:12,282 --> 01:33:14,676
We want something that's almost,
in a sense, scary.

1840
01:33:14,850 --> 01:33:16,242
You go to a Slayer show,

1841
01:33:16,416 --> 01:33:18,810
and the anticipation
of that band coming on

1842
01:33:18,984 --> 01:33:22,184
when you're standing on the floor, where
you know that pit is going to break out,

1843
01:33:22,292 --> 01:33:24,860
is very similar to sitting
in a movie theater,

1844
01:33:25,034 --> 01:33:27,036
knowing that
something's gonna happen

1845
01:33:27,210 --> 01:33:28,690
that's gonna scare the shit
out of me.

1846
01:33:28,864 --> 01:33:31,867
As humans, I don't know why
some of us crave

1847
01:33:32,041 --> 01:33:33,782
and need that in our lives.

1848
01:33:33,956 --> 01:33:36,567
But I'm just glad
it's out there for us.

1849
01:33:38,003 --> 01:33:39,918
Listen to the sound of metal.

1850
01:33:40,092 --> 01:33:42,312
It's so focused on tri tones

1851
01:33:42,486 --> 01:33:45,402
and tensions that,
you know, it, it...

1852
01:33:46,011 --> 01:33:47,839
- What the fuck?
- We gotta go. Let's go.

1853
01:33:48,013 --> 01:33:50,252
All right. Well, we have to go.
And what I'm trying to tell you

1854
01:33:50,276 --> 01:33:53,149
is that the sound of metal,
metal sounds terrifying.

1855
01:33:53,323 --> 01:33:56,152
Movies are terrifying.
That's the connection for me.

1856
01:33:56,326 --> 01:33:58,434
For some reason, those
two genres maybe just connected

1857
01:33:58,458 --> 01:34:00,809
because they just,
they get no respect.

1858
01:34:02,027 --> 01:34:06,292
Which is fine because who cares?
They're still here.

1859
01:34:06,466 --> 01:34:10,557
I think the future is
a more cohesive bond.

1860
01:34:10,732 --> 01:34:15,388
Especially as movies become
more appreciative and respectful

1861
01:34:15,562 --> 01:34:17,434
of, uh, rock and roll
and heavy metal,

1862
01:34:17,608 --> 01:34:20,959
and industrial, all these
different kinds of, uh, musics

1863
01:34:21,133 --> 01:34:23,396
as a soundtrack to stories.

1864
01:34:23,570 --> 01:34:28,401
I think when you take a look at the,
uh, metal concept and the horror concept,

1865
01:34:28,575 --> 01:34:32,405
that they've intertwined so much
over the last three decades

1866
01:34:33,145 --> 01:34:36,061
that they will never unwind.
They'll always be together.

1867
01:34:36,235 --> 01:34:39,238
So you're going to see them continue
to evolve and develop together.

1868
01:34:39,412 --> 01:34:41,763
To watch where they go
and how they continue to grow,

1869
01:34:41,937 --> 01:34:43,697
I think it's gonna be
exciting for all of us,

1870
01:34:43,808 --> 01:34:47,116
both as the actors and
the performers, and as a fan.

1871
01:34:47,290 --> 01:34:50,902
You got to move forward.
You can't just stay in the past.

1872
01:34:51,076 --> 01:34:55,254
You've got to move forward. It'll never
stop because those are the main genres

1873
01:34:55,428 --> 01:34:58,301
that will appeal
to, uh, the audience.

1874
01:34:58,475 --> 01:35:02,740
To keep the history alive, I think
we need to embrace our fears.

1875
01:35:02,914 --> 01:35:06,439
If you talk about exorcising the
demons that are inside yourself,

1876
01:35:06,613 --> 01:35:08,933
the best way to do that is to
share them with other people.

1877
01:35:09,051 --> 01:35:11,009
I think metal and horror
will always be with us.

1878
01:35:11,183 --> 01:35:15,100
And when it starts fizzling out,
people start running out of ideas,

1879
01:35:15,274 --> 01:35:18,321
it would just, you know, like
everything go around in a circle

1880
01:35:18,495 --> 01:35:20,062
and we're back
at square one again.

1881
01:35:20,236 --> 01:35:22,804
I think that horror and...

1882
01:35:23,892 --> 01:35:27,504
heavy metal music are
going to stay together forever.

1883
01:35:27,678 --> 01:35:31,508
There's that angst
that everybody is drawn to.

1884
01:35:32,161 --> 01:35:34,641
These very dark images.

1885
01:35:34,816 --> 01:35:36,078
I think it's just,

1886
01:35:37,035 --> 01:35:38,689
just going to stay here forever.

1887
01:35:40,647 --> 01:35:42,084
And there you have it.

1888
01:35:42,911 --> 01:35:46,741
Metal and horror,
a perfect match.

1889
01:35:47,698 --> 01:35:49,395
Any questions?

1890
01:35:50,048 --> 01:35:54,574
Um, a crossover between the two
is fascinating and definitely unique.

1891
01:35:55,532 --> 01:35:57,316
Those attracted to the dark
and aggressive

1892
01:35:57,490 --> 01:35:59,971
clearly found their outlets
for expression and pleasure.

1893
01:36:00,624 --> 01:36:03,496
The two art forms go hand
in hand, without question.

1894
01:36:04,715 --> 01:36:06,543
Well, I'm happy
to hear you say that.

1895
01:36:07,892 --> 01:36:10,547
Your lesson is now complete.

1896
01:36:12,157 --> 01:36:14,507
So what happens now?

1897
01:36:15,552 --> 01:36:18,555
I give you the grand finale.

1898
01:36:19,861 --> 01:36:21,427
What's the grand finale?

1899
01:36:46,365 --> 01:36:47,453
Hello,

1900
01:36:48,063 --> 01:36:49,629
from the other side.

1901
01:37:31,497 --> 01:37:33,238
I just always liked
being scared.

1902
01:37:33,412 --> 01:37:35,066
I like the creativity
that's behind,

1903
01:37:35,240 --> 01:37:37,068
uh, being able
to scare somebody.

1904
01:37:37,242 --> 01:37:38,741
Always loved a really good
horror movie that could

1905
01:37:38,765 --> 01:37:40,376
kind of stick
with you afterwards.

1906
01:37:40,550 --> 01:37:43,422
I just grew up watching
that stuff at very young age

1907
01:37:43,596 --> 01:37:48,166
I know it's not very, you know,
a ""good parent thing to do.""

1908
01:37:48,340 --> 01:37:50,255
They're thrilling.
They're exciting.

1909
01:37:50,429 --> 01:37:52,581
-I mean, at certain times,
they're suspense... -Death metal!

1910
01:37:52,605 --> 01:37:54,477
And it's just a lot of fun
to watch either way,

1911
01:37:54,651 --> 01:37:56,174
I think people like
being scared,

1912
01:37:56,348 --> 01:37:58,481
and they all have this, um,
dark side themselves

1913
01:37:58,655 --> 01:38:00,633
that a lot of people, you know,
kind of keep hidden,

1914
01:38:00,657 --> 01:38:03,703
but it's kind of a way for them
to let their dark side out.

1915
01:38:03,878 --> 01:38:06,445
Really like the old-school
campy films and stuff.

1916
01:38:06,619 --> 01:38:09,622
But, um, John Carpenter's
Halloween is what really got me into it

1917
01:38:09,796 --> 01:38:12,103
when I was like about eight
years old and I just, like,

1918
01:38:12,277 --> 01:38:14,976
really absorbed the culture
of horror and everything.

1919
01:38:15,150 --> 01:38:18,501
The scares, it's the shock value
I'd have to say.

1920
01:38:18,675 --> 01:38:20,372
The villains are the best.

1921
01:38:20,546 --> 01:38:22,505
We've got Pinhead in the H,

1922
01:38:22,679 --> 01:38:25,551
Michael Myers in the O,
Leatherface in the R,

1923
01:38:25,725 --> 01:38:27,510
Pennywise in the other R...

1924
01:38:28,772 --> 01:38:31,601
Jason in the O,
and Freddy in the R.

1925
01:38:32,123 --> 01:38:36,693
- I like horror because...
- I like violence in general, pretty much.

1926
01:38:36,867 --> 01:38:40,131
It's just a way for me to be
different than anyone else.

1927
01:38:40,305 --> 01:38:43,700
What I love about horror is the, it's
the, it's like the roller coaster thing.

1928
01:38:43,874 --> 01:38:46,616
You're just enjoying
that moment, that edge of fear.

1929
01:38:46,790 --> 01:38:48,270
I've thrown myself in there,
you know?

1930
01:38:48,444 --> 01:38:50,291
It's been a taboo
for the longest time, you know?

1931
01:38:50,315 --> 01:38:52,293
For the longest time, yeah.
Then finally, when metal came,

1932
01:38:52,317 --> 01:38:53,840
metal was pretty taboo
at the time,

1933
01:38:54,015 --> 01:38:56,582
and they just kind of like
came together.

1934
01:39:01,109 --> 01:39:03,372
I love heavy metal.
Uh, I don't know,

1935
01:39:03,546 --> 01:39:05,146
I've loved this
since I was 12 years old.

1936
01:39:05,200 --> 01:39:06,917
It really gets your pum...
Your blood pumping

1937
01:39:06,941 --> 01:39:08,725
and your, uh,
your adrenaline going.

1938
01:39:08,899 --> 01:39:10,292
Just like watching
a horror movie.

1939
01:39:10,466 --> 01:39:12,468
Uh, it's loud, it's extreme.

1940
01:39:13,034 --> 01:39:14,754
It just gets me
in a certain mood, you know?

1941
01:39:14,861 --> 01:39:16,951
I listen to it,
I feel energized.

1942
01:39:17,125 --> 01:39:20,563
I go into mosh pits. So, like, I
love to have a music I move to.

1943
01:39:20,737 --> 01:39:23,457
You can't beat the shit out of
somebody with Taylor Swift, all right?

1944
01:39:25,394 --> 01:39:27,570
Takes a lot of...
energy to do it.

1945
01:39:27,744 --> 01:39:30,064
The imagery goes together
so well, I mean, look at the, uh,

1946
01:39:30,181 --> 01:39:31,680
covers of, like,
old Iron Maiden album,

1947
01:39:31,704 --> 01:39:33,402
it's, it's straight up horror
right there.

1948
01:39:33,576 --> 01:39:35,882
And they just go hand in hand.
You put a horror movie on,

1949
01:39:36,057 --> 01:39:38,059
you could turn the,
you could turn the sound off.

1950
01:39:38,233 --> 01:39:40,322
And put a,
then put a record on horror,

1951
01:39:40,496 --> 01:39:43,847
you know, death metal or metal,
whatever, it goes hand in hand.

1952
01:39:44,021 --> 01:39:47,982
They both kind of feel off-limits
in a certain way, you know?

1953
01:39:48,156 --> 01:39:50,288
Like something that you're not
supposed to be doing,

1954
01:39:50,462 --> 01:39:53,030
but, you know, you do anyways.

1955
01:39:53,204 --> 01:39:55,728
Favorite of all time?
I would have to say

1956
01:39:55,902 --> 01:39:58,905
tie between An American Werewolf
in London and the first Halloween.

1957
01:39:59,080 --> 01:40:01,865
I am a huge Black Sabbath fan.

1958
01:40:02,039 --> 01:40:05,129
It has to be Hellraiser.
I'm all about Doug Bradley.

1959
01:40:05,303 --> 01:40:07,001
Iron Maiden, Metallica.

1960
01:40:07,175 --> 01:40:09,655
The Chucky series
and the Freddy Krueger movies.

1961
01:40:09,829 --> 01:40:11,222
Maiden, oh yeah, Judas Priest.

1962
01:40:11,396 --> 01:40:13,094
Halloween, um, Evil Dead.

1963
01:40:13,268 --> 01:40:14,573
Deicide, Cannibal Corpse.

1964
01:40:14,747 --> 01:40:16,749
- Probably Alien.
- Slipknot.

1965
01:40:16,923 --> 01:40:18,969
The Texas Chainsaw.

1966
01:40:19,143 --> 01:40:21,711
Bands like The Black Dahlia
Murder and Dying Fetus.

1967
01:40:21,885 --> 01:40:24,409
- I will do that.
- Definitely Anthrax.

1968
01:40:24,583 --> 01:40:25,802
Friday the 13th.

1969
01:40:26,368 --> 01:40:27,543
You can't go wrong with that.

1970
01:40:27,717 --> 01:40:30,154
Alice Cooper, uh, King Diamond.

1971
01:40:31,112 --> 01:40:32,765
The Exorcist.

1972
01:40:33,723 --> 01:40:37,161
Metal guys, they always push
themselves to, to break ground,

1973
01:40:37,335 --> 01:40:38,989
break new ground,
break barriers.

1974
01:40:39,163 --> 01:40:40,947
I think horror
does the same thing.

1975
01:40:41,122 --> 01:40:43,689
And when you put them together,
it's fucking sex dude.

1976
01:40:44,386 --> 01:40:45,387
It's just pure sex.

right where she belongs up top.

9
00:00:39,241 --> 00:00:41,758
Only thing left is mine.

10
00:00:41,793 --> 00:00:44,689
Let's get to the real.

11
00:00:44,724 --> 00:00:47,172
Here you go.

12
00:00:47,206 --> 00:00:50,172
Okay, okay. Look, I understand
you're not drinking.

13
00:00:50,206 --> 00:00:51,482
And I respect that.

14
00:00:51,517 --> 00:00:54,172
But come on.
It's our tradition, Montana.

15
00:00:54,206 --> 00:00:57,034
We put the tree up
and then we have a little...

16
00:00:57,068 --> 00:00:58,655
candy cane cocktail
to start the celebration.

17
00:01:02,103 --> 00:01:04,724
I can't do this anymore, Rio.

18
00:01:04,757 --> 00:01:05,758
Do what?

19
00:01:05,793 --> 00:01:07,689
Be a hypocrite.

20
00:01:07,724 --> 00:01:09,275
Sleep with you
on Saturday night

21
00:01:09,310 --> 00:01:12,413
and then get up and sing
in the choir on Sunday morning.

22
00:01:12,448 --> 00:01:14,241
Babe, with all this
holy roller stuff.

23
00:01:14,275 --> 00:01:15,448
All right.
Well, we can't have sex.

24
00:01:15,482 --> 00:01:17,241
We can't drink.
What's next?

25
00:01:17,275 --> 00:01:19,724
We can't hold hands?

26
00:01:22,206 --> 00:01:23,517
Can't you serve Jesus

27
00:01:23,551 --> 00:01:25,241
without ruining
our whole relationship?

28
00:01:25,275 --> 00:01:28,103
So our whole relationship
is just drinking and sex?

29
00:01:28,137 --> 00:01:29,448
I didn't say that.

30
00:01:29,482 --> 00:01:31,103
Okay, this is our third
Christmas together.

31
00:01:31,137 --> 00:01:32,413
Right?

32
00:01:32,448 --> 00:01:33,793
And if you walk out
that door right now,

33
00:01:33,827 --> 00:01:35,378
it's not going to be the same
for either one of us.

34
00:01:35,413 --> 00:01:36,689
That's just it, Rio.

35
00:01:36,723 --> 00:01:39,172
I'm not the same.

36
00:01:40,827 --> 00:01:43,344
And I respect that.
I understand.

37
00:01:43,378 --> 00:01:44,689
I understand.
And I respect that, baby.

38
00:01:44,723 --> 00:01:46,586
Okay?

39
00:01:46,620 --> 00:01:48,620
We've been talking about this
for months and months.

40
00:01:50,827 --> 00:01:53,413
And the truth is
we're just unequally yoked.

41
00:01:53,448 --> 00:01:55,103
Okay?
Wow.

42
00:01:55,137 --> 00:01:57,517
It's not working.

43
00:01:57,551 --> 00:01:59,586
Okay, well,
speaking of not working,

44
00:01:59,620 --> 00:02:01,758
you were furloughed
six weeks ago.

45
00:02:01,793 --> 00:02:03,000
So I don't know
if this is the best time

46
00:02:03,034 --> 00:02:06,310
to be out looking for a place
with no income coming in.

47
00:02:06,344 --> 00:02:08,413
Yeah.

48
00:02:08,448 --> 00:02:11,482
I'll figure it out.
Okay.

49
00:02:11,517 --> 00:02:13,931
Well, when you don't,

50
00:02:13,965 --> 00:02:17,655
you know you'll be back here
anyway.

51
00:02:17,689 --> 00:02:20,344
Montana, listen, let's just--

52
00:02:20,379 --> 00:02:22,758
let's just go in the room
and just...

53
00:02:22,793 --> 00:02:24,344
one last time.

54
00:02:27,965 --> 00:02:32,620
So you really
going to leave?

55
00:02:32,655 --> 00:02:34,517
I was just playing
about the furlough thing.

56
00:02:42,896 --> 00:02:44,448
God, please don't
have me out here

57
00:02:44,482 --> 00:02:46,275
looking crazy for trusting You.

58
00:02:49,551 --> 00:02:51,655
You said my help
comes from You,

59
00:02:51,689 --> 00:02:53,655
so I'm stepping out on faith.

60
00:02:56,793 --> 00:03:00,793

Now that Montana has taken us
to the very throne of glory,

98
00:05:34,931 --> 00:05:37,517
despite being late again...

99
00:05:37,551 --> 00:05:39,896
Are there any prayer requests?

100
00:05:39,931 --> 00:05:41,448
Brother Odom,
Brother Odom, Brother Odom.

101
00:05:41,482 --> 00:05:42,896
Sister Ophelia.

102
00:05:42,931 --> 00:05:45,034
Ooh, I just want
to give an honor to God.

103
00:05:45,068 --> 00:05:47,344
Let me get an Amen.
all: Amen.

104
00:05:47,379 --> 00:05:49,724
- Who is the...
- Girl, where were you?

105
00:05:49,758 --> 00:05:51,413
Brother Odom just told us

106
00:05:51,448 --> 00:05:52,689
he was going to kick you out
the choir if you late again.

107
00:05:52,724 --> 00:05:53,724
I was late because
I was at my--

108
00:05:53,758 --> 00:05:56,448
Montana.

109
00:05:56,482 --> 00:05:58,034
Do you have a testimony,

110
00:05:58,068 --> 00:06:02,034
since you're talking while
Sister Ophelia is testifying?

111
00:06:02,068 --> 00:06:04,034
Oh.

112
00:06:09,896 --> 00:06:11,551
Some of you know
that six weeks ago,

113
00:06:11,586 --> 00:06:13,551
I was laid off from my job.

114
00:06:15,448 --> 00:06:17,448
And I just decided tonight

115
00:06:17,482 --> 00:06:20,137
that I'm going to stop
living with my boyfriend

116
00:06:20,172 --> 00:06:22,068
and get my own apartment.

117
00:06:22,103 --> 00:06:24,413
- Okay.
- Mm.

118
00:06:24,448 --> 00:06:27,034
But there are so many things
that would have to take place

119
00:06:27,068 --> 00:06:32,413
for that miracle to happen,
so please, please pray for me.

120
00:06:32,448 --> 00:06:34,551
Yes, yes.
Amen, choir?

121
00:06:34,586 --> 00:06:35,793
all: Amen.

122
00:06:35,827 --> 00:06:37,896
We know that God
answers prayers.

123
00:06:37,931 --> 00:06:39,896
And Montana, we will
certainly keep you in ours.

124
00:06:39,931 --> 00:06:41,517
Won't we, choir?
all: Amen.

125
00:06:41,551 --> 00:06:42,862
Amen, Amen.

126
00:06:42,896 --> 00:06:45,413
On that note,
that's all for tonight,

127
00:06:45,448 --> 00:06:48,862
and I'll see everyone
bright and early.

128
00:06:48,896 --> 00:06:50,413
Early.

129
00:06:50,448 --> 00:06:53,586
Early, Montana,
at service tomorrow.

130
00:06:53,620 --> 00:06:55,034
You're dismissed.

131
00:06:55,068 --> 00:06:57,103
Sister Ophelia,
a word with you, please?

132
00:06:59,827 --> 00:07:02,862
You moved out
and didn't tell me?

133
00:07:02,896 --> 00:07:05,034
Well, when you do things
God's way?

134
00:07:05,068 --> 00:07:07,517
He'll always have your back.

135
00:07:07,551 --> 00:07:09,000
Girl.

136
00:07:09,034 --> 00:07:10,758
together: Work on your faith.

137
00:07:10,793 --> 00:07:12,206
See, we said that
at the same time,

138
00:07:12,241 --> 00:07:13,862
so you know that means
it's confirmation.

139
00:07:13,896 --> 00:07:15,965
No, you just say
that all the time.

140
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,068
Whatever.

141
00:07:19,551 --> 00:07:22,241
You should come.

142
00:07:22,275 --> 00:07:24,793
Trent's going to be there.

143
00:07:24,827 --> 00:07:26,586
Okay, I just broke up
with my boyfriend.

144
00:07:26,620 --> 00:07:30,793
And even if I was desperate,
Trent is...not it.

145
00:07:30,827 --> 00:07:32,758
Plus my pockets are on E.

146
00:07:32,793 --> 00:07:34,517
So where you
going to stay tonight?

147
00:07:34,551 --> 00:07:36,517
- I'll get a room.
- With your pockets on E?

148
00:07:36,551 --> 00:07:38,517
Girl, come on.

149
00:07:38,551 --> 00:07:40,517
Look, I'm going to spot you
for mocktails tonight,

150
00:07:40,551 --> 00:07:42,068
I'll drive, and then
you can just stay with me

151
00:07:42,103 --> 00:07:44,103
until you find a place.
See?

152
00:07:44,137 --> 00:07:45,931
The Lord provides.

153
00:07:47,034 --> 00:07:48,206
Can you give me a job, too?

154
00:07:48,241 --> 00:07:50,103
I said the Lord provides,
not me.

155
00:07:50,137 --> 00:07:53,931
Let's go.
No. He's not fast enough.

156
00:07:55,896 --> 00:07:56,827
How are you,
Mother Chamberlain?

157
00:07:56,862 --> 00:07:58,758
As pleasant as a peach, dear.

158
00:07:58,793 --> 00:08:00,034
Thank you.

159
00:08:00,068 --> 00:08:02,586
Sweetie, can
I talk to you for a moment?

160
00:08:02,620 --> 00:08:03,586
Uh-huh.

161
00:08:15,379 --> 00:08:18,931
I'm so sorry,
Mother Chamberlain.

162
00:08:18,965 --> 00:08:20,241
Can I help you with something?

163
00:08:20,275 --> 00:08:22,689
We sing in the choir together
every week, dear.

164
00:08:22,724 --> 00:08:26,241
Didn't I ask you to stop
calling me Mother Chamberlain?

165
00:08:26,275 --> 00:08:29,586
Okay, Ms. Estelle.

166
00:08:29,620 --> 00:08:32,931
Just Estelle.

167
00:08:32,965 --> 00:08:35,931
I've been watching you
over the past year,

168
00:08:35,965 --> 00:08:38,275
and dear,
you're not like the others.

169
00:08:38,309 --> 00:08:40,688
I'm hiring
for a position in my home,

170
00:08:40,724 --> 00:08:44,931
and I was wondering
if you would be interested.

171
00:08:44,965 --> 00:08:47,068
You mean your home,

172
00:08:47,103 --> 00:08:49,862
as in the huge mansion
in Cascade?

173
00:08:49,896 --> 00:08:52,689
Yes.

174
00:08:52,724 --> 00:08:54,068
Have you ever been a nanny?

175
00:08:54,103 --> 00:08:56,586
I've never been a nanny,
um,

176
00:08:56,620 --> 00:08:58,689
but in the time
that I've been laid off, I-I...

177
00:08:58,724 --> 00:09:01,827
just finally finished
my teaching certification.

178
00:09:01,862 --> 00:09:03,379
And I do teach
at Children's Church

179
00:09:03,413 --> 00:09:05,172
every third and fourth Sunday.

180
00:09:05,206 --> 00:09:06,689
Splendid.

181
00:09:06,724 --> 00:09:08,241
I need someone to help
my two grandchildren

182
00:09:08,275 --> 00:09:09,344
with their homework

183
00:09:09,379 --> 00:09:12,206
and make sure they're
not tearing down Atlanta.

184
00:09:12,241 --> 00:09:14,310
I mean,
they're not babies anymore,

185
00:09:14,344 --> 00:09:17,827
but they could use
a mother's touch.

186
00:09:17,862 --> 00:09:20,931
I am looking for a full-time
teaching job next year,

187
00:09:20,965 --> 00:09:24,310
so this would have
to be temporary.

188
00:09:24,344 --> 00:09:27,931
That sounds like just
the right amount of time.

189
00:09:27,965 --> 00:09:31,275
Oh, I forgot to mention,
this is a live-in job,

190
00:09:31,310 --> 00:09:33,896
so part of your
compensation package

191
00:09:33,931 --> 00:09:37,206
will be a room and meals.

192
00:09:37,241 --> 00:09:40,620
Oh.

193
00:09:40,655 --> 00:09:41,896
Um...

194
00:09:41,931 --> 00:09:45,620
Things are going
to change for you, dear.

195
00:09:45,655 --> 00:09:47,655
I can feel it in my spirit.

196
00:09:52,724 --> 00:09:55,620
Here's the address.
Stop by tomorrow after church.

197
00:09:55,655 --> 00:09:57,793
I want you to meet my son.

198
00:09:57,827 --> 00:10:00,206
- Your son?
- Yes, the kid's father.

199
00:10:00,241 --> 00:10:03,620
You've only been at Life Church
for a year.

200
00:10:03,655 --> 00:10:05,241
He hasn't been to church
in five.

201
00:10:05,275 --> 00:10:07,655
Well, thank you so much,
Estelle,

202
00:10:07,689 --> 00:10:10,103
and I will definitely
see you tomorrow.

203
00:10:10,137 --> 00:10:12,655
Okay.

204
00:10:24,068 --> 00:10:25,931
Okay, give me the scoop.

205
00:10:25,965 --> 00:10:27,793
All right, so the Chamberlain
family are filthy rich...

206
00:10:27,827 --> 00:10:28,827
Mm-hmm.

207
00:10:28,862 --> 00:10:30,379
Because guarantee,

208
00:10:30,413 --> 00:10:31,758
you have one of their hair care
products in your bathroom.

209
00:10:31,793 --> 00:10:33,310
So what about the son?

210
00:10:33,344 --> 00:10:35,034
Why hasn't he been in church
in five years?

211
00:10:35,068 --> 00:10:36,827
That's how long it's been
since his wife died.

212
00:10:36,862 --> 00:10:38,655
She died of breast cancer.

213
00:10:38,689 --> 00:10:40,103
I know.

214
00:10:40,137 --> 00:10:41,965
And because he was trusting God
for healing,

215
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,655
hasn't been back
to church since.

216
00:10:43,689 --> 00:10:46,034
- Dang.
- I know.

217
00:10:46,068 --> 00:10:50,034
So a single father trying to
raise two kids all by himself.

218
00:10:50,068 --> 00:10:52,310
Whew,
no wonder they need a nanny.

219
00:10:52,344 --> 00:10:54,689
- You gonna be their nanny?
- Estelle--

220
00:10:54,724 --> 00:10:56,793
- You call her Estelle?
- She insisted.

221
00:10:56,827 --> 00:10:58,655
And then--I know.

222
00:10:58,689 --> 00:11:01,000
And then she offered me a job
and told me that I can move in.

223
00:11:01,034 --> 00:11:02,137
Won't He do it?

224
00:11:02,172 --> 00:11:04,034
All right.

225
00:11:04,068 --> 00:11:07,000
Let's see if this works out
before you start testifying.

226
00:11:11,137 --> 00:11:13,689
Quentin is also fine.

227
00:11:13,724 --> 00:11:16,275
Half of the church
had a crush on him.

228
00:11:16,310 --> 00:11:20,241
But he does have this high,
siditty girlfriend, Chloe.

229
00:11:20,275 --> 00:11:21,379
Wait.

230
00:11:21,413 --> 00:11:24,034
The heir, socialite,
whatever she is?

231
00:11:24,068 --> 00:11:25,413
The one that prances in
seconds before the sermon

232
00:11:25,448 --> 00:11:27,241
like she's God's gift
to the universe?

233
00:11:27,275 --> 00:11:28,862
Girl, yes.

234
00:11:28,896 --> 00:11:31,034
Well, why doesn't she
spend time with the kids?

235
00:11:31,068 --> 00:11:33,034
Obviously she doesn't want
a diva like her

236
00:11:33,068 --> 00:11:34,758
being a role model
to her grandchildren.

237
00:11:34,793 --> 00:11:37,448
Well, if they don't like me,
I'm out on the street.

238
00:11:37,482 --> 00:11:40,896
They'll like you, I promise.
This will be great for you.

Okay.

247
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,034
All right.
I had to get gas.

248
00:12:07,068 --> 00:12:09,344
I had to get gas.

249
00:12:09,379 --> 00:12:11,448
I had to get gas
and I didn't want

250
00:12:11,482 --> 00:12:14,896
my car to stop on the freeway
so I just had to--

251
00:12:14,931 --> 00:12:16,793
Oh, God.
Here she comes.

252
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,482
Hi.
Oh, my God.

253
00:12:21,517 --> 00:12:23,275
I am so, so sorry I'm late.

254
00:12:23,310 --> 00:12:27,310
I ran into a bunch of traffic
on my way from church.

255
00:12:27,344 --> 00:12:29,068
I apologize.

256
00:12:30,931 --> 00:12:32,448
Come in.

257
00:12:32,482 --> 00:12:34,965
Thank you so much.

258
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,206
Wow.
Oh, my gosh.

259
00:12:37,241 --> 00:12:38,793
It's beautiful in here.

260
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,034
This is such
a great opportunity.

261
00:12:43,068 --> 00:12:44,724
Thank you, again.

262
00:12:47,448 --> 00:12:50,448
♪ Do, re, me

263
00:12:50,482 --> 00:12:53,517
The acoustics in here
are great.

264
00:12:53,551 --> 00:12:55,827
Mm. My
late daughter-in-law Shandra,

265
00:12:55,862 --> 00:12:59,827
she swore by the acoustics
in this room.

266
00:12:59,862 --> 00:13:04,310
Quentin would play the piano,
and she would sing.

267
00:13:04,344 --> 00:13:06,344
Whole story is just so sad.

268
00:13:08,068 --> 00:13:09,482
Wait here.

269
00:13:09,517 --> 00:13:11,137
I'll go get Quentin.
Okay.

270
00:13:19,310 --> 00:13:21,827
Oh.

271
00:13:21,862 --> 00:13:24,827
Oh, my gosh.

272
00:13:24,862 --> 00:13:25,827
Hi.

273
00:13:25,862 --> 00:13:28,000
Wow.

274
00:13:28,034 --> 00:13:29,517
Mm.

275
00:13:32,344 --> 00:13:34,586
Nobody touches that piano.

276
00:13:34,620 --> 00:13:36,931
Oh, right.

277
00:13:36,965 --> 00:13:38,517
Um...

278
00:13:38,551 --> 00:13:40,034
Estelle told me
to wait over there--

279
00:13:40,068 --> 00:13:41,344
You know my mother
well enough

280
00:13:41,379 --> 00:13:42,413
to call her by her first name?

281
00:13:42,448 --> 00:13:43,551
She insisted.

282
00:13:43,586 --> 00:13:45,517
I'm sorry.
You must be Mr. Chamberlain.

283
00:13:45,551 --> 00:13:47,137
I'm Montana Ellis. I'm
in the choir with your mother.

284
00:13:47,172 --> 00:13:49,000
Hello?

285
00:13:49,034 --> 00:13:51,000
I'm supposed
to be meeting you.

286
00:13:51,034 --> 00:13:52,172
No, no, no, no.

287
00:13:52,206 --> 00:13:54,275
Color additives
only need FDA approval

288
00:13:54,310 --> 00:13:55,482
before going to market.

289
00:13:55,517 --> 00:13:57,344
Yeah, yeah,
you should know this.

290
00:13:59,068 --> 00:14:00,931
Yeah, let me call you back.

291
00:14:00,965 --> 00:14:03,137
Uh, why are you here, again?

292
00:14:03,172 --> 00:14:05,379
For the nanny position?

293
00:14:05,413 --> 00:14:07,310
Your mother wanted us to meet.

294
00:14:07,344 --> 00:14:09,586
Do you have any questions
for me?

295
00:14:09,620 --> 00:14:10,896
Maybe if you looked
a little more like a nanny,

296
00:14:10,931 --> 00:14:12,310
I might have a question or two.

297
00:14:13,965 --> 00:14:16,310
So what's a nanny
supposed to look like?

298
00:14:16,344 --> 00:14:20,448
I see you're already
getting acquainted.

299
00:14:20,482 --> 00:14:22,241
What do you think?

300
00:14:22,275 --> 00:14:24,482
What do I think?
This is your idea.

301
00:14:24,517 --> 00:14:27,034
And after the kids'
latest shenanigans,

302
00:14:27,068 --> 00:14:29,517
you agreed with me.

303
00:14:29,551 --> 00:14:31,413
I did, I did.

304
00:14:31,448 --> 00:14:33,931
Montana, let me show
you around the house

305
00:14:33,965 --> 00:14:35,241
and to your room.

306
00:14:35,275 --> 00:14:36,379
So I'm hired?

307
00:14:36,413 --> 00:14:38,965
If you'll accept the offer.

308
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:43,068
We're paying $75,000 a year
plus room and meals.

309
00:14:43,103 --> 00:14:44,896
I think that's fair, don't you?

310
00:14:44,931 --> 00:14:45,931
Uh--

311
00:14:45,965 --> 00:14:47,241
Before she accepts,

312
00:14:47,275 --> 00:14:48,448
don't you think maybe
she should meet the kids?

313
00:14:48,482 --> 00:14:49,586
Oh, Quentin.

314
00:14:52,241 --> 00:14:53,931
I'll get them.

315
00:15:00,689 --> 00:15:02,689
Thank you so much,
Mr. Chamberlain,

316
00:15:02,724 --> 00:15:04,448
for this opportunity.

317
00:15:04,482 --> 00:15:06,310
Quentin.
Just Quentin.

318
00:15:06,344 --> 00:15:08,310
I'd rather call you
Mr. Chamberlain.

319
00:15:08,344 --> 00:15:10,965
I just don't want the children
to think I'm unprofessional.

320
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,965
And here's the surprise.

321
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,724
But it's not a pony.

322
00:15:15,758 --> 00:15:18,034
I never said it was a pony.

323
00:15:18,068 --> 00:15:19,965
She's your new nanny.

324
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,241
How would you like the children
to address you, dear?

325
00:15:22,275 --> 00:15:24,413
I guess Miss Montana
would be cool.

326
00:15:24,448 --> 00:15:26,448
Wait.

327
00:15:26,482 --> 00:15:29,068
Y'all really went out
and got another nanny?

328
00:15:29,103 --> 00:15:31,448
Un-frickin'-believable.
Deirdre, manners, please.

329
00:15:31,482 --> 00:15:32,620
Miss Montana's going to think

330
00:15:32,655 --> 00:15:35,379
you were raised
by a pack of wolves.

331
00:15:35,413 --> 00:15:37,482
Sorry, Grandmother.

332
00:15:37,517 --> 00:15:39,655
How do you do?
I'm Deirdre.

333
00:15:39,689 --> 00:15:41,206
Pleased to make
your acquaintance,

334
00:15:41,241 --> 00:15:42,586
even though low-key, I'm not.

335
00:15:46,413 --> 00:15:49,275
Hi, I'm Daniel.
I'm ten.

336
00:15:49,310 --> 00:15:51,103
We won't have much contact

337
00:15:51,137 --> 00:15:52,551
because
we really don't need you.

338
00:15:52,586 --> 00:15:53,620
Okay.

339
00:15:53,655 --> 00:15:55,275
Oh, my gosh!

340
00:15:56,482 --> 00:15:57,241
Little boy,
have you lost your mind?

341
00:15:57,275 --> 00:15:59,000
- Ooh!
- Sorry.

342
00:15:59,034 --> 00:16:00,413
Yeah, let--
yeah, let's try that again.

343
00:16:00,448 --> 00:16:02,206
Ah-ah-ah.

344
00:16:03,448 --> 00:16:05,586
Miss Montana,

345
00:16:05,620 --> 00:16:09,206
I bid you a kind
and warm welcome.

346
00:16:11,482 --> 00:16:13,758
- So you're in fifth grade?
- Yes, ma'am.

347
00:16:13,793 --> 00:16:15,000
All right, so that means

348
00:16:17,241 --> 00:16:20,034
Math class is kicking my--

349
00:16:20,068 --> 00:16:21,482
butt.

350
00:16:21,517 --> 00:16:24,793
Well, guess who was
in math club in high school.

351
00:16:24,827 --> 00:16:27,620
She really out here tryna
bribe us with math, bro?

352
00:16:29,310 --> 00:16:30,379
You bro me one more time,

353
00:16:30,413 --> 00:16:32,379
we gon' have
more than math problems.

354
00:16:32,413 --> 00:16:34,379
This is a waste of my time.

355
00:16:34,413 --> 00:16:35,517
Okay, you know what?

356
00:16:35,551 --> 00:16:36,448
Your little attitude
right now--

357
00:16:36,482 --> 00:16:37,482
It's really okay.

358
00:16:37,517 --> 00:16:39,172
No, really, it's not.

359
00:16:39,206 --> 00:16:41,517
Apologize, both of you.
Now.

360
00:16:41,551 --> 00:16:43,172
both: Sorry.

361
00:16:44,724 --> 00:16:46,310
You are not excused.

362
00:16:46,344 --> 00:16:47,379
I'm getting the door,
Grandmother.

363
00:16:47,413 --> 00:16:49,689
Da--
Young lady, watch your tone.

364
00:16:49,724 --> 00:16:50,620
She's mad at me.

365
00:16:52,586 --> 00:16:54,448
No need to apologize.

366
00:16:55,206 --> 00:16:56,689
Miss Brooks is here
to see you.

367
00:16:56,724 --> 00:16:57,655
Mm-hmm.

368
00:16:57,689 --> 00:17:00,103
I told you,
Miss Brooks is my mother.

369
00:17:00,137 --> 00:17:01,206
Call me Chloe.

370
00:17:01,241 --> 00:17:03,137
Well, my mother taught me

371
00:17:03,172 --> 00:17:06,103
to never call an adult
by their first name,

372
00:17:06,137 --> 00:17:07,655
especially one as old as you.

373
00:17:07,689 --> 00:17:09,275
Ooh.

374
00:17:12,862 --> 00:17:14,758
- Hey, baby.
- Baby.

375
00:17:14,792 --> 00:17:17,275
Good to see you.

376
00:17:17,310 --> 00:17:19,275
Ah-da-da-da, the kids.

377
00:17:19,310 --> 00:17:21,448
Can y'all get a room?

378
00:17:21,482 --> 00:17:23,689
They already do.
A lot.

379
00:17:25,655 --> 00:17:28,862
- Who is she?
- Oh, this is Montana.

380
00:17:28,896 --> 00:17:30,379
Yes, the new nanny.

381
00:17:30,413 --> 00:17:31,689
You know
my mother wouldn't rest

382
00:17:31,724 --> 00:17:33,655
before she had another
Mary Poppins in here,

383
00:17:33,689 --> 00:17:36,689
floating around,
umbrella and all.

384
00:17:36,724 --> 00:17:41,103
Don't tell me you've
never seen ""Mary Poppins.""

385
00:17:41,137 --> 00:17:43,689
Oh, she touched me through
with her gold-digger hands!

386
00:17:43,724 --> 00:17:45,103
Boy, I'm--

387
00:17:48,413 --> 00:17:50,793
Sorry about that.
Proper introduction.

388
00:17:50,827 --> 00:17:53,379
Chloe, this is Montana.
Montana, this is Chloe.

389
00:17:53,413 --> 00:17:54,448
This is my--

390
00:17:54,482 --> 00:17:56,137
- His future wife.
- Right.

391
00:17:56,172 --> 00:17:58,448
I've seen you at church.
I'm in the choir.

392
00:17:58,482 --> 00:18:00,862
Yeah, um,
I only go for the sermon,

393
00:18:00,896 --> 00:18:03,172
so I don't know anything
about your little choir.

394
00:18:03,206 --> 00:18:04,827
We have a reservation.
I don't want to be late.

395
00:18:04,862 --> 00:18:06,448
Let's go.

396
00:18:06,482 --> 00:18:07,793
Yes, the gallery.

397
00:18:07,827 --> 00:18:10,379
Okay, um, Montana.
Yeah.

398
00:18:10,413 --> 00:18:12,448
My mother will make sure
that you get settled in.

399
00:18:12,482 --> 00:18:13,862
Okay, thank you.

400
00:18:22,482 --> 00:18:24,655
Okay, what's wrong?

401
00:18:25,896 --> 00:18:27,172
We've been
together three years,

402
00:18:27,206 --> 00:18:28,448
and not once have you mentioned

403
00:18:28,482 --> 00:18:30,620
wanting to wake up next to me
in your bed.

404
00:18:30,655 --> 00:18:32,517
I've woken up next to you

405
00:18:32,551 --> 00:18:34,620
in some of the finest hotels
from Savannah to Seychelles.

406
00:18:34,655 --> 00:18:36,689
But it's not your bed.

407
00:18:36,724 --> 00:18:38,586
We've discussed this.
Okay?

408
00:18:38,620 --> 00:18:39,896
I don't want to set
a bad example for the kids.

409
00:18:39,931 --> 00:18:41,448
You know that.

410
00:18:41,482 --> 00:18:42,344
Wouldn't
a better example to set

411
00:18:42,379 --> 00:18:43,689
to be to just get married

412
00:18:43,724 --> 00:18:46,793
instead of having sex
all over the world?

413
00:18:46,827 --> 00:18:48,379
I'm not trying
to rush you down to altar, Q,

414
00:18:48,413 --> 00:18:51,827
but I'm just saying
we're not getting any younger.

415
00:18:51,862 --> 00:18:53,448
And it would be nice.

416
00:18:57,517 --> 00:19:00,758
A little assurance.

417
00:19:00,793 --> 00:19:02,689
To know that
these gifts and trips

418
00:19:02,724 --> 00:19:04,965
are not just cheap thrills.

419
00:19:08,413 --> 00:19:10,655
All right,
how about you plan

420
00:19:10,689 --> 00:19:13,586
a Transitions Christmas gala
this year?

421
00:19:13,620 --> 00:19:14,965
Are you serious?

422
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:15,896
Yeah.

423
00:19:20,689 --> 00:19:24,413
Because it always
reminds me of Shandra.

424
00:19:24,448 --> 00:19:26,413
I know, baby.

425
00:19:26,448 --> 00:19:30,655
I'm sorry you're still hurting.

426
00:19:30,689 --> 00:19:32,344
And for the record,

427
00:19:32,379 --> 00:19:34,862
I had nothing to do
with hiring Montana, okay?

428
00:19:34,896 --> 00:19:36,551
That was all my mom,
so you know,

429
00:19:36,586 --> 00:19:38,241
you take that up with her.

430
00:19:43,310 --> 00:19:45,586
Ma.

431
00:19:49,517 --> 00:19:51,310
Uh, you can sit
anywhere you like.

432
00:19:51,344 --> 00:19:52,517
- Okay.
- Thanks.

433
00:19:52,551 --> 00:19:53,724
And I'm ready
for this sweet dinner.

434
00:19:56,241 --> 00:19:57,655
Right.

435
00:20:01,379 --> 00:20:06,413
Oh, my God.

436
00:20:06,448 --> 00:20:07,310
You know what?

437
00:20:07,344 --> 00:20:09,241
Yeah, keep going!
Get to your room!

438
00:20:09,275 --> 00:20:11,896
No, that's okay.

439
00:20:11,931 --> 00:20:12,931
It's okay, it's okay.

440
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,689
It's just a frog, you know?

441
00:20:17,724 --> 00:20:19,931
It's just a frog--

442
00:20:35,827 --> 00:20:37,379
Come in.

443
00:20:38,448 --> 00:20:40,724
Hey, is everything okay?

444
00:20:40,758 --> 00:20:43,551
I just wanted to apologize.

445
00:20:43,586 --> 00:20:46,758
The whole frog thing
was my idea.

446
00:20:46,793 --> 00:20:48,482
I've already forgiven you
for that.

447
00:20:48,517 --> 00:20:51,310
I know that you and your sister
have been through a lot

448
00:20:51,344 --> 00:20:52,689
since you lost your mother.

449
00:20:52,724 --> 00:20:57,275
I didn't come here
to talk about my mother.

450
00:20:57,310 --> 00:20:59,586
Okay.
Well, so what's on your mind?

451
00:20:59,620 --> 00:21:01,413
Do you roller skate?

452
00:21:01,448 --> 00:21:02,758
A little.

453
00:21:02,793 --> 00:21:05,965
Could you take me skating?

454
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,413
Sure.

455
00:21:08,448 --> 00:21:11,758
Can I ask something else?

456
00:21:11,793 --> 00:21:13,310
Okay.

457
00:21:13,344 --> 00:21:15,758
Can I bring my girl?

458
00:21:15,793 --> 00:21:17,275
Your girl?

459
00:21:17,310 --> 00:21:20,000
Arshinay.
My girl.

460
00:21:20,034 --> 00:21:22,482
I'm in love with her
and she's in love with me.

461
00:21:22,517 --> 00:21:23,896
Okay.

462
00:21:23,931 --> 00:21:27,827
And what do you know about love
at ten?

463
00:21:33,931 --> 00:21:38,034
Love is the cantankerous way

464
00:21:38,068 --> 00:21:41,620
Arshinay makes me feel.

465
00:21:41,655 --> 00:21:45,620
Love is lugubrious,

466
00:21:45,655 --> 00:21:49,827
mercurial, and real.

467
00:21:49,862 --> 00:21:52,310
Sure, she know the deal!

468
00:21:52,344 --> 00:21:54,310
You wrote that?

469
00:21:54,344 --> 00:21:56,034
For her?
Yeah.

470
00:21:56,068 --> 00:21:57,896
Thesaurus.com,
if you were going to ask me

471
00:21:57,931 --> 00:22:02,827
about the words.
Okay. All right.

472
00:22:02,862 --> 00:22:07,379
Yes, I would love
to take you skating.

473
00:22:07,413 --> 00:22:08,862
But you're going to
have to ask your dad

474
00:22:08,896 --> 00:22:11,034
about the Arshinay part.

475
00:22:11,068 --> 00:22:13,344
But he thinks
I'm too young to date.

476
00:22:13,379 --> 00:22:15,655
Well, because you are.

477
00:22:15,689 --> 00:22:17,793
So you're with him?

478
00:22:17,827 --> 00:22:19,379
No.

479
00:22:19,413 --> 00:22:20,655
Hey, Daniel.

480
00:22:25,413 --> 00:22:26,689
Daniel.

481
00:22:26,724 --> 00:22:29,551
Deirdre?

482
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,551
You're okay.

483
00:22:47,620 --> 00:22:49,689
Don't touch me.

484
00:22:51,379 --> 00:22:53,517
I had an accident
like this in 11th grade--

485
00:22:53,551 --> 00:22:57,034
Don't try to relate to me,
okay?

486
00:22:57,068 --> 00:23:00,413
Just--

487
00:23:04,655 --> 00:23:07,620
Why does everything
have to happen to me?

488
00:23:09,586 --> 00:23:12,931
Dang it.

489
00:23:12,965 --> 00:23:14,413
I'm here.

490
00:23:14,448 --> 00:23:17,758
I didn't ask you to be.

491
00:23:17,793 --> 00:23:20,000
What's going on?

492
00:23:26,965 --> 00:23:31,000
And all he does is buy, sell,
and grow the brand.

493
00:23:31,034 --> 00:23:33,793
I just--I can't.

494
00:23:33,827 --> 00:23:36,172
I--

495
00:23:37,793 --> 00:23:42,482
Men bury themselves in work
because it's--

496
00:23:42,517 --> 00:23:46,620
it's what they know best,
to cope with their pain.

497
00:23:46,655 --> 00:23:49,724
Sounds like an excuse.

498
00:23:49,758 --> 00:23:53,034
Not an excuse.

499
00:23:53,068 --> 00:23:57,172
More like an explanation.

500
00:23:57,206 --> 00:24:02,034
We all have to practice
giving the same grace to others

501
00:24:02,068 --> 00:24:05,034
that we expect them to give us.

502
00:24:09,551 --> 00:24:10,862
Let's get you cleaned up.

503
00:24:10,896 --> 00:24:13,241
I can clean myself, thanks.

504
00:24:16,172 --> 00:24:18,862
Okay.

505
00:24:18,896 --> 00:24:21,620
I'm here if you need me.

506
00:24:21,655 --> 00:24:23,793
Whatever.

507
00:24:49,620 --> 00:24:52,241
Cute doggy dog.
Mm-hmm.

508
00:24:52,275 --> 00:24:54,137
You like clockwork.

509
00:24:54,172 --> 00:24:55,689
You here every Sunday.

510
00:24:55,724 --> 00:24:57,241
No, you're like clockwork,

511
00:24:57,275 --> 00:24:59,827
in that you snore like
a grown man.

512
00:24:59,862 --> 00:25:01,689
- Yo mama?
- Snores too.

513
00:25:01,724 --> 00:25:03,275
But nowhere near
as loud as you.

514
00:25:03,310 --> 00:25:05,758
Shut up.

515
00:25:05,793 --> 00:25:08,724
- How you been, Mama?
- Mm.

516
00:25:08,758 --> 00:25:09,862
Well enough to write you.

517
00:25:09,896 --> 00:25:12,862
Don't suffer needlessly, now.

518
00:25:12,896 --> 00:25:16,310
Not being alert enough to
write is worse than the pain.

519
00:25:16,344 --> 00:25:20,896
Okay, Alexis, you are here so
that you don't have to suffer.

520
00:25:20,931 --> 00:25:24,827
I'm here because God wanted
me to have a caramel angel

521
00:25:24,862 --> 00:25:27,586
at my side while I waste away.

522
00:25:27,620 --> 00:25:29,275
Oh, you just
got all the game, don't you?

523
00:25:29,310 --> 00:25:32,068
Mm-hmm.

524
00:25:32,103 --> 00:25:33,931
But God didn't ask me
to do this.

525
00:25:33,965 --> 00:25:35,241
Whatever.

526
00:25:35,275 --> 00:25:37,275
Look, I'm just
giving you an excuse

527
00:25:37,310 --> 00:25:39,655
for your little fiancée.

528
00:25:39,689 --> 00:25:40,862
Why haven't I met her yet?

529
00:25:40,896 --> 00:25:43,068
Maybe because
she's not my fiancée.

530
00:25:43,103 --> 00:25:45,206
You don't have
the nerve to propose?

531
00:25:45,241 --> 00:25:46,241
How do you know

532
00:25:46,275 --> 00:25:47,931
I ain't waiting on you
to go ahead and get well

533
00:25:47,965 --> 00:25:50,241
so I can leave her
and run away with you?

534
00:25:50,275 --> 00:25:52,862
Oh, well say less, then.
Where you want to go?

535
00:25:52,896 --> 00:25:54,275
Come on.

536
00:25:54,310 --> 00:25:57,000
You know what?

537
00:25:57,034 --> 00:25:58,827
Oh, here we go.
Oh.

538
00:25:58,862 --> 00:26:01,310
- Perfect. Alexis Island.
- Mm.

539
00:26:01,344 --> 00:26:04,000
Mm-hmm, I can see us
on the beach now.

540
00:26:04,034 --> 00:26:05,241
Me with my phone in my hand...
Mm-hmm.

541
00:26:05,275 --> 00:26:08,655
And you,
snoring like a grown man.

542
00:26:08,689 --> 00:26:09,758
Uh!

543
00:26:09,793 --> 00:26:12,206
You don't stop.

544
00:26:12,241 --> 00:26:15,655
Oh.

545
00:26:15,689 --> 00:26:17,034
Yeah.

546
00:26:17,068 --> 00:26:18,724
I gotta get back to work.

547
00:26:18,758 --> 00:26:19,827
But it's Sunday.

548
00:26:19,862 --> 00:26:21,655
I know,
but you already know that.

549
00:26:23,137 --> 00:26:27,172
You say I suffer needlessly,

550
00:26:27,206 --> 00:26:29,965
but so do you.

551
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:32,310
Your closest friends are people
who when you meet them,

552
00:26:32,344 --> 00:26:35,206
only have a couple months
left to live.

553
00:26:39,034 --> 00:26:41,275
How about you let me
do the worrying?

554
00:26:42,689 --> 00:26:44,000
You get some sleep.

555
00:26:44,034 --> 00:26:47,344
And I will see you next Sunday.

556
00:26:54,241 --> 00:26:57,000
- Hey, girl, hey.
- Oh, hey, girl.

557
00:26:57,034 --> 00:26:58,931
- What's going on?
- Oh, my goodness.

558
00:26:58,965 --> 00:27:01,034
It's been real over here.

559
00:27:01,068 --> 00:27:03,206
Okay, well, spill the tea.

560
00:27:03,241 --> 00:27:05,965
It's just I'm in a
20,000-square-foot house

561
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:10,448
on 18 acres
and I feel like I'm trapped.

562
00:27:10,482 --> 00:27:12,344
The whole world has been
consumed with that house

563
00:27:12,379 --> 00:27:14,068
and those kids.

564
00:27:14,103 --> 00:27:16,275
Yeah.

565
00:27:16,310 --> 00:27:19,034
And they are a lot.

566
00:27:19,068 --> 00:27:23,827
I feel like they just act out
because they miss their mom.

567
00:27:23,862 --> 00:27:25,034
And they can't
access their dad--

568
00:27:26,758 --> 00:27:28,310
But I'm working on that.

569
00:27:28,344 --> 00:27:31,965
I understand.

570
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:33,413
Let me call you right back.

571
00:27:33,448 --> 00:27:35,137
Okay, I love you.

572
00:27:35,172 --> 00:27:37,172
Love you, too.

573
00:27:37,206 --> 00:27:39,896
'Tana, bae, hey, listen.
I love you, okay?

574
00:27:39,931 --> 00:27:42,206
We can manage all the changes
and still be together.

575
00:27:42,241 --> 00:27:44,310
Matter of fact,
why don't you come over here,

576
00:27:44,344 --> 00:27:46,137
we could talk about
over your favorite.

577
00:27:46,172 --> 00:27:48,034
Mm-hmm.

578
00:27:48,068 --> 00:27:50,827
That's a nice glazed salmon
with a little lemon squeeze,

579
00:27:50,862 --> 00:27:52,034
like you like it.

580
00:27:52,068 --> 00:27:53,724
Little--little--
little cabin of love.

581
00:27:53,758 --> 00:27:55,724
And then I got you
a nice bed of kale

582
00:27:55,758 --> 00:27:57,931
that you can come over here
and lay on

583
00:27:57,965 --> 00:27:59,965
while you eat the food
off my chest, please.

584
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,206
- Mm.
- I mean, you don't have to.

585
00:28:02,241 --> 00:28:04,034
We'll take our time.

586
00:28:04,068 --> 00:28:07,965
I love you and I miss you.

587
00:28:11,448 --> 00:28:14,379
Nope.

588
00:28:26,517 --> 00:28:28,103
Yeah?

589
00:28:28,137 --> 00:28:29,793
Mr. Chamberlain, it's--

590
00:28:29,827 --> 00:28:31,034
it's Montana.

591
00:28:34,793 --> 00:28:36,827
Quentin.
Just Quentin.

592
00:28:36,862 --> 00:28:38,034
Will you please
just call me Quentin?

593
00:28:38,068 --> 00:28:40,034
Nope.

594
00:28:40,068 --> 00:28:42,448
Okay, what can I do for you?

595
00:28:42,482 --> 00:28:44,379
Just checking to see
if you need anything.

596
00:28:44,413 --> 00:28:45,965
On your day off?

597
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,758
- I have one question.
- All right.

598
00:28:48,793 --> 00:28:50,517
Why do I always see Estelle
and the kids at church

599
00:28:50,551 --> 00:28:52,275
but never you?

600
00:28:52,310 --> 00:28:54,068
Because me and God don't
really get down like that,

601
00:28:54,103 --> 00:28:55,344
and frankly, that's none
of your damn business.

602
00:28:55,379 --> 00:28:57,931
Excuse me.

603
00:28:57,965 --> 00:28:59,896
Hello?

604
00:28:59,931 --> 00:29:01,413
Hey, baby.

605
00:29:01,448 --> 00:29:02,862
Do you have a couple
of seconds to go over

606
00:29:02,896 --> 00:29:04,862
some questions for the gala?

607
00:29:04,896 --> 00:29:06,413
- Okay.
- Okay.

608
00:29:06,448 --> 00:29:08,344
So what are we thinking
Christmas tree-wise?

609
00:29:08,379 --> 00:29:10,172
I was thinking blue spruce,

610
00:29:10,206 --> 00:29:12,034
but you're more like
a Douglas fir kind of guy,

611
00:29:12,068 --> 00:29:13,275
and then we have
Virginia pine--

612
00:29:13,310 --> 00:29:15,137
I-I-I'm sure
you'll make the right choice.

613
00:29:15,172 --> 00:29:17,137
Okay, I will.

614
00:29:17,172 --> 00:29:20,137
Second thing, I think we should
do the event at the mansion.

615
00:29:20,172 --> 00:29:22,310
Hey, can we talk about
this a little later?

616
00:29:22,344 --> 00:29:24,827
Yeah.
Where are you?

617
00:29:24,862 --> 00:29:27,172
I'm home,
but I'll reach out later.

618
00:29:27,206 --> 00:29:28,931
Okay, well, I love you, baby.

619
00:29:28,965 --> 00:29:30,862
Mm-hmm, bye.

620
00:29:33,862 --> 00:29:37,896
Sorry for snapping like that.

621
00:29:37,931 --> 00:29:41,551
I just choose to spend
my Sundays elsewhere now.

622
00:29:41,586 --> 00:29:42,482
So I don't get hit

623
00:29:45,379 --> 00:29:47,965
You think I'm making this up?

624
00:29:49,206 --> 00:29:50,551
Okay, not that
I have any reason

625
00:29:50,586 --> 00:29:51,862
to make up anything at all,

626
00:29:55,068 --> 00:29:57,000
Do you wanna roll?

627
00:30:06,034 --> 00:30:08,034
Your fiancée
wouldn't mind us

628
00:30:08,068 --> 00:30:10,241
riding together like this,
right?

629
00:30:10,275 --> 00:30:14,034
I have not asked her
to be my wife.

630
00:30:14,068 --> 00:30:17,275
I guess after several years,
a woman would assume.

631
00:30:17,310 --> 00:30:18,448
No, no.

632
00:30:18,482 --> 00:30:20,137
Chloe likes name brands,

633
00:30:20,172 --> 00:30:22,448
premium gifts,
extravagant travel.

634
00:30:22,482 --> 00:30:23,655
Trust me, she's has more
than enough of all of it.

635
00:30:23,689 --> 00:30:26,034
But she still wants the
security of being your wife.

636
00:30:26,068 --> 00:30:27,551
Okay.
Are you a agent?

637
00:30:27,586 --> 00:30:29,241
No.

638
00:30:29,275 --> 00:30:32,034
But every woman's had a man
who gets what he wants

639
00:30:32,068 --> 00:30:34,103
and then leaves you to pick up
the pieces of your life

640
00:30:34,137 --> 00:30:37,965
once he decides to get what
he wants from someone else.

641
00:30:39,379 --> 00:30:41,448
So you're a therapist,
that's what you--

642
00:30:41,482 --> 00:30:43,275
right, right, right.

643
00:30:44,310 --> 00:30:46,241
Stay tuned to 97.5,

644
00:30:46,275 --> 00:30:48,172
the Sound of the City,

645
00:30:48,206 --> 00:30:50,965
for a chance to win the
12 Days of Christmas giveaway.

646
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:54,310
Wow.
This is beautiful.

647
00:30:54,344 --> 00:30:56,034
This is Transitions.

648
00:30:56,068 --> 00:31:00,103
I started this
after my wife passed.

649
00:31:00,137 --> 00:31:02,896

I'm sorry.

653
00:31:09,448 --> 00:31:11,137
But it's nice how

- Back again?
- Hey.

661
00:31:32,448 --> 00:31:34,586
Montana, this is Charles,
he's the head nurse here.

662
00:31:34,620 --> 00:31:36,965
I was just showing her
how I spend my Sunday mornings.

663
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:39,379
- Okay, nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

665

Got it.

666
00:31:42,655 --> 00:31:44,482
- He's cool.
- Yeah, he's good people.

667
00:31:46,172 --> 00:31:48,551
This place needs
some Christmas spirit.

668
00:31:48,586 --> 00:31:52,931
Hey, me and the kids
should decorate.

- Yeah.
- Yeah.

671
00:31:58,241 --> 00:31:59,482
This way, come on.

672
00:32:04,448 --> 00:32:07,689
Alexis, guess who's back?

673
00:32:07,724 --> 00:32:09,413
Come in.

674
00:32:13,103 --> 00:32:14,379
Well.

675
00:32:18,586 --> 00:32:20,275

to bring your little girlfriend

up in this piece?

678
00:32:23,275 --> 00:32:24,310
Uh, no, no, no.

679
00:32:24,344 --> 00:32:26,482
This--this is my friend,
Montana.

680
00:32:26,517 --> 00:32:29,448
Well, listen, you groupies
going to have to fall back.

681
00:32:29,482 --> 00:32:32,586
- Groupies?
- Yeah, groupies.

682
00:32:32,620 --> 00:32:36,448
You and all the rest of them,
trying to get my boo.

683
00:32:36,482 --> 00:32:39,689
Q built this big, old house
for me out in the country.

684
00:32:39,724 --> 00:32:42,620
He even let my staff
stay here, too.

685
00:32:46,413 --> 00:32:47,689
You feeling any better?

686
00:32:47,724 --> 00:32:50,000
I'm still 100% alive.

687
00:32:50,034 --> 00:32:52,413
- And then that's a good thing?
- Mm-hmm.

688
00:32:52,448 --> 00:32:56,310
I'd like to pray with you,
if you're okay with that.

689
00:32:56,344 --> 00:32:57,689
Well, hold on, groupie.

690
00:32:57,724 --> 00:32:59,586
Who you be praying to?

691
00:32:59,620 --> 00:33:00,551
Because folks nowadays

692
00:33:03,068 --> 00:33:07,310
Listen, I am Christian, okay?

693
00:33:07,344 --> 00:33:09,551
Well, mostly.

694
00:33:09,586 --> 00:33:11,344
Somebody's going
to have to help me

695
00:33:11,379 --> 00:33:13,379
repent of all the lusting
after Q I be doing.

696
00:33:13,413 --> 00:33:15,517
But other than that,
I'm straight.

697
00:33:15,551 --> 00:33:17,482
Will you stop playing
and let her pray for you?

698
00:33:17,517 --> 00:33:20,689
Please pray for me,
because I'm trying to...

699
00:33:20,724 --> 00:33:22,551
finish my writing before
I leave from here.

700
00:33:22,586 --> 00:33:24,551
And I keep telling her

701
00:33:24,586 --> 00:33:26,551
that she has plenty of time
to finish it.

702
00:33:26,586 --> 00:33:30,034
You and I both know
that ain't true.

703
00:33:30,068 --> 00:33:34,379
If you have any praying skills,
lay 'em on me.

704
00:33:35,724 --> 00:33:39,034
Father, comfort Alexis
right now in her mind,

705
00:33:39,068 --> 00:33:41,620
in her body, in her soul.

706
00:33:41,655 --> 00:33:44,758
Fill her with Your light,
Your love, and Your peace.

707
00:33:44,793 --> 00:33:47,275
In Jesus' name, Amen.

708
00:33:50,413 --> 00:33:52,241
Amen.
Amen.

709
00:33:54,241 --> 00:33:58,344
Thank you.

710
00:33:58,379 --> 00:34:01,448
And as much as I'd like
to look at your pretty face, Q,

711
00:34:01,482 --> 00:34:04,517
would you please go spend
some time with this girl?

712
00:34:04,551 --> 00:34:07,103
I got work to do.
Go, little bitty thing.

713
00:34:09,310 --> 00:34:11,068
Bye, groupie.

714
00:34:11,103 --> 00:34:13,275
I'm just playing.
We just had our little moment.

715
00:34:13,310 --> 00:34:15,413
It's--

716
00:34:15,447 --> 00:34:18,344
Bye, Montana.
Bye.

717
00:34:18,379 --> 00:34:20,516
Q, you should
bring her again.

718
00:34:20,551 --> 00:34:23,862
- We'll see.
- Mm.

719
00:34:23,896 --> 00:34:25,655
- Bye.
- Bye.

720
00:34:25,688 --> 00:34:27,172
Bye.

721
00:34:42,688 --> 00:34:43,757
What's wrong?

722
00:34:43,793 --> 00:34:46,275
I'm sorry.

723
00:34:46,310 --> 00:34:51,379
It's just--
she's just so young.

724
00:34:52,862 --> 00:34:53,862
Yeah.

725
00:34:53,896 --> 00:34:54,793
Well, me and the kids

726
00:34:58,827 --> 00:35:02,206
Just because
you're facing difficulty...

727
00:35:02,241 --> 00:35:04,689
doesn't mean you can't have
a merry Christmas.

728
00:35:04,724 --> 00:35:07,517
Yeah, you're right.

729
00:35:07,551 --> 00:35:11,241
Do you like barbecue?

730
00:35:11,275 --> 00:35:12,482
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

731
00:35:12,517 --> 00:35:13,689
Yes.

732
00:35:19,172 --> 00:35:22,758
♪ Christmastime

733
00:35:22,793 --> 00:35:24,344
♪ It's Christmastime

734
00:35:24,379 --> 00:35:26,275
- Thank you.
- Thank you, both.

735
00:35:26,310 --> 00:35:28,275
- Enjoy.
- For sure, for sure.

736
00:35:28,310 --> 00:35:30,827
♪ Ba-ba-ba

737
00:35:30,862 --> 00:35:32,655
- Oh.
- This looks so good.

738
00:35:32,689 --> 00:35:34,172
Nothing like a
spot of barbecue

739
00:35:34,206 --> 00:35:36,862
to warm you up on
a awkwardly cold Atlanta day.

740
00:35:36,896 --> 00:35:38,724
- Mm-hmm.
- Ooh, yes, yes, yes.

741
00:35:38,758 --> 00:35:40,344
C'est magnifique.

742
00:35:40,379 --> 00:35:41,344
Mm,
like the Cole Porter song.

743
00:35:41,379 --> 00:35:42,862
Mm.

744
00:35:42,896 --> 00:35:45,344
together: The Ella Fitzgerald
version, of course.

745
00:35:45,379 --> 00:35:46,931
Okay.

746
00:35:46,965 --> 00:35:48,655
Okay, So you know your music.

747
00:35:48,689 --> 00:35:52,827
Mm-hmm.
I heard you do, too.

748
00:35:52,862 --> 00:35:55,689
I used to write,
play a little bit.

749
00:35:57,344 --> 00:35:59,827
Not anymore.

750
00:35:59,862 --> 00:36:01,379
It's too painful.

751
00:36:03,448 --> 00:36:05,655
Reminds me of
everything I lost.

752
00:36:08,551 --> 00:36:10,896
So I volunteer
at Transitions instead.

753
00:36:10,931 --> 00:36:12,724
Mm.

754
00:36:12,758 --> 00:36:15,206
Is it...

755
00:36:15,241 --> 00:36:18,689
volunteering or feeling guilty
for being alive?

756
00:36:24,931 --> 00:36:27,344
I would get so fat
if this place was closer.

757
00:36:27,379 --> 00:36:28,896
- Mm.
- Yeah.

758
00:36:28,931 --> 00:36:31,344
I got to watch my spread.

759
00:36:31,379 --> 00:36:36,344
Okay, well, I don't see
much spread, as you put it.

760
00:36:36,379 --> 00:36:38,931
You could always run.

761
00:36:38,965 --> 00:36:40,241
I had trails built
around the property

762
00:36:40,275 --> 00:36:42,827
for that sole purpose.

763
00:36:42,862 --> 00:36:43,689
Maybe I will.

764
00:36:43,724 --> 00:36:46,551
Mm-mm.

765
00:36:50,275 --> 00:36:52,586
You know, we should
probably try to get going.

766
00:36:52,620 --> 00:36:54,655
- Okay.
- You ready? Yeah?

767
00:36:54,689 --> 00:36:56,413
- Yeah.
- Are you gonna--okay.

768
00:36:56,448 --> 00:36:58,586
All right, say, because
I'll take it if you don't--

769
00:36:58,620 --> 00:36:59,896
- Uh-uh.
- All right, cool.

770
00:37:07,068 --> 00:37:09,413
Was he expecting you?

771
00:37:09,448 --> 00:37:10,655
I'm sorry, Miss Chamberlain.

772
00:37:10,689 --> 00:37:12,448
I don't need an appointment
to see my man.

773
00:37:12,482 --> 00:37:14,000
It's not his birthday.

774
00:37:14,034 --> 00:37:17,310
Let me share something
with you, dear.

775
00:37:17,344 --> 00:37:20,551
If a man's not ready,
you cannot make him love you.

776
00:37:31,482 --> 00:37:32,724
There you are.

777
00:37:32,758 --> 00:37:34,034
Hey.

778
00:37:35,586 --> 00:37:37,793
Mm.
Everything all right?

779
00:37:37,827 --> 00:37:40,724
It is now.
You were with herall day?

780
00:37:40,758 --> 00:37:41,965
Yeah.

781
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:44,448
If you two would
please excuse me.

782
00:37:44,482 --> 00:37:46,448
Oh, no.
Don't try to run away now.

783
00:37:46,482 --> 00:37:48,931
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

784
00:37:48,965 --> 00:37:50,034
What are you doing?

785
00:37:50,068 --> 00:37:52,034
We don't do jealousy.
What's that?

786
00:37:52,068 --> 00:37:53,310
I'm sorry.

787
00:37:56,068 --> 00:37:58,551
Now you let this chick
live in here.

788
00:37:58,586 --> 00:38:01,103
Y'all were out all day.

789
00:38:01,137 --> 00:38:04,379
Like, when is there going to be
a place in your heart for me?

790
00:38:04,413 --> 00:38:06,344
Chloe.

791
00:38:06,379 --> 00:38:08,793
You know good and well
how much I care for you.

792
00:38:08,827 --> 00:38:11,034
Really?

793
00:38:11,068 --> 00:38:13,034
How much?

794
00:38:19,655 --> 00:38:21,655
That much.

795
00:38:21,689 --> 00:38:23,413
Stop worrying about Montana,
okay?

796
00:38:23,448 --> 00:38:24,862
She's here to get close
to the kids, not me.

797
00:38:24,896 --> 00:38:26,517
And that's even worse.

798
00:38:26,551 --> 00:38:28,034
And you're falling for it.
Falling for what?

799
00:38:28,068 --> 00:38:29,965
Everyone knows the way
to a man's heart

800
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:32,034
is through his kids.
Okay.

801
00:38:32,068 --> 00:38:37,034
I don't want Montana.
I have who I want.

802
00:38:37,068 --> 00:38:38,862
Okay?

803
00:38:38,896 --> 00:38:39,931
Great.

804
00:38:39,965 --> 00:38:41,862
You good?

805
00:38:41,896 --> 00:38:43,793
You're not good.

806
00:38:43,827 --> 00:38:45,965
Was that a crop top?

807
00:39:07,620 --> 00:39:10,931
Okay.

808
00:39:10,965 --> 00:39:13,620
Aren't you supposed
to make it on the stovetop?

809
00:39:13,655 --> 00:39:16,689
Nope, because
it ain't store-bought stuffing.

810
00:39:16,724 --> 00:39:19,068
- Oh.
- Get it, get it?

811
00:39:19,103 --> 00:39:20,689
See, Daniel gets me.
Give me my points.

812
00:39:20,724 --> 00:39:22,172
Come on, Deirdre.

813
00:39:24,655 --> 00:39:26,172
Oh, these are done perfect.

814
00:39:26,206 --> 00:39:28,758
I need you two to help me
with something, okay?

815
00:39:28,793 --> 00:39:29,862
If you want to learn
how to make

816
00:39:29,896 --> 00:39:31,758
the best French toast
of your life,

817
00:39:31,793 --> 00:39:34,413
you're going to do two things,
all right?

818
00:39:34,448 --> 00:39:36,586
Deirdre, you're going to put...

819
00:39:36,620 --> 00:39:39,103
an avalanche of strawberries
on here.

820
00:39:39,137 --> 00:39:42,965
And Daniel,
I need you to put...

821
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:46,620
a mountaintop full
of whipped cream.

822
00:39:46,655 --> 00:39:48,034
- Ooh.
- Okay?

823
00:39:48,068 --> 00:39:49,793
Okay, here we go.

824
00:39:49,827 --> 00:39:52,724
- Why they look like that?
- Exactly.

825
00:39:52,758 --> 00:39:54,586
She gave me
the end piece of the bread.

826
00:39:56,068 --> 00:39:57,517
Good morning,
Mr. Chamberlain.

827
00:39:57,551 --> 00:39:58,758
Morning.

828
00:39:58,793 --> 00:40:00,103
- Right on time, Pops.
- On time for?

829
00:40:00,137 --> 00:40:04,620
- To try baked French toast.
- Give it a try.

830
00:40:04,655 --> 00:40:06,758
- Baked French toast, huh?
- Yeah.

831
00:40:06,793 --> 00:40:09,586
Uh, it ain't stovetop.

832
00:40:09,620 --> 00:40:11,620
Hmm.

833
00:40:12,931 --> 00:40:14,689
Dude, you try.

834
00:40:14,724 --> 00:40:16,862
Oh, wow.

835
00:40:16,896 --> 00:40:17,965
Oh, this is slamming.

836
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:19,827
- C'est magnifique?
- Mm-hmm.

837
00:40:19,862 --> 00:40:23,068
- Mm.
- Mm-hmm. Mm.

838
00:40:23,103 --> 00:40:24,551
- Sure.
- Right?

839
00:40:24,586 --> 00:40:26,103
Mm-hmm.

840
00:40:28,172 --> 00:40:30,896
Don't fight.

841
00:40:32,206 --> 00:40:34,034
This is actually really good.
Yeah.

842
00:40:34,068 --> 00:40:36,620
I'm glad you're liking it,
Deirdre.

843
00:40:36,655 --> 00:40:37,655
Shandra used to make
French toast with the kids

844
00:40:37,689 --> 00:40:39,068
all the time.

845
00:40:39,103 --> 00:40:41,034
It's actually
my favorite breakfast.

846
00:40:41,068 --> 00:40:41,896
Thank you.

847
00:40:41,931 --> 00:40:45,103
You're welcome,
Mr. Chamberlain.

848
00:40:45,137 --> 00:40:48,068
Okay. I got to go run off
these extra calories.

849
00:40:48,103 --> 00:40:50,068
Mm, gosh. Me, too.

850
00:40:50,103 --> 00:40:51,965
#Spread.

851
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:54,034
- You gonna join?
- Oh, no, I--

852
00:40:54,068 --> 00:40:56,068
But I'll start soon.

853
00:40:56,103 --> 00:40:58,103
Today is the first
day of Christmas break

854
00:40:58,137 --> 00:41:00,482
and I have a full day planned
for these two.

855
00:41:00,517 --> 00:41:03,482
But first, we have
to clean the kitchen.

856
00:41:03,517 --> 00:41:05,517
- But we don't do dishes.
- At all.

857
00:41:05,551 --> 00:41:06,655
Mm.

858
00:41:06,689 --> 00:41:08,241
We clean up what we mess up,

859
00:41:08,275 --> 00:41:09,931
in life and in the kitchen.

860
00:41:09,965 --> 00:41:12,034
Ooh.

861
00:41:12,068 --> 00:41:14,241
That's a bar. I like that.
Y'all have fun.

862
00:41:14,275 --> 00:41:17,689
Bye, kids.

863
00:41:17,724 --> 00:41:18,620
He knows what he's doing,
right?

864
00:41:18,655 --> 00:41:21,000
He knows.

865
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:38,793
both: ♪ Noel, Noel

866
00:41:38,827 --> 00:41:43,034
♪ Noel, Noel

870
00:42:07,310 --> 00:42:10,896
Wow.

871
00:42:10,931 --> 00:42:12,758
I didn't know
you guys could sing.

872
00:42:12,793 --> 00:42:15,689
Our family used to sing like
this together all the time.

873
00:42:15,724 --> 00:42:18,000
So Mr. Chamberlain
sings, too?

874
00:42:18,034 --> 00:42:20,931
No one sings
in this house anymore.

875
00:42:20,965 --> 00:42:23,551
I still do,
but only with my door closed

876
00:42:23,586 --> 00:42:25,000
so my dad can't hear.

877
00:42:25,034 --> 00:42:26,655
Hmm.

878
00:42:26,689 --> 00:42:28,206
Yeah, singing should be heard.

879
00:42:28,241 --> 00:42:29,896
Why aren't you
in the youth choir?

880
00:42:29,931 --> 00:42:31,620
Pops won't let us,

881
00:42:31,655 --> 00:42:33,586
and we should probably
stop singing anyway

882
00:42:33,620 --> 00:42:35,310
if he's still in the house.

883
00:42:35,344 --> 00:42:37,310
It's like he's trying
to erase the main thing

884
00:42:37,344 --> 00:42:40,137
we remember of our mother.

885
00:42:40,172 --> 00:42:42,172
She was always singing
and teaching us songs

886
00:42:42,206 --> 00:42:44,068
we sang together as a family.

887
00:42:44,103 --> 00:42:45,931
How would you like to sing

888
00:42:45,965 --> 00:42:47,793
at the Christmas gala
in two weeks?

889
00:42:47,827 --> 00:42:50,068
- He would never allow that.
- That's why we won't tell him.

890
00:42:50,103 --> 00:42:53,000
It'll--it'll be a surprise.

891
00:42:53,034 --> 00:42:56,586
You're getting
in so much trouble.

892
00:42:56,620 --> 00:42:58,034
You never know.

893
00:42:58,068 --> 00:43:00,896
We just might reach him, too.

894
00:43:00,931 --> 00:43:03,034
MM, we'll see.

895
00:43:03,068 --> 00:43:06,827
Let's go, kids.
Move it.

896
00:43:06,862 --> 00:43:10,862
Oh, I wouldn't be caught dead
in a car like that.

897
00:43:10,896 --> 00:43:13,655
Well, I guess we're about
to go to your funeral.

898
00:43:13,689 --> 00:43:17,620
Miss Montana, since
you have a car like that,

899
00:43:17,655 --> 00:43:19,965
does that mean you're poor?

900
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:21,827
Oh.

901
00:43:21,862 --> 00:43:25,137
That depends.

902
00:43:25,172 --> 00:43:27,137
Do you two realize
that half of this planet

903
00:43:27,172 --> 00:43:30,068
lives on less than $4 a day?

904
00:43:30,103 --> 00:43:33,689
So by that measure,
I'm amongst the world's rich.

905
00:43:33,724 --> 00:43:36,655
But if I were to compare
myself to your father,

906
00:43:36,689 --> 00:43:39,931
who was on ""Forbes'""
billionaire list, then yeah,

907
00:43:39,965 --> 00:43:42,310
I guess I would
be considered poor.

908
00:43:42,344 --> 00:43:44,206
And even that has
to be qualified.

909
00:43:46,413 --> 00:43:50,827
But I'm rich in relationships
and in opportunity,

910
00:43:50,862 --> 00:43:52,620
and especially in gifts.

911
00:43:52,655 --> 00:43:54,827
Ooh, and Christmas
is only two weeks away.

912
00:43:54,862 --> 00:43:56,344
Hey!

913
00:43:56,379 --> 00:43:59,862
I'm not talking
about material gifts.

914
00:43:59,896 --> 00:44:04,448
I'm talking about the God-given
gifts that you were born with.

915
00:44:04,482 --> 00:44:08,862
And once God gives you a gift,
He never takes it back.

916
00:44:08,896 --> 00:44:10,275
I want to teach y'all a song,

917
00:44:10,310 --> 00:44:12,034
and I need you to sing after
me, okay?

918
00:44:12,068 --> 00:44:13,275
With those beautiful voices.

919
00:44:13,310 --> 00:44:15,896

Come on, come on, come on,
come on, come on.

948
00:46:19,310 --> 00:46:22,379
Yeah. I went for the run.

949
00:46:22,413 --> 00:46:26,241
And, uh, you know...
Mm-hmm.

950
00:46:26,275 --> 00:46:28,344
Fried chicken yesterday.

951
00:46:28,379 --> 00:46:30,448
Uh-huh,
it looks like you, uh,

952
00:46:30,482 --> 00:46:32,413
sweated all your electrolytes
out of your body.

953
00:46:32,448 --> 00:46:35,517
Hold on a second.
I was just...

954
00:46:35,551 --> 00:46:39,000
running and running
and running.

955
00:46:41,482 --> 00:46:43,172
Ooh.
All right, here we go.

956
00:46:43,206 --> 00:46:45,275
- Okay.
- Yeah, take a sip of that.

957
00:46:45,310 --> 00:46:48,862
- Thanks. Mm!
- That's better, right?

958
00:46:48,896 --> 00:46:51,206
So much better.

959
00:46:51,241 --> 00:46:54,551
My feet are killing me.

960
00:46:54,586 --> 00:46:56,551
Let me see your shoe.

961
00:46:56,586 --> 00:47:00,103
I don't bite.

962
00:47:00,137 --> 00:47:03,931
Okay, well first and foremost,
these are not running shoes.

963
00:47:03,965 --> 00:47:05,931
And they look a little cheap.

964
00:47:05,965 --> 00:47:08,206
Excuse you.

965
00:47:08,241 --> 00:47:10,172
I paid 69.99 for these.

966
00:47:10,206 --> 00:47:12,413
Mm, did you?

967
00:47:12,448 --> 00:47:15,206
What are you doing?

968
00:47:15,241 --> 00:47:16,413
Calling the sneaker police
on me?

969
00:47:16,448 --> 00:47:20,241
Da-da-da-da, a second.

970
00:47:20,275 --> 00:47:23,310
Brother.
Yo, need a favor.

971
00:47:23,344 --> 00:47:24,965
I have a friend here

972
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:27,241
who is running around
in walking shoes.

973
00:47:27,275 --> 00:47:29,620
Yeah.
What size you wear?

974
00:47:29,655 --> 00:47:33,551
- A seven.
- Seven.

975
00:47:33,586 --> 00:47:35,551
45 minutes, perfect.

976
00:47:35,586 --> 00:47:37,034
My guy.

977
00:47:37,068 --> 00:47:38,586
All right.

978
00:47:38,620 --> 00:47:40,655
So what's happening
in 45 minutes?

979
00:47:40,689 --> 00:47:42,413
Dear friend of mine
is going to be here.

980
00:47:42,448 --> 00:47:45,413
He is my personal stylist
and he's going to fit you

981
00:47:45,448 --> 00:47:47,551
with the running shoes
that you should be wearing.

982
00:47:47,586 --> 00:47:49,034
You're welcome.

983
00:47:49,068 --> 00:47:51,137
Thanks,
but I can't afford that.

984
00:47:51,172 --> 00:47:54,000
Mm, good thing
you're not paying for it.

985
00:47:54,034 --> 00:47:57,379
Now all due respect,
you should probably go shower.

986
00:47:59,068 --> 00:48:00,379
- But--
- Mm, yeah, you stink.

987
00:48:00,413 --> 00:48:04,000
- I don't stink.
- Mm?

988
00:48:04,034 --> 00:48:06,448
Okay, I do a little bit.

989
00:48:06,482 --> 00:48:07,965
But look, I don't--

990
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:10,689
listen, I don't want
you buying me things.

991
00:48:10,724 --> 00:48:13,241
Do-don't most women
love shoes?

992
00:48:13,275 --> 00:48:15,413
I'm not most women.

993
00:48:15,448 --> 00:48:18,965
Yeah,
I'm kind of gathering that.

994
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:22,275
No, seriously.
I don't want to do this--

995
00:48:22,310 --> 00:48:24,137
- Oh, my.
- You're kind of--

996
00:48:24,172 --> 00:48:25,586
I mean, my eyes is watering
a little something.

997
00:48:25,620 --> 00:48:26,551
- Okay. Oh, God.
- I'm just saying.

998
00:48:26,586 --> 00:48:28,000
- Okay, all right.
- It would--it would--

999
00:48:28,034 --> 00:48:29,379
it would be so nice of you.

1000
00:48:29,413 --> 00:48:31,172
- Oh, gosh. Ooh!
- I'ma open this door, too.

1001
00:48:44,379 --> 00:48:46,034
Let's be honest, baby,

1002
00:48:46,068 --> 00:48:47,310
you--you changed
the rules of the game.

1003
00:48:51,655 --> 00:48:53,448
Come in.

1004
00:48:56,413 --> 00:48:58,000
Smell good.

1005
00:48:58,034 --> 00:48:59,137
Where are you going?
Mm.

1006
00:48:59,172 --> 00:49:01,758
- Nunya.
- Nunya?

1007
00:49:01,793 --> 00:49:03,206
Nunya business.

1008
00:49:05,275 --> 00:49:08,275
You are looking cute, though.
You got a date?

1009
00:49:08,310 --> 00:49:10,034
That's classified.

1010
00:49:10,068 --> 00:49:11,655
Mm, that's hedging.

1011
00:49:11,689 --> 00:49:14,275
♪ Mm, mm
You'll see.

1012
00:49:14,310 --> 00:49:16,137

Okay, girl.

00:49:16,172 --> 00:49:18,034
Hey.

1014
00:49:22,137 --> 00:49:24,448
You headed to a photo shoot
or something?

1015
00:49:24,482 --> 00:49:26,379
No.

1016
00:49:26,413 --> 00:49:27,689
I didn't want to look bummy

1017
00:49:27,724 --> 00:49:29,482
in front of your
elitist friend.

1018
00:49:29,517 --> 00:49:30,620
Mm.

1019
00:49:35,793 --> 00:49:37,379
Yeah, let's go.

1020
00:49:37,413 --> 00:49:39,034
Mind your business.

1021
00:49:40,793 --> 00:49:43,551
Hey, what is that scent
you're wearing?

1022
00:49:43,586 --> 00:49:45,103
Just some cheap body spray.

1023
00:49:45,137 --> 00:49:49,344
Mm, doesn't smell cheap.

1024
00:49:49,379 --> 00:49:51,517
Is it too much to
just say I look nice

1025
00:49:51,551 --> 00:49:52,655
or I smell good,

1026
00:49:56,413 --> 00:49:58,448
You look magazine-amazing

1027
00:49:58,482 --> 00:50:01,517
and you smell like
cherry blossoms.

1028
00:50:01,551 --> 00:50:03,206
Better?

1029
00:50:03,241 --> 00:50:05,586
Oh, my man!

1030
00:50:05,620 --> 00:50:08,137
There he is.

1031
00:50:08,172 --> 00:50:10,482
- Hey, Q!
- Ah.

1032
00:50:13,172 --> 00:50:15,551
- My dude. What's good?
- Good to see you, man.

1033
00:50:15,586 --> 00:50:17,310
You brought everything,
didn't you?

1034
00:50:17,344 --> 00:50:18,655
You know it.

1035
00:50:18,689 --> 00:50:21,206
Meet my new nanny.
This is Montana.

1036
00:50:21,241 --> 00:50:23,034
Montana, this is Gerard.
This is my guy.

1037
00:50:23,068 --> 00:50:26,310
We go back.
Like Pop-Tarts and go-karts.

1038
00:50:26,344 --> 00:50:27,793
Like grandpa pool
and summer school.

1039
00:50:27,827 --> 00:50:30,310
Mm, like when Mike Vick
was number one pick?

1040
00:50:30,344 --> 00:50:32,551
- Oh!
- Yeah, we--

1041
00:50:32,586 --> 00:50:35,655
Uh, we go back.

1042
00:50:35,689 --> 00:50:37,655
Kind of got that.

1043
00:50:37,689 --> 00:50:40,275
My, my, my,
aren't you lovely?

1044
00:50:40,310 --> 00:50:41,448
Thanks.

1045
00:50:41,482 --> 00:50:43,172
All right.
Let's do this dance.

1046
00:50:43,206 --> 00:50:45,172
All right.

1047
00:50:45,206 --> 00:50:46,482
Here we go.

1048
00:50:46,517 --> 00:50:48,448
You go ahead
and have a seat right there.

1049
00:50:48,482 --> 00:50:50,517
Boom.
All right.

1050
00:50:50,551 --> 00:50:52,103
- Take these off?
- Yeah.

1051
00:50:52,137 --> 00:50:53,482
- You need a--
- No, I'm good.

1052
00:50:53,517 --> 00:50:55,275
Thanks.
All right.

1053
00:50:55,310 --> 00:50:57,034
So you're going to
stand right here.

1054
00:50:57,068 --> 00:50:58,034
It's going to tell me

1055
00:50:59,413 --> 00:51:03,137
so I can give you the support
you need.

1056
00:51:03,172 --> 00:51:06,724
Looks like you got flat feet.

1057
00:51:06,758 --> 00:51:08,310
But I just need
to get you a shoe

1058
00:51:08,344 --> 00:51:12,620
that has some shock absorption
and stability support.

1059
00:51:12,655 --> 00:51:15,137
I am going to give you
a sneaker

1060
00:51:15,172 --> 00:51:16,793
that's going to make love
to your feet.

1061
00:51:16,827 --> 00:51:18,620
All right.
I like that.

1062
00:51:18,655 --> 00:51:20,620
I don't know
how to feel about that.

1063
00:51:20,655 --> 00:51:23,551
But my boyfriend
will be very jealous.

1064
00:51:23,586 --> 00:51:25,517
All right. I got it
in the car, so hang tight.

1065
00:51:25,551 --> 00:51:27,068
I'll be right back.

1066
00:51:30,448 --> 00:51:33,275
You...have a boyfriend?

1067
00:51:33,310 --> 00:51:35,137
Oh, no.

1068
00:51:35,172 --> 00:51:37,758
I just--I just said that
so he wouldn't try to holler.

1069
00:51:37,793 --> 00:51:39,724
Ah.

1070
00:51:53,310 --> 00:51:54,689
It's Montana.

1071
00:51:54,724 --> 00:51:56,862
I'm singing a solo
tomorrow at church.

1072
00:51:56,896 --> 00:51:59,172
I hope you can come.

1073
00:52:19,896 --> 00:52:22,344
Did Miss Montana text you
about her solo today?

1074
00:52:22,379 --> 00:52:23,827
She did.

1075
00:52:23,862 --> 00:52:25,241
You're not going?

1076
00:52:25,275 --> 00:52:28,344
- I'm not.
- Why not?

1077
00:52:28,379 --> 00:52:29,827
Yeah.
Why not, Pop?

1078
00:52:29,862 --> 00:52:31,275
Will the two of you
please stop harassing me?

1079
00:52:31,310 --> 00:52:32,586
Thank you.

1080
00:52:32,620 --> 00:52:36,206
But it's her solo,
and she lives here.

1081
00:52:36,241 --> 00:52:39,344
So if you get up now,
we could get there on time.

1082
00:52:41,689 --> 00:52:45,275
So are you coming or not?

1083
00:52:58,275 --> 00:52:59,689
Come in.

1084
00:53:02,931 --> 00:53:06,241
Oh, you look nice.

1085
00:53:06,275 --> 00:53:07,793
Thank you, Ma.

1086
00:53:07,827 --> 00:53:09,413
Um...

1087
00:53:09,448 --> 00:53:10,758
open or closed?

1088
00:53:10,793 --> 00:53:13,241
Open, right?

1089
00:53:13,275 --> 00:53:14,931
I think I'm too formal.

1090
00:53:14,965 --> 00:53:17,344
Well, there's nothing wrong
with formal.

1091
00:53:17,379 --> 00:53:20,379
In my day, we always gave God
our very best.

1092
00:53:20,413 --> 00:53:25,000
These days, young people will
wear anything to church.

1093
00:53:25,034 --> 00:53:28,241
I think we should all
ride together this morning.

1094
00:53:28,275 --> 00:53:30,310
Yeah, that was the plan, Mom.

1095
00:53:30,344 --> 00:53:32,793
Montana, too.

1096
00:53:34,896 --> 00:53:38,000
Okay, well, what is it
going to look like if--

1097
00:53:38,034 --> 00:53:43,000
I--I mean, Montana riding
with us is just fine.

1098
00:53:45,413 --> 00:53:48,344
Open.

1099
00:53:48,379 --> 00:53:51,310
Come on. We don't want
to be late for church.

1100
00:53:51,344 --> 00:53:52,689
I'll be right there.

1101
00:53:52,724 --> 00:53:55,448
[delicate dramatic music

1102
00:54:06,793 --> 00:54:08,724
Oh, dear, dear, dear.

1103
00:54:08,758 --> 00:54:11,000
Family, oh, my.
Oh, my bad.

1104
00:54:11,034 --> 00:54:12,793
Whatever are you doing
under there

1105
00:54:12,827 --> 00:54:14,000
with that pretty dress on?

1106
00:54:14,034 --> 00:54:17,482
I think it's the alternator.

1107
00:54:17,517 --> 00:54:18,965
Come on, stupid car.

1108
00:54:20,517 --> 00:54:23,344
Uh, hey,
you can ride with us.

1109
00:54:23,379 --> 00:54:24,724
I'll get the mechanic
to look at your car

1110
00:54:24,758 --> 00:54:26,482
while we at church.

1111
00:54:26,517 --> 00:54:27,862
- I'll take a Lyft, it's fine.
- Yeah, you will, from us.

1112
00:54:27,896 --> 00:54:29,896
Come on.

1113
00:54:29,931 --> 00:54:31,034
Come on.

1114
00:54:36,344 --> 00:54:37,655
All right, all right.

1115
00:54:40,482 --> 00:54:43,758
Get ready to be bombarded
by hugs and greetings.

1116
00:54:43,793 --> 00:54:45,275
Mm-hmm.

1117
00:54:45,310 --> 00:54:47,379
Whether you realize it
or not, people miss you,

1118
00:54:47,413 --> 00:54:48,965
and they want you back.

1119
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:51,931
I am only here
to hear Montana sing.

1120
00:54:51,965 --> 00:54:54,586
Well,
you made the first step.

1121
00:54:59,965 --> 00:55:03,344
Good to see you.

1122
00:55:03,379 --> 00:55:05,862
Well, well, well, well.

1123
00:55:05,896 --> 00:55:10,793
It must be Easter because
the dead has been resurrected.

1124
00:55:10,827 --> 00:55:12,448
Sister Ophelia, how are you?

1125
00:55:12,482 --> 00:55:13,620
Yeah, I see you getting
ready to sit over there

1126
00:55:13,655 --> 00:55:15,862
with that fiancée of yours.

1127
00:55:15,896 --> 00:55:18,068
Oh, no.
She-she not my fiancée.

1128
00:55:18,103 --> 00:55:19,896
Well, so what is she then?

1129
00:55:19,931 --> 00:55:22,551
Is she a booty call, is she
a side piece with a biscuit?

1130
00:55:22,586 --> 00:55:24,517
Uh--

1131
00:55:24,551 --> 00:55:27,655
I'ma--
God is faithful, son.

1132
00:55:27,689 --> 00:55:29,034
And just.

1133
00:55:29,068 --> 00:55:31,448
And He will forgive you
of all your sins

1134
00:55:31,482 --> 00:55:34,379
and the illicit relations.

1135
00:55:34,413 --> 00:55:36,827
Mm, Sister Ophelia,
I could get myself to the altar

1136
00:55:36,862 --> 00:55:38,068
if need be.
Mm-hmm.

1137
00:55:38,103 --> 00:55:39,379
I appreciate your concern,
though.

1138
00:55:39,413 --> 00:55:40,862
Good to see.
Mm-hmm.

1139
00:55:40,896 --> 00:55:42,379
You look great, by the way.

1140
00:55:42,413 --> 00:55:43,517
Uh-huh. I know.

1141
00:55:43,551 --> 00:55:45,862
Quentin.

1142
00:55:45,896 --> 00:55:47,413
You just saved my damn lunch.

1143
00:55:47,448 --> 00:55:49,413
Hey.

1144
00:55:49,448 --> 00:55:51,827
Now you know you both can
go up to the altar together.

1145
00:55:51,862 --> 00:55:53,793
There's room for both of you
at the cross.

1146
00:55:53,827 --> 00:55:56,000
I guess.
Thank you.

1147
00:55:56,034 --> 00:55:58,689
It's so good to see you.
Mm-hmm.

1148
00:56:02,482 --> 00:56:03,965
So you ain't been
to church in all these years

1149
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:06,620
and you didn't think
to tell me you were coming?

1150
00:56:06,655 --> 00:56:08,448
It was a
last-minute decision.

1151
00:56:08,482 --> 00:56:10,689
Oh, right, ironically,
you found Jesus now

1152
00:56:10,724 --> 00:56:12,689
since you've been hanging out
with her.

1153
00:56:12,724 --> 00:56:15,931
Chloe,
I haven't found anything, okay?

1154
00:56:15,965 --> 00:56:18,034
You know what?
Don't worry.

1155
00:56:18,068 --> 00:56:19,551
I'm not going to
cause a scene here.

1156
00:56:19,586 --> 00:56:21,448
Thank you for not causing a--

1157
00:56:21,482 --> 00:56:22,620
where are you--

1158
00:56:28,206 --> 00:56:30,724
You're here now, Papa.

1160
00:56:47,827 --> 00:56:52,517

♪ God sent me a king

1167
00:57:23,896 --> 00:57:25,862
Church, let's give Montana
a big hand

1168
00:57:25,896 --> 00:57:29,586
for that soul-stirring song
that lifted all of our spirits.

1169
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:32,103
In this technological age,

1170
00:57:32,137 --> 00:57:33,931
would you open up
your Bible apps

1171
00:57:33,965 --> 00:57:35,862
and go to the book of Job,

1172
00:57:35,896 --> 00:57:38,655
the 15th chapter
and the 13th verse?

1173
00:57:38,689 --> 00:57:43,689
It says, ""Though He slay me,
yet will I trust Him.""

1174
00:57:43,724 --> 00:57:45,517
When you look
at all of the seasons

1175
00:57:45,551 --> 00:57:47,034
that take place in the Earth,

1176
00:57:47,068 --> 00:57:49,551
it is reflective
of all the seasons

1177
00:57:49,586 --> 00:57:51,689
we go through in our life.

1178
00:57:51,724 --> 00:57:54,758
Winter, spring, summer, fall.

1179
00:57:54,793 --> 00:57:56,655
Everybody loves spring,

1180
00:57:56,689 --> 00:57:59,000
when things are blossoming
and blooming and growing.

1181
00:57:59,034 --> 00:58:00,241
- Amen.
- Amen.

1182
00:58:00,275 --> 00:58:02,586
Everybody looks forward
to summer

1183
00:58:02,620 --> 00:58:04,310
when things are bright
and cheery and restful.

1184
00:58:04,344 --> 00:58:06,000
- Yes.
- Amen.

1185
00:58:06,034 --> 00:58:08,931
How people find themselves
enamored in fall

1186
00:58:08,965 --> 00:58:11,068
when things are changing.

1187
00:58:11,103 --> 00:58:14,034
But it's hard to find people
who like winter.

1188
00:58:14,068 --> 00:58:17,034
My faith is rooted in knowing

1189
00:58:17,068 --> 00:58:19,931
that even while it is winter
in your life,

1190
00:58:19,965 --> 00:58:22,793
spring is still coming.

1191
00:58:22,827 --> 00:58:26,068
We trust Him even when we don't
like what life is serving.

1192
00:58:26,103 --> 00:58:30,551
We trust Him even when we're
at the crossroads of life,

1193
00:58:30,586 --> 00:58:34,724
trying to figure out is
this God, or is this the enemy?

1194
00:58:34,758 --> 00:58:37,758
- Mm.
- God is worth the wait.

1195
00:58:37,793 --> 00:58:39,620
I got to tell you this.

1196
00:58:39,655 --> 00:58:42,068
It's hard for you to do,
it's hard for you to digest,

1197
00:58:42,103 --> 00:58:44,620
it's hard for you
to hold on to.

1198
00:58:44,655 --> 00:58:48,172
But I'm challenging you
to have the faith of Job.

1199
00:58:48,206 --> 00:58:51,206
And in the face of all of
your adversarial conditions,

1200
00:58:51,241 --> 00:58:55,034
I want you to resolve
in yourself

1201
00:58:55,068 --> 00:58:59,206
that though He's slain me,
I still trust Him.

1202
00:59:01,758 --> 00:59:03,862
Y'all sounded so good, yes.

1203
00:59:03,896 --> 00:59:07,206
Speaking of sound good,
you brought the house down.

1204
00:59:07,241 --> 00:59:09,724
Thank you for inviting me.
Thank you for coming.

1205
00:59:09,758 --> 00:59:10,758
Absolutely.

1206
00:59:10,793 --> 00:59:12,758
- My guy.
- Hey.

1207
00:59:12,793 --> 00:59:14,034
I'm so glad to see you.

1208
00:59:14,068 --> 00:59:14,793
I wish you would have
told me you were coming,

1209
00:59:14,827 --> 00:59:16,689
I'd have put you
on the program.

1210
00:59:16,724 --> 00:59:18,275
Which is why
you didn't know I was coming.

1211
00:59:18,310 --> 00:59:20,275
Oh, the shots fired.

1212
00:59:20,310 --> 00:59:23,137
But I need to know
what do I have to do

1213
00:59:23,172 --> 00:59:25,275
to get you back
in the house again?

1214
00:59:25,310 --> 00:59:26,310
To keep a real, Bishop,

1215
00:59:28,655 --> 00:59:30,000
If that's the
reason why you came,

1216
00:59:30,034 --> 00:59:32,655
I can put Montana up
every Sunday to sing.

1217
00:59:34,034 --> 00:59:35,275
Now that's a plan
that might actually work.

1218
00:59:35,310 --> 00:59:36,310
Leave it to me.

1219
00:59:36,344 --> 00:59:39,793
I'll put that plan right
into motion immediately.

1220
00:59:39,827 --> 00:59:41,655
I'ma take off.
It's good to see you.

1221
00:59:41,689 --> 00:59:42,965
It's good to see you.
I hope to see you again soon.

1222
00:59:43,000 --> 00:59:44,241
Absolutely.

1223
00:59:44,275 --> 00:59:45,620
Montana,
I'll see you in the car.

1224
00:59:45,655 --> 00:59:48,034
Yeah, yeah.
All the way, all the way.

1225
00:59:48,068 --> 00:59:49,068
I just--

1226
00:59:49,103 --> 00:59:52,310
Surprised to see me here?

1227
00:59:52,344 --> 00:59:55,137
If I've been ignoring
your calls and your texts,

1228
00:59:55,172 --> 00:59:56,655
and you're still
randomly popping up.

1229
00:59:56,689 --> 00:59:58,275
That amounts to stalking.

1230
00:59:58,310 --> 01:00:00,000
I thought you'll be glad
I came to church.

1231
01:00:00,034 --> 01:00:01,689
Isn't that what you wanted,
baby?

1232
01:00:01,724 --> 01:00:04,931
No, I wanted us to grow
closer to God as a couple.

1233
01:00:04,965 --> 01:00:06,724
Believe the same things,
but we don't.

1234
01:00:06,758 --> 01:00:07,896
So I moved on.

1235
01:00:07,931 --> 01:00:10,137
Oh, Montana, babe,
come on, listen.

1236
01:00:10,172 --> 01:00:12,068
You the best part of me.

1237
01:00:12,103 --> 01:00:15,310
Okay?
You my whole heart, 'Tana.

1238
01:00:15,344 --> 01:00:17,206
I've been in pieces
since you've been gone.

1239
01:00:17,241 --> 01:00:19,758
If you just,
maybe just take me back

1240
01:00:19,793 --> 01:00:21,896
and make me whole again,
please.

1241
01:00:21,931 --> 01:00:25,310
I gave my whole heart
to Jesus.

1242
01:00:25,344 --> 01:00:28,655
And the next man that gets it
will deserve it.

1243
01:00:28,689 --> 01:00:31,310
Okay.

1244
01:00:31,344 --> 01:00:35,620
Well, let me at least
get a goodbye hug.

1245
01:00:35,655 --> 01:00:41,206
Oh. Hi, Chloe.
This is Rio, an old friend.

1246
01:00:41,241 --> 01:00:45,310
No, no.
I was practically her husband.

1247
01:00:45,344 --> 01:00:48,137
Practically,
we were a lot of things.

1248
01:00:48,172 --> 01:00:50,137
But husband
was not one of them.

1249
01:00:50,172 --> 01:00:53,620
Rio, this is Chloe.
This is my boss's girlfriend.

1250
01:00:53,655 --> 01:00:54,827
Oh, hey.

1251
01:00:54,862 --> 01:00:56,379
Nice to meet you, Rio.

1252
01:00:56,413 --> 01:01:01,206
What brings you to our faith
community on this fine Sunday?

1253
01:01:01,241 --> 01:01:02,931
Oh, that's sweet.
Mm-hmm.

1254
01:01:02,965 --> 01:01:04,896
Has Montana invited you
to the event I'm organizing

1255
01:01:04,931 --> 01:01:07,034
at the Chamberlain mansion?

1256
01:01:07,068 --> 01:01:09,275
No, she hasn't.
I mean, I'd love to come.

1257
01:01:09,310 --> 01:01:11,275
I'm not really
in a position to invite.

1258
01:01:11,310 --> 01:01:14,103
Oh, girl, stop.

1259
01:01:14,137 --> 01:01:15,724
Everyone loves you.

1260
01:01:15,758 --> 01:01:17,034
Besides, it's going
to be the event of the year

1261
01:01:17,068 --> 01:01:18,724
on the Atlanta social calendar.

1262
01:01:18,758 --> 01:01:20,000
Okay.

1263
01:01:20,034 --> 01:01:22,827
So if he comes,
he can be our guest.

1264
01:01:22,862 --> 01:01:24,379
Excuse me.

1265
01:01:28,862 --> 01:01:31,896
Hmm.

1266
01:01:31,931 --> 01:01:33,344
You want her back, don't you?

1267
01:01:33,379 --> 01:01:35,379
Yeah, with all my heart,
I do.

1268
01:01:35,413 --> 01:01:38,344
Yeah, well, you can't
compete with eight figures.

1269
01:01:38,379 --> 01:01:40,344
Quentin Chamberlain
is a billionaire.

1270
01:01:40,379 --> 01:01:42,896
I ain't worried
about his money.

1271
01:01:42,931 --> 01:01:44,103
Well, you should be.

1272
01:01:44,137 --> 01:01:45,965
Women find it impossible

1273
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:48,172
to resist a man who's rich
and handsome.

1274
01:01:48,206 --> 01:01:50,827
And as long as she lives
in that mansion,

1275
01:01:50,862 --> 01:01:54,241
you ain't ever
getting her back.

1276
01:01:54,275 --> 01:01:56,413
But I got a plan.

1277
01:01:56,448 --> 01:01:58,172
Okay.

1278
01:01:58,206 --> 01:02:02,862
If she's fired,
she's homeless.

1279
01:02:02,896 --> 01:02:06,793
Back in your bed
before Christmas.

1280
01:02:08,379 --> 01:02:11,000
Uh, what--what do you need
from me?

1281
01:02:11,034 --> 01:02:13,827
We'll talk.

1282
01:02:13,862 --> 01:02:17,379
You take those right upstairs
and to the left.

1283
01:02:17,413 --> 01:02:19,793
Okay, not too many
in the front.

1284
01:02:21,793 --> 01:02:23,344
It smells
like Christmas in here.

1285
01:02:23,379 --> 01:02:27,034
Quentin's going to love this.

1286
01:02:27,068 --> 01:02:30,275
Mrs. Chamberlain,
you look so regal.

1287
01:02:30,310 --> 01:02:31,965
And you don't even
have on your gown yet.

1288
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:34,034
Well, thank you.
How is everything progressing?

1289
01:02:34,068 --> 01:02:36,793
- I mean--
- I see.

1290
01:02:36,827 --> 01:02:39,517
I invited some of the
church members to attend,

1291
01:02:39,551 --> 01:02:43,103
many of whom don't have
a $1,000 ticket price.

1292
01:02:43,137 --> 01:02:44,448
I picked up the tab.

1293
01:02:44,482 --> 01:02:46,862
I mean, it is Christmas,
after all.

1294
01:02:46,896 --> 01:02:49,793
Mrs. Chamberlain, if
we wanted the church picnic,

1295
01:02:49,827 --> 01:02:51,413
we would have the event
at the church.

1296
01:02:51,448 --> 01:02:55,000
This is supposed
to be a society event.

1297
01:02:55,034 --> 01:02:59,000
I was society when you
were in diapers in Alabama.

1298
01:02:59,034 --> 01:03:01,862
Please make the adjustments
to your guest list.

1299
01:03:01,896 --> 01:03:03,103
But--

1300
01:03:03,137 --> 01:03:06,103
I won't hear
any objections to this.

1301
01:03:08,310 --> 01:03:10,862
I felt that.

1302
01:03:12,206 --> 01:03:18,000
♪ O come, all ye faithful

1303
01:03:18,034 --> 01:03:23,172
♪ Joyful and triumphant

1304
01:03:23,206 --> 01:03:25,551
♪ Oh come ye

1305
01:03:25,586 --> 01:03:28,965
You should be inside
getting dolled up.

1306
01:03:31,275 --> 01:03:33,034
Between Chloe
barking at everyone

1307
01:03:33,068 --> 01:03:37,000
and giving me murderous looks,
it's stressful in there.

1308
01:03:37,034 --> 01:03:39,172
Mm.

1309
01:03:39,206 --> 01:03:40,586
And the one good dress
I have,

1310
01:03:40,620 --> 01:03:43,275
I already wore it to my solo.

1311
01:03:43,310 --> 01:03:45,137
Well, there's nothing much
I can do about Chloe

1312
01:03:45,172 --> 01:03:47,172
and her disposition,

1313
01:03:47,206 --> 01:03:52,896
but there might be something
for you to wear in your room.

1314
01:03:52,931 --> 01:03:56,068
- Estelle, you didn't.
- I'm not sure what was done.

1315
01:03:56,103 --> 01:03:58,275
You're going to
have to go and see.

1316
01:03:58,310 --> 01:04:03,137
Oh, my goodness.

1317
01:04:03,172 --> 01:04:05,896
Thank you so much
for whatever you just did.

1318
01:04:05,931 --> 01:04:07,137
Mm-hmm.

1319
01:04:07,172 --> 01:04:09,413
And for what you've
already done.

1320
01:04:09,448 --> 01:04:11,379
Come on.
Let's get dressed.

1321
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:21,517
Mr. Chamberlain didn't
know what you'd like,

1322
01:04:21,551 --> 01:04:25,034
so I brought lots of options.

1323
01:04:25,068 --> 01:04:27,931
Oh, what?

1324
01:04:27,965 --> 01:04:32,034
Oh, my gosh.

1325
01:04:32,068 --> 01:04:33,586
I'm speechless.

1326
01:04:33,620 --> 01:04:37,310
Tonight, you're
going to be Cinderella.

1327
01:04:39,103 --> 01:04:43,379
Oh.
You look quite dapper, son.

1328
01:04:43,413 --> 01:04:45,206
Thank you.

1329
01:04:45,241 --> 01:04:48,241
I wish your father were alive
to see how handsome you are.

1330
01:04:48,275 --> 01:04:50,137
You look just like him.

1331
01:04:50,172 --> 01:04:52,241
Mwah.
Thank you.

1332
01:04:52,275 --> 01:04:56,344
Well, what do we think?

1333
01:04:56,379 --> 01:04:58,241
Absolutely exquisite.

1334
01:04:58,275 --> 01:05:01,310
Great job.
Thank you, baby.

1335
01:05:01,344 --> 01:05:04,034
Oh, and Mrs. Chamberlain,
I've updated the list

1336
01:05:04,068 --> 01:05:06,275
to accommodate some
of our special church members.

1337
01:05:06,310 --> 01:05:07,310
Well done.

1338
01:05:07,344 --> 01:05:09,103
Okay, well, off I go.

1339
01:05:09,137 --> 01:05:12,413
Toodles.

1340
01:05:12,448 --> 01:05:15,206
Um, Mother,
have you seen Montana?

1341
01:05:15,241 --> 01:05:17,413
When a lady is
introduced to society,

1342
01:05:17,448 --> 01:05:20,034
she has to make an entrance.

1343
01:05:20,068 --> 01:05:22,517
Oh.

1344
01:05:22,551 --> 01:05:27,137
And son,
it's time for new life.

1345
01:05:27,172 --> 01:05:29,724
You know how much
I love Shandra,

1346
01:05:29,758 --> 01:05:31,551
but she's not coming back,

1347
01:05:31,586 --> 01:05:34,137
and Chloe is not the one
for you.

1348
01:05:34,172 --> 01:05:35,482
Ma--

1349
01:05:35,517 --> 01:05:38,000
If she were, you would
have married her by now.

1350
01:05:39,241 --> 01:05:41,655
And believe me
when I tell you

1351
01:05:41,689 --> 01:05:45,000
that Montana is going to have
a long line of suitors

1352
01:05:45,034 --> 01:05:46,724
after tonight.

1353
01:05:46,758 --> 01:05:50,310
So you may want to
consider making a move

1354
01:05:50,344 --> 01:05:53,034
before you end up
at the end of the line.

1355
01:05:53,068 --> 01:05:55,551
What?

1356
01:06:10,482 --> 01:06:12,413
Baby.

1357
01:06:12,448 --> 01:06:14,068
Hey.

1358
01:06:14,103 --> 01:06:16,448
I wanted to introduce
you to Montana's date, Rio.

1359
01:06:16,482 --> 01:06:18,551
Nice place, man.

1360
01:06:18,586 --> 01:06:21,034
Uh, thank you.
Thank you very much.

1361
01:06:21,068 --> 01:06:22,206
Appreciate it.

1362
01:06:22,241 --> 01:06:24,206
Oh, there she is.

1363
01:06:25,758 --> 01:06:28,448
Um, I was just introducing
Quentin to your boyfriend.

1364
01:06:28,482 --> 01:06:31,034
My ex-boyfriend,

1365
01:06:31,068 --> 01:06:35,206
that you invited
even after I asked you not to.

1366
01:06:36,758 --> 01:06:40,034
You know what, c'est la vie.
Rico, welcome.

1367
01:06:40,068 --> 01:06:42,034
It's Rio.

1368
01:06:42,068 --> 01:06:43,551
Right.

1369
01:06:43,586 --> 01:06:45,655
If you'll all excuse me,
I have to go

1370
01:06:45,689 --> 01:06:47,758
and officially
get this function underway.

1371
01:06:47,793 --> 01:06:48,758
Excuse me.

1372
01:06:52,310 --> 01:06:55,137
Unbelievable.

1373
01:06:59,103 --> 01:07:00,827
Ladies and gentlemen,
if I could have your attention

1374
01:07:00,862 --> 01:07:02,689
just for a moment.

1375
01:07:02,724 --> 01:07:04,551
I want to personally
say thank you all

1376
01:07:04,586 --> 01:07:07,793
for attending our fourth
annual Christmas gala.

1377
01:07:07,827 --> 01:07:10,275
Really quickly, if you
will please show some love

1378
01:07:10,310 --> 01:07:11,724
to the lovely lady to my left.

1379
01:07:11,758 --> 01:07:14,206
This is Chloe Brooks,
my literal right hand.

1380
01:07:14,241 --> 01:07:15,620
Came in and put this whole
thing together for us.

1381
01:07:15,655 --> 01:07:20,206
You did a fantastic job.

1382
01:07:20,793 --> 01:07:21,758
Transitions.

1383
01:07:21,793 --> 01:07:25,379
Transitions is for women
with terminal cancer

1384
01:07:25,413 --> 01:07:27,379
who do not have
health insurance.

1385
01:07:27,413 --> 01:07:30,344
We house ten women
at a restored mansion

1386
01:07:30,379 --> 01:07:31,793
just outside of Douglasville,

1387
01:07:31,827 --> 01:07:34,103
providing the world's
best palliative care,

1388
01:07:34,137 --> 01:07:36,586
all at absolutely
no cost to the patient.

1389
01:07:36,620 --> 01:07:38,689
It is truly a labor of love.

1390
01:07:38,724 --> 01:07:41,620
Heavy on the labor,
but even heavier on the love.

1391
01:07:41,655 --> 01:07:43,241
And we can't do it alone.

1392
01:07:43,275 --> 01:07:47,137
So I want to thank you all
in advance for your support.

1393
01:07:47,172 --> 01:07:48,793
With that being said,
please enjoy the food, please

1394
01:07:48,827 --> 01:07:50,448
enjoy the music, but
most importantly,

1395
01:07:50,482 --> 01:07:52,344
please enjoy each
other.

1396
01:07:52,379 --> 01:07:55,448
Thank you again for coming.
Merry Christmas.

1397
01:07:55,482 --> 01:07:57,413
all: Merry Christmas.

1398
01:08:02,862 --> 01:08:05,689
Montana.

1399
01:08:05,724 --> 01:08:08,862
You look absolutely amazing.

1400
01:08:08,896 --> 01:08:10,517
Thank you
for being here tonight.

1401
01:08:10,551 --> 01:08:11,551
I think I'ma take off.

1402
01:08:11,586 --> 01:08:13,172
Wait, you're leaving?

1403
01:08:13,206 --> 01:08:15,896
These events are still
a little hard for me,

1404
01:08:15,931 --> 01:08:17,655
you know, because--

1405
01:08:17,689 --> 01:08:19,274
- Yeah, I do.
- Yeah.

1406
01:08:19,309 --> 01:08:20,758
But you can't leave.

1407
01:08:20,792 --> 01:08:24,172
Deidre and Daniel
have a surprise for you.

1408
01:08:24,206 --> 01:08:25,172
What kind of surprise?

1409
01:08:25,206 --> 01:08:26,517
The kind you'll love.

1410
01:08:26,550 --> 01:08:29,827
But you have to stay
to find out what it is.

1411
01:08:29,862 --> 01:08:31,344
I'm sorry,
I'ma have to miss it this time.

1412
01:08:31,379 --> 01:08:33,309
Please don't go.

1413
01:08:36,655 --> 01:08:38,931
Puppy dog eyes.
Really?

1414
01:08:38,965 --> 01:08:41,517
Okay, I'll stick around
for a little while.

1415
01:08:41,550 --> 01:08:43,689
Okay.
Give me ten minutes, okay?

1416
01:08:43,724 --> 01:08:45,344
I was thinking
more like five.

1417
01:08:45,379 --> 01:08:47,517
Seven and a half?

1418
01:08:47,550 --> 01:08:48,862
You on the clock right now,
so.

1419
01:08:48,896 --> 01:08:50,724
Okay. All right.

1420
01:08:52,862 --> 01:08:55,517
Are you guys ready?

1421
01:08:55,550 --> 01:08:59,482
If Pops doesn't like this,
will he fire you?

1422
01:08:59,517 --> 01:09:02,482
I don't think
that's going to happen.

1423
01:09:02,517 --> 01:09:05,241
I think God wants me
to be here.

1424
01:09:05,274 --> 01:09:10,309
If God took our mother away,
then why would He let you stay?

1425
01:09:14,517 --> 01:09:16,827
Come on.
Take a seat.

1426
01:09:23,792 --> 01:09:28,896
I know what it's like
to lose your mom.

1427
01:09:28,931 --> 01:09:34,517
I lost my mom
when I was in middle school.

1428
01:09:34,550 --> 01:09:40,896
And I know this
might sound crazy, but...

1429
01:09:40,931 --> 01:09:42,827
sometimes
you just have to know

1430
01:09:42,862 --> 01:09:45,931
that God is going
to make everything okay,

1431
01:09:45,965 --> 01:09:49,827
even when there's
no visible evidence He will.

1432
01:09:49,862 --> 01:09:52,517
And that's called faith.

1433
01:09:52,550 --> 01:09:56,793
Did your mom have cancer too?

1434
01:09:56,827 --> 01:09:58,241
No.

1435
01:09:58,275 --> 01:10:03,550
Her heart just gave out.

1436
01:10:03,585 --> 01:10:06,241
Completely unexpected.

1437
01:10:06,275 --> 01:10:09,241
And I didn't even get a chance
to say goodbye.

1438
01:10:09,275 --> 01:10:12,482
I'm so sorry, Miss Montana.

1439
01:10:12,517 --> 01:10:14,517
Thanks.

1440
01:10:14,550 --> 01:10:17,482
I still miss her.

1441
01:10:17,517 --> 01:10:18,585
But do you want to
know what I learned

1442
01:10:18,620 --> 01:10:21,000
when my mom went to heaven?

1443
01:10:21,034 --> 01:10:24,000
That life isn't fair,
and no matter what you do,

1444
01:10:24,034 --> 01:10:26,413
bad stuff is still going
to happen.

1445
01:10:26,448 --> 01:10:29,413
No.

1446
01:10:29,448 --> 01:10:33,000
I learned that everything
is temporary.

1447
01:10:33,034 --> 01:10:36,241
Except God.

1448
01:10:36,275 --> 01:10:40,585
He's the only one
that stays forever.

1449
01:10:40,620 --> 01:10:43,344
If Pops fires you,

1450
01:10:43,379 --> 01:10:46,550
can you still come over
sometimes and hang out with us?

1451
01:10:46,585 --> 01:10:49,793
We low-key squad now.

1452
01:10:49,827 --> 01:10:52,585
Oh, oh.

1453
01:10:52,620 --> 01:10:54,550
Okay, let's stop
all this sad talk.

1454
01:10:54,585 --> 01:10:56,724
We've got a crowd to wow.

1455
01:10:56,758 --> 01:10:58,413
Are y'all ready?
Yes.

1456
01:10:58,448 --> 01:11:00,550
- Did you do your warm-ups?
- Yeah. I'm nervous, though.

1457
01:11:00,585 --> 01:11:02,827
Well, come on.
Let's go, let's go.

1458
01:11:02,862 --> 01:11:04,793
Oh, my gosh, I love this dress.

1459
01:11:04,827 --> 01:11:06,655
Yeah, it's so pretty.

1460
01:11:08,827 --> 01:11:11,827
We have a surprise, everyone.

1461
01:11:11,862 --> 01:11:14,931
The duet known
as the Chamberlain Children

1462
01:11:14,965 --> 01:11:18,655
would like to bless you
with an original song

1463
01:11:18,689 --> 01:11:21,482
called ""Everything I Need
at Christmas.""

1464
01:11:25,793 --> 01:11:30,550

01:11:30,585 --> 01:11:36,448

How did you like it, Dad?

1481
01:13:04,585 --> 01:13:06,585
You sounded great, kid.

1482
01:13:06,620 --> 01:13:08,965
You guys' voices
have improved a lot.

1483
01:13:09,000 --> 01:13:11,517
Miss Montana taught us.

1484
01:13:13,620 --> 01:13:15,793
You sound
just like your mother.

1485
01:13:15,827 --> 01:13:19,448
Thanks, Dad.

1486
01:13:19,482 --> 01:13:21,862
Excuse me, excuse me.
both: Don't go.

1487
01:13:21,896 --> 01:13:25,172
What?

1488
01:13:25,206 --> 01:13:26,689
Excuse me, everyone.

1489
01:13:26,724 --> 01:13:29,655
Quentin's going
to need some space.

1490
01:13:29,689 --> 01:13:32,862
I think we should all give
my beautiful grandchildren,

1491
01:13:32,896 --> 01:13:35,620
the duet,
another round of applause.

1492
01:13:37,206 --> 01:13:40,862
Let's also acknowledge their
wonderful teacher, Montana.

1493
01:13:43,931 --> 01:13:46,448
Thank you for bringing music
back into our home.

1494
01:14:02,137 --> 01:14:05,137
You okay?

1495
01:14:05,172 --> 01:14:07,000
No.

1496
01:14:07,034 --> 01:14:10,862
The piano, the singing, the--

1497
01:14:10,896 --> 01:14:13,585
It's too much.
She went too far.

1498
01:14:13,620 --> 01:14:15,172
She was out of line, okay?

1499
01:14:15,206 --> 01:14:17,517
She didn't clear none
of that with me, she--

1500
01:14:17,550 --> 01:14:20,517
Or me.

1501
01:14:20,550 --> 01:14:23,000
And I'm the event planner.

1502
01:14:23,034 --> 01:14:27,482
She should be fired for that.

1503
01:14:27,517 --> 01:14:29,241
Then who will take care
of Deirdre and Daniel?

1504
01:14:29,275 --> 01:14:33,241
Baby, they are old enough
to take care of themselves.

1505
01:14:33,275 --> 01:14:35,827
Chloe,
let me ask you a question.

1506
01:14:35,862 --> 01:14:37,827
Do you want me to fire her

1507
01:14:37,862 --> 01:14:41,137
because you don't think
she can do the job,

1508
01:14:41,172 --> 01:14:43,724
or because you want
to remove the threat?

1509
01:14:43,758 --> 01:14:46,689
A threat?

1510
01:14:46,724 --> 01:14:48,241
Okay.

1511
01:14:48,275 --> 01:14:50,758
What--what are you doing?

1512
01:14:50,793 --> 01:14:51,827
Check your phone.
I sent you a link.

1513
01:14:58,965 --> 01:15:00,206
There's got to be
some sort of mistake.

1514
01:15:00,241 --> 01:15:03,241
Why?
Because she's too perfect?

1515
01:15:03,275 --> 01:15:05,241
- Why would you do that?
- Do what?

1516
01:15:05,275 --> 01:15:06,309
I didn't take naked
pictures of myself

1517
01:15:06,344 --> 01:15:08,068
and post them on BlackTea.

1518
01:15:08,103 --> 01:15:10,034
Your little church girl
did that.

1519
01:15:10,068 --> 01:15:11,862
Maybe you should just ask her.

1520
01:15:11,896 --> 01:15:14,896
Maybe we should
end this thing.

1521
01:15:14,931 --> 01:15:16,655
So what?

1522
01:15:16,689 --> 01:15:18,758
So you can mess with the help?

1523
01:15:18,793 --> 01:15:19,896
What are you talking about?

1524
01:15:19,931 --> 01:15:21,585
I've seen the way
you look at her.

1525
01:15:21,620 --> 01:15:22,931
And trust me,

1526
01:15:22,965 --> 01:15:24,862
I've had my suspicions
since she first got here.

1527
01:15:24,896 --> 01:15:29,172
Okay, this has nothing
to do with Montana.

1528
01:15:29,206 --> 01:15:31,206
You just not the woman
to help me raise my kids.

1529
01:15:31,241 --> 01:15:35,655
And messy Mary Poppins is?
Naked girl?

1530
01:15:35,689 --> 01:15:37,862
Look, I've done nothing
but try to upgrade you

1531
01:15:37,896 --> 01:15:39,862
and them badass kids.

1532
01:15:39,896 --> 01:15:41,620
But you know what?

1533
01:15:41,655 --> 01:15:44,758
You and them little demon kids
can go straight to hell.

1534
01:15:44,793 --> 01:15:47,172
And your mom.

1535
01:15:52,344 --> 01:15:53,550
You think you're just
going to waltz in here

1536
01:15:53,585 --> 01:15:56,862
with your singing and your
what-would-Jesus-do sweetness,

1537
01:15:56,896 --> 01:15:59,000
and Quentin's just
gonna fall for you?

1538
01:15:59,034 --> 01:16:01,309
I got news for you.

1539
01:16:01,344 --> 01:16:03,344
He ain't going
to marry you either.

1540
01:16:03,379 --> 01:16:04,724
Little ho.

1541
01:16:21,241 --> 01:16:25,655
Are you okay?

1542
01:16:25,689 --> 01:16:28,309
What did you think?

1543
01:16:28,344 --> 01:16:30,034
That I was going to hear
Deirdre and Daniel's voices

1544
01:16:30,068 --> 01:16:32,000
and have some sort
of breakthrough?

1545
01:16:32,034 --> 01:16:33,931
Just magically
let music back in my heart?

1546
01:16:33,965 --> 01:16:35,068
I actually did.

1547
01:16:35,103 --> 01:16:36,965
Well, you were wrong.

1548
01:16:37,000 --> 01:16:39,000
Quentin,
your heart is broken.

1549
01:16:39,034 --> 01:16:40,689
It's Mr. Chamberlain,

1550
01:16:40,724 --> 01:16:44,655
and the condition of my heart
is not your concern.

1551
01:16:44,689 --> 01:16:47,000
You were brought here
to look after the kids,

1552
01:16:47,034 --> 01:16:49,137
and based off your choices,

1553
01:16:49,172 --> 01:16:52,137
you're not even the person
for that.

1554
01:16:52,172 --> 01:16:54,241
Mr. Chamberlain, I'm so sorry

1555
01:16:54,275 --> 01:16:59,241
for committing the crime of
having Deidre and Daniel sing.

1556
01:16:59,275 --> 01:17:01,309
But there's no reason for you
to assail my character.

1557
01:17:01,344 --> 01:17:04,448
You want to talk
about character?

1558
01:17:04,482 --> 01:17:06,206
Let's talk character.

1559
01:17:06,241 --> 01:17:08,931
So I guess in your world,

1560
01:17:08,965 --> 01:17:11,344
it's all right for choir girls
to show they ass on BlackTea?

1561
01:17:12,965 --> 01:17:15,862
Is this you?

1562
01:17:20,379 --> 01:17:21,689
Pack your things.

1563
01:17:21,724 --> 01:17:23,034
Quentin--

1564
01:17:23,068 --> 01:17:26,034
Mr. Chamberlain,
those are old photos,

1565
01:17:26,068 --> 01:17:29,034
and I didn't post them!

1566
01:17:29,068 --> 01:17:31,724
I'm the victim here.

1567
01:17:31,758 --> 01:17:34,344
I put you in my house,

1568
01:17:34,379 --> 01:17:36,689
I put you around my children...

1569
01:17:36,724 --> 01:17:38,034
I showed you Transitions,

1570
01:17:38,068 --> 01:17:42,000
and to think
I was even starting to fall--

1571
01:17:43,413 --> 01:17:46,379
Your services
are no longer needed.

1572
01:17:46,413 --> 01:17:49,206
And I'm sure
my mother will agree.

1573
01:17:49,241 --> 01:17:51,413
You can go.

1574
01:17:54,896 --> 01:17:58,896
I thought you said
you deleted those pictures.

1575
01:17:58,931 --> 01:18:00,758
- Uh--
- Is that why you came here?

1576
01:18:00,793 --> 01:18:02,413
To get me fired?

1577
01:18:02,448 --> 01:18:03,965
All right,
let--let's talk about this.

1578
01:18:04,000 --> 01:18:05,413
So--oh!

1579
01:18:05,448 --> 01:18:07,103
If you come anywhere near me

1580
01:18:07,137 --> 01:18:08,793
or contact me again,

1581
01:18:08,827 --> 01:18:11,793
I promise you
I'm calling the police.

1582
01:18:11,827 --> 01:18:15,517
Montana, hey.

1583
01:18:28,827 --> 01:18:30,448
Hey, girl.
Hey.

1584
01:18:30,482 --> 01:18:32,206
Hey, um,
can I stay with you

1585
01:18:32,241 --> 01:18:34,448
until I find another place?

1586
01:18:34,482 --> 01:18:36,793
Of course
you can stay with me.

1587
01:18:36,827 --> 01:18:38,241
What's going on?

1588
01:18:38,275 --> 01:18:40,896
Someone posted naked pictures
of me on BlackTea.

1589
01:18:40,931 --> 01:18:42,448
What?

1590
01:18:42,482 --> 01:18:47,379
Oh, and you know
the internet is forever.

1591
01:18:47,413 --> 01:18:50,862
And once you get something
on there, you can't get it off.

1592
01:18:50,896 --> 01:18:53,379
Okay, but what has that
got to do with you moving?

1593
01:18:53,413 --> 01:18:55,413
Quentin just showed me
the pictures.

1594
01:18:55,448 --> 01:19:00,482
And then he just
treated me like trash.

1595
01:19:00,517 --> 01:19:02,896
I'll be here
praying for you, okay?

1596
01:19:02,931 --> 01:19:06,309
Everything is going
to be all right, all right?

1597
01:19:11,103 --> 01:19:14,000
Come in.

1598
01:19:15,309 --> 01:19:17,034
You didn't look okay
when you ran out.

1599
01:19:18,482 --> 01:19:22,137
You're leaving us,
aren't you?

1600
01:19:22,172 --> 01:19:24,448
But it has nothing
to do with you two.

1601
01:19:24,482 --> 01:19:27,344
I am so grateful
I got to know you.

1602
01:19:27,379 --> 01:19:30,172
I hope that you find it
in your hearts to forgive me.

1603
01:19:30,206 --> 01:19:32,034
This is my dad's doing,
isn't it?

1604
01:19:32,068 --> 01:19:36,862
You can't leave us
on Christmas Eve.

1605
01:19:36,896 --> 01:19:39,965
Can you excuse us?

1606
01:19:45,206 --> 01:19:50,103
Quentin didn't hire you,
so Quentin can't fire you.

1607
01:19:50,137 --> 01:19:53,068
You've become like
part of the family.

1608
01:19:57,068 --> 01:19:58,344
Thank you for reminding me

1609
01:19:58,379 --> 01:20:01,275
of what it feels like
to have a mother.

1610
01:20:01,309 --> 01:20:04,585
That's the nicest thing
I've heard in a long time.

1611
01:20:06,000 --> 01:20:08,550
Oh, baby.

1612
01:20:08,585 --> 01:20:12,103
But I can't stay.

1613
01:20:16,034 --> 01:20:20,517
This is why it's better
to never get your hopes up.

1614
01:20:20,550 --> 01:20:22,862
'Cause then
you'll never be disappointed.

1615
01:20:22,896 --> 01:20:24,550
Oh, sweetie.

1616
01:20:33,862 --> 01:20:36,137
Did you relieve Montana
of her duties?

1617
01:20:43,000 --> 01:20:45,000
Sorry, I got to take this.

1618
01:20:45,034 --> 01:20:47,137
Hello.
Mr. Chamberlain.

1619
01:20:47,172 --> 01:20:49,379
I don't think Alexis is going
to make it through the night,

1620
01:20:49,413 --> 01:20:51,034
so you might want to get here.

1621
01:20:51,068 --> 01:20:53,000
I'm on my way.

1622
01:21:04,275 --> 01:21:06,344
It's open.

1623
01:21:50,103 --> 01:21:52,068
Q doggy dog.

1624
01:22:06,655 --> 01:22:11,724
You--you know I love you.

1625
01:22:17,309 --> 01:22:20,482
But you can't save me

1626
01:22:20,517 --> 01:22:23,068
'cause you ain't Jesus.

1627
01:22:23,103 --> 01:22:26,482
But you can

1628
01:22:26,517 --> 01:22:32,309
live your life to the fullest.

1629
01:22:32,344 --> 01:22:36,103
Which is what God
wants you to do.

1630
01:22:38,034 --> 01:22:42,517
Yeah. Life's too short.

1631
01:22:44,655 --> 01:22:47,103
What are you waiting for?

1632
01:23:05,655 --> 01:23:10,034
When you gave me this...

1633
01:23:10,068 --> 01:23:12,689
you said it's 'cause
it was Shandra's.

1634
01:23:15,344 --> 01:23:20,344
But now, this is--

1635
01:23:20,379 --> 01:23:23,241
that was your way
of giving up on God.

1636
01:23:30,068 --> 01:23:33,689
It's--it's time for you
to get your holy back.

1637
01:23:44,068 --> 01:23:49,172
Q.

1638
01:23:49,206 --> 01:23:53,034
Look at me.

1639
01:23:53,068 --> 01:23:58,689
T-thank you.

1640
01:24:23,448 --> 01:24:25,275
Come in.

1641
01:24:34,137 --> 01:24:36,172
Son,

1642
01:24:36,206 --> 01:24:40,585
there's so much beauty
and love inside of you.

1643
01:24:40,620 --> 01:24:44,103
But you've been withholding it

1644
01:24:44,137 --> 01:24:45,793
from the world
and from this family,

1645
01:24:45,827 --> 01:24:48,068
ever since
you stopped believing.

1646
01:24:52,758 --> 01:24:55,413
One of the saddest days
in my life,

1647
01:24:55,448 --> 01:24:57,448
when she left here.

1648
01:25:00,965 --> 01:25:03,931
When Deirdre and Daniel sang,

1649
01:25:03,965 --> 01:25:07,896
I saw a light in their eyes
I haven't seen since--

1650
01:25:10,172 --> 01:25:13,241
Since before
she Shandra got sick.

1651
01:25:13,275 --> 01:25:18,241
And that's because of Montana.

1652
01:25:18,275 --> 01:25:21,448
Quentin, if you let her
walk out of your life,

1653
01:25:21,482 --> 01:25:25,379
I can assure you,
you will forever regret it.

1654
01:25:34,379 --> 01:25:37,309
Why me?

1655
01:25:37,344 --> 01:25:39,275
Why me?

1656
01:25:41,689 --> 01:25:42,689
You, uh...

1657
01:25:42,724 --> 01:25:44,309
do you mind if I sit?

1658
01:25:57,550 --> 01:26:01,344
The things I said to you

1659
01:26:01,379 --> 01:26:04,827
were--were misguided.

1660
01:26:04,862 --> 01:26:09,896
And it was stupid of me
to condemn you so quickly.

1661
01:26:12,931 --> 01:26:16,241
I'm man enough to admit
when I'm wrong.

1662
01:26:20,585 --> 01:26:23,275
I'm here to ask you
to please come back.

1663
01:26:23,309 --> 01:26:26,655
The kids want you back,
my mother wants you back.

1664
01:26:29,000 --> 01:26:30,827
I want you back.

1665
01:26:36,862 --> 01:26:39,896
I've never felt so dishonored
in my life.

1666
01:26:42,620 --> 01:26:44,550
And rather than
see my devastation,

1667
01:26:44,585 --> 01:26:46,206
you chose to humiliate me.

1668
01:26:46,241 --> 01:26:48,827
Montana, I'm sorry.

1669
01:26:48,862 --> 01:26:52,724
I was--

1670
01:26:52,758 --> 01:26:55,758
I was so locked into
just the pain of the past

1671
01:26:55,793 --> 01:26:58,413
that I couldn't see the future.

1672
01:27:00,689 --> 01:27:04,034
Or how you fit into it.

1673
01:27:04,068 --> 01:27:09,655
What do you mean,
me fitting into it?

1674
01:27:09,689 --> 01:27:13,758
Montana...

1675
01:27:13,793 --> 01:27:15,827
the first time I saw you...

1676
01:27:15,862 --> 01:27:18,413
Time stood still.

1677
01:27:21,758 --> 01:27:24,655
But I could not
accept the fact that--

1678
01:27:24,689 --> 01:27:26,655
that you were the answer

1679
01:27:26,689 --> 01:27:32,309
to a prayer that
I had forgot I'd even prayed.

1680
01:27:32,344 --> 01:27:35,309
And I spoke that prayer
right there,

1681
01:27:35,344 --> 01:27:37,931
at that piano.

1682
01:27:37,965 --> 01:27:41,827
Dear Lord,

1683
01:27:41,862 --> 01:27:45,482
heal this broken heart...

1684
01:27:46,827 --> 01:27:52,482
And allow me to love again.

1685
01:27:52,517 --> 01:27:54,550

of a high and aggravated nature

1735
01:32:26,068 --> 01:32:27,309
for posting illicit photos
online.

1736
01:32:27,344 --> 01:32:29,068
Oh, please.
I don't have time for this.

1737
01:32:29,103 --> 01:32:31,550
Hands behind your back,
ma'am.

1738
01:32:31,585 --> 01:32:32,931
Really?

1739
01:32:32,965 --> 01:32:34,206
Out here, in front of everyone?

1740
01:32:34,241 --> 01:32:35,379
Yes.

1741
01:32:35,413 --> 01:32:37,758
Could you guys let the
Bishop know this is happening?

1742
01:32:37,793 --> 01:32:39,309
Yes.

1743
01:32:39,344 --> 01:32:41,241

1744
01:32:41,275 --> 01:32:43,034

I've learned that God will
always do so much more

1755

00:00:14,973 --> 00:00:16,767
- Where are you getting beer?

2
00:00:55,097 --> 00:00:56,598
- I'm so cold.

3
00:02:28,857 --> 00:02:30,942
- Get me one of them beers.

4
00:04:29,019 --> 00:04:31,938
- Vera, got 'em burgers ready to go?

5
00:04:35,066 --> 00:04:36,485
Shit.

6
00:04:37,652 --> 00:04:40,614
Dear, how about another beer, will ya?

7
00:04:51,833 --> 00:04:53,335
So what do you think, kids?

8
00:04:53,668 --> 00:04:55,295
Some vacation, huh?

9
00:04:55,629 --> 00:04:56,546
- Fabulous, daddy.

10
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:58,757
All my friends are gonna be so jealous.

11
00:05:01,176 --> 00:05:02,469
- This place sucks.

12
00:05:02,803 --> 00:05:04,304
I'm freezing.

13
00:05:04,638 --> 00:05:06,890
Why couldn't we go to
Florida, like everybody else?

14
00:05:09,643 --> 00:05:13,772
- And waitin' in all those
lines with all those tourists?

15
00:05:14,105 --> 00:05:14,606
Huh, son?

16
00:05:14,940 --> 00:05:16,107
Huh, huh, huh?

17
00:05:16,441 --> 00:05:18,610
No, this year, we're
gonna miss those crowds.

18
00:05:18,944 --> 00:05:21,571
We're gonna see the great outdoors.

19
00:05:21,905 --> 00:05:24,574
Hell, we got this whole
campground to ourselves.

20
00:05:24,908 --> 00:05:26,368
As soon as 'em coals get hot,

21
00:05:26,701 --> 00:05:29,496
I'm gonna cook us up some real burgers.

22
00:05:29,830 --> 00:05:32,165
Vera, got them burgers and my beer?

23
00:05:34,793 --> 00:05:36,461
Damn it, where is that woman?

24
00:05:37,546 --> 00:05:39,047
You kids sit here and enjoy the scenery.

25
00:05:39,381 --> 00:05:41,383
I'm gonna see what's
happened to that goof.

26
00:05:57,399 --> 00:05:58,275
- Will you stop that?

27
00:05:58,608 --> 00:05:59,568
I'm trying to read.

28
00:05:59,901 --> 00:06:01,695
- I didn't think you knew how.

29
00:06:02,028 --> 00:06:02,904
- Listen, you little brat,

30
00:06:03,238 --> 00:06:05,407
just because I was forced to
come on this stupid vacation

31
00:06:05,740 --> 00:06:07,659
with you doesn't mean I
have to listen to any more

32
00:06:07,993 --> 00:06:08,910
of your smart-ass remarks.

33
00:06:09,244 --> 00:06:10,328
- And what are
you gonna do about it?

34
00:06:10,662 --> 00:06:12,789
- How about this, you little
miserable little shit?

35
00:06:13,123 --> 00:06:14,374
- Ow!

36
00:06:14,708 --> 00:06:16,585
- Vera, where in the hell's my beer?

37
00:06:19,546 --> 00:06:22,549
- Please, I'll
do whatever you want.

38
00:06:22,883 --> 00:06:24,968
- Vera?

39
00:06:25,302 --> 00:06:28,305
- Just don't hurt my babies.

40
00:06:28,638 --> 00:06:30,348
- Vera, are you in there?

41
00:06:30,682 --> 00:06:33,268
- They're my babies, too, Jennifer.

42
00:06:33,602 --> 00:06:34,144
- Vera?

43
00:06:34,477 --> 00:06:35,103
You okay?

44
00:06:38,732 --> 00:06:39,441
- Harry?

45
00:06:39,774 --> 00:06:41,693
- What the hell's going on, woman?

46
00:06:42,027 --> 00:06:44,487
- Please, Harry, Jennifer's husband, Rex,

47
00:06:44,821 --> 00:06:46,781
just turned up out of nowhere.

48
00:06:47,115 --> 00:06:48,992
Everybody thought he was dead.

49
00:06:49,326 --> 00:06:49,826
- Damn it, Vera,

50
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:54,372
I thought we agreed there
wasn't gonna be no soap operas.

51
00:06:55,290 --> 00:06:59,002
We're gonna cook them barbecue
hamburgers outside now.

52
00:07:00,503 --> 00:07:02,005
- I can just pop 'em in the microwave.

53
00:07:02,339 --> 00:07:03,965
- No microwave.

54
00:07:04,299 --> 00:07:06,843
We're gonna cook over
an open fire outside.

55
00:07:07,177 --> 00:07:08,637
Now come on, the kids are waiting.

56
00:07:08,970 --> 00:07:10,889
- But Harry, it's freezing out there.

57
00:07:21,858 --> 00:07:23,193
- This is the life, huh, kids?

58
00:07:23,526 --> 00:07:24,277
- I'm cold.

59
00:07:24,611 --> 00:07:26,821
- My fingers are numb,
I think it's frostbite.

60
00:07:27,739 --> 00:07:31,701
- They said on TV it's 75
degrees in Los Angeles.

61
00:07:32,035 --> 00:07:34,204
We could be there by tomorrow night.

62
00:07:34,537 --> 00:07:36,748
- Oh, God. The beach, Hollywood.

63
00:07:37,082 --> 00:07:38,833
- And Disneyland, surfing.

64
00:07:39,167 --> 00:07:40,627
- And traffic and smog and winos.

65
00:07:44,589 --> 00:07:45,924
Take a look around you.

66
00:07:47,133 --> 00:07:48,176
You see any traffic?

67
00:07:49,219 --> 00:07:50,387
You see any smog?

68
00:07:51,429 --> 00:07:52,555
You see any winos?

69
00:07:58,061 --> 00:07:59,479
Oh, shit.

70
00:07:59,813 --> 00:08:00,855
- Maybe they won't stop.

71
00:08:07,696 --> 00:08:08,321
- Stop!

72
00:08:08,655 --> 00:08:11,282
Stop, you can't come in here!

73
00:08:11,616 --> 00:08:12,158
You can't come in here!

74
00:08:12,492 --> 00:08:13,743
Stop!

75
00:08:14,077 --> 00:08:14,703
- Say, what the --

76
00:08:16,579 --> 00:08:18,373
- Look, you can't come in here, old timer.

77
00:08:18,707 --> 00:08:19,749
This spot's taken.

78
00:08:20,083 --> 00:08:23,545
- Hey, sign on the highway
says public campground, mister.

79
00:08:24,504 --> 00:08:27,966
Besides, I see three, four
empty campsites up there.

80
00:08:28,299 --> 00:08:31,094
- Look, friend, I passed
up Six campgrounds

81
00:08:31,428 --> 00:08:32,804
to find this spot.

82
00:08:33,138 --> 00:08:35,473
Me and my wife kinda figured
on being alone with the kids.

83
00:08:35,807 --> 00:08:37,517
You understand, don't you?

84
00:08:38,601 --> 00:08:40,103
- I know exactly what you mean.

85
00:08:41,354 --> 00:08:43,690
There ain't nothing like
being in the great outdoors

86
00:08:44,024 --> 00:08:46,401
to bring a man closer to his kids.

87
00:08:48,069 --> 00:08:50,780
Raised my boy Bernie up
here, as a matter of fact.

88
00:08:52,449 --> 00:08:55,326
Shoulda seen the fish we
pulled out of that river there.

89
00:08:56,286 --> 00:08:57,037
- Yeah?

90
00:08:57,370 --> 00:08:59,622
- Oh, yeah, real whoppers.

91
00:08:59,956 --> 00:09:03,126
Of course, Bernie was
just a little dipper then.

92
00:09:03,460 --> 00:09:05,795
Some of them fish was as big as he was.

93
00:09:08,715 --> 00:09:10,300
Say, that your boy over there?

94
00:09:10,633 --> 00:09:11,134
- Yep.

95
00:09:11,468 --> 00:09:12,177
That's my Mikey.

96
00:09:13,261 --> 00:09:14,554
I wanted to get him out of the city.

97
00:09:14,888 --> 00:09:16,848
- Well, best thing in the world for a boy.

98
00:09:18,016 --> 00:09:19,851
Hey, my name's Bromley.

99
00:09:20,185 --> 00:09:21,186
Ben Bromley.

100
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:23,229
You can call me Pop, though.

101
00:09:23,563 --> 00:09:25,273
Everybody calls me Pop.

102
00:09:25,607 --> 00:09:26,524
- Harry Scrubs.

103
00:09:26,858 --> 00:09:27,942
Glad to meet you, Pop.

104
00:09:28,902 --> 00:09:33,448
Look, see, I'm kinda sorry,
you know, about the campsite.

105
00:09:33,782 --> 00:09:35,116
- Oh, forget it, mister.

106
00:09:36,242 --> 00:09:37,118
Understand exactly.

107
00:09:38,244 --> 00:09:40,914
Hey, I'll pull over on the far side.

108
00:09:42,248 --> 00:09:44,042
You folks won't even know I'm here.

109
00:09:54,052 --> 00:09:55,720
- Who is that dirty old man?

110
00:09:56,054 --> 00:09:58,306
- Oh, he's just some harmless old guy.

111
00:09:58,640 --> 00:09:59,474
He won't bother us.

112
00:10:12,695 --> 00:10:13,988
- He looks like a derelict.

113
00:10:14,322 --> 00:10:16,658
- Nah, he's just some poor old guy.

114
00:10:16,991 --> 00:10:18,409
Used to live up here.

115
00:10:18,743 --> 00:10:20,954
Taught his boy to fish
right in this river.

116
00:10:21,287 --> 00:10:22,205
- There's fish here?

117
00:10:22,539 --> 00:10:23,957
- That's what Pop said.

118
00:10:42,517 --> 00:10:44,018
- What's he doing over there?

119
00:10:44,352 --> 00:10:45,937
- Chopping firewood, I guess.

120
00:10:46,271 --> 00:10:48,398
- Wow, he's gonna make a real campfire.

121
00:10:48,731 --> 00:10:50,358
Dad, you think we could
go over and talk to him

122
00:10:50,692 --> 00:10:51,943
about fishing and stuff?

123
00:10:52,277 --> 00:10:53,528
- Yeah, sure.

124
00:10:53,862 --> 00:10:54,863
Maybe we'll all go.

125
00:10:55,196 --> 00:10:56,614
- Daddy, please.

126
00:10:56,948 --> 00:10:57,907
- Really, Harry.

127
00:10:58,241 --> 00:10:59,951
What if he's got some disease?

128
00:11:00,285 --> 00:11:02,287
- Hey, he's just a harmless old guy.

129
00:11:02,620 --> 00:11:04,080
He's up there all alone.

130
00:11:04,414 --> 00:11:07,625
Think what it'd mean to him
to be with a real family.

131
00:11:10,170 --> 00:11:12,922
- When Bernie and I used to live up here,

132
00:11:13,256 --> 00:11:16,092
we'd go for weeks and
not see a human being.

133
00:11:18,303 --> 00:11:20,513
Bernie used to sit on
that rock over there.

134
00:11:21,472 --> 00:11:24,225
Deer would come right up
and eat out of his hand.

135
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:27,645
Used to be a lot of deer up here then.

136
00:11:31,691 --> 00:11:34,152
That boy sure loved them deer.

137
00:11:34,485 --> 00:11:36,070
- More cake, Mr. Bromley?

138
00:11:36,404 --> 00:11:36,905
- Oh, no.

139
00:11:37,238 --> 00:11:38,948
No, thank you, ma'am.

140
00:11:39,282 --> 00:11:41,826
If I had another piece,
I'm liable to bust.

141
00:11:43,745 --> 00:11:46,331
You're sure a lucky man, Harry.

142
00:11:46,664 --> 00:11:50,627
Two great kids and a pretty
little cook like Vera.

143
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:51,920
- Yep.

144
00:11:52,253 --> 00:11:53,838
I guess I am pretty lucky.

145
00:11:55,006 --> 00:11:56,174
Got a good job.

146
00:11:57,675 --> 00:11:59,302
Motorhome's almost paid for.

147
00:12:00,428 --> 00:12:03,973
- Yeah, I was looking at that
motorhome you got, Harry.

148
00:12:04,307 --> 00:12:06,142
That's sure a beautiful rig.

149
00:12:07,060 --> 00:12:10,521
Vera tells me you even got
a microwave oven in there.

150
00:12:10,855 --> 00:12:13,608
- Microwave, central heating,

151
00:12:14,651 --> 00:12:17,654
air conditioning for the
summer, color television.

152
00:12:18,905 --> 00:12:22,200
You name it, this baby's got it, Pop.

153
00:12:23,117 --> 00:12:27,997
- Bernie always wanted to get
a microwave oven for his ma.

154
00:12:28,331 --> 00:12:30,041
Of course, we couldn't afford it.

155
00:12:31,209 --> 00:12:32,627
We couldn't afford electricity.

156
00:12:34,170 --> 00:12:36,422
But he used to sit
there and he'd tell her,

157
00:12:37,507 --> 00:12:40,468
""Someday, I'm gonna get
you a microwave, ma.""

158
00:12:42,011 --> 00:12:43,012
He woulda, too.

159
00:12:45,306 --> 00:12:48,101
Poor woman died before he had a chance.

160
00:12:48,434 --> 00:12:51,145
- Your Bernie sounds like
such a wonderful boy.

161
00:12:51,479 --> 00:12:52,188
- Oh, yes, ma'am.

162
00:12:52,522 --> 00:12:56,025
A man couldn't ask for a
better son than Bernie.

163
00:12:56,985 --> 00:13:01,281
He was gonna take care of
his ma and me in our old age.

164
00:13:01,614 --> 00:13:02,740
- How wonderful.

165
00:13:03,074 --> 00:13:05,868
- We used to have some
good old times together.

166
00:13:06,202 --> 00:13:07,453
Then the boy took sick.

167
00:13:09,372 --> 00:13:13,042
They took him to one of them
big hospitals down state.

168
00:13:14,585 --> 00:13:16,546
Bernie was never the same after that.

169
00:13:18,089 --> 00:13:18,881
- How sad.

170
00:13:21,009 --> 00:13:22,427
- What was wrong with the boy?

171
00:13:24,095 --> 00:13:25,263
- It was nerves, Harry.

172
00:13:26,222 --> 00:13:27,640
Just nerves.

173
00:13:29,225 --> 00:13:30,518
- What the hell was that?

174
00:13:30,852 --> 00:13:33,604
- Ah, probably just some old black bear

175
00:13:33,938 --> 00:13:35,690
out looking for his lady friend.

176
00:13:36,983 --> 00:13:39,068
- There's bears around here?

177
00:13:39,402 --> 00:13:39,944
- Why, sure.

178
00:13:40,278 --> 00:13:42,822
Bears, mountain lions,

179
00:13:43,156 --> 00:13:45,783
all kinds of critters wandering
around these mountains.

180
00:13:46,993 --> 00:13:48,703
Mostly, they keep out of sight now.

181
00:13:49,746 --> 00:13:50,496
- How come?

182
00:13:51,664 --> 00:13:53,207
- It's the campers, son.

183
00:13:58,129 --> 00:14:01,257
Critters don't trust 'em.

184
00:14:01,591 --> 00:14:04,969
Can't trust those humans
out in the wilds, Harry,

185
00:14:05,303 --> 00:14:08,598
‘cause they'll give you the ax every time!

186
00:14:11,017 --> 00:14:11,976
- I don't know about everybody else,

187
00:14:12,310 --> 00:14:14,437
but I'm about ready to call it a night.

188
00:14:16,356 --> 00:14:16,856
How about you, honey?

189
00:14:17,190 --> 00:14:19,025
- My goodness, I suppose I am tired.

190
00:14:19,359 --> 00:14:21,402
Come on, kids, say
goodnight to Mr. Bromley.

191
00:14:23,363 --> 00:14:24,322
- Goodnight.

192
00:14:28,034 --> 00:14:28,826
- Goodnight, Pop.

193
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:30,620
- Goodnight.

194
00:14:32,955 --> 00:14:34,582
- Hold on just a minute.

195
00:14:41,923 --> 00:14:42,882
You forgot something.

196
00:14:46,010 --> 00:14:49,097
- Why don't you just keep
that for a snack, Mr. Bromley?

197
00:14:49,430 --> 00:14:50,390
- Thank you.

198
00:14:50,723 --> 00:14:52,392
Thank you kindly, ma'am.

199
00:14:59,649 --> 00:15:00,608
Hey!

200
00:15:00,942 --> 00:15:02,110
Night, all!

201
00:15:02,443 --> 00:15:04,112
Nice talking to ya.

202
00:15:26,801 --> 00:15:29,512
Now you just settle down, boy.

203
00:15:29,846 --> 00:15:33,015
I brought you a real nice surprise.

204
00:15:33,349 --> 00:15:34,684
Lookie here, boy.

205
00:15:35,017 --> 00:15:36,310
Homemade chocolate cake.

206
00:15:40,690 --> 00:15:42,483
Sure is good cake, boy.

207
00:15:42,817 --> 00:15:44,444
Just like your mama used to make.

208
00:15:46,779 --> 00:15:48,489
You remember them cakes, boy?

209
00:15:55,830 --> 00:15:59,000
We could have chocolate
cake all the time, boy,

210
00:15:59,333 --> 00:16:02,628
if we had a new microwave
oven like them nice folk

211
00:16:02,962 --> 00:16:04,172
in the next campground.

212
00:16:05,465 --> 00:16:09,218
Yeah, they got all kinds
of things over there, boy.

213
00:16:10,178 --> 00:16:11,387
They got a microwave oven,

214
00:16:12,430 --> 00:16:16,684
an icebox full of food, a color TV.

215
00:16:17,018 --> 00:16:20,897
You could watch cartoons all
day long if you had a color TV.

216
00:16:24,108 --> 00:16:26,569
Told you when I took
you from that hospital

217
00:16:26,903 --> 00:16:28,362
that we was going home.

218
00:16:28,696 --> 00:16:30,698
Only this time, it's gonna be different.

219
00:16:31,032 --> 00:16:33,409
Yeah, this time, we're going in style.

220
00:16:40,625 --> 00:16:42,001
- Pop's gonna take me fishing tomorrow.

221
00:16:42,335 --> 00:16:43,961
- How exciting for you.

222
00:16:51,135 --> 00:16:52,136
- Hey, where are you going?

223
00:16:52,470 --> 00:16:53,095
- Out.

224
00:16:55,640 --> 00:16:56,265
- Are you crazy?

225
00:16:56,599 --> 00:16:57,099
There's bears out there.

226
00:16:57,433 --> 00:16:59,101
- Yeah, sure there are, you little creep.

227
00:16:59,435 --> 00:17:01,103
Santa Claus and the Easter Bunny, too.

228
00:17:03,189 --> 00:17:04,190
- I'm gonna tell dad.

229
00:17:05,399 --> 00:17:07,652
- Look, I just wanna go down by the river

230
00:17:07,985 --> 00:17:09,403
and listen to some music by myself.

231
00:17:09,737 --> 00:17:10,905
Give me a break, huh?

232
00:17:11,239 --> 00:17:12,365
- Okay, it's your funeral.

233
00:17:14,534 --> 00:17:15,284
- Thanks, kid.

234
00:17:16,661 --> 00:17:18,412
Sometimes, you're okay.

235
00:17:35,137 --> 00:17:36,013
- What are you doing?

236
00:17:36,347 --> 00:17:38,099
- I thought I heard something.

237
00:17:38,432 --> 00:17:40,560
That old man could be prowling
around out there, Harry.

238
00:17:40,893 --> 00:17:41,978
- Who, Pop?

239
00:17:42,311 --> 00:17:44,772
He's probably snoring his head off by now.

240
00:17:45,106 --> 00:17:47,984
- Well, I don't want Mikey
going over there tomorrow.

241
00:17:48,317 --> 00:17:49,902
- But the old guy said
he'd take him fishing.

242
00:17:50,236 --> 00:17:51,862
- Harry, I don't like that old man.

243
00:17:52,196 --> 00:17:53,030
He scares me.

244
00:17:53,364 --> 00:17:54,073
You take him fishing.

245
00:17:54,407 --> 00:17:55,283
You're his father.

246
00:17:59,954 --> 00:18:01,122
- Well, okay, Vera.

247
00:18:02,248 --> 00:18:03,457
I'll take Mikey fishing.

248
00:18:04,625 --> 00:18:07,086
I still think the old guy's all right.

249
00:18:07,420 --> 00:18:08,087
All you gotta do is listen

250
00:18:08,421 --> 00:18:11,257
to him talk about that
boy of his to know that.

251
00:19:09,690 --> 00:19:11,317
- Now, remember what I told you.

252
00:19:12,401 --> 00:19:14,362
Don't break nothing valuable this time.

253
00:19:16,405 --> 00:19:17,615
Understand?

254
00:19:29,335 --> 00:19:31,379
Don't you go running off no place else,

255
00:19:32,922 --> 00:19:35,424
or I'll let them take
back to the hospital.

256
00:19:35,758 --> 00:19:37,802
Only this time, I won't come and get ya.

257
00:19:44,558 --> 00:19:45,393
Go on, son.

258
00:19:47,561 --> 00:19:49,897
I won't really send you back there.

259
00:19:50,231 --> 00:19:51,857
I brung you home, didn't I?

260
00:20:44,702 --> 00:20:45,578
- Harry!

261
00:20:45,911 --> 00:20:46,579
Wake up!

262
00:20:48,122 --> 00:20:48,914
Wake up!

263
00:20:49,248 --> 00:20:51,751
I thought I heard something.

264
00:20:52,084 --> 00:20:54,211
- Give me a break, Vera.

265
00:20:54,545 --> 00:20:55,254
I just --

266
00:20:56,630 --> 00:20:57,548
Did you hear that?

267
00:20:57,882 --> 00:20:59,300
- That's what I've been
trying to tell you.

268
00:21:42,802 --> 00:21:43,427
- Damn.

269
00:21:44,595 --> 00:21:46,096
Mikey, let me in.

270
00:21:51,018 --> 00:21:52,144
- Stop her, boy!

271
00:21:55,439 --> 00:21:57,233
Don't let her get away, boy.

272
00:21:57,566 --> 00:21:59,652
She's one them that put you away.

273
00:21:59,985 --> 00:22:01,028
She's a camper!

274
00:22:19,255 --> 00:22:20,005
Shit!

275
00:23:28,824 --> 00:23:30,367
- How long do we have to
stay out here, anyway?

276
00:23:30,701 --> 00:23:33,537
It's getting a little cold out, you know?

277
00:23:33,871 --> 00:23:34,955
- You're a hell of a wilderness counselor,

278
00:23:35,289 --> 00:23:35,789
Bob, you know that?

279
00:23:36,123 --> 00:23:39,501
- Look, man, I was built
for comfort, not stress.

280
00:23:39,835 --> 00:23:41,378
Just because I grew up in these hills,

281
00:23:41,712 --> 00:23:43,547
doesn't make me Grizzly Adams, you know?

282
00:23:43,881 --> 00:23:45,257
- Well, it gets cold in
the mountains at night.

283
00:23:45,591 --> 00:23:46,342
I mean, isn't this what you teach

284
00:23:46,675 --> 00:23:48,427
all those little college
cuties in your survival course?

285
00:23:48,761 --> 00:23:51,722
- Yeah, man, and I'm anxious
to get back to them, too.

286
00:23:52,056 --> 00:23:54,516
I got a little practical
exercise I'm gonna teach them.

287
00:23:54,850 --> 00:23:56,894
I call it Sleeping Bag 101.

288
00:23:59,063 --> 00:24:01,440
- Don't you think about
anything else besides girls?

289
00:24:05,402 --> 00:24:06,403
- No.

290
00:24:07,947 --> 00:24:10,658
Hey, did you check out that little chick

291
00:24:10,991 --> 00:24:14,119
with the absolutely perfect thighs?

292
00:24:14,453 --> 00:24:15,204
- Does she have a name?

293
00:24:15,537 --> 00:24:16,038
- Mm-hmm.

294
00:24:16,372 --> 00:24:18,540
Her name is Victoria.

295
00:24:18,874 --> 00:24:20,960
But she said I could call her Vicky.

296
00:24:22,503 --> 00:24:26,256
I think I'm in love, man.

297
00:24:28,676 --> 00:24:30,427
Come on, let's go back up the hill

298
00:24:30,761 --> 00:24:33,055
before that asshole Regis gets
his perverted hands on her,

299
00:24:33,389 --> 00:24:34,556
okay?
- Okay, it shouldn't be long.

300
00:24:34,890 --> 00:24:36,517
There's still two more coming in tonight.

301
00:24:36,850 --> 00:24:38,519
We got a Debbie Harris from Denver

302
00:24:38,852 --> 00:24:42,147
and a PJ Richards from L.A.

303
00:24:42,481 --> 00:24:43,023
- PJ?

304
00:24:43,357 --> 00:24:44,566
- Yeah.

305
00:24:44,900 --> 00:24:48,487
- Do you think PJ is a male or a female?

306
00:24:55,744 --> 00:24:57,371
- Shit.

307
00:24:57,705 --> 00:25:00,207
Road to the camp's gotta
be someplace around here.

308
00:25:07,214 --> 00:25:09,133
All right, civilization.

309
00:25:27,943 --> 00:25:30,904
Hey, anybody home?

310
00:25:31,238 --> 00:25:33,157
Anybody know where the wilderness camp is?

311
00:26:12,821 --> 00:26:13,781
- What I'd like to know, though,

312
00:26:14,114 --> 00:26:17,743
is why we have to stay out
here freezing our asses off

313
00:26:18,077 --> 00:26:20,579
while Regis gets to stay
up in camp where it's warm?

314
00:26:20,913 --> 00:26:23,290
- Well, since we're 50
miles from the nearest town,

315
00:26:23,624 --> 00:26:25,834
there isn't exactly a lot of
places to ask for directions

316
00:26:26,168 --> 00:26:27,461
if somebody gets lost.

317
00:26:27,795 --> 00:26:28,921
Somebody always gets lost.

318
00:26:30,631 --> 00:26:31,799
- And I wonder why they have to put us way

319
00:26:32,132 --> 00:26:33,092
the hell out here, anyway.

320
00:26:33,425 --> 00:26:34,843
- Because this is a
wilderness camp, schmuck.

321
00:26:35,177 --> 00:26:35,719
Where do you want them to put it?

322
00:26:36,053 --> 00:26:37,596
Under the Hollywood freeway?

323
00:26:37,930 --> 00:26:39,098
- That's an idea.

324
00:26:39,431 --> 00:26:41,016
I could go with real
survival things there.

325
00:26:41,350 --> 00:26:42,518
- Ah, look, somebody's coming.

326
00:26:49,775 --> 00:26:50,400
Hi.

327
00:26:50,734 --> 00:26:51,360
- Hi.

328
00:26:52,361 --> 00:26:53,529
Hi, I'm Debbie Harris.

329
00:26:53,862 --> 00:26:55,656
I'm sorry I'm late, my
car's been acting up.

330
00:26:57,074 --> 00:26:58,033
- I'm Ron.

331
00:26:58,367 --> 00:26:59,701
I'm the wildlife instructor.

332
00:27:02,538 --> 00:27:03,163
This is Bobby.

333
00:27:03,497 --> 00:27:05,833
- Well, hello, Debbie.

334
00:27:06,166 --> 00:27:08,794
I'm sure you and I are
gonna be real close friends.

335
00:27:09,128 --> 00:27:10,921
- What do you teach,
sport, hand-to-hand combat?

336
00:27:11,255 --> 00:27:13,215
- Hand-to-hand combat?

337
00:27:14,383 --> 00:27:15,217
That's a good one.

338
00:27:15,551 --> 00:27:17,344
Do you hear that, Ron?

339
00:27:17,678 --> 00:27:18,387
Man, that's a good one.

340
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:19,471
- Where's the camp?

341
00:27:21,014 --> 00:27:23,142
- It's about five miles
from here down the road.

342
00:27:23,475 --> 00:27:24,852
We're waiting for one more guy to show up

343
00:27:25,185 --> 00:27:26,854
and then we can take you there.

344
00:27:27,187 --> 00:27:27,813
- No, that's okay.

345
00:27:28,147 --> 00:27:28,814
Just tell me how to get there.

346
00:27:29,148 --> 00:27:30,899
I'm sure I can find it
all by my little self.

347
00:27:31,233 --> 00:27:31,733
- Sure.

348
00:27:32,067 --> 00:27:33,193
Listen, just follow this
road another half mile

349
00:27:33,527 --> 00:27:35,320
to the dirt road on your left.

350
00:27:35,654 --> 00:27:37,322
That'll take you to the camp.

351
00:27:37,656 --> 00:27:39,658
Ah, Regis will show you where you tent is.

352
00:27:40,742 --> 00:27:41,493
- Thanks.

353
00:27:49,001 --> 00:27:50,377
- Hey, Debbie,

354
00:27:50,711 --> 00:27:53,005
I'm holding a little informal orientation

355
00:27:53,338 --> 00:27:54,882
in my tent later on.

356
00:27:55,215 --> 00:27:56,133
You're invited.

357
00:28:02,890 --> 00:28:03,640
Wow.

358
00:28:04,808 --> 00:28:05,851
What a bitch.

359
00:28:07,352 --> 00:28:09,855
You think she's a lesbian or something?

360
00:28:10,147 --> 00:28:10,939
- I hope not.

361
00:28:34,004 --> 00:28:35,047
- Oh, thank God you stopped.

362
00:28:35,380 --> 00:28:36,006
Something terrible has happened.

363
00:28:36,340 --> 00:28:38,175
Please, you gotta help me.

364
00:28:39,384 --> 00:28:40,928
Oh, God, thank you,
I'll never forget this.

365
00:29:24,930 --> 00:29:25,555
- Damn it.

366
00:29:25,889 --> 00:29:26,848
Don't you dare quit on me now.

367
00:29:27,182 --> 00:29:27,933
We're almost there.

368
00:29:31,645 --> 00:29:36,566
Thanks, pal.

369
00:29:44,741 --> 00:29:45,492
Damn.

370
00:29:57,921 --> 00:29:58,672
Damn.

371
00:30:10,809 --> 00:30:12,311
- Come on, man.

372
00:30:12,644 --> 00:30:15,522
If this guy hasn't shown up by
now, he probably never will.

373
00:30:15,856 --> 00:30:16,773
- Maybe you're right.

374
00:30:17,107 --> 00:30:18,567
We'll give him five more minutes.

375
00:30:18,900 --> 00:30:19,776
- Five more minutes?

376
00:30:20,110 --> 00:30:22,487
Come on, man, my little
girlies are freezing up there.

377
00:30:22,821 --> 00:30:23,697
- Okay, okay, you win.

378
00:30:24,031 --> 00:30:25,824
Look, grab the sign and
throw it in the back.

379
00:30:26,158 --> 00:30:27,409
And we'll -- wait a minute.

380
00:30:31,163 --> 00:30:32,831
- I don't think that's him, man.

381
00:30:33,165 --> 00:30:34,958
- This time at night, who's it gonna be?

382
00:30:36,209 --> 00:30:37,919
- Hey, man, get out of the road.

383
00:30:38,253 --> 00:30:38,920
He's not gonna stop.

384
00:30:44,009 --> 00:30:44,760
- PJ?

385
00:30:49,139 --> 00:30:51,141
Are you looking for the
wilderness counselor's camp?

386
00:30:52,392 --> 00:30:53,018
All right, listen,

387
00:30:53,352 --> 00:30:54,936
go another mile to the
dirt road on the left.

388
00:30:55,270 --> 00:30:56,605
It's about four miles from --

389
00:30:59,941 --> 00:31:00,442
Slow down!

390
00:31:00,776 --> 00:31:02,486
That road is dangerous!

391
00:31:07,657 --> 00:31:08,742
- PJ, I presume.

392
00:31:09,076 --> 00:31:11,078
- That guy has got a
serious attitude problem.

393
00:31:11,411 --> 00:31:14,081
- Uh-huh, but he looks
way cool in that hat.

394
00:31:15,248 --> 00:31:15,749
- Let's just get the hell out of here.

395
00:31:16,083 --> 00:31:17,000
- All right.

396
00:31:17,334 --> 00:31:19,836
Slip your little panties off, babies.

397
00:31:20,170 --> 00:31:21,254
Bobby's on his way.

398
00:31:22,672 --> 00:31:23,548
- You're sick, you know that?

399
00:31:25,759 --> 00:31:26,510
- Yeah.

400
00:31:35,936 --> 00:31:36,478
- Hey!

401
00:31:36,812 --> 00:31:38,146
Can you give me a ride up to the camp?

402
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:40,690
My car broke down back there.

403
00:31:44,945 --> 00:31:45,904
- I know, we saw it.

404
00:31:48,365 --> 00:31:49,032
Climb in.

405
00:31:49,366 --> 00:31:50,867
I'll throw this in the back.

406
00:31:51,201 --> 00:31:51,827
- Thanks.

407
00:32:01,795 --> 00:32:03,004
- What happened?

408
00:32:03,338 --> 00:32:04,423
- I don't know, it just quit.

409
00:32:04,756 --> 00:32:06,133
- We just sent a guy up
here a few minutes ago.

410
00:32:06,466 --> 00:32:06,967
Why didn't you flag him down?

411
00:32:07,300 --> 00:32:07,801
- Oh, I flagged him down.

412
00:32:08,135 --> 00:32:10,387
The son of a bitch nearly ran over me.

413
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:12,848
- You and me are definitely
gonna have to talk to that guy.

414
00:32:13,181 --> 00:32:14,391
- As soon as we get there, Bobby.

415
00:32:14,724 --> 00:32:15,767
As soon as we get there.

416
00:34:46,042 --> 00:34:46,793
- Thanks.

417
00:34:48,503 --> 00:34:49,921
What are you doing in here?

418
00:34:50,255 --> 00:34:52,382
- I thought you might
need somebody to help

419
00:34:52,716 --> 00:34:54,551
dry the places you couldn't reach.

420
00:34:54,884 --> 00:34:56,303
- You did, did you?

421
00:34:56,636 --> 00:34:58,722
- Of course, I could've been mistaken.

422
00:34:59,055 --> 00:35:00,140
- No, I don't think so.

423
00:35:31,755 --> 00:35:34,049
- See, I told you nobody was watching us.

424
00:35:35,008 --> 00:35:36,301
- Well, we can't stay here.

425
00:35:36,635 --> 00:35:37,469
- Why not?

426
00:35:37,802 --> 00:35:40,138
- Well, somebody might
wanna take a shower.

427
00:35:40,472 --> 00:35:42,140
Besides, it's all wet.

428
00:35:42,474 --> 00:35:44,476
- There's nobody in the supply tent.

429
00:35:44,809 --> 00:35:48,396
And that's all filled with
nice, cozy sleeping bags.

430
00:35:48,730 --> 00:35:51,399
- Well, we have to be back at
the campfire in half an hour.

431
00:35:51,733 --> 00:35:53,777
- That's twice as long as we need.

432
00:35:57,197 --> 00:35:57,822
Come on.

433
00:36:02,202 --> 00:36:05,705
- Well, it looks like that son
of a bitch finally got here.

434
00:36:06,039 --> 00:36:07,290
I wonder where he is.

435
00:36:07,624 --> 00:36:09,668
- I don't know, but we're gonna find out.

436
00:36:43,702 --> 00:36:44,536
- Oh, soft.

437
00:38:22,926 --> 00:38:24,260
- Mama just wants you

438
00:38:24,594 --> 00:38:27,472
to always remember one thing, Bernie.

439
00:38:29,557 --> 00:38:31,267
This is our home.

440
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:36,272
Can't nobody never take that away from us.

441
00:40:28,509 --> 00:40:31,012
- What do you mean you haven't --

442
00:40:33,097 --> 00:40:35,099
What do you mean you haven't seen him?

443
00:40:35,433 --> 00:40:37,185
- I mean I haven't seen him.

444
00:40:37,518 --> 00:40:39,646
Nobody's checked in here
for a couple of hours.

445
00:40:41,356 --> 00:40:42,982
I've scheduled a meeting in 15 minutes.

446
00:40:43,316 --> 00:40:44,442
He'll probably turn up there.

447
00:40:44,776 --> 00:40:46,444
- Look, damn it, I wanna see this guy now.

448
00:40:46,778 --> 00:40:49,030
He's a nut case and I
want him out of here.

449
00:40:49,364 --> 00:40:51,199
- Take it easy, Ron.

450
00:40:51,532 --> 00:40:53,284
He's prepaid for the entire course.

451
00:40:53,618 --> 00:40:54,369
- Are you out of your mind?

452
00:40:54,702 --> 00:40:56,204
I come here to tell
you this guy's a maniac

453
00:40:56,537 --> 00:40:57,872
and you tell me he's prepaid.

454
00:40:59,958 --> 00:41:01,668
- Ron, you know the situation.

455
00:41:02,001 --> 00:41:04,003
We had 12 kids registered for this course.

456
00:41:04,337 --> 00:41:06,339
Seven of them showed up,
including PJ Richards,

457
00:41:06,673 --> 00:41:07,507
wherever he is.

458
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:09,092
Seven is our break-even number.

459
00:41:09,425 --> 00:41:11,678
If we don't have at least that
many, we're all out of a job

460
00:41:12,011 --> 00:41:14,013
until the regular season
begins next summer.

461
00:41:16,933 --> 00:41:19,435
Try to lighten up a little bit.

462
00:41:22,981 --> 00:41:25,149
So the guy doesn't stop for hitchhikers.

463
00:41:25,483 --> 00:41:27,819
It doesn't exactly make him
Jack the Ripper, does it?

464
00:41:30,571 --> 00:41:31,197
- Right.

465
00:42:12,697 --> 00:42:14,657
- Oh, God damn you, Bobby.

466
00:42:14,991 --> 00:42:16,159
I told you to get everybody

467
00:42:16,492 --> 00:42:18,619
their camping gear this afternoon.

468
00:42:18,953 --> 00:42:20,788
- I just got here, Mr. Buchan.

469
00:42:21,122 --> 00:42:22,832
Besides, they weren't all
here this afternoon to give.

470
00:42:23,166 --> 00:42:25,168
- I don't wanna hear
any of your bullshit excuses.

471
00:42:25,501 --> 00:42:26,502
I want it done tonight.

472
00:42:26,836 --> 00:42:27,336
- Tonight?

473
00:42:27,670 --> 00:42:28,296
It's freezing.

474
00:42:28,629 --> 00:42:30,214
- Tonight, God damn you, Bobby!

475
00:42:30,548 --> 00:42:32,717
I want it done tonight,
right after the meeting.

476
00:42:35,762 --> 00:42:36,512
- Asshole.

477
00:42:38,681 --> 00:42:41,100
- Is everybody always
this friendly around here?

478
00:42:41,434 --> 00:42:42,852
Or did I just come at a bad time?

479
00:42:43,811 --> 00:42:44,979
- I'm sorry.

480
00:42:45,313 --> 00:42:46,064
They're just a little uptight

481
00:42:46,397 --> 00:42:48,066
over last-minute cancellations.

482
00:42:48,399 --> 00:42:49,817
Bobby and Regis are usually --

483
00:42:50,735 --> 00:42:51,944
they're usually pretty good guys.

484
00:42:52,278 --> 00:42:53,237
You'll see at the meeting.

485
00:42:53,571 --> 00:42:54,614
- I hope so.

486
00:42:54,947 --> 00:42:58,034
I was beginning to wonder
what I'd gotten myself into.

487
00:42:58,367 --> 00:42:59,619
What's this meeting, anyway?

488
00:42:59,952 --> 00:43:01,496
- It's just a little
informal get-together.

489
00:43:01,829 --> 00:43:04,332
We introduce everyone, drink a little beer

490
00:43:04,665 --> 00:43:08,002
and decide who we can con
into chopping the firewood.

491
00:43:08,336 --> 00:43:09,754
Look, we still have a few minutes.

492
00:43:10,088 --> 00:43:11,547
Come on, I'll show you
where you're staying.

493
00:43:11,881 --> 00:43:12,507
Come on.

494
00:43:22,850 --> 00:43:24,227
Hello?

495
00:43:24,560 --> 00:43:25,394
Anybody home?

496
00:43:25,728 --> 00:43:27,647
- Yeah, come on in if you stand it.

497
00:43:29,065 --> 00:43:29,774
- Well, this is it.

498
00:43:30,108 --> 00:43:31,484
- Ah-ha, another victim.

499
00:43:31,818 --> 00:43:33,194
- Welcome to the Beverly Hilton.

500
00:43:33,528 --> 00:43:35,530
- Sophie, Vicky, meet Debbie.

501
00:43:35,863 --> 00:43:36,364
- Hi.
- Hi.

502
00:43:36,697 --> 00:43:37,448
- Hiya.

503
00:43:37,782 --> 00:43:39,492
- The four of you have this
whole place to yourself.

504
00:43:39,826 --> 00:43:42,286
Oh, put your bag anywhere you like.

505
00:43:42,620 --> 00:43:43,955
Where's Jane?

506
00:43:44,288 --> 00:43:45,498
- She went to take a shower.

507
00:43:45,832 --> 00:43:46,624
Wait until you see the shower.

508
00:43:46,958 --> 00:43:48,960
It's straight out of The Flintstones.

509
00:43:49,293 --> 00:43:50,044
- Oh, I can hardly wait.

510
00:43:50,378 --> 00:43:51,254
- Look, I gotta get ready for the meeting.

511
00:43:51,587 --> 00:43:52,380
So if you guys can find Jane...

512
00:43:52,713 --> 00:43:53,631
- Sure.
- And I'll see you

513
00:43:53,965 --> 00:43:54,799
in a little while.

514
00:43:57,260 --> 00:43:59,512
- God, isn't he beautiful?

515
00:44:00,471 --> 00:44:02,140
- Forget it, sweetie,
you haven't got a chance.

516
00:44:02,473 --> 00:44:03,057
- What do you mean?

517
00:44:03,391 --> 00:44:06,894
- I mean, he's obviously got
the hots for Debbie here.

518
00:44:07,228 --> 00:44:07,937
- What are you talking about?

519
00:44:08,271 --> 00:44:09,814
I just met the guy.

520
00:44:10,148 --> 00:44:11,065
- It's in the eyes.

521
00:44:11,399 --> 00:44:12,483
You can see it.

522
00:44:12,817 --> 00:44:13,317
- She's right.

523
00:44:13,651 --> 00:44:16,654
He looks at you the same way
that dork Bobby looks at me.

524
00:44:16,988 --> 00:44:18,114
- I met Bobby.

525
00:44:18,447 --> 00:44:20,616
He's a little bit nutty,
but he seems nice enough.

526
00:44:20,950 --> 00:44:21,450
- Oh, he's nice.

527
00:44:21,784 --> 00:44:22,660
He's just a dork.

528
00:44:24,579 --> 00:44:26,080
- I'm gonna go find Jane.

529
00:44:26,414 --> 00:44:27,039
I'll see you at the meeting.

530
00:44:27,373 --> 00:44:28,749
- Good-bye.

531
00:44:31,586 --> 00:44:33,212
- Oh, God, what a day.

532
00:44:34,881 --> 00:44:35,631
- Janel!

533
00:44:36,549 --> 00:44:38,426
Jane, are you up there?

534
00:44:57,987 --> 00:45:01,282
Come on, Jane, we've got a meeting.

535
00:45:01,616 --> 00:45:02,241
Jane?

536
00:45:04,702 --> 00:45:05,453
Janey?

537
00:45:19,300 --> 00:45:21,510
- Okay, everybody, let's gather around.

538
00:45:23,054 --> 00:45:23,804
Now!

539
00:45:38,903 --> 00:45:41,280
Ron, can I have a word with you?

540
00:45:46,369 --> 00:45:48,287
There are four people missing.

541
00:45:48,621 --> 00:45:49,247
Where are they?

542
00:45:51,666 --> 00:45:52,833
- I don't know.

543
00:45:53,167 --> 00:45:54,877
They were all told to be here.

544
00:45:55,211 --> 00:45:56,003
- God damn it, Ron,

545
00:45:56,337 --> 00:45:58,047
we've got to have some
discipline around here.

546
00:45:58,381 --> 00:46:00,549
People can't show up
whenever they feel like it.

547
00:46:01,842 --> 00:46:02,551
- Hi, everybody!

548
00:46:04,178 --> 00:46:04,804
Sorry.

549
00:46:06,180 --> 00:46:07,890
- Do you want me to go find the others?

550
00:46:08,224 --> 00:46:08,849
- Yes.

551
00:46:10,685 --> 00:46:11,978
No.

552
00:46:12,311 --> 00:46:14,730
On second thought, let
'em miss the meeting.

553
00:46:15,064 --> 00:46:17,024
I'm gonna be handing out shift
details in a few minutes.

554
00:46:17,358 --> 00:46:19,944
And let's see how they feel
about a little latrine duty.

555
00:46:23,864 --> 00:46:24,573
- Where's Jane?

556
00:46:24,907 --> 00:46:26,742
- I went down to the showers
to see if I could find her

557
00:46:27,076 --> 00:46:28,327
and this is all I could find.

558
00:46:29,954 --> 00:46:32,373
- Oh, man.

559
00:46:32,707 --> 00:46:33,666
- That cute guy from Seattle.
- Uh-huh.

560
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:35,543
- He isn't here, either.

561
00:46:35,876 --> 00:46:37,295
They didn't waste any time.

562
00:46:37,628 --> 00:46:39,630
- Oh my God, they couldn't even
stop to turn off the water.

563
00:46:43,175 --> 00:46:45,678
- Who-ho-ho-ho.

564
00:46:49,140 --> 00:46:50,766
- You've all got a lot of work to do

565
00:46:51,100 --> 00:46:52,685
if you're gonna get one of these.

566
00:46:57,106 --> 00:46:59,525
This is the wilderness
counselor's certificate.

567
00:47:01,152 --> 00:47:02,653
The reason you're all here.

568
00:47:05,531 --> 00:47:06,449
With one of these,

569
00:47:08,075 --> 00:47:12,621
you'll qualify for the best
jobs in the best camps.

570
00:47:14,165 --> 00:47:15,583
You won't wait tables.

571
00:47:17,043 --> 00:47:19,253
And you won't tell bedtime stories.

572
00:47:24,342 --> 00:47:25,509
But don't go and get the idea

573
00:47:25,843 --> 00:47:28,095
that we are just gonna hand
you this piece of paper

574
00:47:28,429 --> 00:47:31,098
just because you paid your fee.

575
00:47:32,725 --> 00:47:35,519
Ah, no. You are gonna --

576
00:47:35,853 --> 00:47:38,314
- ""Idea that we're gonna
give you this piece of paper

577
00:47:38,647 --> 00:47:41,233
just because you paid your fee.""

578
00:47:43,194 --> 00:47:45,738
""No, you're gonna have to earn this.""

579
00:47:48,908 --> 00:47:50,242
- You got a problem, Bobby?

580
00:47:52,661 --> 00:47:53,662
- No, Regis.

581
00:47:54,997 --> 00:47:56,832
- Look, somebody's coming.

582
00:47:59,168 --> 00:48:01,420
- Ron, go see who it is.

583
00:48:07,218 --> 00:48:08,219
As I was saying,

584
00:48:10,513 --> 00:48:13,265
you're gonna have to
earn this piece of paper,

585
00:48:13,599 --> 00:48:14,642
God damn children.

586
00:48:16,477 --> 00:48:17,228
Shut up!

587
00:48:18,312 --> 00:48:20,648
- Is it Regis or it is Memorex?

588
00:48:25,903 --> 00:48:27,363
- Okay, I'm coming.

589
00:48:27,696 --> 00:48:28,322
Coming.

590
00:48:29,698 --> 00:48:31,867
- God damn it, get that
light out of my eyes.

591
00:48:33,411 --> 00:48:34,829
- Ah, sorry about that.

592
00:48:35,162 --> 00:48:35,663
Hey, where's Deputy Taylor?

593
00:48:35,996 --> 00:48:36,789
I thought he was the only one working

594
00:48:37,123 --> 00:48:37,665
in the county at night.

595
00:48:37,998 --> 00:48:39,041
- Taylor's out sick.

596
00:48:39,375 --> 00:48:41,168
How many you got up there?

597
00:48:41,502 --> 00:48:44,422
- There's 11 of us, including the staff.

598
00:48:44,755 --> 00:48:46,507
- You got some young girls up there?

599
00:48:46,841 --> 00:48:47,341
- Yeah, we do.

600
00:48:47,675 --> 00:48:48,509
Look, what's this all about?

601
00:48:50,469 --> 00:48:51,220
- Look at them.

602
00:48:52,179 --> 00:48:53,764
They didn't hear one word I said.

603
00:48:56,142 --> 00:48:58,477
There's not an ounce of
discipline in the whole bunch.

604
00:48:59,562 --> 00:49:01,147
- Oh, now, they're just kids, hon.

605
00:49:03,816 --> 00:49:07,403
They don't understand
discipline the way we do.

606
00:49:11,824 --> 00:49:14,118
- Not too many people
do understand, Marcie.

607
00:49:17,663 --> 00:49:19,665
- Let's go into the tent.

608
00:49:19,999 --> 00:49:21,792
Let the kids entertain themselves, yeah.

609
00:49:23,836 --> 00:49:25,087
- No.

610
00:49:25,421 --> 00:49:26,046
You go ahead.

611
00:49:27,006 --> 00:49:28,382
I gotta run a security check.

612
00:49:32,136 --> 00:49:33,471
- Don't you be too long now.

613
00:49:34,722 --> 00:49:37,725
Or Marcie will have to discipline you.

614
00:49:53,824 --> 00:49:55,242
- Anyway, we wanted to check on your kids

615
00:49:55,576 --> 00:49:56,785
just to be on the safe side.

616
00:49:57,995 --> 00:49:59,497
- Well, thanks for coming up.

617
00:50:00,414 --> 00:50:02,166
- Keep your eyes open, just in case.

618
00:50:02,500 --> 00:50:03,334
- Okay.

619
00:50:03,667 --> 00:50:04,627
All right, thanks.

620
00:50:04,960 --> 00:50:06,212
Thanks again.

621
00:50:36,325 --> 00:50:41,247
- Even a maniac won't tangle
with this, unless he's crazy.

622
00:50:43,123 --> 00:50:45,125
- Well, you don't think
he's still around, do you?

623
00:50:45,459 --> 00:50:47,628
- Well, it's hard to tell with these guys.

624
00:50:47,962 --> 00:50:49,630
That's what makes them so dangerous.

625
00:50:50,673 --> 00:50:52,841
- What the hell are you
talking about, Bobby?

626
00:50:54,426 --> 00:50:55,928
- The maniac, Regis.

627
00:50:56,262 --> 00:50:57,638
He just killed a bunch of people

628
00:50:57,972 --> 00:50:59,139
on the campground by the highway.

629
00:50:59,473 --> 00:51:02,268
And he's out looking for more victims.

630
00:51:03,227 --> 00:51:04,436
- Where did you hear that?

631
00:51:05,980 --> 00:51:07,064
- Cop told Ron.

632
00:51:08,607 --> 00:51:11,902
- Hey, Ron, what's all
this crap about a maniac?

633
00:51:20,035 --> 00:51:21,453
- Security check, huh?

634
00:51:40,097 --> 00:51:42,016
You've been a bad boy, Regis.

635
00:51:54,111 --> 00:51:57,072
I'm gonna have to whip you into shape.

636
00:52:05,998 --> 00:52:09,501
First, we'll start out
with a little ambush.

637
00:52:29,271 --> 00:52:30,981
- They're playing your song, Regis.

638
00:52:33,567 --> 00:52:34,985
- Yeah, well, I'm gonna check the grounds.

639
00:52:35,319 --> 00:52:36,654
And then I'm gonna turn in.

640
00:52:36,987 --> 00:52:39,823
And I'm holding you
personally responsible, Bobby,

641
00:52:40,157 --> 00:52:42,284
for any litter in this
campsite in the morning.

642
00:52:42,618 --> 00:52:44,995
So I suggest you stop
telling your little bullshit

643
00:52:45,329 --> 00:52:47,039
maniac stories and get to work.

644
00:52:52,503 --> 00:52:54,213
- He's a major putz.

645
00:52:54,546 --> 00:52:56,465
- Why is he so freaked
out over your story?

646
00:52:57,966 --> 00:52:59,635
- The people who own this
camp are a little sensitive

647
00:52:59,968 --> 00:53:01,303
about maniac stories.

648
00:53:01,637 --> 00:53:06,183
Especially after what
happened here back in '75.

649
00:53:06,517 --> 00:53:08,018
- Come on, what is it?

650
00:53:08,352 --> 00:53:10,020
- There was this guy named Bernie.

651
00:53:11,146 --> 00:53:13,941
And he used to live up here
in a cabin with his folks.

652
00:53:15,192 --> 00:53:19,446
And Bernie was this dumb, gentle guy.

653
00:53:20,948 --> 00:53:24,493
He used to walk through
the woods feeding the deer

654
00:53:24,827 --> 00:53:26,120
and like that.

655
00:53:26,453 --> 00:53:29,081
And the rest of the time
he spent chopping wood.

656
00:53:29,415 --> 00:53:32,000
And every couple of weeks or so,

657
00:53:32,334 --> 00:53:33,085
his pop would take the wood

658
00:53:33,419 --> 00:53:36,422
that he chopped down into
the valley and sell it.

659
00:53:36,755 --> 00:53:38,173
And that's how they survived.

660
00:53:38,507 --> 00:53:40,592
Anyway, one day,

661
00:53:41,593 --> 00:53:44,388
they get a letter telling
them the county is gonna build

662
00:53:44,722 --> 00:53:47,224
a road up the mountain
to turn the mountain

663
00:53:47,558 --> 00:53:51,437
Into a recreation area, with
campsites and like that,

664
00:53:51,770 --> 00:53:53,230
to draw the tourists.

665
00:53:53,564 --> 00:53:54,773
- How rotten.

666
00:53:55,107 --> 00:53:56,024
- What a rip.

667
00:53:56,358 --> 00:53:57,192
- Yeah.

668
00:53:57,526 --> 00:54:01,572
Well, Bernie's pop says

669
00:54:02,698 --> 00:54:06,493
if the county wants his family out,

670
00:54:06,827 --> 00:54:08,620
they're gonna have to throw them out.

671
00:54:08,954 --> 00:54:10,122
He's not moving.

672
00:54:14,668 --> 00:54:16,044
- So what happened?

673
00:54:16,378 --> 00:54:19,298
- So they send a bunch
of deputies up there

674
00:54:19,631 --> 00:54:20,883
to throw them out.

675
00:54:22,301 --> 00:54:23,510
Only, something went wrong.

676
00:54:24,553 --> 00:54:25,304
- What?

677
00:54:28,223 --> 00:54:32,144
- Well, no one knows
exactly what happened.

678
00:54:33,103 --> 00:54:34,897
But according to the official report,

679
00:54:35,856 --> 00:54:39,902
Bernie's pop pulled the gun
and the deputies opened fire.

680
00:54:40,235 --> 00:54:42,863
And when it was over,
Bernie's mom was dead.

681
00:54:44,198 --> 00:54:45,741
And the old man was wounded.

682
00:54:46,074 --> 00:54:47,534
And they took him into jail.

683
00:54:47,868 --> 00:54:49,870
And they kept him there
for a couple of years.

684
00:54:51,163 --> 00:54:52,164
- What about Bernie?

685
00:54:53,707 --> 00:54:58,629
- Bernie took off by himself
into the woods that night.

686
00:55:01,632 --> 00:55:04,843
They say he stayed out there chopping wood

687
00:55:06,011 --> 00:55:07,304
and going crazy.

688
00:55:09,264 --> 00:55:13,894
After that, everybody kind
of forgot him for a while.

689
00:55:14,228 --> 00:55:18,649
But then, then they opened the road.

690
00:55:18,982 --> 00:55:21,026
And the tourists started coming in.

691
00:55:23,987 --> 00:55:24,905
- And?

692
00:55:25,239 --> 00:55:29,535
- And Bernie goes totally berserk.

693
00:55:29,868 --> 00:55:33,622
He comes down here with
that ax of his in his hand

694
00:55:33,956 --> 00:55:35,749
and he starts a swingin'.

695
00:55:36,083 --> 00:55:40,295
And he starts chopping up
these campers left and right.

696
00:55:40,629 --> 00:55:44,174
You see, in his mind, they
were all to blame, right?

697
00:55:44,508 --> 00:55:49,304
Well, the next day, a
young deputy finds him

698
00:55:49,638 --> 00:55:53,684
by the river next to a
pile of arms and legs,

699
00:55:56,019 --> 00:55:58,063
stacked up like firewood.

700
00:56:01,066 --> 00:56:02,860
When they tried to take him away,

701
00:56:03,193 --> 00:56:05,362
he bit the deputy's finger off.

702
00:56:05,696 --> 00:56:07,865
They had to put him in a straightjacket

703
00:56:08,198 --> 00:56:09,283
with a special hood.

704
00:56:11,034 --> 00:56:13,161
- God, now I wish you
wouldn't have told us.

705
00:56:13,495 --> 00:56:14,746
- Yeah, well, I don't
think we have to worry

706
00:56:15,080 --> 00:56:16,748
about poor, old Bernie anymore.

707
00:56:17,082 --> 00:56:19,751
He's been locked up down at
that state hospital for years.

708
00:56:20,919 --> 00:56:22,629
Probably still got him in that hood.

709
00:56:33,307 --> 00:56:33,932
Boyee.

710
00:56:38,103 --> 00:56:39,313
- Hold it right there.

711
00:56:42,608 --> 00:56:44,943
Mm, Regis, Regis.

712
00:56:45,277 --> 00:56:49,114
I'm just gonna love making
you say, ""Mercy, Marcie.""

713
00:56:52,117 --> 00:56:53,076
Regis?

714
00:56:56,872 --> 00:56:58,957
Stay back or I'll cut
you off at the knees.

715
00:57:14,556 --> 00:57:19,061
- Looks like old Regis
finally shot his wad.

716
00:57:22,564 --> 00:57:23,857
- You really hate him, don't you?

717
00:57:24,191 --> 00:57:24,816
- No.

718
00:57:25,859 --> 00:57:27,319
No, not really.

719
00:57:30,280 --> 00:57:31,573
It's just that he's...

720
00:57:31,907 --> 00:57:33,867
he's so full of shit, you know?

721
00:57:36,912 --> 00:57:39,164
- Well, hate to be the
one to break up the party,

722
00:57:39,498 --> 00:57:41,875
but I think we all should get some sleep.

723
00:57:42,209 --> 00:57:42,709
- I don't know about you,

724
00:57:43,043 --> 00:57:45,087
but I don't think I'm gonna
get much sleep knowing

725
00:57:45,420 --> 00:57:46,672
there's a maniac lose.

726
00:57:47,005 --> 00:57:50,592
- Hey, well, you can
always come to my tent.

727
00:57:50,926 --> 00:57:54,012
- Thanks anyway, Bobby, but
you know, I don't think so.

728
00:57:56,682 --> 00:57:59,267
- Yeah, well, I was just kidding, anyway.

729
00:58:00,936 --> 00:58:05,065
I gotta get those bedrolls.

730
00:58:05,399 --> 00:58:06,525
I'll be in the supply tent.

731
00:58:09,277 --> 00:58:09,945
- Wait a minute, Bobby.

732
00:58:10,237 --> 00:58:10,988
I'll give you a hand with 'em.

733
00:58:11,321 --> 00:58:12,864
- No, I don't need your help.

734
00:58:17,494 --> 00:58:18,662
- Oh, shit.

735
00:58:18,996 --> 00:58:20,330
I think I've hurt his feelings.

736
00:58:26,003 --> 00:58:27,546
- Well, I'm gonna take a shower

737
00:58:27,879 --> 00:58:29,965
while there's lots of hot water.

738
00:58:34,302 --> 00:58:35,637
Wanna walk me to my tent

739
00:58:35,971 --> 00:58:38,473
and protect me from all the maniacs?

740
00:58:39,516 --> 00:58:40,267
- Yeah, sure.

741
00:58:41,893 --> 00:58:43,145
- Nighty night, kids.

742
00:58:43,478 --> 00:58:45,188
Oh, I usually get up around noon.

743
00:58:45,522 --> 00:58:47,149
So try to be quiet in the morning.

744
00:58:57,284 --> 00:58:59,077
- I guess you must be tired.

745
00:58:59,411 --> 00:59:00,203
- Yeah, I really am.

746
00:59:01,830 --> 00:59:04,166
- Would you like me to
walk you to your tent?

747
00:59:04,499 --> 00:59:06,752
- Do you mind if we talk for
just a few minutes first?

748
00:59:07,085 --> 00:59:07,836
- No, of course not.

749
00:59:08,170 --> 00:59:09,421
What do you wanna talk about?

750
00:59:10,464 --> 00:59:13,925
- That story that Bobby
was telling about Bernie.

751
00:59:14,259 --> 00:59:15,635
Did that really happen?

752
00:59:15,969 --> 00:59:17,054
- Yeah.

753
00:59:17,387 --> 00:59:17,971
Well, at least everyone around here

754
00:59:18,305 --> 00:59:20,724
seems to tell it pretty much the same way.

755
00:59:21,058 --> 00:59:23,226
And there is an old cabin
up there in the woods.

756
00:59:24,311 --> 00:59:26,354
- It's such a sad story.

757
00:59:29,900 --> 00:59:31,359
Could we go see the cabin?

758
00:59:31,693 --> 00:59:32,319
- What, now?

759
00:59:32,652 --> 00:59:33,612
- Yeah, would you mind?

760
00:59:36,823 --> 00:59:37,908
- Well, no.

761
00:59:38,241 --> 00:59:39,534
No.

762
00:59:39,868 --> 00:59:41,912
But I mean, I thought you were worn out.

763
00:59:42,245 --> 00:59:43,872
- I am, but I'm wired, too.

764
00:59:44,206 --> 00:59:46,041
I think maybe the walk will calm me down.

765
00:59:47,751 --> 00:59:48,376
- All right.

766
00:59:48,710 --> 00:59:49,795
Well, just stay close to me.

767
00:59:50,128 --> 00:59:52,464
That trail is pretty,
pretty tough right now.

768
01:00:09,606 --> 01:00:10,357
- Bobby?

769
01:00:16,321 --> 01:00:17,823
- I'll get you your bedroll.

770
01:00:18,156 --> 01:00:19,324
- Bobby?

771
01:00:19,658 --> 01:00:21,201
Hey, I'm sorry about before.

772
01:00:21,535 --> 01:00:23,245
It's not that I didn't wanna be with you.

773
01:00:23,578 --> 01:00:24,955
It's, well...it's just you.

774
01:00:25,288 --> 01:00:26,748
- Yeah, yeah, I know.

775
01:00:27,666 --> 01:00:30,127
I come on a little too strong.

776
01:00:30,460 --> 01:00:31,169
- You really do.

777
01:00:36,633 --> 01:00:38,510
- I'm such a jerk.

778
01:00:38,844 --> 01:00:41,012
I mean, I talk about Regis,

779
01:00:41,346 --> 01:00:45,100
and I end up coming off twice
as obnoxious as he does.

780
01:00:45,433 --> 01:00:46,268
- Shh.

781
01:00:46,601 --> 01:00:48,103
And you talk too much, you know?

782
01:00:55,861 --> 01:00:57,696
I need my bedroll.

783
01:00:58,029 --> 01:00:59,239
- Okay, great.

784
01:01:03,410 --> 01:01:04,327
- How'd that happen?

785
01:01:06,079 --> 01:01:06,830
- I don't know.

786
01:01:07,873 --> 01:01:09,583
But Regis isn't gonna like it.

787
01:01:09,916 --> 01:01:11,960
- Well, let's not talk
about Regis anymore.

788
01:01:14,129 --> 01:01:15,463
- Yeah.

789
01:01:15,797 --> 01:01:16,423
Fuck 'im.

790
01:01:18,091 --> 01:01:18,842
- Come on.

791
01:01:19,843 --> 01:01:20,802
- Whoa.
- Oops.

792
01:01:23,263 --> 01:01:24,222
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, I'm good.

793
01:01:24,556 --> 01:01:26,183
Let's get out of here.

794
01:01:37,068 --> 01:01:37,944
- Oh, Marcie.

795
01:01:38,987 --> 01:01:39,738
Oh, baby.

796
01:01:41,489 --> 01:01:42,824
You little devil.

797
01:01:47,829 --> 01:01:49,331
You wouldn't be planning
a little ambush now,

798
01:01:49,664 --> 01:01:50,290
would we, Marcie?

799
01:01:53,793 --> 01:01:54,794
Oh.

800
01:01:55,128 --> 01:01:58,298
Decided to skip the ambush
and go right for the Kill.

801
01:01:58,632 --> 01:01:59,925
Well, that's okay with me.

802
01:02:03,803 --> 01:02:04,429
Marcie?

803
01:02:05,597 --> 01:02:06,348
Marcie!

804
01:02:09,392 --> 01:02:11,311
You son of a bitch!

805
01:02:11,645 --> 01:02:12,812
You fucker!

806
01:02:17,359 --> 01:02:18,401
Jesus!

807
01:02:36,628 --> 01:02:37,128
- Are you okay?

808
01:02:37,462 --> 01:02:38,672
- Yeah, I'm fine.

809
01:02:39,005 --> 01:02:39,923
How much further is it?

810
01:02:40,257 --> 01:02:40,757
- The river's just up ahead

811
01:02:41,091 --> 01:02:42,509
and the cabin's on the other side.

812
01:02:42,842 --> 01:02:43,426
Just watch your step down here.

813
01:02:43,760 --> 01:02:45,428
It gets pretty rough walking.

814
01:02:45,762 --> 01:02:46,972
- It's beautiful.

815
01:02:47,305 --> 01:02:48,098
- Yeah.

816
01:02:48,431 --> 01:02:49,391
Hey, you wanna rest a minute?

817
01:02:49,724 --> 01:02:50,350
- Yeah.

818
01:02:54,729 --> 01:02:56,106
- So you really like it, huh?

819
01:02:56,439 --> 01:02:57,065
- Yeah.

820
01:02:58,066 --> 01:02:59,025
It's so primitive.

821
01:03:00,694 --> 01:03:01,778
- You can walk hundreds of
miles into these mountains

822
01:03:02,112 --> 01:03:04,948
and not see a road, a
house, another human being.

823
01:03:07,033 --> 01:03:09,452
There's still lions and
grizzlies up there, you know?

824
01:03:09,786 --> 01:03:10,954
- Are you trying to scare me?

825
01:03:11,288 --> 01:03:11,871
- Well, if I was trying to do that,

826
01:03:12,205 --> 01:03:13,123
I'd tell you about bigfoot.

827
01:03:13,456 --> 01:03:14,332
I mean, most of the recent sightings

828
01:03:14,666 --> 01:03:16,334
have been around in this area.

829
01:03:16,668 --> 01:03:18,753
I mean, two years ago,
bigfoot ate a pup tent

830
01:03:19,087 --> 01:03:21,339
and turned over a jeep
only two miles downstream.

831
01:03:22,674 --> 01:03:23,425
- Great.

832
01:03:23,758 --> 01:03:25,385
Can we go see the cabin now?

833
01:03:25,719 --> 01:03:26,344
- Sure.

834
01:03:27,304 --> 01:03:27,929
Just watch your step.

835
01:03:28,263 --> 01:03:29,347
It's pretty rough down here.

836
01:03:45,905 --> 01:03:47,490
- Let's go inside where it's warm.

837
01:03:48,867 --> 01:03:50,285
- Can't we go someplace else?

838
01:03:50,618 --> 01:03:51,202
- No, silly.

839
01:03:51,536 --> 01:03:52,954
We're going to take a shower.

840
01:03:53,288 --> 01:03:55,206
A nice, hot, steamy shower.

841
01:03:55,540 --> 01:03:56,374
- But what if somebody comes in?

842
01:03:56,708 --> 01:03:58,335
You know, Regis or somebody?

843
01:03:58,668 --> 01:04:00,670
- Chet, Regis is asleep.

844
01:04:01,004 --> 01:04:02,464
Everybody's asleep.

845
01:04:02,797 --> 01:04:04,966
I thought you wanted to
take a shower with me.

846
01:04:06,051 --> 01:04:06,885
- Well, I do.

847
01:04:07,218 --> 01:04:08,219
- Well, come on then.

848
01:04:08,553 --> 01:04:10,180
No guts, no glory, Chet.

849
01:04:22,942 --> 01:04:24,778
Brr, it really is cold.

850
01:04:27,238 --> 01:04:29,657
Hey, why aren't you getting undressed?

851
01:04:29,991 --> 01:04:31,326
Are you shy?

852
01:04:38,375 --> 01:04:40,794
Mm, it's just right.

853
01:04:42,087 --> 01:04:44,672
Nothing turns me on like a nice shower.

854
01:04:45,006 --> 01:04:46,841
All steamy and soapy and hot.

855
01:05:19,290 --> 01:05:19,916
- Where are you going?

856
01:05:20,250 --> 01:05:21,793
- Down here, there's a bridge not too far.

857
01:05:22,127 --> 01:05:22,961
- Why don't we just cross here?

858
01:05:23,294 --> 01:05:24,462
- No, you don't wanna do that.

859
01:05:24,796 --> 01:05:25,964
- Oh, come on, it's as hard as a rock.

860
01:05:26,297 --> 01:05:26,798
- Look, if you're gonna do that,

861
01:05:27,132 --> 01:05:27,799
at least take some of your clothes off

862
01:05:28,133 --> 01:05:29,884
SO in case you get wet, you
have something warm to put on.

863
01:05:30,218 --> 01:05:30,969
- Oh, sure, you'd love
that, won't you, Ron?

864
01:05:31,302 --> 01:05:32,720
- Look it, just be careful.

865
01:05:33,054 --> 01:05:34,013
You don't wanna mess with that.

866
01:05:36,099 --> 01:05:36,683
- Be careful.

867
01:05:37,016 --> 01:05:37,892
Ah, damn it.

868
01:05:38,226 --> 01:05:39,477
- Oh, my God, it's so cold!

869
01:05:39,811 --> 01:05:41,271
- Come on, we
gotta get you warm quick.

870
01:05:41,604 --> 01:05:42,355
- Can't we go back to the camp?

871
01:05:42,689 --> 01:05:43,606
- The camp's almost a
mile on the other side.

872
01:05:43,940 --> 01:05:44,566
Look, Debbie.

873
01:05:58,955 --> 01:06:00,874
- Oh, God, Sophie, get up!

874
01:06:01,207 --> 01:06:01,833
Shit!

875
01:06:18,433 --> 01:06:19,267
- Well, there it is.

876
01:06:20,435 --> 01:06:20,935
- Can we get inside?

877
01:06:21,269 --> 01:06:22,562
- Yeah, yeah, come on.

878
01:06:22,896 --> 01:06:24,063
Sometimes, the kids from
the camp come in here.

879
01:06:24,397 --> 01:06:26,024
There's blankets and a fireplace.

880
01:06:26,357 --> 01:06:27,984
We gotta get you in
before you get pneumonia.

881
01:06:28,318 --> 01:06:29,110
- What's this?

882
01:06:29,444 --> 01:06:30,820
- It's all the wood that
Bernie chopped, I guess.

883
01:06:31,154 --> 01:06:32,655
Come on, we gotta get a fire going.

884
01:06:38,578 --> 01:06:39,496
- It's cold.

885
01:06:54,928 --> 01:06:56,679
- I'll get a fire going.

886
01:06:57,013 --> 01:06:58,431
You get those clothes off.

887
01:07:12,779 --> 01:07:14,531
Come on, do you want me
to take them off for ya?

888
01:07:30,171 --> 01:07:31,005
- That feels so good.

889
01:07:31,339 --> 01:07:32,465
- You can come closer if you want.

890
01:07:33,633 --> 01:07:38,304
Don't worry, I'm not gonna attack you.

891
01:07:38,638 --> 01:07:39,138
We'll get these clothes dry,

892
01:07:39,472 --> 01:07:40,723
and then I'll take you back to camp.

893
01:07:42,350 --> 01:07:44,018
- Ron, I'm sorry.

894
01:07:44,352 --> 01:07:45,603
- Look, there's a place upriver
where I can get you across

895
01:07:45,937 --> 01:07:47,438
without getting your feet wet.

896
01:07:47,772 --> 01:07:48,773
- I said I was sorry.

897
01:07:50,233 --> 01:07:51,234
- About what?

898
01:07:52,360 --> 01:07:54,862
- I didn't listen to you about the stream.

899
01:07:55,196 --> 01:07:56,114
I thought you were trying to trick me

900
01:07:56,447 --> 01:07:58,116
into taking my clothes off.

901
01:07:58,449 --> 01:07:59,534
- Well, it worked, didn't it?

902
01:08:02,745 --> 01:08:03,830
- Isn't there another blanket?

903
01:08:04,163 --> 01:08:05,248
- No, that's the only one.

904
01:08:06,583 --> 01:08:08,710
- Come on, there's room for two.

905
01:08:09,043 --> 01:08:09,544
- Are you sure?

906
01:08:09,877 --> 01:08:10,503
- Come on.

907
01:08:16,342 --> 01:08:17,093
- Thanks.

908
01:08:31,983 --> 01:08:34,360
- You ever see such a mess before?

909
01:08:34,694 --> 01:08:35,820
- This is my first murder.

910
01:08:36,863 --> 01:08:39,699
- Well, you ain't likely
to see many like this.

911
01:08:40,033 --> 01:08:41,200
- Who'd you reckon that is?

912
01:08:41,534 --> 01:08:42,619
I figured everybody in the county

913
01:08:42,952 --> 01:08:44,912
had already been out here tonight.

914
01:08:45,246 --> 01:08:46,122
- 3T50K?Y.

915
01:09:01,387 --> 01:09:04,724
- Taylor, thought you was
home in your deathbed.

916
01:09:05,058 --> 01:09:06,392
- Can we plow through all this?

917
01:09:07,935 --> 01:09:09,228
I heard about the murders
out here last night.

918
01:09:09,562 --> 01:09:11,981
I thought I'd better come
up and take a look at it.

919
01:09:12,315 --> 01:09:13,691
What happened?

920
01:09:14,025 --> 01:09:16,402
- Some junkie took an ax
to a bunch of tourists.

921
01:09:17,445 --> 01:09:19,364
Damnest thing I ever saw.

922
01:09:19,697 --> 01:09:20,823
Must have been on PCP.

923
01:09:21,157 --> 01:09:23,076
I mean, he tore the place apart.

924
01:09:24,243 --> 01:09:25,703
- Coroner been up in here yet?

925
01:09:26,037 --> 01:09:26,788
- Been and gone.

926
01:09:28,039 --> 01:09:31,084
Shit, never seen a coroner
lose his supper before.

927
01:09:31,417 --> 01:09:32,919
It's gonna take the boys
all night at the morgue

928
01:09:33,252 --> 01:09:34,212
to sort out the pieces.

929
01:09:36,089 --> 01:09:37,632
Taking the last one away now.

930
01:09:39,967 --> 01:09:41,803
Funny thing about that one.

931
01:09:42,136 --> 01:09:42,887
Not a mark on him.

932
01:09:44,055 --> 01:09:45,807
- Yeah, well, who is he?

933
01:09:46,140 --> 01:09:47,058
- Some old guy.

934
01:09:48,142 --> 01:09:49,811
Coroner says he had a heart attack.

935
01:09:50,144 --> 01:09:51,437
I think he died of fright.

936
01:09:52,563 --> 01:09:53,314
-Mind if I...7?

937
01:09:54,732 --> 01:09:55,900
- Be my guest.

938
01:09:56,234 --> 01:09:57,944
Hey, hold on a minute.

939
01:09:58,277 --> 01:09:58,778
- Come on, give us a break.

940
01:09:59,112 --> 01:09:59,612
We've been out here all night.

941
01:09:59,946 --> 01:10:02,573
- Take it easy, Sim,
just wanna take a look.

942
01:10:15,962 --> 01:10:16,963
- Oh my God.

943
01:10:20,842 --> 01:10:21,676
Oh my God.

944
01:10:24,053 --> 01:10:25,179
- Hey, Taylor, what's the matter?

945
01:10:25,513 --> 01:10:28,266
You look like you've
seen a freakin' ghost.

946
01:10:28,599 --> 01:10:32,562
- It wasn't any junkie
who did this, asshole.

947
01:10:32,895 --> 01:10:33,521
- Hey.

948
01:10:35,231 --> 01:10:36,315
- It's Bernie.

949
01:10:37,483 --> 01:10:38,234
It's Bernie.

950
01:10:40,069 --> 01:10:40,820
He's back.

951
01:10:42,071 --> 01:10:43,865
- Hey, Taylor, where are you going?

952
01:10:46,367 --> 01:10:47,952
- Don't you understand?

953
01:10:48,911 --> 01:10:49,954
He's back.

954
01:10:50,288 --> 01:10:51,205
He's gonna come home.

955
01:10:51,539 --> 01:10:52,039
- At the camp?

956
01:10:52,373 --> 01:10:53,291
I already checked.

957
01:10:53,624 --> 01:10:54,709
There ain't nobody there.

958
01:10:56,836 --> 01:10:57,795
- Oh, he will be.

959
01:10:59,172 --> 01:11:00,506
He will be.

960
01:11:00,840 --> 01:11:01,507
- You're crazy, Taylor.

961
01:11:01,841 --> 01:11:03,634
There ain't nobody there with them kids.

962
01:11:13,519 --> 01:11:14,604
Crazy bastard.

963
01:12:00,149 --> 01:12:01,025
- Take it away.

964
01:12:04,237 --> 01:12:05,154
- I finally got it.

965
01:12:11,536 --> 01:12:14,622
Is this where you bring all the girls?

966
01:12:17,166 --> 01:12:17,917
- No.

967
01:12:21,754 --> 01:12:26,634
I mean, I never brought
anybody else up here before.

968
01:12:26,968 --> 01:12:27,635
- No?

969
01:12:29,136 --> 01:12:31,013
- Girls don't like me very much.

970
01:12:32,265 --> 01:12:33,933
- Well, I like you and I'm a girl.

971
01:12:39,897 --> 01:12:40,857
- You really like me?

972
01:12:42,066 --> 01:12:43,276
- Well, sure.

973
01:12:43,609 --> 01:12:46,529
Well, you know secret places by the river

974
01:12:46,863 --> 01:12:49,949
and you know how to
drink wine out of a bota.

975
01:12:53,578 --> 01:12:54,412
I like you a lot.

976
01:12:58,332 --> 01:13:01,168
Oh, God, it's really cold out here.

977
01:13:02,670 --> 01:13:04,922
- We can go back if you want to.

978
01:13:05,256 --> 01:13:05,756
- Oh, no.

979
01:13:06,090 --> 01:13:07,466
No, I like it here.

980
01:14:03,898 --> 01:14:05,191
- We have your bedroll.

981
01:14:05,524 --> 01:14:06,150
I can...

982
01:14:07,735 --> 01:14:09,904
we can spread it by the fire.

983
01:14:10,237 --> 01:14:11,113
- That's a good idea.

984
01:14:17,286 --> 01:14:19,288
- Ah, this should be plenty warm.

985
01:14:19,622 --> 01:14:20,581
It's heavy enough.

986
01:14:20,915 --> 01:14:22,708
- Maybe there's some
more wine hidden in it.

987
01:14:23,876 --> 01:14:25,461
- I'd settle for an extra blanket or two.

988
01:14:28,547 --> 01:14:29,173
Oh.

989
01:14:30,216 --> 01:14:32,927
Oh!

990
01:14:34,136 --> 01:14:35,221
Hey!

991
01:14:35,554 --> 01:14:36,764
Hey!

992
01:14:37,098 --> 01:14:38,140
Calm down.

993
01:14:38,474 --> 01:14:39,558
It's just a joke.

994
01:14:40,726 --> 01:14:41,352
- Ajoke?

995
01:14:41,686 --> 01:14:42,353
- It's a joke.

996
01:14:42,687 --> 01:14:44,480
Sure, you can buy those in magic stores.

997
01:14:44,814 --> 01:14:45,481
I've seen them before.

998
01:14:45,815 --> 01:14:47,566
- Oh, God, it looks so real.

999
01:14:48,651 --> 01:14:50,987
- Some little punk from summer
camp probably wrapped it up

1000
01:14:51,320 --> 01:14:53,572
in there to get a rise out of us.

1001
01:14:53,906 --> 01:14:55,241
- Well, it worked.

1002
01:15:00,955 --> 01:15:01,706
- Hey.

1003
01:15:03,457 --> 01:15:04,542
Let's go back.

1004
01:15:06,293 --> 01:15:07,420
- Are you sure?

1005
01:15:07,753 --> 01:15:08,379
- Mm-hmm.

1006
01:15:09,422 --> 01:15:10,172
- Okay.

1007
01:15:14,176 --> 01:15:16,345
- We can go back to my
tent, if you'd like.

1008
01:15:16,679 --> 01:15:17,805
- Okay.

1009
01:15:18,139 --> 01:15:20,182
- It's nice and warm there.

1010
01:15:30,860 --> 01:15:31,610
Okay.

1011
01:17:28,435 --> 01:17:29,061
- What is it?

1012
01:17:29,395 --> 01:17:30,020
- Shh.

1013
01:17:32,273 --> 01:17:33,816
- What, Bobby?

1014
01:17:34,150 --> 01:17:35,151
- Somebody's following us.

1015
01:17:35,484 --> 01:17:38,154
- Oh my God, what are we gonna do?

1016
01:18:00,843 --> 01:18:05,764
- Well, if it isn't old PJ,
the disappearing camper.

1017
01:18:06,932 --> 01:18:10,144
Well, is this how you
get your jollies, PJ?

1018
01:18:10,477 --> 01:18:11,645
Spying on people?

1019
01:18:12,605 --> 01:18:13,355
Huh?

1020
01:18:16,066 --> 01:18:17,610
Well, come on, pervert.

1021
01:18:17,943 --> 01:18:18,444
- Bobby, let's just --

1022
01:18:18,777 --> 01:18:19,278
- Uh-uh, no way.

1023
01:18:19,612 --> 01:18:21,071
No, this jerk needs a lesson.

1024
01:18:21,405 --> 01:18:21,906
Come on.

1025
01:18:22,239 --> 01:18:25,993
I'm gonna kick your ass from
here to the next hospital.

1026
01:18:26,327 --> 01:18:26,952
Come on.

1027
01:18:27,286 --> 01:18:27,912
Come on.

1028
01:18:29,580 --> 01:18:33,626
Hey, man, what are you doing?

1029
01:18:33,959 --> 01:18:35,252
Hey, hey, put that down.

1030
01:18:35,586 --> 01:18:37,254
You could hurt somebody with that, pal.

1031
01:18:37,588 --> 01:18:39,048
You could hurt someone with that.

1032
01:18:55,648 --> 01:18:57,066
- Can I ask you a question?

1033
01:18:57,399 --> 01:18:58,025
- Anything.

1034
01:18:58,984 --> 01:19:00,569
- Did you plan this whole thing?

1035
01:19:00,903 --> 01:19:02,154
- Whose idea was it to come up here?

1036
01:19:02,488 --> 01:19:03,364
- Mine, but --
- And who pulled us

1037
01:19:03,697 --> 01:19:04,615
both into the stream?

1038
01:19:04,949 --> 01:19:06,325
- I did, but --
- I rest my case.

1039
01:19:06,659 --> 01:19:07,159
- You rat,

1040
01:19:07,493 --> 01:19:08,786
if you think I planned --
- Shut up and kiss me.

1041
01:19:09,119 --> 01:19:10,621
- No way, Jose.

1042
01:19:10,955 --> 01:19:11,622
I came up here to look around

1043
01:19:11,956 --> 01:19:14,333
and that's exactly what I'm going to do.

1044
01:19:14,667 --> 01:19:15,167
- Okay.

1045
01:19:15,501 --> 01:19:16,085
But don't come crawling back to me

1046
01:19:16,418 --> 01:19:17,503
when you freeze your buns.

1047
01:19:24,593 --> 01:19:26,262
- Hey, there's something over here.

1048
01:19:29,515 --> 01:19:30,516
It's stuck.

1049
01:19:34,937 --> 01:19:36,188
- Are you okay?

1050
01:19:36,522 --> 01:19:37,273
What is it?

1051
01:19:37,606 --> 01:19:38,232
- I think so.

1052
01:19:42,653 --> 01:19:45,281
- I guess this must have fell
when you jerked the door open.

1053
01:19:46,490 --> 01:19:47,241
What?

1054
01:19:51,787 --> 01:19:52,955
- Look at all this stuff.

1055
01:19:54,873 --> 01:19:55,499
- The makings

1056
01:19:55,833 --> 01:19:57,293
of a pretty good torture chamber in here.

1057
01:20:07,594 --> 01:20:10,973
The Grim Reaper approaches a little --

1058
01:20:15,311 --> 01:20:16,895
- You think our clothes are dry yet?

1059
01:20:17,229 --> 01:20:18,689
- I don't know, let's check.

1060
01:20:28,449 --> 01:20:28,949
- The clothes.

1061
01:20:29,283 --> 01:20:30,534
- We don't need clothes
for what I've got in mind.

1062
01:20:31,702 --> 01:20:32,661
- You pervert.

1063
01:21:01,565 --> 01:21:02,733
- Help!

1064
01:21:03,067 --> 01:21:04,276
Somebody, please!

1065
01:21:10,824 --> 01:21:11,909
Jane, help me!

1066
01:21:16,413 --> 01:21:17,289
Regis!

1067
01:21:17,623 --> 01:21:18,248
Marcie!

1068
01:21:25,130 --> 01:21:25,881
Oh, God!

1069
01:22:08,048 --> 01:22:09,258
- Piece of shit vehicles.

1070
01:22:09,591 --> 01:22:10,092
Bernie?

1071
01:22:10,426 --> 01:22:11,051
Who's Bernie?

1072
01:22:12,052 --> 01:22:13,220
I'll take him.

1073
01:22:13,512 --> 01:22:15,431
I'll take him from the knees up.

1074
01:22:40,539 --> 01:22:41,832
Hey, kids!

1075
01:22:42,166 --> 01:22:42,666
Kids!

1076
01:22:43,834 --> 01:22:45,961
I'm sorry to interrupt you here.

1077
01:22:49,047 --> 01:22:50,549
Kids, I can't tell you how --

1078
01:23:30,172 --> 01:23:30,672
Jesus.

1079
01:23:54,571 --> 01:23:56,907
- So you think Taylor found
anything up at that camp?

1080
01:23:57,241 --> 01:23:58,992
- Taylor's a flake.

1081
01:23:59,326 --> 01:24:01,745
- But he's been with
the department 20 years.

1082
01:24:02,079 --> 01:24:04,414
- Yeah, and he's still pushing
around that patrol unit.

1083
01:24:04,748 --> 01:24:05,791
That tell you something?

1084
01:24:06,124 --> 01:24:07,167
- I hear he's a good cop.

1085
01:24:11,755 --> 01:24:13,340
- Hurry, or we won't get any sleep at all.

1086
01:24:13,674 --> 01:24:15,217
- Ah, sleep is for sissies.

1087
01:24:15,551 --> 01:24:18,220
Tell you what, I'll let you
sleep an extra 15 minutes --

1088
01:27:51,308 --> 01:27:52,058
- Hello?

1089
01:27:52,392 --> 01:27:53,769
Hello, is anybody there?

1090
01:27:54,102 --> 01:27:54,728
Hello?

1091
01:27:58,356 --> 01:27:59,441
Oh, God.

1092
01:28:15,457 --> 01:28:16,166
- I'm telling ya,

1093
01:28:16,500 --> 01:28:18,376
it's a regular slaughterhouse up there.

1094
01:28:18,710 --> 01:28:19,628
Every cop in the county's up

1095
01:28:19,961 --> 01:28:22,464
at the camp trying to
figure out what happened.

1096
01:28:22,798 --> 01:28:24,966
- I hear they got the looney though.

1097
01:28:25,300 --> 01:28:26,802
They say some kid shot him dead.

1098
01:28:28,011 --> 01:28:29,721
- Wait a minute, something's coming.

1099
01:28:46,446 --> 01:28:47,948
- Jesus, what a night, huh?

1100
01:28:48,281 --> 01:28:49,658
- You got some bodies back there?

1101
01:28:49,991 --> 01:28:51,827
- Hell, they're gonna need a semi

1102
01:28:52,160 --> 01:28:53,829
for all the bodies they got up there.

1103
01:28:55,163 --> 01:28:57,415
We got the live ones, though.

I'm here at the Lovesick Diner
and Grill with my colleagues here.

00:00:08,791 --> 00:00:10,140

You can do it, baby.

11
00:00:25,721 --> 00:00:26,852
Do it tonight.

12
00:00:27,027 --> 00:00:28,593
You can't take me to your crib

13
00:00:28,767 --> 00:00:30,247
You can ride it all night

You can do it, baby.

00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:54,445
Gonna end up falling in love
with you

23
00:00:54,619 --> 00:00:57,231
It""s the type of shit you
expose me to

24
00:00:57,405 --> 00:01:00,669
Then I pulled up side by side
in my Mercedes coupe

25
00:01:01,539 --> 00:01:03,585
Ain""t nobody got you like I got you

26
00:01:03,759 --> 00:01:07,023
We move higher and higher, you

27
00:01:08,633 --> 00:01:11,027
Ain""t nobody got you like I got you

28
00:01:11,201 --> 00:01:14,117

climbing the ladder

29
00:01:15,423 --> 00:01:16,554

It""s the type of shit you

Then I pulled up side by side
in my Mercedes coupe

41
00:01:43,625 --> 00:01:46,932
A wise man once said, falling
in love

42
00:01:48,020 --> 00:01:50,501
is the one fall you don""t get
up from

43
00:01:51,198 --> 00:01:53,504
Guess we""re lovesick.

44
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:06,517
It""s a love letter, it""s some things
that I do, but I won""t say I do

45
00:02:06,691 --> 00:02:09,651
You should get to know me better

46
00:02:09,825 --> 00:02:11,653

What does it mean?

00:03:47,923 --> 00:03:50,839
That you are unlucky in love.

65
00:03:51,013 --> 00:03:55,365
I love you, but I can hate you
at the same time

66
00:03:55,539 --> 00:03:58,063
wedding rings,
we got them at the same time.

67
00:03:58,238 --> 00:04:00,327

00:04:13,383 --> 00:04:16,473
I might pull up on my baby,

72
00:04:16,647 --> 00:04:19,563
Rolling through the ocean in a
white boat

73
00:04:20,129 --> 00:04:23,524
Pull up and salute in a white ghost

74
00:04:24,612 --> 00:04:27,136
What else does it say?

75
00:04:36,276 --> 00:04:38,582
Fucking finally, that's the exchange.

76
00:04:39,670 --> 00:04:42,934
Now, let's hope this mope

77
00:04:45,937 --> 00:04:49,158
Ridin"", kept it cooling, I don

85
00:05:10,527 --> 00:05:12,268
Nah, it""s just some cook.

00:05:12,877 --> 00:05:14,966
Sure as shit he's in there.

00:05:16,316 --> 00:05:19,536
How many fucking trash bags

Put him on the phone.

97
00:05:38,729 --> 00:05:40,644
Put him on the phone.

00:05:40,818 --> 00:05:42,733

Now you want to look out for me?

I'm just looking.

108
00:06:20,815 --> 00:06:24,079
I told you, I can't be put on a leash.

109
00:06:24,775 --> 00:06:27,387
This is gonna get me killed one day

110
00:06:28,910 --> 00:06:31,478
but I know

111
00:06:32,261 --> 00:06:33,871
I could have had him

112
00:06:38,049 --> 00:06:40,487
There""s a girl outside.
The one with the great ass.

113
00:06:40,791 --> 00:06:44,229
Of course I""d rather be there

114
00:06:44,404 --> 00:06:46,710
I love your family.

115
00:06:46,884 --> 00:06:50,932
No, it's just in this case, we have
to wait for the money. Just-That's it.

116
00:06:51,106 --> 00:06:53,891
And we just have to find out
where the money's going. No.

117
00:06:54,065 --> 00:06:57,678
- It""s not like that hon.
- Oh, I wouldn't mind getting that for Christmas.

118
00:06:57,852 --> 00:06:59,157
What? No, I

119
00:06:59,810 --> 00:07:01,092
Honey, I don't know what he's
talking about.

120
00:07:01,116 --> 00:07:03,205
No-okay.

121
00:07:03,379 --> 00:07:04,728
I'm going to come home right now.

122
00:07:04,902 --> 00:07:07,035
Okay? I'm gonna come home right now.

123
00:07:07,209 --> 00:07:09,124
- Damn it.
- I'm going to be right there. Okay?

124
00:07:09,298 --> 00:07:12,257
I love you boo boo. All right
tin tin.

125
00:07:12,432 --> 00:07:15,304
Hello?

126
00:07:15,478 --> 00:07:17,785
Fucking hung up on me.
What the fuck is wrong with you?

127
00:07:17,959 --> 00:07:19,656
How's that my fault?

128
00:07:19,830 --> 00:07:22,354
What you giving me a hard time for.
fucking shut up

129
00:07:30,928 --> 00:07:32,887
Don ain""t here

130
00:07:33,322 --> 00:07:35,585
Good. Cause we're here to see you.

131
00:07:35,759 --> 00:07:39,850
Woah, looks like someone's
feeling the Christmas spirit.

132
00:07:40,024 --> 00:07:42,287
We know you're mad at him.

133
00:07:42,766 --> 00:07:44,289
I mean, shit,

134
00:07:44,681 --> 00:07:47,771
If I treated my wife like he
treats you.

135
00:07:49,469 --> 00:07:50,731
He's a dog

136
00:07:50,905 --> 00:07:52,254
but I'm not a rat.

137
00:07:53,211 --> 00:07:55,910
Well, we just thought that maybe
you'd like the chance to hurt him.

138
00:07:56,824 --> 00:08:00,784
Hmm. I can do that my own way.

139
00:08:00,958 --> 00:08:03,526
Don""t I make you feel special?

140
00:08:03,700 --> 00:08:05,441
Thanks for your help.

141
00:08:05,615 --> 00:08:08,662
Low key gotta be gotta be right
there for your loving

142
00:08:08,836 --> 00:08:12,796
I""m hoping I am what you seek

143
00:08:17,540 --> 00:08:20,935
Hold on, he come with that. Ooh-
Ooh here he come

144
00:08:21,109 --> 00:08:24,155
Quick little jab to the head

145
00:08:24,329 --> 00:08:26,027
Oh, come on, man.

146
00:08:26,201 --> 00:08:28,333
See, you really got to be on
that right?

147
00:08:28,508 --> 00:08:31,815
That boy is surgical with it

148
00:08:36,559 --> 00:08:38,300
Champ is getting old, man.

149
00:08:38,474 --> 00:08:39,910
Still the champ

150
00:08:40,084 --> 00:08:41,084
Yeah.

151
00:08:41,651 --> 00:08:43,174
Ooh-Ooh-

152
00:08:43,435 --> 00:08:44,915
a king on his own.

153
00:08:45,089 --> 00:08:47,135
A king only sits on his throne
for so long

154
00:08:48,136 --> 00:08:49,964
Yeah, well, I'm out

155
00:09:15,250 --> 00:09:19,341
I hope it's good, man.

156
00:09:19,515 --> 00:09:21,212
What the hell is this?

157
00:09:21,386 --> 00:09:24,259
This shit it's slippier than
a pimp's pocketbook, man.

158
00:09:24,433 --> 00:09:25,913
Yeah. What""s going on here?

159
00:09:26,087 --> 00:09:28,132
I ordered a soft steak. This is
a pet rock

160
00:09:28,306 --> 00:09:30,352
Meat""s tougher than a midget
trying a slam dunk.

161
00:09:30,526 --> 00:09:32,049
Who the hell made this?

162
00:09:32,223 --> 00:09:33,983
Man, I thought Rick James had
some slick hair

163
00:09:34,138 --> 00:09:35,938
Look at all of grease on this
damn bacon, man.

164
00:09:36,053 --> 00:09:38,142
Who's the cook around here?

165
00:09:39,056 --> 00:09:41,232
Where they get him from? The
penitentiary?

166
00:09:41,406 --> 00:09:42,973
My God man.

167
00:09:43,147 --> 00:09:45,062
It ain't like it looked on the
picture, man.

168
00:09:45,236 --> 00:09:47,021
I swear to God, man.

169
00:09:47,195 --> 00:09:49,589
Like a three stars porta potty
establishmen. I""m scared

170
00:09:49,763 --> 00:09:52,722
- Who""s the new girl?
- God, man, this is. tell you one thing man

171
00:09:52,896 --> 00:09:55,788
This meat is tougher than a fat drawer
trying to fit to a skinny door, man.

172
00:09:55,812 --> 00:09:58,206
I ain""t never going to eat at
this damn place again.

173
00:09:58,380 --> 00:10:00,208
They get down...

174
00:10:06,083 --> 00:10:08,782
I just wanna pick you up,
Can it go down?

175
00:10:08,956 --> 00:10:10,740
Hit you in the backseat,

176
00:10:10,914 --> 00:10:13,961
Can it go down?

177
00:10:15,832 --> 00:10:17,486
You're gonna get me in trouble.

178
00:10:17,660 --> 00:10:21,185
Trouble with who?

179
00:10:21,359 --> 00:10:23,187
You know, I want it

180
00:10:23,492 --> 00:10:27,583
I can fuck you in the backseat,
backseat, backseat

181
00:10:27,757 --> 00:10:30,804
I can fuck you in the backseat,

182
00:10:30,978 --> 00:10:32,327
you know you got it

183
00:10:32,501 --> 00:10:36,331
Oh, is it something that I need
to know?

184
00:10:36,505 --> 00:10:41,118
We been sipping, screwing,
moving slow...

185
00:10:41,292 --> 00:10:44,252
Shawty in here, calling my name...

186
00:10:45,079 --> 00:10:46,297
I can fuck you in the

187
00:10:46,515 --> 00:10:48,125
backseat

188
00:10:48,343 --> 00:10:51,215
I can fuck you in the backseat

189
00:10:51,389 --> 00:10:54,610
I can fuck you in the backseat,

190
00:10:54,784 --> 00:10:58,222
I can fuck you in the backseat,

191
00:11:05,229 --> 00:11:07,579
For some time.

192
00:11:07,754 --> 00:11:12,976
For some time.

193
00:11:13,150 --> 00:11:18,460
Is she falling, is she falling
in love?

194
00:11:22,420 --> 00:11:23,420
Hey, baby,

195
00:11:24,945 --> 00:11:26,860
you get my message?

196
00:11:27,034 --> 00:11:29,123
If I had...

197
00:11:29,297 --> 00:11:30,515
Put him on the phone.

198
00:11:30,690 --> 00:11:32,169
Put him on the phone.

199
00:11:32,343 --> 00:11:34,737
You messed with the wrong one
today, Don.

200
00:11:34,911 --> 00:11:36,826
Go ahead with your bitch.

201
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,132
Keep it for us...

202
00:11:38,306 --> 00:11:40,438
I""m tired baby!

203
00:11:40,612 --> 00:11:42,136
Fuck you Don

204
00:11:44,442 --> 00:11:46,618
Hello it""s Don here
at the Lovesick Diner and Grill.

205
00:11:46,793 --> 00:11:48,272
With my colleagues.

206
00:11:48,446 --> 00:11:50,231
I know you wanna come and get a burger.

207
00:11:50,405 --> 00:11:53,016
I know you wanna come and get a
fry. Come on down.

208
00:11:53,190 --> 00:11:55,671
Bring your wife, bring your
girlfriend. It's all here.

209
00:11:55,889 --> 00:11:58,108
Have a good time at the Lovesick
Diner and Grill, baby.

210
00:11:58,282 --> 00:12:00,415
Let's go.

211
00:12:00,676 --> 00:12:03,157
If I had...

212
00:12:03,331 --> 00:12:06,160
Your love...

213
00:12:06,334 --> 00:12:09,206
In my hands...

214
00:12:09,380 --> 00:12:12,383
Keep it for us...

215
00:12:15,082 --> 00:12:18,520

00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:29,720
It's going to be all right, Marie.

2
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:36,040
It's going to be OK.

3
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:41,120
Come up here, Dad.
She's here.

4
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:43,600
Look, Daddy's coming to join us.

5
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,960
This is where you're hiding.

6
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:58,640
Are you all right, darling?

7
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:03,000
What's going on?

8
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:09,640
Daddy?
I think this is what she needs.

9
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:14,240
I've already read a bit
but it's better if it's you.

10
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:15,480
- All of it?
- Yep.

11
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:17,160
From the start?

12
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:20,120
So...

13
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:23,920
It all started the day we moved.

14
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:27,880
4th of April 1986.

15
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:30,000
6:30am.

16
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:35,080
Dad is packing the car
with all our things, our whole life.

17
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:38,200
In the end, we didn't keep much.

18
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:53,880
Graham for Jim.

19
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:00,880
Graham for Jim.

20
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:05,320
Jim for Dad.

21
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:07,560
All checked?
Nothing forgotten?

22
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:10,640
No, it's all good,
we have everything.

23
00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:13,520
So, come down.
OK?

24
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:16,120
OK, on my way, Daddy.

25
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:51,040
What's he done now?

26
00:03:52,760 --> 00:03:53,760
What's that?

27
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:59,560
- You ripped the door off?
- Not the door, just the frame.

28
00:03:59,720 --> 00:04:01,080
Throw it in the back.

29
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:25,320
Jim, it's going to be OK.

30
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:28,400
What about school?

31
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:31,200
- You'll go to a new one.
- And my friends?

32
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:33,520
Which friends exactly?

33
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:36,000
I don't know, Mr Burton?

34
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:39,160
Mr Burton?
The old guy from the library?

35
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:42,760
- And Miguel?
- Your Spanish pen pal?

36
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:44,680
You write to each other...

37
00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:47,400
Precisely.
We won't have the same letter box.

38
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,080
Hey, we're not going to the moon, OK?

39
00:04:58,040 --> 00:05:00,440
I like seeing the city
get smaller and smaller...

40
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:04,560
- Everything look smaller from afar.
- Yes, it's mathematical.

41
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:08,280
Not only, Jim. Not only.

42
00:05:58,120 --> 00:06:02,920
SPACEBOY

43
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:28,040
Wake up.

44
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:41,720
Cosmo, I think we've arrived.

45
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:54,680
- Promise you won't go crazy.
- Come on, Dad!

46
00:06:54,840 --> 00:06:56,520
- Promise me.
- OK. Promise.

47
00:06:57,080 --> 00:06:58,880
Good.
Ready?

48
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:02,760
Here we go.
You can open your eyes, we're there.

49
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:08,640
Is this where you're
going to complete your mission?

50
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:09,920
Wicked!

51
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:12,120
- Come on let's go!
- Easy tiger.

52
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:15,360
Let me settle in, you can
come after school tomorrow.

53
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:17,360
- Deal.
- Come on, let's go.

54
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:35,120
- Will you be OK to get home?
- Yes, I've prepared a map.

55
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:39,200
April. May. June.

56
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:43,680
Three short months and it's summer.
Can you survive that long?

57
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:48,960
It'll give you a chance to make
some friends for the holidays.

58
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:51,520
Real ones this time.

59
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:55,640
Hurry up parking those bikes...

60
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:57,200
Stand up please, miss!

61
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:59,240
No running!

62
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:02,040
Mr Gouldman!

63
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:04,360
Mr Gouldman.

64
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:07,000
You! Here in my school?

65
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:09,280
Mr Gouldman. What an honour.

66
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:11,640
Sorry! I'm Mr Flanberg.

67
00:08:12,280 --> 00:08:14,480
- I'm the headmaster.
- How do you do?

68
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:19,080
By hiring a man of your caliber,
the observatory...

69
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:21,960
has reached for the stars!

70
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:23,080
Yes, well, this is my...

71
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:25,000
Please. No running!

72
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:29,120
They run, they run.
And then they fall, they fall.

73
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:32,160
Gravitational waves.

74
00:08:32,680 --> 00:08:33,920
Space-time.

75
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:42,280
A black hole.

76
00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:44,400
So fascinating, isn't it?

77
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:48,320
And who's the lucky owner
of such a fabulous dad?

78
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:51,920
I'm James Eugene Gouldman
but you can call me Jim.

79
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:54,760
- Which fits in the high scores.
- In what?

80
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:00,640
High scores.

81
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:03,720
- You use three letters from your name.
- In video games.

82
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:05,800
That's very good.

83
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:09,640
- You can go and join class 6B.
- Go on, off you go.

84
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:13,160
Go on. Chop-chop.
Off you go.

85
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:15,960
Mr Gouldman.

86
00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:18,720
- Have a nice day.
- See you tomorrow.

87
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:20,200
Perhaps, yes.

88
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:20,400
It's going to be all right.

89
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:23,800
Breathe.

90
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:26,600
It's going to be all right.

91
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:32,200
Is someone there?

92
00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:35,280
No.

93
00:10:36,280 --> 00:10:37,280
OK.

94
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:39,280
Bye then.

95
00:10:55,840 --> 00:10:59,160
Today, we're going to learn about:

96
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:01,120
The

97
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:02,800
atom.

98
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:09,920
An atom is a tiny particle that
can't be seen with the naked eye.

99
00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:13,040
So to help us dive into the matter,
I'm going to start

100
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:16,000
with a sketch...

101
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:23,480
That's the one.

102
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:28,320
First scientific step: observation.

103
00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:36,080
So for example, we have
oxygen, carbon, iron...

104
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:39,880
Lots of different elements, and
each chemical element is, in fact,

105
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:42,320
made up of tiny particles...

106
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:57,240
You can sit down.

107
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:00,440
Wait here.

108
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:08,040
- Isn't young Gouldman here?
- No.

109
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:11,000
- Small, brown-haired kid?
- I haven't seen him.

110
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:15,480
Our dear Emma.

111
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:18,360
After a few months away,
she's back in top shape

112
00:12:19,160 --> 00:12:21,280
for the last term of the school year.

113
00:12:22,760 --> 00:12:25,240
But please,
everyone be very careful.

114
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:26,760
Her doctors insist.

115
00:12:27,560 --> 00:12:29,120
Her parents insist.

116
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:31,320
In a word, everyone...

117
00:12:31,840 --> 00:12:33,840
insists.

118
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:35,840
Vi... gi...

119
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:39,680
lance.
Vigilance.

120
00:12:39,880 --> 00:12:41,160
So, if you play with Emma...

121
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,000
be...

122
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:44,880
vigilant.

123
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:48,400
- Please, continue.
- Thank you.

124
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:51,440
Yes, I'll leave you to it.

125
00:12:55,560 --> 00:12:58,400
I'm very happy you're back.
Why don't you sit down.

126
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:06,440
So, then...

127
00:13:06,520 --> 00:13:10,320
The actual distance between
the nucleus of the atom...

128
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:13,400
Cosmo. Let's go!

129
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:18,040
How are you?
We've missed you.

130
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:20,240
Look.

131
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,800
I've wanted to give it to you
for a long time...

132
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:30,000
Look, it's a transfer.
Put it on.

133
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:41,240
- Did you see the guy in the tree?
- What guy in a tree?

134
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:48,200
- Look!
- Who's he?

135
00:13:56,600 --> 00:13:59,080
What are you
doing in my classroom?

136
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:01,680
The headmaster told me
to go to classroom 6B.

137
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:05,920
- Through the window?
- He didn't say how exactly.

138
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:08,440
Silence!

139
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:12,200
- And you too. Understood?
- Loud and clear.

140
00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:15,040
Do you know him?

141
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,240
Who is this guy?

142
00:14:20,520 --> 00:14:21,800
Ah, Mrs Diaz.

143
00:14:24,960 --> 00:14:27,480
Did you see a boy by any chance?

144
00:14:27,640 --> 00:14:29,200
Lost in the hallways?

145
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:41,200
We'll see about this later, Mrs Diaz.

146
00:14:43,840 --> 00:14:45,560
Please write clearly.

147
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:50,880
Jim. Wait by my desk, please.

148
00:14:51,520 --> 00:14:54,160
Bye.
Emma, you too, wait here.

149
00:14:55,480 --> 00:14:57,440
I don't need you to stay.
You can go.

150
00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:00,440
- Bye Spencer.
- Wait, Miss Adams, I wanted to...

151
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:03,080
- Goodbye.
- No listen... No one ever listens...

152
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:06,680
Next time, please use the door
like everyone else. Agreed?

153
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:09,680
Agreed! But if there's
a fire or an explosion

154
00:15:09,840 --> 00:15:11,560
we may need
to leave via the window.

155
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:15,400
It could be dangerous.
That thing could explode.

156
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:18,200
Through the door.

157
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,040
Right.

158
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:26,480
Every year, at the end of June,
the school has a science contest.

159
00:15:26,840 --> 00:15:30,080
Emma, you know all about this,
but as you're both alone

160
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:32,200
I thought you could work together?

161
00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:34,040
I'm already in Spencer's team.

162
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:38,080
They started working
in January so they're too far ahead.

163
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:40,040
I'm sorry.

164
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:44,720
Here Jim, have a look at these
examples of ongoing projects.

165
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:46,080
Great, thanks.

166
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:47,240
Emma...

167
00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:50,160
You'll be fine.
Don't worry.

168
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:52,040
OK then...

169
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:55,800
Try to meet tonight and
come up with a proposal for tomorrow.

170
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,120
That bastard
is stealing Emma from us.

171
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:03,560
- Whatever.
- What, whatever?

172
00:16:12,760 --> 00:16:15,760
Emma?
One hour, don't forget.

173
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:21,440
Jim?

174
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:33,560
Yes, I'm in the kitchen.

175
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:36,760
- Are you hungry?
- I've already had dinner.

176
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:38,400
I'll eat later then.

177
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:49,520
- Are you alone?
- Yeah, my father often works late.

178
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:52,320
I came up with an idea.

179
00:16:54,280 --> 00:16:55,440
The hamster...

180
00:16:57,240 --> 00:16:59,520
Cute animals always earn you points.

181
00:17:06,680 --> 00:17:08,680
- So? What do you think?
- I'm home.

182
00:17:10,600 --> 00:17:11,960
We have company...

183
00:17:12,120 --> 00:17:13,440
- Good evening, sir.
- Hello.

184
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:14,600
This is Emma.

185
00:17:14,680 --> 00:17:17,320
We have to find an idea
for a science contest at school.

186
00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:18,520
A contest? Great!

187
00:17:18,920 --> 00:17:19,960
And your day?

188
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:22,280
Great, I'll tell you later.
Did you eat?

189
00:17:22,440 --> 00:17:24,640
No, but go for it, I made pasta.

190
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:30,480
Follow me.

191
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:36,040
Come on, Emma.

192
00:17:57,960 --> 00:17:59,400
Please don't touch anything.

193
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:02,280
Relax. I'm touching with my eyes.

194
00:18:02,440 --> 00:18:05,240
You'll hurt yourself.
Look at all the toothpicks.

195
00:18:10,360 --> 00:18:12,240
My mother gave me one hour.

196
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:13,800
We need to hurry.

197
00:18:14,040 --> 00:18:15,520
This meeting is top secret.

198
00:18:23,080 --> 00:18:24,240
Hold on tight.

199
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:28,040
New-Mexico. August 1960.

200
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:31,920
Pilot Joseph Kittinger
is about to make history.

201
00:18:32,680 --> 00:18:35,320
After one last check of his equipment,

202
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:39,040
designed to withstand
extreme temperatures and pressure,

203
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:40,840
his balloon takes off.

204
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:45,160
After four solitary hours,
Kittinger reaches the frontier of space.

205
00:18:45,680 --> 00:18:51,080
At 31,300 meters altitude,
he faces infinity.

206
00:18:51,640 --> 00:18:55,720
In the hope of seeing his family again,
Kittinger puts his trust in God.

207
00:18:55,920 --> 00:18:58,040
He dives into the void.

208
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:03,720
Kittinger achieves
the greatest leap in history,

209
00:19:03,920 --> 00:19:08,480
falling at 988 km/h,
without any equipment.

210
00:19:09,160 --> 00:19:13,640
After 4 minutes and 37 seconds,
Kittinger opens his parachute.

211
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:17,040
He becomes a hero for mankind.

212
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:20,240
Did you see that?

213
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:25,760
Emma, we're recreating Kittinger's
Excelsior balloon for the contest.

214
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:27,880
- For real?
- Yes, of course.

215
00:19:28,040 --> 00:19:30,720
That's a joke.
We can't do something like that.

216
00:19:30,840 --> 00:19:31,880
Yes we can.

217
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,840
My dad taught me everything
and we have his old equipment.

218
00:19:35,080 --> 00:19:38,000
He's an astrophysicist.
He's going to go into space.

219
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:39,720
He's really going into space?

220
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:42,360
It's top secret. Look.

221
00:19:45,800 --> 00:19:47,960
He'll be the fifth physicist
to go into space.

222
00:19:48,560 --> 00:19:49,960
After Rukavishnikov in '71,

223
00:19:50,120 --> 00:19:51,800
Gibson in '73,

224
00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:53,040
Allen in '82,

225
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:54,440
and Acton in '85.

226
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:55,880
And now: my dad.

227
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:59,800
Take-off in two years,
four months and eleven days.

228
00:20:00,120 --> 00:20:02,440
On the 7th of July 1988 to be precise.

229
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:07,040
All right but...
we can't build a hot-air balloon.

230
00:20:08,120 --> 00:20:11,320
With all my past experiments,
I know what I'm doing.

231
00:20:11,560 --> 00:20:13,840
My mum's going to kill me.
I've got to go.

232
00:20:15,680 --> 00:20:16,680
What?

233
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,720
Go on Dad, tell me.
How was it?

234
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:28,000
Go on, tell me.

235
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:32,120
Please.

236
00:20:32,560 --> 00:20:35,240
Nothing strengthens authority
so much as silence.

237
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:36,840
Leonardo DaVinci.

238
00:20:41,720 --> 00:20:42,800
I'm kidding.

239
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:44,760
- How was it?
- Thanks for the pasta.

240
00:20:45,080 --> 00:20:48,520
- Wait. You first. She looks nice that...
- Emma?

241
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:51,960
Emma, yes.
What about the science contest?

242
00:20:52,120 --> 00:20:55,560
I'm thinking of recreating
Kittinger's hot-air balloon.

243
00:20:56,160 --> 00:20:58,960
Good idea.
But no messing around this time, OK?

244
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:01,400
- OK... Yes!
- Promise?

245
00:21:02,040 --> 00:21:03,680
How was the telescope?

246
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:06,280
Once you've seen one,
you've seen them all.

247
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:08,120
You'll see tomorrow.

248
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:15,120
Oh no... Help!
Let me go.

249
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:18,240
Take-off!

250
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:46,720
There... Here I am.
So?

251
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:50,080
Did you have time
to prepare something together?

252
00:21:55,800 --> 00:21:57,680
- A hot-air balloon?
- My project?!

253
00:22:00,760 --> 00:22:02,680
It's a lovely presentation.

254
00:22:05,560 --> 00:22:07,360
Explanations of the physics.

255
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:09,400
It's good.
Very good.

256
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:12,960
This is a joke. We can't do this.
It's much too dangerous.

257
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:14,440
Yes.

258
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:15,880
Yes.

259
00:22:16,160 --> 00:22:18,240
You're quite right, Miss Novak.

260
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:22,240
We wouldn't want
your balloon to turn into a hearse.

261
00:22:23,640 --> 00:22:25,160
No hamster.

262
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:28,280
You know what Charlotte's
doing for the contest?

263
00:22:28,440 --> 00:22:30,120
No. What's she doing?

264
00:22:31,040 --> 00:22:33,600
Maxi-binoculars.
What a joke.

265
00:22:34,280 --> 00:22:37,120
- That sounds good.
- It's not, it's pathetic.

266
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:41,480
So? What is there to see today?
I see...

267
00:22:43,480 --> 00:22:44,480
A tree?

268
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:47,800
No, it's the t-shirt
of the girl right next to me.

269
00:22:47,960 --> 00:22:49,960
You can't really see very far...

270
00:22:54,440 --> 00:22:57,400
- What's up?
- Terrible project. Impossible to do.

271
00:22:57,600 --> 00:22:58,600
Great...

272
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:02,280
- And your hamster idea?
- He tricked me.

273
00:23:03,480 --> 00:23:06,200
- So, what are you going?
- A hot-air balloon.

274
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:07,560
He's such a weirdo.

275
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:10,360
I'll tell Miss Adams
I'm dropping the project.

276
00:23:10,520 --> 00:23:12,360
No, don't.
I've had an idea.

277
00:23:12,680 --> 00:23:15,360
How would you like to
spy on him for us?

278
00:23:15,920 --> 00:23:19,160
- What are you on about?
- Like a special agent.

279
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,440
- Are you still with us?
- Yes.

280
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:43,440
This is the control centre

281
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:48,000
where we collect the data to share
with the other space research centres.

282
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:50,160
You know the principle.

283
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:54,720
- Cool isn't it?
- Yep.

284
00:23:56,720 --> 00:23:58,400
Ah! It's Jim.

285
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:01,960
Will you be watching
next week's take-off with us?

286
00:24:02,120 --> 00:24:05,800
Challenger? Of course.
I wouldn't miss it for the world.

287
00:24:07,480 --> 00:24:08,680
Ready?

288
00:24:09,240 --> 00:24:10,560
Here we are.

289
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:13,600
- Welcome to my lair.
- Cool. Oh, the chair!

290
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:16,200
- Yeah. Good, right?
- Does it swivel?

291
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:19,000
Yeah, nice one...

292
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:22,640
Why can't we talk about
your mission here?

293
00:24:23,160 --> 00:24:26,080
Just don't.
We agreed. OK?

294
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:30,480
- Hey, my project was accepted.
- Which project?

295
00:24:30,760 --> 00:24:33,840
- Kittinger. For the contest.
- Oh yes, the contest.

296
00:24:40,280 --> 00:24:41,840
Project Excelsior.

297
00:24:50,040 --> 00:24:51,080
What?

298
00:24:51,880 --> 00:24:55,480
You forgot the resistance factors
in your weight to mass ratio.

299
00:24:57,320 --> 00:24:58,920
I'm afraid so.

300
00:25:00,360 --> 00:25:04,920
Jim, don't ever forget, for a scientist,
a millimetre is a millimetre...

301
00:25:05,040 --> 00:25:06,200
A gram is a gram.

302
00:25:06,360 --> 00:25:08,600
It's important.

303
00:25:27,160 --> 00:25:28,160
It's here.

304
00:25:30,040 --> 00:25:32,760
- So? Do you like it?
- It looks great.

305
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:36,480
- Shall we go and take a look?
- Yes.

306
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:40,440
Are you sure
this barn's abandoned?

307
00:25:40,600 --> 00:25:44,360
Yes, I'm sure. But I'm warning you,
I'm not getting in your balloon.

308
00:25:44,520 --> 00:25:46,920
Stop, Emma, you can trust me...

309
00:25:55,520 --> 00:25:58,160
I get it.
You're nervous about the contest?

310
00:25:58,320 --> 00:26:00,760
Don't worry,
I know it's all new to you,

311
00:26:02,120 --> 00:26:04,720
but I've got everything covered.

312
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:11,280
An envelope.
A basket. And hot air.

313
00:26:11,720 --> 00:26:15,520
Then we'll need: two walkie-talkies,
an altimeter, and...

314
00:26:16,280 --> 00:26:19,000
- two parachutes.
- Two what?

315
00:26:19,400 --> 00:26:22,600
Parachutes, Emma. I'm not going
to repeat everything twice.

316
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:23,960
And now...

317
00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:25,920
Destination - Space.

318
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:34,960
- It really works!
- Of course. You see, you can trust me.

319
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:54,400
Yes, look, don't worry...
it's fine.

320
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:58,640
To recreate Kittinger's mission,
we'll need helium, not fire, so...

321
00:27:31,040 --> 00:27:32,040
Emma!

322
00:27:33,320 --> 00:27:34,320
Emma!

323
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:36,280
Come on Emma, hurry up.

324
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:38,760
Come on, Emma.

325
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:40,720
Hurry up.
Run.

326
00:27:43,640 --> 00:27:45,600
Come on. Hurry up.
Quick.

327
00:27:46,760 --> 00:27:47,760
Come on!

328
00:27:49,040 --> 00:27:50,200
Check this out.

329
00:27:50,760 --> 00:27:52,800
Look at this stroke of luck.

330
00:27:54,840 --> 00:27:56,400
What? That old thing?

331
00:27:57,320 --> 00:28:00,840
Don't say that. It's great.
Look. We've got our seats to...

332
00:28:01,080 --> 00:28:02,240
We have our basket.

333
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:06,640
I just need to unscrew
four bolts and we're good.

334
00:28:09,800 --> 00:28:14,120
Sure, and we can also use
the wheels to make an aircraft carrier.

335
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:18,440
Hang on...

336
00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:22,480
An aircraft carrier...
If we use the wheels? But...

337
00:28:24,360 --> 00:28:26,360
Emma, your idea doesn't work.

338
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:42,160
What are you doing?

339
00:28:42,800 --> 00:28:45,280
Weighing the basket.
15 kilos, 210 grams.

340
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:48,400
- Too heavy.
- We could still change project.

341
00:28:50,040 --> 00:28:54,040
That's not it... The basket's great.
The right size and everything, but...

342
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:55,680
Too much weight.

343
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:59,960
My hamster idea is really good.
And I know where to find one.

344
00:29:00,120 --> 00:29:02,120
We need to keep the weight down.

345
00:29:05,080 --> 00:29:06,560
What, I'm too fat?

346
00:29:07,280 --> 00:29:10,360
Negative. We just need
to cut out the superfluous.

347
00:29:10,520 --> 00:29:12,560
And that's me?

348
00:29:37,800 --> 00:29:39,120
You didn't just do that!

349
00:29:39,280 --> 00:29:42,400
I did the maths, the envelope
in proportion to weight...

350
00:29:42,560 --> 00:29:45,000
What's wrong with you?
What's your problem!?

351
00:29:45,560 --> 00:29:48,760
For a scientist, a centimeter
is a centimeter and a gram...

352
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:55,280
We had to cut out the superfluous.

353
00:29:55,520 --> 00:29:56,520
Then chop off your...

354
00:29:57,520 --> 00:29:59,920
Yes, Luc and Marc...

355
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:04,440
What's her name again?

356
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:07,480
We saw her with Noiret
the other day.

357
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:09,320
Come on.

358
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:11,800
Yes.

359
00:30:12,280 --> 00:30:13,680
Of course.

360
00:30:19,240 --> 00:30:20,480
Hello Dad. Hello Mum.

361
00:30:21,480 --> 00:30:23,560
Hello darling.
Everything all right?

362
00:30:24,440 --> 00:30:27,600
Yes, I was working
on the project for the contest.

363
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:30,600
I'll go and take a look.

364
00:30:58,240 --> 00:30:59,400
I thought so.

365
00:31:02,800 --> 00:31:04,080
Show me.

366
00:31:12,560 --> 00:31:14,000
Why are you late?

367
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:16,440
- Emma, your hair!
- It was Julia.

368
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:19,200
She wants to be a hair stylist.
It looks good, no?

369
00:31:19,800 --> 00:31:22,040
No.
Your beautiful hair.

370
00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:26,480
Emma told me about it.
Sorry, I should have said.

371
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:29,560
I need to know what you're doing.
Is that so hard?

372
00:31:29,880 --> 00:31:32,240
I'm sorry.
Don't be angry.

373
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:36,200
It's for your own good, Emma.

374
00:31:41,800 --> 00:31:44,640
- Tell me if you need help.
- Let's meet tomorrow?

375
00:31:44,800 --> 00:31:46,360
- OK.
- See you tomorrow.

376
00:31:46,560 --> 00:31:48,160
Bye.

377
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:55,880
- Emma, I wanted to tell you that...
- I'm all ears.

378
00:31:58,040 --> 00:31:59,160
I wanted to say...

379
00:31:59,320 --> 00:32:01,040
I unbolted part of the basket.

380
00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:03,920
We don't have
a weight issue anymore!

381
00:32:05,240 --> 00:32:08,720
You've got loads of photos.
Can I see them?

382
00:32:12,120 --> 00:32:14,240
The flowers at the botanical gardens.

383
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:16,800
The school window.

384
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:19,440
Through which you came in.

385
00:32:20,600 --> 00:32:21,960
My bedroom.

386
00:32:22,920 --> 00:32:24,960
That's my mum.

387
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:29,640
- He looks scary, right?
- Who is he?

388
00:32:29,800 --> 00:32:31,880
The warden at the botanical gardens.

389
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:34,000
He's scary, isn't he?

390
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:37,680
You know, no-one has ever
heard his voice.

391
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:39,680
Pam, my best friend.

392
00:32:39,840 --> 00:32:42,840
- And the warden behind her.
- Wait, what's that?

393
00:32:43,240 --> 00:32:44,880
Balloons.

394
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:46,560
How tall is Pam?

395
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:48,920
A bit taller than me.

396
00:32:49,080 --> 00:32:50,680
- Why?
- OK...

397
00:32:51,640 --> 00:32:52,680
- 35mm.
- Jim?

398
00:32:52,840 --> 00:32:54,600
Those balloons are 2 meters high.

399
00:32:55,160 --> 00:32:56,760
They're filled with helium.

400
00:32:56,920 --> 00:32:58,760
Hi Emma, love the new haircut.

401
00:32:58,920 --> 00:33:01,440
- I'm not convinced.
- No, really, it's great.

402
00:33:01,800 --> 00:33:03,400
And how's your project going?

403
00:33:03,560 --> 00:33:06,280
We started after everyone,
but it's going well...

404
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:08,520
You really think you can beat us?

405
00:33:09,160 --> 00:33:12,800
On 11 April 1961, people thought
it was impossible to go into space.

406
00:33:13,160 --> 00:33:15,560
- So what?
- The next day, Yuri Gagarin went.

407
00:33:15,960 --> 00:33:17,200
Who cares about Gagarin?

408
00:33:17,400 --> 00:33:20,040
So, me and my dad
are going to show the idiots...

409
00:33:20,200 --> 00:33:21,200
Idiots?

410
00:33:21,720 --> 00:33:24,760
- Idiots!? Who are the idiots?
- It's a generalization.

411
00:33:25,120 --> 00:33:26,600
Who exactly are the idiots?

412
00:33:26,840 --> 00:33:27,840
I want to know!

413
00:33:32,200 --> 00:33:34,320
No running in the staircase.

414
00:33:36,600 --> 00:33:38,120
What's that racket?

415
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:43,560
Stop it boys.
Stop!

416
00:33:46,600 --> 00:33:47,600
Stop!

417
00:33:50,280 --> 00:33:51,280
Enough!

418
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:53,600
Stop fighting right now!

419
00:33:54,320 --> 00:33:56,960
I abhor fighting in my school.

420
00:33:58,240 --> 00:33:59,520
You again.

421
00:33:59,680 --> 00:34:00,760
Yes, it's always you.

422
00:34:00,920 --> 00:34:02,920
- Miss Novak, what happened?
- He started.

423
00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:04,800
- I don't know, sir.
- You don't know.

424
00:34:05,800 --> 00:34:07,280
Rubbish, he started it!

425
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:10,360
You know what happens now?
You're a loyal customer.

426
00:34:10,840 --> 00:34:12,560
- Kiss and make up.
- Let go of me.

427
00:34:12,720 --> 00:34:15,080
- Kiss and make up, I said.
- Sir, the germs.

428
00:34:15,560 --> 00:34:18,040
You should have
thought about germs before.

429
00:34:18,240 --> 00:34:21,040
One little kiss. Come on.
One kiss. One little one.

430
00:34:21,200 --> 00:34:22,600
- Let me go!
- Never!

431
00:34:22,720 --> 00:34:23,760
Just a little kiss.

432
00:34:23,920 --> 00:34:27,320
There you go.
Peace. Friendship. Kisses.

433
00:34:27,480 --> 00:34:30,640
All that I welcome!
Let's go.

434
00:34:37,640 --> 00:34:38,720
Oops. Sorry.

435
00:34:43,400 --> 00:34:44,480
Here you go.

436
00:34:47,320 --> 00:34:49,840
- There you are.
- Someone here has to work.

437
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:53,680
- Have you see Jim?
- He's hiding behind the console.

438
00:34:56,160 --> 00:34:57,400
Here.

439
00:34:58,840 --> 00:35:00,320
It's going to start soon.

440
00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:02,240
I've got the countdown.

441
00:35:02,720 --> 00:35:04,840
- Everything OK?
- Yep, nothing to report.

442
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:08,160
- And your project for the contest?
- Euh, yes...

443
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:11,040
- Come! It's going to start.
- Hurry up!

444
00:35:11,720 --> 00:35:12,720
Come on.

445
00:35:19,160 --> 00:35:21,000
Starting main reactor.

446
00:35:23,320 --> 00:35:25,200
Five.
Four.

447
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:26,760
Three.

448
00:35:26,840 --> 00:35:28,840
Two. One.

449
00:35:29,360 --> 00:35:32,080
Firing side-thrusters
and lift-off of Challenger

450
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:35,240
for its tenth mission into space!

451
00:35:45,640 --> 00:35:47,640
- It's beautiful.
- Yes.

452
00:35:51,040 --> 00:35:53,440
- It's incredible.
- Beautiful...

453
00:36:08,120 --> 00:36:12,520
- What's that grey thing at the back?
- That's the liquid hydrogen.

454
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:14,160
It propels the shuttle.

455
00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:15,640
Hydrogen?

456
00:36:16,440 --> 00:36:17,440
No.

457
00:36:29,320 --> 00:36:30,600
Dad, what's going on?

458
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:37,680
Dad, what's going on?

459
00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:54,760
There you go.

460
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:58,520
- Sure you don't want to go home?
- No, I'd rather stay here with you.

461
00:36:58,720 --> 00:37:01,360
All right.
I'll try to be quick.

462
00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:24,120
Cosmo, you hear that?

463
00:37:24,640 --> 00:37:26,800
It must be about Dad's space mission.

464
00:37:27,480 --> 00:37:29,880
It's probably top secret.

465
00:37:32,120 --> 00:37:33,640
You're right. We can't...

466
00:37:34,120 --> 00:37:35,200
Not read it.

467
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:45,360
Hello Graham,

468
00:37:47,640 --> 00:37:49,440
Following tonight's catastrophe,

469
00:37:49,840 --> 00:37:53,200
I have also decided
to leave the programme.

470
00:37:54,520 --> 00:37:58,880
David is furious that, like you,
I am also abandoning the mission.

471
00:38:03,360 --> 00:38:06,360
Like you,
I am also abandoning the mission.

472
00:38:06,680 --> 00:38:10,320
He doesn't understand my decision,
just as he couldn't accept yours.

473
00:38:11,120 --> 00:38:13,640
I'm so sorry
that things have ended this way.

474
00:38:14,040 --> 00:38:17,080
Call me if you want to.
Your friend, Felix.

475
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:19,400
Felix...

476
00:38:26,920 --> 00:38:29,000
Felix McCaine, David Boyle

477
00:38:29,360 --> 00:38:31,240
and Graham Gouldman.

478
00:38:42,160 --> 00:38:43,880
I'm done.

479
00:38:44,600 --> 00:38:46,280
How do you feel?

480
00:38:51,320 --> 00:38:53,200
Come here.

481
00:38:58,840 --> 00:39:01,200
You should never have seen that.

482
00:39:02,440 --> 00:39:03,880
It'll be all right.

483
00:39:15,400 --> 00:39:17,080
You're hiding here?

484
00:39:17,400 --> 00:39:20,960
Can't you just be normal?
What's wrong?

485
00:39:21,480 --> 00:39:23,960
My dad dropped out of his mission.

486
00:39:30,160 --> 00:39:32,440
He left months ago.

487
00:39:32,600 --> 00:39:34,840
The observatory
was just a smoke screen.

488
00:39:36,280 --> 00:39:38,000
He didn't tell you anything?

489
00:39:38,360 --> 00:39:42,320
That's why he asked me to keep quiet
when we were at the observatory.

490
00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:47,360
But I'm going to show him
that a Gouldman never gives up.

491
00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:51,400
In fact,
tonight we're getting that helium.

492
00:39:51,560 --> 00:39:54,440
What? The helium
at the botanical gardens?

493
00:39:54,600 --> 00:39:57,720
Exactly!
We'll break in after it closes.

494
00:39:57,880 --> 00:39:59,240
No Jim, it's illegal.

495
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:04,160
The laws of physics
are superior to the laws of men.

496
00:40:04,320 --> 00:40:06,320
Sir Isaac Newton.

497
00:40:09,920 --> 00:40:11,960
If my mum finds out she'll kill me.

498
00:40:12,920 --> 00:40:13,960
For real?

499
00:40:15,200 --> 00:40:16,200
No.

500
00:40:17,120 --> 00:40:19,400
So, what's the problem?

501
00:40:27,080 --> 00:40:28,160
Come on, let's go.

502
00:40:36,120 --> 00:40:38,440
There, the balloons.
The helium must be inside.

503
00:40:39,480 --> 00:40:40,760
This way.

504
00:40:52,120 --> 00:40:54,600
You want to spend a naughty evening?

505
00:40:55,360 --> 00:40:56,720
Here's the number you need...

506
00:41:00,080 --> 00:41:02,040
Impossible from above.

507
00:41:06,240 --> 00:41:09,280
Weird... I was sure
there'd be a way to get...

508
00:41:16,440 --> 00:41:17,880
Are you OK?

509
00:41:19,440 --> 00:41:20,760
Jim.

510
00:41:31,360 --> 00:41:32,440
Wildest dreams...

511
00:41:35,360 --> 00:41:36,360
Come on.

512
00:42:11,040 --> 00:42:12,960
Look, he's there.

513
00:43:40,080 --> 00:43:42,840
- Jim ...Look.
- What?

514
00:43:48,760 --> 00:43:50,800
- We're really doing this!
- You bet.

515
00:44:35,680 --> 00:44:37,800
You know what Charly's doing
for the contest?

516
00:44:38,360 --> 00:44:40,720
- Nope.
- It's a make-up machine.

517
00:44:40,880 --> 00:44:43,280
That's just dumb,
He'll never win with that.

518
00:44:43,760 --> 00:44:47,360
A bit of mascara here,
a lashing of mascara there.

519
00:44:47,520 --> 00:44:50,880
And a bit of cream here,
on forehead, on the cheeks...

520
00:44:51,360 --> 00:44:53,000
Nonsense.
He'll never win.

521
00:44:53,440 --> 00:44:54,760
Hi.

522
00:44:55,600 --> 00:44:57,960
You're still talking to us?

523
00:44:58,400 --> 00:45:00,480
I wanted to see how it was going.

524
00:45:01,280 --> 00:45:02,280
Great colour.

525
00:45:03,360 --> 00:45:04,360
Thanks.

526
00:45:04,920 --> 00:45:07,680
Look, we're bound to win
with our FloppyBook!

527
00:45:08,120 --> 00:45:09,240
What?

528
00:45:09,600 --> 00:45:12,840
He said that we're bound to win
with our FloppyBook!

529
00:45:15,040 --> 00:45:17,840
Are you getting anywhere
with your secret mission?

530
00:45:18,640 --> 00:45:20,040
Yes.

531
00:45:25,400 --> 00:45:28,680
- I can't see anything, it's blurry.
- It's the best I could do.

532
00:45:28,840 --> 00:45:31,440
Nothing. Blurred.
Can you see anything?

533
00:45:31,960 --> 00:45:33,960
- Answer me.
- A little...

534
00:45:34,120 --> 00:45:36,240
No, you can't.
And I can't either.

535
00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:37,920
No-one can. It's useless.

536
00:45:38,480 --> 00:45:39,760
Just bin it.

537
00:45:40,840 --> 00:45:44,480
It takes you ages to get anything,
and when you do, it's rubbish.

538
00:45:48,920 --> 00:45:52,880
You know what? If you're still with us,
sabotage his project.

539
00:45:53,040 --> 00:45:54,280
I don't want trouble.

540
00:45:54,560 --> 00:45:57,840
With your illness,
who will suspect you?

541
00:45:58,960 --> 00:46:00,720
- Where you going?
- That was really low.

542
00:46:01,280 --> 00:46:02,520
- Wait...
- Bye, Emma...

543
00:46:07,360 --> 00:46:09,280
Let's get back to it.

544
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:11,560
Page six
Page six...

545
00:46:21,680 --> 00:46:23,280
Are you sure we'll have enough?

546
00:46:23,720 --> 00:46:27,400
Helium is 700 times more voluminous
as a gas than as a liquid.

547
00:46:27,840 --> 00:46:28,920
Basic chemistry.

548
00:46:29,640 --> 00:46:31,360
I saw Spencer earlier.

549
00:46:31,800 --> 00:46:34,160
- I think he's jealous.
- He's right to be.

550
00:46:34,360 --> 00:46:36,160
Have you seen what we're building?

551
00:46:36,560 --> 00:46:37,560
Look.

552
00:46:37,920 --> 00:46:41,400
If they complete their FloppyBook
it'll be a heavy contender.

553
00:46:41,560 --> 00:46:45,520
And with all this helium,
we'll have the light contender.

554
00:46:48,440 --> 00:46:50,000
You're right,
she's spying on us.

555
00:46:50,560 --> 00:46:52,320
Shut up.
Keep quiet.

556
00:46:53,760 --> 00:46:55,440
Light contender.

557
00:46:56,600 --> 00:46:58,480
What's that?

558
00:47:02,200 --> 00:47:05,000
I bought it last year
with my pocket money.

559
00:47:06,040 --> 00:47:07,920
Can you play something for me?

560
00:47:08,320 --> 00:47:10,280
- Really?
- Yes.

561
00:47:37,840 --> 00:47:40,040
Stop it.
I told you to keep it down.

562
00:47:42,520 --> 00:47:44,320
I'm going to blow them up.

563
00:48:16,920 --> 00:48:21,040
I wanted to go to music academy, but
my mum said it was a waste of time.

564
00:48:21,400 --> 00:48:25,200
Music didn't help us discover
atomic fusion or plate tectonics.

565
00:48:25,360 --> 00:48:27,640
But it's a pretty lovely waste of time.

566
00:48:29,680 --> 00:48:32,960
She thinks I can't handle anything.
She'll never change.

567
00:48:33,320 --> 00:48:36,600
Without change, no butterflies.
That's biology.

568
00:48:39,960 --> 00:48:42,120
My dad says that to me all the time.

569
00:48:47,160 --> 00:48:49,440
I can't believe
he'd lie to me like that.

570
00:48:50,480 --> 00:48:53,240
My mum's the same.
They do it to protect you.

571
00:48:53,400 --> 00:48:56,040
Except that your mum
doesn't lie to you.

572
00:48:56,720 --> 00:48:58,160
Sometimes, I wish she did.

573
00:49:00,240 --> 00:49:01,640
It's there.

574
00:49:09,520 --> 00:49:11,720
Can I ask you something?

575
00:49:14,160 --> 00:49:15,160
Be honest...

576
00:49:15,240 --> 00:49:18,320
What did you think
when the teacher put us together?

577
00:49:18,560 --> 00:49:20,200
I thought of your ephelides.

578
00:49:20,680 --> 00:49:21,960
My what?

579
00:49:22,200 --> 00:49:24,280
Ephelides...
You know, your freckles.

580
00:49:32,720 --> 00:49:33,720
Saïph.

581
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:35,160
Rigel.

582
00:49:35,840 --> 00:49:37,080
Betelgeuse.

583
00:49:37,360 --> 00:49:40,560
Bellatrix. Mintaka. Alnilam.

584
00:49:41,640 --> 00:49:42,640
And Alnitak.

585
00:49:42,960 --> 00:49:46,080
Link them up and you have
the constellation of Orion.

586
00:50:08,120 --> 00:50:09,520
Thanks for all your help.

587
00:50:11,720 --> 00:50:12,720
What's this?

588
00:50:13,320 --> 00:50:16,600
Who says stratospheric flight,
says safe return home.

589
00:50:17,800 --> 00:50:20,040
Cool, some words
I actually understand.

590
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:23,760
Emma! Please concentrate.

591
00:50:24,080 --> 00:50:26,400
We're here to test the parachutes.

592
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:29,240
- It's a catapult.
- Affirmative.

593
00:50:29,600 --> 00:50:34,640
If the parachutes work for my dad,
then they'll work for the two of us.

594
00:50:36,560 --> 00:50:38,040
You know what?

595
00:50:38,520 --> 00:50:39,720
- You go first.
- Me?!

596
00:50:39,880 --> 00:50:42,520
So that I can analyses your trajectory...

597
00:51:06,240 --> 00:51:08,920
- What have you done now?
- You're back already.

598
00:51:09,080 --> 00:51:11,680
I thought it'd be fun
to do something together.

599
00:51:12,280 --> 00:51:15,240
I went shopping, I've got nearly
everything for the tree house.

600
00:51:15,400 --> 00:51:17,000
The tree house observatory.

601
00:51:17,280 --> 00:51:19,040
Great, but I have work to do.

602
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:22,240
Hey, Jim. Look.

603
00:51:24,200 --> 00:51:25,640
I found this.

604
00:51:27,640 --> 00:51:28,640
It's for good luck.

605
00:51:29,400 --> 00:51:32,280
Were you checking
one of Cousteau's theories?

606
00:51:32,840 --> 00:51:33,840
Funny.

607
00:51:35,480 --> 00:51:38,720
- Wasn't for your contest, I hope.
- No.

608
00:51:39,240 --> 00:51:41,200
You never tell me about it anymore.

609
00:51:41,640 --> 00:51:44,560
I want to surprise you.
You like surprises, right?

610
00:51:45,120 --> 00:51:46,240
OK then.

611
00:51:47,360 --> 00:51:48,840
In that case...

612
00:52:13,760 --> 00:52:16,080
- It's closed.
- Are you sure?

613
00:52:16,440 --> 00:52:19,360
Yes! I pulled as hard
as I could, it wouldn't budge.

614
00:52:19,600 --> 00:52:20,600
Are you sure?

615
00:52:22,120 --> 00:52:24,440
Doesn't matter.
Give me a leg up.

616
00:52:29,160 --> 00:52:31,080
Go on, push.

617
00:52:35,840 --> 00:52:37,960
I'm too small, it's slippery.
Push!

618
00:52:39,120 --> 00:52:40,400
Push.

619
00:52:42,040 --> 00:52:43,120
I'm almost there.

620
00:52:46,360 --> 00:52:47,920
Are you OK?

621
00:53:00,240 --> 00:53:02,440
Watch out for mosquitoes.

622
00:53:12,800 --> 00:53:13,800
Where is he?

623
00:54:18,440 --> 00:54:19,640
Jim.
Wake up.

624
00:54:20,320 --> 00:54:22,160
Jim? Are you OK?

625
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:26,400
Jim, wake up!
Are you OK?

626
00:54:38,760 --> 00:54:40,040
What are you doing?

627
00:54:44,560 --> 00:54:45,720
How did you get in?

628
00:54:47,760 --> 00:54:50,480
- You had to pull a little harder.
- What?

629
00:54:50,640 --> 00:54:52,760
What do you mean, pull harder?

630
00:54:53,280 --> 00:54:55,440
Looks pretty impressive, right?

631
00:54:58,920 --> 00:55:00,880
We have FloppyBook.
That's better.

632
00:55:01,040 --> 00:55:03,680
And we're going to win.
Give me that.

633
00:55:06,080 --> 00:55:08,760
Make sure you don't touch anything.

634
00:55:28,960 --> 00:55:30,600
Sorry to drop in like this

635
00:55:30,760 --> 00:55:34,120
but I don't really like
Emma cycling home alone...

636
00:55:36,480 --> 00:55:38,480
No of course, I understand.

637
00:55:39,120 --> 00:55:41,280
As I always say: Safety first.

638
00:55:42,120 --> 00:55:44,880
- Please, make yourself comfortable.
- Thank you.

639
00:55:53,920 --> 00:55:57,520
Don't forget the
children's lieutenant's safety tips.

640
00:55:57,960 --> 00:56:00,160
My tips are the following...

641
00:56:05,920 --> 00:56:08,600
- Here we go.
- Thank you.

642
00:56:10,080 --> 00:56:13,400
- Are you OK?
- Yes, fine.

643
00:56:15,240 --> 00:56:17,440
- Coffee?
- No, thank you.

644
00:56:29,120 --> 00:56:31,160
They're talking. We have time.

645
00:56:31,560 --> 00:56:32,920
It's super cold in space.

646
00:56:33,360 --> 00:56:35,680
Like -60°C at 10,000 meters.

647
00:56:35,840 --> 00:56:38,320
And Kittinger went up
over 30,000 meters!

648
00:56:40,680 --> 00:56:42,600
Do we have to stay much longer?

649
00:56:42,760 --> 00:56:46,240
That's 33 minutes, 16 seconds,
our flight will last about 40 minutes,

650
00:56:46,400 --> 00:56:47,760
so stand-by...

651
00:56:47,920 --> 00:56:50,280
OK, I get it, stand-by.

652
00:56:52,040 --> 00:56:53,960
- Have you seen their project yet?
- No.

653
00:56:54,400 --> 00:56:59,920
I just know they're recreating
Kittinger's 1960's Excelsior project.

654
00:57:01,800 --> 00:57:03,080
It's...

655
00:57:03,720 --> 00:57:04,720
A hot-air balloon.

656
00:57:05,080 --> 00:57:06,920
Well you know more than I do.

657
00:57:07,560 --> 00:57:09,720
To be frank,
I wish I knew a little more.

658
00:57:11,440 --> 00:57:15,440
As Jim says, we'll get the surprise
on the day of the contest.

659
00:57:16,120 --> 00:57:17,960
I'm not very fond of surprises.

660
00:57:18,640 --> 00:57:21,760
But they're big kids now
and I trust Jim.

661
00:57:22,800 --> 00:57:25,200
We've made
so many scale models together...

662
00:57:26,680 --> 00:57:29,640
Hey, what does your mum do?
I never see her.

663
00:57:30,840 --> 00:57:34,120
In two months, how often have
you seen my dad? Twice?

664
00:57:34,280 --> 00:57:37,920
- I told you, they work all the time.
- You're lucky.

665
00:57:41,480 --> 00:57:43,080
I don't want them to find us.

666
00:57:46,360 --> 00:57:49,000
Emma, quiet, they're going to hear us.

667
00:57:50,080 --> 00:57:51,280
Are you OK?

668
00:57:52,120 --> 00:57:54,360
- Emma? Are you OK?
- I'm fine, Jim.

669
00:58:04,280 --> 00:58:06,280
So? What are they doing?

670
00:58:07,960 --> 00:58:10,160
They haven't started yet.

671
00:58:14,600 --> 00:58:16,480
Altitude training?

672
00:58:18,240 --> 00:58:19,240
Check.

673
00:58:19,560 --> 00:58:20,560
Basket?

674
00:58:20,880 --> 00:58:21,880
Emma, stop!

675
00:58:22,560 --> 00:58:24,880
Don't you want the roof open
for the test?

676
00:58:25,040 --> 00:58:27,760
We're only going up one meter
to check it's ready.

677
00:58:31,040 --> 00:58:32,520
- Sure?
- Yep.

678
00:58:32,760 --> 00:58:34,680
Don't worry, it's only
to scare them.

679
00:58:35,120 --> 00:58:36,600
Relax.

680
00:58:39,720 --> 00:58:41,480
Spacesuit, Emma.

681
00:58:43,520 --> 00:58:44,680
OK.
Check.

682
00:58:47,640 --> 00:58:50,760
United States. 21 June 1986,

683
00:58:51,400 --> 00:58:53,640
Pilots Gouldman and Novak...

684
00:59:01,160 --> 00:59:06,080
After a last check of their equipment,
their balloon is ready for a final test

685
00:59:06,240 --> 00:59:08,360
before tomorrow's take-off.

686
00:59:38,800 --> 00:59:40,080
You've lost it!

687
00:59:41,000 --> 00:59:43,480
Was that, ""only to scare them ""?!

688
00:59:44,840 --> 00:59:46,920
Let's go!
Hurry up!

689
00:59:47,920 --> 00:59:49,600
Completely crazy.

690
01:00:13,840 --> 01:00:14,840
Emma?

691
01:00:19,600 --> 01:00:21,800
Emma, are you all right?

692
01:00:50,560 --> 01:00:53,280
Come on, Emma, let's go.
Emma? Look at me.

693
01:00:53,760 --> 01:00:55,320
Are you all right?

694
01:00:56,680 --> 01:00:58,600
Quick.
We have to get out of here.

695
01:02:00,640 --> 01:02:03,840
Inert gases like neon, nitrogen or...

696
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:06,440
helium, in this case,
are not toxic.

697
01:02:07,000 --> 01:02:08,000
Thank God.

698
01:02:09,160 --> 01:02:12,000
So, Emma fainted because
she inhaled smoke?

699
01:02:12,160 --> 01:02:15,280
Her cystic fibrosis
has made her lungs fragile.

700
01:02:15,480 --> 01:02:17,080
I feel much better.

701
01:02:18,680 --> 01:02:22,440
I'd like to keep her under
observation here for a couple of days.

702
01:02:23,360 --> 01:02:25,640
- The contest is tomorrow.
- No more contest, Emma.

703
01:02:25,800 --> 01:02:26,960
That's what happens...

704
01:02:27,120 --> 01:02:28,920
Don't say it's for my own good.

705
01:02:29,080 --> 01:02:32,160
You're not to see him anymore.
You're sick, Emma.

706
01:02:32,520 --> 01:02:34,760
- That's my fault, is it?
- Well, is it mine?

707
01:02:39,520 --> 01:02:43,680
When I see how that boy is raised...
His mother's death is no excuse.

708
01:02:45,120 --> 01:02:46,200
His mum is dead?

709
01:02:47,480 --> 01:02:49,120
Didn't you know?

710
01:02:50,080 --> 01:02:51,960
It just shows he's a liar.

711
01:02:53,760 --> 01:02:55,000
How did you find out?

712
01:02:55,720 --> 01:02:58,960
His dad told me last night.
He told me everything.

713
01:02:59,920 --> 01:03:01,960
He made that balloon
to go and join his mum.

714
01:03:02,640 --> 01:03:04,040
- That boy is crazy.
- Enough...

715
01:03:05,120 --> 01:03:06,600
I'm not crazy!

716
01:03:07,440 --> 01:03:10,480
- Tell her Emma.
- How could you do this to her?

717
01:03:11,600 --> 01:03:14,000
Do you want to die Emma?
Is that it?

718
01:03:14,600 --> 01:03:16,520
- Answer me.
- No.

719
01:03:17,120 --> 01:03:18,760
But I didn't know that...

720
01:03:18,960 --> 01:03:20,600
Go away Jim.

721
01:03:20,960 --> 01:03:22,080
But I didn't know.

722
01:03:23,280 --> 01:03:25,600
- Go away.
- Did you hear?

723
01:03:26,160 --> 01:03:27,200
Leave!

724
01:03:51,760 --> 01:03:53,760
Look who it is!

725
01:03:54,840 --> 01:03:56,680
It's the little shit-stirrer...

726
01:03:57,760 --> 01:03:59,600
Come on, let's go see Emma

727
01:04:00,160 --> 01:04:01,160
Let go of me.

728
01:04:01,320 --> 01:04:04,920
Can't understand a word you say,
your gob always full of sweets.

729
01:04:07,280 --> 01:04:08,280
It's you two?

730
01:04:08,480 --> 01:04:11,520
There were loads
of wrappers behind the barn.

731
01:04:11,720 --> 01:04:12,720
And this...

732
01:04:12,800 --> 01:04:14,040
I never mixed it up.

733
01:04:14,680 --> 01:04:17,480
- It's done now.
- If you're colour-blind maybe.

734
01:04:17,840 --> 01:04:20,120
Who's going to believe
the little shit-stirrer?

735
01:04:20,280 --> 01:04:22,800
Shit-stirrer, me?!
You nearly killed her.

736
01:04:22,960 --> 01:04:26,880
You'd have killed her for sure
with that stupid balloon.

737
01:04:51,920 --> 01:04:54,760
I've just spoken to Emma's mum.
What's going on?

738
01:04:55,360 --> 01:04:56,680
- It's nothing.
- Nothing?

739
01:04:56,840 --> 01:04:59,120
Emma in hospital. A fire.
That's nothing?

740
01:04:59,520 --> 01:05:01,600
- It was sabotage, OK!
- Oh really.

741
01:05:01,760 --> 01:05:04,080
Is making a real hot-air balloon
sabotage too?

742
01:05:04,240 --> 01:05:06,560
- I never said it was a scale model.
- I trusted you.

743
01:05:06,800 --> 01:05:08,680
Taking risks with Emma in her state!

744
01:05:09,360 --> 01:05:10,960
But I didn't know that Emma was ill.

745
01:05:11,120 --> 01:05:14,000
If you'd known,
would it have changed anything?

746
01:05:15,320 --> 01:05:17,160
Jim, stay here.

747
01:06:01,520 --> 01:06:05,640
I get that you're sad and angry
about Emma being in hospital.

748
01:06:05,880 --> 01:06:09,200
- You don't get anything.
- What exactly is your problem then?

749
01:06:13,120 --> 01:06:15,000
That's my problem.

750
01:06:36,800 --> 01:06:38,920
Three years ago...

751
01:06:39,080 --> 01:06:41,160
When your mum died

752
01:06:44,520 --> 01:06:47,840
I could no longer take that risk.
That's all.

753
01:06:50,200 --> 01:06:51,480
So why didn't you tell me?

754
01:06:52,640 --> 01:06:55,400
You keep it all bottled up.
You did the same with Mum.

755
01:06:55,760 --> 01:06:58,200
One day she's here,
the next she's gone, it's over.

756
01:06:58,360 --> 01:07:00,160
I'd told you.
We'd told you!

757
01:07:00,600 --> 01:07:01,600
Lies again!

758
01:07:01,720 --> 01:07:04,120
You knew mum was sick
and that it was serious.

759
01:07:05,720 --> 01:07:08,720
But there are things
you shouldn't have to hear.

760
01:07:15,160 --> 01:07:17,440
I didn't want to see you
suffer any more.

761
01:07:17,600 --> 01:07:19,440
It was already too much.

762
01:07:24,760 --> 01:07:26,200
Look at this.

763
01:07:27,640 --> 01:07:31,440
There are a little under
43 quintillion different positions.

764
01:07:32,120 --> 01:07:35,240
You could cover Earth 270 times
with differently-mixed cubes,

765
01:07:35,400 --> 01:07:36,440
and yet...

766
01:07:36,800 --> 01:07:39,000
There's only one right solution.

767
01:07:39,960 --> 01:07:42,480
Sometimes, I think life is the same.

768
01:07:44,520 --> 01:07:46,680
It's not easy.

769
01:07:47,440 --> 01:07:49,320
We do the best we can.

770
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:54,800
Have fun in your observatory
in this wretched hole.

771
01:07:54,960 --> 01:07:56,680
If that's your right solution!

772
01:07:57,880 --> 01:07:59,800
I dropped out because of you.

773
01:08:01,800 --> 01:08:03,280
We moved here for you.

774
01:08:04,120 --> 01:08:05,320
For a fresh start.

775
01:08:06,360 --> 01:08:08,880
To leave all that shit behind.

776
01:08:28,720 --> 01:08:31,080
Good night, my love.

777
01:08:50,600 --> 01:08:52,440
Right. Go on girl, let's hear it.

778
01:08:52,600 --> 01:08:55,240
I want to know everything
about this guy.

779
01:08:57,160 --> 01:08:58,520
Are you OK?

780
01:08:59,840 --> 01:09:01,480
It's all going to be fine, OK?

781
01:09:01,720 --> 01:09:03,360
I promise.

782
01:09:04,280 --> 01:09:05,680
He's nothing but a liar.

783
01:09:06,280 --> 01:09:09,720
Says she, the high priestess of truth.

784
01:09:11,200 --> 01:09:13,440
You know what?
Let's send him a message.

785
01:09:15,880 --> 01:09:16,880
No.

786
01:09:17,480 --> 01:09:20,120
Pam.
If my parents find out, they'll kill me.

787
01:09:20,280 --> 01:09:22,440
We don't give a shit
about your parents.

788
01:09:22,840 --> 01:09:24,880
Just send him a message.

789
01:09:25,720 --> 01:09:26,760
OK?

790
01:09:37,360 --> 01:09:40,400
Look, I think it's
almost as good as Mum's...

791
01:09:46,320 --> 01:09:48,280
I'm sorry for yesterday.

792
01:10:26,240 --> 01:10:29,040
- Are you Jim?
- Yeah, why?

793
01:10:42,360 --> 01:10:44,760
It's for you.
From my cousin's friend.

794
01:11:10,040 --> 01:11:11,520
Miaplacidus.

795
01:11:12,520 --> 01:11:13,520
Canopus.

796
01:11:13,840 --> 01:11:14,840
Aludra.

797
01:11:18,120 --> 01:11:19,960
Cosmo, those are star names.

798
01:11:25,280 --> 01:11:26,880
So, Miaplacidus...

799
01:11:30,000 --> 01:11:31,000
Miaplacidus.

800
01:11:32,520 --> 01:11:34,000
Aludra.

801
01:11:37,640 --> 01:11:38,760
Canopus.

802
01:11:39,640 --> 01:11:40,640
Murzim.

803
01:11:41,240 --> 01:11:42,400
Athena.

804
01:11:42,880 --> 01:11:43,880
Wasat.

805
01:11:45,000 --> 01:11:46,000
Dubhe.

806
01:11:48,720 --> 01:11:49,720
Wasat.

807
01:11:51,720 --> 01:11:53,040
Chara.

808
01:11:54,080 --> 01:11:55,240
Kurhah.

809
01:11:55,520 --> 01:11:56,680
Sirius.

810
01:11:57,360 --> 01:11:58,840
Asellus.

811
01:12:07,840 --> 01:12:09,640
What is it?

812
01:12:14,880 --> 01:12:16,800
Come on.
Let's get back to work.

813
01:12:53,480 --> 01:12:55,440
The observatory.

814
01:13:28,480 --> 01:13:29,920
Jesus Christ!

815
01:13:54,480 --> 01:13:56,480
Yes, I stole your helium.
So what?

816
01:13:56,640 --> 01:13:58,240
I need more.

817
01:13:58,720 --> 01:14:01,040
It's not funny.
The contest is today!

818
01:14:01,480 --> 01:14:04,080
It's an intergalactic catastrophe.

819
01:14:06,840 --> 01:14:11,080
Months of preparing, only for that
psycho Spencer to mess it all up.

820
01:14:14,280 --> 01:14:16,360
I didn't even see that Emma was sick.

821
01:14:25,080 --> 01:14:27,680
I didn't understand
a word of your story.

822
01:14:28,040 --> 01:14:29,040
Nothing.

823
01:14:29,160 --> 01:14:33,160
But in life, when you fall, you get
off your arse and get back in the fight.

824
01:14:33,800 --> 01:14:35,400
Yeah but...

825
01:14:36,560 --> 01:14:38,720
You think it's
always going to be easy?

826
01:14:44,240 --> 01:14:46,640
So, for the helium?

827
01:14:46,800 --> 01:14:48,840
You think you can spare some more?

828
01:14:50,440 --> 01:14:52,000
You stole my whole stock.

829
01:14:53,160 --> 01:14:54,640
No, not quite.

830
01:14:56,640 --> 01:14:58,200
Go on, get out of here.

831
01:14:58,920 --> 01:15:01,680
But make sure
you apologize to the chick.

832
01:15:26,760 --> 01:15:28,520
Stay here, Cosmo.

833
01:15:52,600 --> 01:15:54,640
Jim!
You came.

834
01:15:56,800 --> 01:15:58,080
Yeah, I'm here.

835
01:15:58,320 --> 01:16:01,240
I told you to stop coming
in through windows.

836
01:16:53,680 --> 01:16:54,680
That's Pam.

837
01:16:54,840 --> 01:16:56,360
You saw polaroid's of her.

838
01:17:02,080 --> 01:17:03,760
What's wrong with her?

839
01:17:04,080 --> 01:17:06,520
Sorry for hiding all this from you.

840
01:17:10,240 --> 01:17:13,120
Is there anything I can do?

841
01:17:28,360 --> 01:17:30,320
A rotating house?

842
01:17:30,560 --> 01:17:33,200
With the sun always
coming through the same window.

843
01:17:33,360 --> 01:17:35,200
As though time was standing still.

844
01:17:36,440 --> 01:17:38,480
It's impossible to stop time, Emma.

845
01:17:38,640 --> 01:17:39,960
It's a basic principle.

846
01:17:40,440 --> 01:17:43,080
If you can't do that,
then get me out of here.

847
01:18:08,480 --> 01:18:10,360
Oh fuck, it's today.

848
01:18:40,800 --> 01:18:43,240
- Spencer...
- We're going to win!

849
01:18:54,720 --> 01:18:56,440
- Mr Flanberg!
- Mr Gouldman.

850
01:18:57,160 --> 01:18:58,560
Have you seen Jim?

851
01:18:59,160 --> 01:19:02,600
I've been looking since this morning.
I can't find him.

852
01:19:03,640 --> 01:19:04,840
He must be here somewhere.

853
01:19:05,000 --> 01:19:07,160
There are more than 200 students...
Look around.

854
01:19:07,320 --> 01:19:09,600
- I think he's disappeared.
- Disappeared?

855
01:19:09,760 --> 01:19:11,600
- From my school?
- Sir, we need you.

856
01:19:13,640 --> 01:19:15,000
How horrendous...

857
01:19:15,920 --> 01:19:17,440
The contest, Mr Gouldman.

858
01:19:17,600 --> 01:19:18,600
The contest...

859
01:19:18,720 --> 01:19:21,320
Let me do this and I'll get back to you.

860
01:19:22,240 --> 01:19:24,920
Everything is under control.
I'll get back to you.

861
01:19:25,440 --> 01:19:27,120
Everything is under control.

862
01:19:31,920 --> 01:19:33,240
I'm ready.

863
01:19:45,520 --> 01:19:48,200
Emma? What are you doing here,
dressed like that?

864
01:19:49,280 --> 01:19:51,440
Emma, stay here.

865
01:20:01,800 --> 01:20:04,360
Oh, it's nothing.
And then?

866
01:20:16,440 --> 01:20:17,840
Kids! Stop!

867
01:20:18,520 --> 01:20:20,320
Move back from the edge.
Emma!

868
01:20:20,640 --> 01:20:21,640
Don't move!

869
01:20:22,480 --> 01:20:24,080
It's over, Jim.

870
01:20:24,960 --> 01:20:25,960
Emma, please, stop.

871
01:20:26,320 --> 01:20:28,440
Step back from the edge!

872
01:20:28,600 --> 01:20:29,720
Trust me.

873
01:20:30,360 --> 01:20:31,400
Stop!

874
01:20:37,280 --> 01:20:39,720
Everything's so calm
when you're not around.

875
01:20:40,600 --> 01:20:41,600
Stay there.

876
01:20:42,440 --> 01:20:43,920
Stop!

877
01:20:47,560 --> 01:20:49,040
Ladies and gentlemen...

878
01:20:49,280 --> 01:20:50,280
Come, come.

879
01:20:50,360 --> 01:20:52,600
The make-up machine!

880
01:20:52,920 --> 01:20:55,680
This make-up machine
will revolutionize beauty!

881
01:20:55,840 --> 01:20:58,360
No more hours wasted
applying make-up in the morning.

882
01:20:58,520 --> 01:21:00,720
Isn't it clever?

883
01:21:00,880 --> 01:21:01,960
Not bad at all.

884
01:21:02,120 --> 01:21:05,920
Unhappy with the result?
Not a problem, wipe it all off.

885
01:21:07,360 --> 01:21:09,880
All made possible
thanks to a tiny barometer

886
01:21:10,040 --> 01:21:11,640
that you can see here below.

887
01:21:11,960 --> 01:21:13,120
If you have questions

888
01:21:13,360 --> 01:21:15,520
now's the time to ask.
Don't hold back!

889
01:21:15,680 --> 01:21:18,920
All that matters is the contest.
We're winning this!

890
01:21:22,280 --> 01:21:23,560
Come closer, come closer...

891
01:21:23,920 --> 01:21:25,600
Don't be shy. Come closer.

892
01:21:26,400 --> 01:21:27,640
That's right, come close.

893
01:21:28,120 --> 01:21:29,640
Welcome to the future:

894
01:21:29,800 --> 01:21:30,800
FloppyBook!

895
01:21:31,400 --> 01:21:32,840
Floppybok...?

896
01:21:33,760 --> 01:21:34,760
Book.

897
01:21:37,400 --> 01:21:39,120
It's connected.

898
01:21:40,960 --> 01:21:43,920
Imagine you've just seen
a great film at the cinema.

899
01:21:44,360 --> 01:21:48,520
You take the ""film"" disk,
and via our FloppyBook platform,

900
01:21:48,680 --> 01:21:51,240
- you add a message.
- What does it do?

901
01:21:51,600 --> 01:21:54,920
Then, when a pupil is wondering
what film to go and see

902
01:21:55,080 --> 01:21:57,480
they can just
look through the ""film"" disk

903
01:21:57,640 --> 01:22:00,200
to see comments
others have left.

904
01:22:00,560 --> 01:22:02,440
Very clever.

905
01:22:03,680 --> 01:22:06,520
A wide range of themes
to cater for every taste.

906
01:22:07,240 --> 01:22:10,960
They're ever so sweet
but this will never take off...

907
01:22:12,160 --> 01:22:14,320
- It's brilliant!
- Bravo.

908
01:22:20,480 --> 01:22:21,480
You're sure?

909
01:22:25,000 --> 01:22:27,280
Oh, you're here are you!
Where are they?

910
01:22:27,720 --> 01:22:29,800
- Answer me!
- What? Who? Jim?

911
01:22:29,960 --> 01:22:30,960
Stop this...

912
01:22:31,040 --> 01:22:34,120
- His kid has kidnapped my daughter.
- Our daughter.

913
01:22:34,440 --> 01:22:37,120
- I've been looking for him all day.
- They're in a barn.

914
01:22:38,240 --> 01:22:41,200
- What barn?
- What's the idiot doing?

915
01:22:41,400 --> 01:22:44,760
- I told you, that boy is deranged.
- Darling, calm down.

916
01:22:44,920 --> 01:22:47,360
I abhor fighting in my school.

917
01:22:47,520 --> 01:22:48,680
Go and find them!

918
01:22:49,480 --> 01:22:52,560
- Where's this barn?
- There's a path over there.

919
01:22:52,760 --> 01:22:56,240
- Show me. Come on.
- Let's go.

920
01:22:56,720 --> 01:22:59,160
Wait for me... Wait.

921
01:23:01,400 --> 01:23:02,400
Damn.

922
01:23:02,800 --> 01:23:05,160
Emma, promise me you won't lose it.

923
01:23:05,560 --> 01:23:06,680
Promise?

924
01:23:06,880 --> 01:23:07,880
I promise.

925
01:23:08,120 --> 01:23:09,200
Promise.

926
01:23:09,400 --> 01:23:10,400
Jim!

927
01:23:13,400 --> 01:23:15,040
Go on, step forward a bit.

928
01:23:16,360 --> 01:23:18,280
OK, you can look now.

929
01:23:20,760 --> 01:23:24,360
- The botanical gardens' balloons?
- Yeah, it's a long story.

930
01:23:24,520 --> 01:23:25,960
I'll tell you later.

931
01:23:39,680 --> 01:23:41,800
- It works!
- Of course...

932
01:23:45,040 --> 01:23:46,200
Shall we get ready.

933
01:23:49,360 --> 01:23:51,600
Jim, it's my hamster.

934
01:23:53,600 --> 01:23:56,680
Apparently, a hamster
will always earn you points.

935
01:24:02,240 --> 01:24:04,240
I'm sorry I didn't tell you.

936
01:24:04,480 --> 01:24:07,120
Why did you lie about your mum?

937
01:24:08,240 --> 01:24:12,200
She was very sick...
and I think I didn't want to see it...

938
01:24:15,920 --> 01:24:18,600
Some things are more difficult
to admit than others.

939
01:24:21,960 --> 01:24:23,560
Emma, are you all right?

940
01:24:25,960 --> 01:24:27,240
I'm all right.

941
01:24:28,280 --> 01:24:30,280
- Are you sure?
- It's all right, Jim.

942
01:24:30,520 --> 01:24:32,000
Emma!

943
01:24:32,560 --> 01:24:34,000
Emma!

944
01:24:36,320 --> 01:24:37,600
Jim!

945
01:24:50,560 --> 01:24:52,720
It's over. They're coming.

946
01:24:55,920 --> 01:24:57,040
Listen Emma,

947
01:24:57,800 --> 01:25:00,200
I think you should go back
to the hospital.

948
01:25:00,400 --> 01:25:02,560
- It's for your own good.
- Jim, don't say that.

949
01:25:02,880 --> 01:25:04,880
- But Emma, you're sick.
- Not you!

950
01:25:06,080 --> 01:25:08,520
It's for your own good, Emma.

951
01:25:12,040 --> 01:25:13,040
OK.

952
01:25:13,360 --> 01:25:14,560
You're right.

953
01:25:14,720 --> 01:25:16,360
It's over.

954
01:25:18,560 --> 01:25:20,480
But kiss me first.

955
01:25:24,880 --> 01:25:25,880
But...

956
01:25:26,000 --> 01:25:27,800
Emma, you're completely crazy!

957
01:25:28,080 --> 01:25:30,560
- Over there... back there.
- Where?

958
01:25:31,880 --> 01:25:32,880
Wait for me.

959
01:25:33,360 --> 01:25:36,560
- And how did you know about this?
- We followed them.

960
01:25:41,800 --> 01:25:44,600
Jesus...
Christ!

961
01:25:47,080 --> 01:25:48,080
Look.

962
01:25:49,520 --> 01:25:50,840
My God! He did it.

963
01:25:51,400 --> 01:25:52,400
Honey.

964
01:25:54,920 --> 01:25:56,000
Jim, look at the barn.

965
01:25:56,400 --> 01:25:57,680
You're completely mental!

966
01:26:03,600 --> 01:26:05,320
I can't believe it, Jim.

967
01:26:09,280 --> 01:26:11,520
Look down, Jim. Look.

968
01:26:13,320 --> 01:26:15,280
We couldn't give up, Jim.

969
01:27:07,240 --> 01:27:08,560
The school... The contest!

970
01:27:09,400 --> 01:27:11,080
Oh yes, the contest...

971
01:27:12,840 --> 01:27:15,480
Let's see if Charlotte's invention
works...

972
01:27:23,040 --> 01:27:25,000
Jim and Emma! Up there!

973
01:27:28,440 --> 01:27:29,480
Look!

974
01:27:30,520 --> 01:27:31,640
Charlotte!

975
01:27:36,960 --> 01:27:39,040
Jim? It feels like
we're rising really fast.

976
01:27:39,440 --> 01:27:40,760
That's normal.

977
01:27:40,920 --> 01:27:43,800
With less air pressure,
the balloons grow.

978
01:27:53,560 --> 01:27:55,720
Don't try telling me
you didn't know.

979
01:28:00,240 --> 01:28:02,480
Apart from trusting them,
what can we do?

980
01:28:02,640 --> 01:28:04,400
Your famous theory.

981
01:28:05,200 --> 01:28:06,520
Look at the result.

982
01:28:06,960 --> 01:28:09,800
Without your son,
Emma would never have done this.

983
01:28:09,960 --> 01:28:11,360
Shut up!

984
01:28:13,400 --> 01:28:16,280
It's your fault if she's up there.
You suffocate her.

985
01:28:21,920 --> 01:28:23,320
But she's sick.

986
01:28:24,520 --> 01:28:26,800
- She can't take it anymore.
- Quiet.

987
01:28:28,720 --> 01:28:30,000
I can hear something.

988
01:28:30,680 --> 01:28:32,160
It's coming from here.

989
01:28:33,240 --> 01:28:34,840
It's broken.
That's for sure.

990
01:28:35,280 --> 01:28:37,480
- It's bound to be.
- You know how it works?

991
01:28:37,720 --> 01:28:38,720
It's mine.

992
01:28:39,080 --> 01:28:40,080
Wait. Don't move.

993
01:28:42,160 --> 01:28:43,520
It won't work.

994
01:28:48,240 --> 01:28:49,440
Graham for Jim.

995
01:28:57,240 --> 01:29:00,240
I was wondering...
Why did you kiss me?

996
01:29:00,880 --> 01:29:03,800
- Had you never kissed a girl?
- Why would I?

997
01:29:09,240 --> 01:29:11,080
I can hear them.

998
01:29:24,840 --> 01:29:26,320
Emma, the altimeter.

999
01:29:26,880 --> 01:29:28,480
Emma, we have to go back.

1000
01:29:30,040 --> 01:29:31,400
Come on.

1001
01:29:32,480 --> 01:29:33,600
I'm OK, I'll check yours.

1002
01:29:35,120 --> 01:29:36,120
OK.

1003
01:29:37,440 --> 01:29:38,440
That's good.

1004
01:29:39,680 --> 01:29:42,120
- Jim. I'm staying up here.
- What?

1005
01:29:42,880 --> 01:29:44,560
I'm staying here, Jim.

1006
01:29:45,400 --> 01:29:47,600
Don't be scared.
It's easy, you'll see.

1007
01:29:48,120 --> 01:29:50,000
I'm not scared up here.

1008
01:29:50,840 --> 01:29:53,120
I can't abandon you.

1009
01:29:54,640 --> 01:29:57,800
If you don't want to lose me,
leave me here.

1010
01:29:59,240 --> 01:30:00,240
Jim?

1011
01:30:00,400 --> 01:30:04,400
- Please, Jim, make her come down.
- He's trying, can't you see?

1012
01:30:06,080 --> 01:30:07,800
I don't want anything
to happen to you.

1013
01:30:08,320 --> 01:30:10,600
Something did happen to me.
Thanks to you.

1014
01:30:10,760 --> 01:30:12,480
My freedom.

1015
01:30:15,960 --> 01:30:19,040
Everybody just sees me as fragile.

1016
01:30:19,600 --> 01:30:21,240
You never saw me like that.

1017
01:30:21,920 --> 01:30:24,120
- I don't understand.
- I know.

1018
01:30:27,800 --> 01:30:30,120
Just this once,
I want people to listen to me.

1019
01:30:30,280 --> 01:30:32,920
Just this once,
I want to make my own decision.

1020
01:30:33,120 --> 01:30:34,120
Just this once.

1021
01:30:49,600 --> 01:30:52,080
With the hope
of seeing his family again,

1022
01:30:52,320 --> 01:30:55,280
Jim Gouldman puts his life
in God's hands.

1023
01:30:58,040 --> 01:30:59,680
He dives into the void.

1024
01:31:09,720 --> 01:31:10,880
Over and out

1025
01:31:11,680 --> 01:31:13,160
Spaceboy.

1026
01:31:23,200 --> 01:31:25,440
- Look.
- Oh, Jim...

1027
01:31:57,840 --> 01:31:58,840
Jim, it's me!

1028
01:31:59,320 --> 01:32:00,680
Dad!

1029
01:32:06,720 --> 01:32:07,720
I'm here.

1030
01:32:07,840 --> 01:32:08,840
Are you OK?

1031
01:32:10,480 --> 01:32:11,480
I'm sorry.

1032
01:32:11,720 --> 01:32:13,760
I shouldn't have hidden
the truth from you.

1033
01:32:14,520 --> 01:32:15,920
Are you OK?

1034
01:32:16,560 --> 01:32:20,120
- How did you find me?
- We found your talkie in the barn.

1035
01:32:20,720 --> 01:32:23,000
We could hear you,
but we couldn't talk to you.

1036
01:32:23,160 --> 01:32:24,720
Perfect.
Take me there.

1037
01:33:05,960 --> 01:33:07,800
Jim and his dad are coming.

1038
01:34:03,320 --> 01:34:04,920
It's him, arrest him!

1039
01:34:37,160 --> 01:34:38,640
It's not working.

1040
01:34:38,920 --> 01:34:39,920
We tried.

1041
01:34:46,000 --> 01:34:48,040
Now, it's going to work.
Emma?

1042
01:34:50,200 --> 01:34:51,680
Jim, is that you?

1043
01:34:52,200 --> 01:34:54,600
- Can you hear me?
- Yes. I'm down here.

1044
01:34:54,880 --> 01:34:56,920
Your mum wants to tell you something.

1045
01:34:58,640 --> 01:35:01,080
Emma?
Emma, it's Mum.

1046
01:35:01,520 --> 01:35:05,360
I'm so sorry, my darling.
I was trying to protect you...

1047
01:35:05,520 --> 01:35:07,960
Because I love you.
Daddy and I love you so much.

1048
01:35:08,560 --> 01:35:10,840
If you knew Emma...
Please forgive me.

1049
01:35:11,000 --> 01:35:13,840
Come down please,
I beg you, come back.

1050
01:35:23,840 --> 01:35:25,400
Dad was right.

1051
01:35:27,960 --> 01:35:30,280
Everything looks smaller
from a distance.

1052
01:35:30,440 --> 01:35:32,120
Forgive me too, Mum.

1053
01:35:32,360 --> 01:35:33,640
I'm sorry.

1054
01:35:36,320 --> 01:35:38,880
And it's not just mathematical.

1055
01:35:49,960 --> 01:35:53,360
And you and Mum
really did all that together?

1056
01:35:54,560 --> 01:35:57,960
Einstein says you can live
as if nothing is a miracle

1057
01:35:58,520 --> 01:36:00,960
or as if everything is a miracle.

1058
01:36:03,320 --> 01:36:05,600
I miss Mummy, Dad.

1059
01:36:06,520 --> 01:36:08,040
Me too, my angel.

1060
01:36:09,240 --> 01:36:10,360
Me too.

1061
01:36:15,360 --> 01:36:16,480
There... A shooting star.

1062
01:36:16,640 --> 01:36:18,120
It's just gone past.

1063
01:36:18,440 --> 01:36:20,720
I didn't see it.
Neither did Cosmo.

1064
01:36:20,880 --> 01:36:23,560
Look how sad he looks...

1065
01:36:23,680 --> 01:36:29,480

Brian Cox: Seven Days on Mars,https://yts-subs.com/movie-imdb/tt19857396,https://yts-subs.com/subtitles/brian-cox-seven-days-on-mars-2022-english-yify-481752,"﻿1
00:00:10,760 --> 00:00:13,840
Right now, that rover, Perseverance,

2
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:17,960
is 200 million miles away,
on the surface of Mars.

3
00:00:17,960 --> 00:00:21,840
It's on the floor of Jezero Crater,
and it's taking the images

4
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:24,240
and collecting the samples
that might tell us

5
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:27,360
whether life ever existed
on the Red Planet.

6
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:40,280
Jezero Crater is one of the most
important and enigmatic sites

7
00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:41,720
in the solar system.

8
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:45,800
Around 3.8 billion years ago

9
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:47,680
it was filled with a lake.

10
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:53,320
But that lake is long gone.

11
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:56,120
Mars has become
a dry and barren world.

12
00:01:02,360 --> 00:01:06,840
Today, Perseverance
and the Ingenuity helicopter

13
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:09,680
are searching the crater
for signs of the life

14
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:11,440
that may once have lived there.

15
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:17,160
What they find could transform our
understanding of life -

16
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:20,680
on Earth and throughout
the universe.

17
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:26,240
It is certainly the most
audacious mission

18
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:29,320
ever sent to the surface
of another world.

19
00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:32,200
TDL, this is mission.
I have you five by five. How read?

20
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:34,000
I have you five by, as well.

21
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,120
This is a crucial
seven days for the rover...

22
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:42,880
..and I've been given extraordinary
access to the Perseverance mission.

23
00:01:46,160 --> 00:01:49,680
I'll be following the rover's
every move

24
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:53,920
as it attempts to travel further
and faster than ever before.

25
00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:59,080
Through its cameras,

26
00:01:59,080 --> 00:02:02,120
we'll show you what it's like
to stand on...

27
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:06,440
..and explore the surface
of another world.

28
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:16,680
This week, we'll see the Red Planet

29
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:18,840
as no-one has seen it before.

30
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:54,680
This is Nasa's
Jet Propulsion Laboratory,

31
00:02:54,680 --> 00:03:00,440
4,800 Oak Grove Drive,
Pasadena, California.

32
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:09,800
From the 1960s onwards,
it's been the control centre

33
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:13,720
for Nasa's pioneering
deep space missions,

34
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:17,120
and now it's the headquarters
for the hundreds of scientists

35
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:19,640
and engineers who make
up the Perseverance team.

36
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:27,120
JPL is a really special place for me
because, way back in 1980,

37
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:29,440
I wrote to them because
I was interested

38
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:33,160
in the exploration of the planets,
and they wrote back!

39
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:34,280
And this is it.

40
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:37,200
Imagine the excitement
when this brown envelope arrived

41
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:40,880
from California, filled with images
of the solar system,

42
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:44,720
the moons of Jupiter,
and the rings of Saturn.

43
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:49,080
This is one of the reasons
I became a physicist.

44
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:51,920
Well, now, 40 years later,

45
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:55,920
I'm actually at JPL
because, as I speak,

46
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:59,760
there is a rover roving
across the Martian surface -

47
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:04,680
the first mission dedicated
to the search for life on Mars.

48
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:06,920
And this week,
we have unique access,

49
00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:08,400
not only to Mission Control,

50
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:11,600
but also to the navigators who are
plotting the path

51
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:14,600
of Perseverance around the boulders

52
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:17,040
and the mountains of Mars.

53
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:19,440
And we're also going to see
the photographs,

54
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:21,160
the data come down in real time.

55
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:23,880
We're going to learn things
about Mars that nobody

56
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:25,640
has ever known before.

57
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:28,320
Can't wait.

58
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:36,640
Just over a year ago,
the world held its breath

59
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:38,560
as the Perseverance rover...

60
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:43,600
..the flagship of
the Mars 2020 mission,

61
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:45,880
made its final approach
towards Mars.

62
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:49,880
After seven years of development

63
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:51,880
and a six-month journey,

64
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:55,520
no-one knew if
the 2.7 billion dollar rover

65
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:57,960
would make it safely
onto the surface.

66
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:13,200
Since then, Perseverance
has been exploring the area

67
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:16,800
around its landing site
in Jezero Crater,

68
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:19,960
sending back
the most extraordinary images.

69
00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:33,080
With the exception of
the occasional animation,

70
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:35,480
every image of Mars
in this programme

71
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:38,720
has been captured by the cameras
on Perseverance,

72
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:41,320
or the other spacecraft around Mars.

73
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:52,600
Perseverance's mission is to search
for signs of long-extinct life.

74
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:55,960
What it discovers

75
00:05:55,960 --> 00:05:58,960
could answer one of the great
existential questions...

76
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:04,560
..are we alone in the universe?

77
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:19,480
This is JPL's Space Flight
Operations Facility

78
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:22,720
or, better, Mission Control.

79
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:28,200
And this room is iconic for anyone
that's into space flight,

80
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:31,880
because this is the room
in which all those dramatic moments

81
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:34,160
that we all remember happened.

82
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:36,680
The dive of Cassini
into Saturn,

83
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:38,680
the landing of Curiosity,

84
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:40,720
and Perseverance on Mars.

85
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:43,400
They're talking now to
the solar system,

86
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:45,240
anything that's out there.

87
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:49,640
This is where all the data comes
down from the Perseverance Rover.

88
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:58,680
TDL, this is five by,
I have you five by.

89
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:00,280
I have you five by, as well.

90
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:05,400
This morning, the crew
in Mission Control are waiting

91
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:07,560
to hear from Perseverance,

92
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:12,560
which is currently 200 million miles
away on the surface of Mars.

93
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:18,360
To find out how communication works
across such vast distances,

94
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:21,040
I've come to see Rick Welch.

95
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:24,040
So this room, sometimes, we call
the centre of the universe.

96
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:26,200
This is where all the data comes
to this facility

97
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:28,240
from all our spacecraft out
in the solar system.

98
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:30,720
So you can see up on the
screen the different antenna.

99
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:33,440
We actually have antennas at three
locations around the Earth,

100
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:36,120
which allow us to really look out
and see spacecraft, no matter

101
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:37,840
what planet they happen to be at.

102
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:38,920
How does that work?

103
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:41,840
Because Mars is... What is it?
About 200 million miles away,

104
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:43,560
give or take, at the moment.

105
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:48,120
Right now, as you said, we're about
300 million kilometres away,

106
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:50,720
and it's probably about 16 minutes
to get our signal

107
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:52,000
all the way to Mars, one way.

108
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,440
So compare that to the moon.
It only takes a couple of seconds

109
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:56,320
for a signal to get back and forth
to the moon.

110
00:07:56,320 --> 00:07:57,880
So even when we had
astronauts there,

111
00:07:57,880 --> 00:08:00,200
it seemed like we could talk back
and forth in real time.

112
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:02,560
You know, 16 minutes is really
too long to do any kind

113
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:04,200
of real-time communication.

114
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:08,760
This delay in communication
between Earth and Mars

115
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:12,320
determines so much of how
the mission operates.

116
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:16,040
Because the team are unable
to control the rover in real time,

117
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:19,080
they must compile detailed sets
of instructions to send

118
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:21,120
to Perseverance every day.

119
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:24,600
So the scientists and engineers
here on Earth

120
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:27,640
spend about eight hours deciding
the next things for the rover to do,

121
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:31,000
and building the commands. We then
send that up in the Martian morning.

122
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,440
The rover is on its own to execute
those the best it can.

123
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:35,440
And then we hear back in
the Martian afternoon

124
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:36,880
what actually happened on Mars.

125
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:40,080
Oh, so that says,
""Next UHF two hours.""

126
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:42,280
So is that... is that what that
means? That's right.

127
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:44,840
So we're very interested
in getting our downlink today to see

128
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:45,960
how the rover is doing.

129
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:49,400
And that will be arriving
here in about two hours.

130
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:53,240
While the crew in
Mission Control wait...

131
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:56,960
..Perseverance is uploading its
latest data

132
00:08:56,960 --> 00:08:59,640
to one of several spacecraft
in orbit around Mars.

133
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:06,760
That spacecraft will relay the data
back to Earth in two hours' time...

134
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:15,560
..which gives me time to explore
the JPL campus.

135
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:25,960
JPL is set in a beautiful location
in the mountains around Pasadena.

136
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:28,400
It's about ten miles
from Los Angeles.

137
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:30,680
And there's a reason that it's here,

138
00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:34,480
isolated, because it began life
as a rocket test facility.

139
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:37,160
And the thing about rockets
when you're testing them,

140
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:38,800
is that sometimes they explode.

141
00:09:40,040 --> 00:09:44,440
But in the 1950s, this became
the centre of America's exploration

142
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:48,280
of the solar system and beyond,
and the first American satellite,

143
00:09:48,280 --> 00:09:51,760
Explorer 1, was built
and controlled from here,

144
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:54,400
as were all those things
I grew up with -

145
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:59,200
Voyager, Cassini, and now,
the latest, Perseverance.

146
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:03,520
And in here, in the Mars yard,
we're going to meet its twin.

147
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:21,680
This is Optimism.

148
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:24,440
Engineers like their acronyms,
so that actually stands

149
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:29,240
for Operational Perseverance Twin
with the Integration of Mechanisms

150
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:31,360
and Instruments Sent to Mars.

151
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:37,680
But it is, in every important
way, an exact engineering replica

152
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:39,640
of Perseverance.

153
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:41,480
There are a few things missing.

154
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:44,360
For instance, on Earth, it's not
safe for the rover to be powered

155
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:49,240
by nuclear battery, so instead
it's plugged into the mains.

156
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:51,880
But, for example, it has exactly
the same

157
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:53,720
flight computers as Perseverance.

158
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:57,640
So if they want to upload
new software, then they upload

159
00:10:57,640 --> 00:11:01,200
it to that first, and test it
to make sure it works.

160
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:05,400
And it's quite an imposing
thing, isn't it?

161
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:07,640
It's bigger than I thought.

162
00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:18,520
Weighing over a ton on Earth, and
standing just over two metres tall,

163
00:11:18,520 --> 00:11:20,040
the rover is a beast.

164
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:25,560
And it's packed with instruments
designed to scrutinise

165
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:27,000
the Martian surface.

166
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:32,840
Among them are 19 cameras,
more than any other spacecraft.

167
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:38,320
Five are mounted at the top of
the mast

168
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:41,360
to give a human-like
eye-level view

169
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:43,200
of the Martian landscape.

170
00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:49,880
Lower down, cameras focus
on the area in front of the rover...

171
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:56,720
..where the robot arm is deployed
to study and sample the surface,

172
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:58,600
looking for signs of life.

173
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:05,320
In just over a year, the rover's
cameras have sent

174
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:08,040
over 200,000 images back to Earth.

175
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:29,280
This morning, the latest batch
of photos

176
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:32,920
are just about to arrive at JPL...

177
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:35,920
..and I'm going to look at them
with the leader of the science team,

178
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:37,800
Ken Farley.

179
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:43,120
So here we have one of the images
that just came down from Mars today,

180
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:46,960
and it's a great landscape looking
off to the north and east

181
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:48,120
in Jezero Crater.

182
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:52,800
Yeah. And do you still get excited
by the idea that nobody's ever seen

183
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:56,240
this planet from this angle before?
It's completely new data.

184
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:58,160
How could you not?
I mean, this is just...

185
00:12:58,160 --> 00:13:02,240
I love it. This is... Every day,
to be able to take in a landscape

186
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:05,680
like this and be surprised
by things that we see.

187
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:08,560
Still exciting to see it every day.

188
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:12,880
Can you describe what we're seeing
in this image? In the foreground,

189
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:16,960
you see the area that we've been
exploring for most of the last year.

190
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:18,520
That's the crater floor.

191
00:13:18,520 --> 00:13:22,120
And then the thing that just
captures everybody's attention,

192
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:23,560
including mine, is the delta.

193
00:13:23,560 --> 00:13:26,680
And the delta is very distinctive
and it's got a flat top.

194
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:28,720
You can see the flat top
on the left side. Yeah.

195
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:30,760
That's about 40 metres high.

196
00:13:32,680 --> 00:13:37,280
The delta is the most important
feature in Jezero Crater,

197
00:13:37,280 --> 00:13:40,680
and it's the reason Perseverance
was sent here.

198
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:46,360
It was formed at the mouth
of a river that flowed into the lake

199
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:48,400
that once filled the crater.

200
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:52,240
The delta's layers of
sedimentary rock

201
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:54,800
are thought to be the most likely
place to find evidence

202
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:57,760
of the life that may once
have lived on Mars.

203
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:03,280
And it's where the rover
is headed to next.

204
00:14:03,280 --> 00:14:06,480
We are just about to embark
on about a five-kilometre drive

205
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:09,600
to get to the Delta. We would love
to just go straight there.

206
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:12,160
It's only about two kilometres,
two and a half kilometres

207
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:15,200
as the crow flies. But there are
boulders in the foreground

208
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:18,400
and, in the middle distance, that
you can't easily see in this image,

209
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:20,960
there are sand dunes, so we have to
go all the way around

210
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:22,240
to get there.

211
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:23,480
You don't want to get stuck.

212
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:26,960
We absolutely do not want
to get stuck. That would be bad.

213
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:41,280
Well, we've arrived at an extremely
exciting time

214
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:43,000
for Perseverance on Mars.

215
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:46,400
For the last year, it's been
exploring this region around here,

216
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:49,440
but now it's going to set
off to its primary target,

217
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:52,160
here in the ancient river delta.

218
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:55,760
Now, it can't, or they don't want
to, take the direct route,

219
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:58,320
because that would be through
this rocky dune field.

220
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:01,720
It would take a long time, might
even be dangerous for the rover.

221
00:15:01,720 --> 00:15:04,720
And so what will be happening this
week is it's going to head off

222
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:07,800
about, hopefully, 200 or 300 metres
a day

223
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:09,760
driving in this direction.

224
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:11,480
And then, by the end of the week -

225
00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:13,600
I really am looking forward
to this -

226
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:17,440
it's going to thread its way,
we think, around the side

227
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:21,480
of this crater. It looks quite nasty
from the air, but they say

228
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:23,040
that it's certainly passable.

229
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:27,560
And so, if we're lucky, then
Perseverance will be around here,

230
00:15:27,560 --> 00:15:30,120
at the end of our week here at JPL.

231
00:15:35,160 --> 00:15:39,160
Over the next week, I'll follow
the rover's every move as it starts

232
00:15:39,160 --> 00:15:41,640
the most important drive
of its mission so far.

233
00:15:44,280 --> 00:15:46,280
To cover the 1,200 metres

234
00:15:46,280 --> 00:15:49,320
to La Orotava crater in just
seven days,

235
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:54,280
the rover will need to break
all distance and driving records.

236
00:15:54,280 --> 00:15:58,560
No rover has gone so far
across the surface of another planet

237
00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:00,480
in such a short space of time.

238
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:07,320
We're hoping that journey will
start today,

239
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:09,120
but first we need to be sure

240
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:12,040
the rover is ready to move on.

241
00:16:12,040 --> 00:16:13,360
This is where it happens.

242
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:16,360
So Rick is taking me to the daily
briefing meeting,

243
00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:18,280
on the rover operations floor.

244
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:21,680
Coming in to
the Perseverance Operation Facility,

245
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:24,040
we have this great selfie
of the rover,

246
00:16:24,040 --> 00:16:25,760
which is awesome to see.

247
00:16:27,160 --> 00:16:28,640
And this picture is actually taken

248
00:16:28,640 --> 00:16:30,440
with a camera at the end
of the robotic arm.

249
00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:33,720
So if you were the rover, it's
taking over 50 different pictures

250
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:35,880
to actually build this mosaic.

251
00:16:37,520 --> 00:16:40,480
I remember one of your engineers
actually saying that it behaved

252
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:42,120
like one of his teenagers would,

253
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:45,240
because it landed and the first
thing it did was take a selfie.

254
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:46,840
Exactly. Exactly.

255
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:59,800
This maze of rooms is the beating
heart of the mission.

256
00:16:59,800 --> 00:17:03,600
It's usually strictly off-limits
to outsiders,

257
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:07,160
but today I've been given special
clearance to join the team inside.

258
00:17:09,120 --> 00:17:11,280
So this is one of our big
operations room.

259
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:13,840
We call this the
Mission Support Area or MSA.

260
00:17:13,840 --> 00:17:16,240
And this is where our data comes.

261
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:25,880
Our tactical downlink lead
today is Keith.

262
00:17:32,680 --> 00:17:35,280
He's actually checking
in with all the team members,

263
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:37,440
all our engineering and
science members to make sure

264
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:38,480
they can hear him.

265
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:45,560
This is the team's chance to check
on the status of the rover,

266
00:17:45,560 --> 00:17:49,240
and this morning it seems
all is not well.

267
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:02,840
Occasionally, we do need to say,
we see some issue with this system.

268
00:18:02,840 --> 00:18:05,440
And so let's preclude use
of that for tomorrow,

269
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:07,480
until we have more time
to look at it.

270
00:18:07,480 --> 00:18:09,960
Yeah, I think he said, didn't he,
that the drill had paused.

271
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:12,200
Monday, we'll be looking...

272
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:15,520
Before it's even started
its record-breaking drive,

273
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:19,360
the rover is facing a problem
that could delay its progress.

274
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:21,040
And it stems from this.

275
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:26,280
The last task in its investigation
of the crater floor was to take

276
00:18:26,280 --> 00:18:28,360
a rock sample from this boulder,

277
00:18:28,360 --> 00:18:30,400
informally known as Sid.

278
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:37,000
So what have we got?

279
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,240
This is a very interesting image,

280
00:18:39,240 --> 00:18:42,880
because we are trying to take
a core sample of this rock.

281
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:45,800
And the rock was too hard

282
00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:47,880
and the coring faulted.

283
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:50,920
It stopped with the drill
still stuck in the rocks.

284
00:18:50,920 --> 00:18:52,320
It's not supposed to be like that.

285
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:54,560
I suppose you don't want to break
a drill bit, right?

286
00:18:54,560 --> 00:18:57,320
That's exactly right. If the rock is
too hard,

287
00:18:57,320 --> 00:18:59,200
you start to dull the drill bit,

288
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:02,440
and we have a small number of drill
bits and once they're all dull,

289
00:19:02,440 --> 00:19:04,440
we're not going to be collecting
any more rocks.

290
00:19:04,440 --> 00:19:07,240
So we are very careful not
to push the drill too hard.

291
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:11,840
And while the drill is stuck
in the rock,

292
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:13,840
the rover can't go anywhere.

293
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:17,320
This is what it's like on
a rover mission.

294
00:19:17,320 --> 00:19:19,840
Every day, there's something
new that you have to deal with.

295
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:22,120
So what do you do?
We're asking for a core

296
00:19:22,120 --> 00:19:24,560
that was about six centimetres long,

297
00:19:24,560 --> 00:19:27,600
and we know it got to five
centimetres before it faulted.

298
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:29,720
So five centimetres - good enough.

299
00:19:29,720 --> 00:19:31,920
So you don't care about
the extra centimetre.

300
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:33,680
You just want to get that core...
Right.

301
00:19:33,680 --> 00:19:37,000
We've decided that the best thing
to do was to simply snap

302
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,840
off this core from the rock,

303
00:19:38,840 --> 00:19:41,760
and ingest it into the rover
and seal it.

304
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:49,120
As our first day at JPL ends,
the instructions telling the rover

305
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:52,480
to break off the sample
and withdraw the drill,

306
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:56,280
are sent to the Deep Space Network,
and onwards to Mars.

307
00:19:57,880 --> 00:20:01,680
We won't know if it's been a success
until we return.

308
00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:17,560
Our fascination with Mars
is nothing new.

309
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:26,720
We know now that, in the early years
of the 20th century, this world

310
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:31,040
was being watched closely
by intelligences greater than man's.

311
00:20:38,040 --> 00:20:41,160
Stories of Martian visitors
were once a staple

312
00:20:41,160 --> 00:20:42,640
of cinema and radio.

313
00:20:43,880 --> 00:20:47,360
And at the time, those stories
didn't seem as far-fetched

314
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:48,600
as they do today.

315
00:20:51,680 --> 00:20:56,560
Intellects vast cool
and unsympathetic,

316
00:20:56,560 --> 00:21:00,640
regarded this Earth
with envious eyes,

317
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:03,400
and slowly and surely
drew their plans against us.

318
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:11,240
It's hard to believe today,
but a century ago - actually,

319
00:21:11,240 --> 00:21:15,040
as recently as the 1930s -
it was perfectly respectable

320
00:21:15,040 --> 00:21:18,560
to imagine that there was
a civilisation on Mars.

321
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:25,760
Gee-whiz.

322
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:30,480
Invaders from Mars,
weird, fantastic beings

323
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:34,280
of a superintelligence, ruling
a race of synthetic humans

324
00:21:34,280 --> 00:21:38,160
and pitting them against mankind's
dream to conquer the universe.

325
00:21:39,720 --> 00:21:44,720
They were beings as intelligent
or even more intelligent than us,

326
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:47,040
staring down at Earth.

327
00:21:47,040 --> 00:21:50,280
This could be the beginning
of the end for the human race.

328
00:21:50,280 --> 00:21:53,400
For what men first thought were
meteors, or the often-ridiculed

329
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:57,480
flying saucers are, in reality,
the flaming vanguard

330
00:21:57,480 --> 00:21:59,360
of the invasion from Mars.

331
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:05,320
Even into the 1950s, it was
reasonable to think that Mars

332
00:22:05,320 --> 00:22:07,040
was covered in vegetation.

333
00:22:07,040 --> 00:22:11,240
And the reason is that until
the space age,

334
00:22:11,240 --> 00:22:15,360
this was the best
photograph we had of Mars.

335
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:18,480
This is from the 100-inch
telescope at Mount Wilson.

336
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:22,120
And these dark markings
on the surface, which move around,

337
00:22:22,120 --> 00:22:26,120
actually, or appear to, as the
months pass and the seasons change,

338
00:22:26,120 --> 00:22:29,080
look for all the world
like vegetation.

339
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:36,280
This is a book written by the great
Patrick Moore in the 1950s.

340
00:22:36,280 --> 00:22:38,600
It's titled A Guide to Mars.

341
00:22:38,600 --> 00:22:40,720
And in the chapter called
Life on Mars,

342
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:43,000
Patrick Moore writes this,

343
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:47,720
""To sum up, there is no reason
to suppose that low forms

344
00:22:47,720 --> 00:22:50,600
""of vegetation may not exist
on Mars,

345
00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:54,760
""whilst there is a great deal
of evidence that they do.""

346
00:22:58,280 --> 00:23:01,360
But that changed with the dawn
of the space age.

347
00:23:09,040 --> 00:23:13,880
In November 1964, Nasa launched
Mariner 4 towards Mars...

348
00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:21,240
..on a mission to return the first
close-up images of the planet.

349
00:23:21,240 --> 00:23:24,240
The spacecraft is flying
toward Mars, about to pass

350
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:26,640
within 6,000 miles of its surface.

351
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:32,640
Back at JPL, they waited anxiously
as the data trickled in.

352
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:37,720
This would be the first
time we'd seen the surface

353
00:23:37,720 --> 00:23:42,720
of another planet and, potentially,
signs of extraterrestrial life.

354
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:53,240
But all that emerged
was a barren, crater-scarred world,

355
00:23:53,240 --> 00:23:57,200
with no sign of life
and certainly no Martians.

356
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:13,120
On August 20th 1975, the first
Viking spaceship was launched.

357
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:21,720
Subsequent missions revealed
the planet

358
00:24:21,720 --> 00:24:24,320
in greater and greater detail,

359
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:26,720
hinting at a very different past.

360
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:33,200
By the mid-1970s, the Viking
missions had discovered

361
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:36,720
great river valleys, proof that
large amounts of water

362
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:38,720
had flowed across
the Martian surface.

363
00:24:44,120 --> 00:24:47,000
To investigate that history
of water,

364
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:50,600
a string of rovers were sent
to explore the surface.

365
00:24:50,600 --> 00:24:55,240
They discovered a very different
world to the Mars we see today.

366
00:24:56,440 --> 00:24:58,840
There was evidence that,
in the past,

367
00:24:58,840 --> 00:25:02,720
Mars was covered in lakes
and even oceans.

368
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:07,240
On Earth, we know that wherever we
find water, we find life.

369
00:25:09,040 --> 00:25:13,120
This all suggests that even if Mars
is a dead world today,

370
00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:15,320
it may not always have been so.

371
00:25:19,640 --> 00:25:21,800
In just 50 years,

372
00:25:21,800 --> 00:25:26,480
we've come full circle, from
Mariner 4 apparently suggesting

373
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:28,040
that Mars is a dead world,

374
00:25:28,040 --> 00:25:31,600
to believing again that it is
certainly possible

375
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:34,560
that life may have existed
at some point

376
00:25:34,560 --> 00:25:36,280
in the history of the Red Planet.

377
00:25:36,280 --> 00:25:40,720
And now it's up to Perseverance
to see if that's true.

378
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:11,720
Day two at JPL, and I return
to Mission Control

379
00:26:11,720 --> 00:26:14,320
to see the new data that
Perseverance has sent back.

380
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:23,360
Ken. So, last time we spoke,
the drill bit was stuck in the rock.

381
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:25,000
So what happened?

382
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:30,040
Well, we have this image of a
beautiful rock in the drill bit.

383
00:26:30,040 --> 00:26:34,200
So now we know, just from this image
alone, that the drill was able

384
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:37,440
to break off the rock core
and pull out.

385
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:38,600
So that one's been solved.

386
00:26:38,600 --> 00:26:40,680
The sample's safely stowed away.

387
00:26:40,680 --> 00:26:42,680
So what's the plan today?

388
00:26:42,680 --> 00:26:45,640
Well, that was the last thing
we had to do to complete

389
00:26:45,640 --> 00:26:47,680
the crater floor campaign,

390
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:50,680
and we are ready to begin
the drive campaign.

391
00:26:50,680 --> 00:26:55,120
So the main activity for the next
few weeks is drive, drive, drive.

392
00:26:58,600 --> 00:27:02,520
With the time lost to the drilling
fault, Perseverance will now

393
00:27:02,520 --> 00:27:05,600
have to average 200 metres a day

394
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:08,000
if it is to reach
La Orotava Crater

395
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:09,560
by the end of the week.

396
00:27:11,800 --> 00:27:13,800
But the pictures from its cameras

397
00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:17,520
showed that it's starting
from a tricky position,

398
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:20,840
surrounded by a maze of rocks
and sand traps.

399
00:27:24,360 --> 00:27:26,440
To find its way onto clearer ground,

400
00:27:26,440 --> 00:27:29,600
Perseverance is going to need help.

401
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:33,440
Vandi Verma is head
of the Rover Driving Team.

402
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:35,720
Hello, Vandi.
Hi. Nice to meet you.

403
00:27:35,720 --> 00:27:40,320
So you're about to set off
on the journey, the long journey

404
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:41,680
around to the delta.

405
00:27:41,680 --> 00:27:45,640
So how do you plan the next route?

406
00:27:45,640 --> 00:27:48,480
So we look at the images. So I would
look at these

407
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:52,800
navigation camera images I took in
the direction we expect to drive.

408
00:27:52,800 --> 00:27:56,160
And we turn these 3D goggles on.

409
00:27:56,160 --> 00:27:59,640
If I put it into stereo
so you can yourself see it...

410
00:27:59,640 --> 00:28:02,240
Oh, that really is quite
impressive, actually.

411
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:05,440
I can see the surface of Mars coming
out from the screen.

412
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:09,480
And you can see a curved ripple
here, with the rocks on it.

413
00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:13,160
It's a really good substitute
for standing where the rover is

414
00:28:13,160 --> 00:28:15,680
on Mars, and kind of looking
out to see

415
00:28:15,680 --> 00:28:17,520
how you would navigate the terrain.

416
00:28:19,720 --> 00:28:24,080
Using the 3D images, Vandi can begin
to plot Perseverance's route

417
00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:26,040
through the obstacles.

418
00:28:26,040 --> 00:28:29,480
Essentially, we are saying we want
to navigate around this area,

419
00:28:29,480 --> 00:28:32,200
so we are doing the path
so it goes around this.

420
00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:34,200
But we don't want to go over here,

421
00:28:34,200 --> 00:28:36,800
because it's very sandy,
and sand, actually,

422
00:28:36,800 --> 00:28:38,760
the wheels don't do very well in.
Ah, yeah.

423
00:28:38,760 --> 00:28:41,120
You can see all the layers
as you start...

424
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:43,640
In hazardous terrain like this,

425
00:28:43,640 --> 00:28:46,600
the only way the rover can safely
find its way

426
00:28:46,600 --> 00:28:49,640
is by following Vandi's
carefully plotted route.

427
00:28:52,280 --> 00:28:55,560
But this mode of rover driving
is slow.

428
00:28:55,560 --> 00:28:57,280
It's only possible to programme

429
00:28:57,280 --> 00:29:00,080
around 30 metres of driving
each day,

430
00:29:00,080 --> 00:29:03,520
nowhere near enough to cover
the distances required

431
00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:05,360
to reach the delta.

432
00:29:05,360 --> 00:29:08,040
So once the rover reaches
safer ground,

433
00:29:08,040 --> 00:29:10,400
Vandi points it in
the right direction

434
00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:12,480
and activates its secret weapon.

435
00:29:13,560 --> 00:29:15,640
So, now we're going to turn
on AutoNav,

436
00:29:15,640 --> 00:29:17,520
because the rover will know more
on Mars

437
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:19,040
at that point than we know here.

438
00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:30,360
AutoNav allows the rover to drive
itself across open terrain

439
00:29:30,360 --> 00:29:34,120
where there are fewer obstacles
to avoid,

440
00:29:34,120 --> 00:29:38,280
analysing the stereo images
from its cameras in real time

441
00:29:38,280 --> 00:29:40,080
to pick a route across the surface.

442
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:50,840
For a demonstration of how it works,

443
00:29:50,840 --> 00:29:52,240
I'm back in the Mars yard

444
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:56,040
to meet the Perseverance
project manager, Jennifer Trosper.

445
00:29:58,160 --> 00:30:00,800
So I was told we have to wear
these coats.

446
00:30:00,800 --> 00:30:02,600
I thought it was for my safety,

447
00:30:02,600 --> 00:30:05,520
but I'm told it's for its safety,
to protect it from me.

448
00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:06,960
It is, it is. Static. Yes.

449
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:10,640
And that's why I'm hooking up
right here, so that I don't zap

450
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:12,800
any of the electronics.

451
00:30:12,800 --> 00:30:16,440
So, if I were to sit here - and
I can't believe I'm saying this -

452
00:30:16,440 --> 00:30:19,120
but if I sit down, will she
recognise me?

453
00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:21,520
Because of how well it's working
on Mars,

454
00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:23,920
I wouldn't expect it to run
over you,

455
00:30:23,920 --> 00:30:25,560
but we could give it a try.

456
00:30:25,560 --> 00:30:27,200
Let's check it out. Let's have a go.

457
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:29,920
I love the words that you...
""She should.""

458
00:30:29,920 --> 00:30:32,560
No, she will.
""What should happen...""

459
00:30:32,560 --> 00:30:34,640
She's... Really, just...

460
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:37,160
I mean, if I just sit here...

461
00:30:37,160 --> 00:30:38,600
All right.

462
00:30:44,760 --> 00:30:49,320
As I settle down for this game
of interplanetary chicken,

463
00:30:49,320 --> 00:30:52,280
the first thing that becomes evident
is that Optimism

464
00:30:52,280 --> 00:30:55,360
is more of a tortoise than hare.

465
00:30:55,360 --> 00:31:00,000
This is top speed,
4.2 centimetres a second

466
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:03,160
or just under one mile
every ten hours.

467
00:31:05,880 --> 00:31:09,480
I'd like to say it's nerve-racking
but, in all honesty,

468
00:31:09,480 --> 00:31:11,360
I could definitely get
out of the way.

469
00:31:12,920 --> 00:31:14,880
As the rover drives forwards,

470
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:17,520
it's constantly imaging the ground
in front,

471
00:31:17,520 --> 00:31:20,080
building a map
of the obstacles that it will

472
00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:23,160
need to avoid - in this case, me.

473
00:31:27,240 --> 00:31:31,000
She's just taking some more images
to update her nav map.

474
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:33,280
Then she has to decide how to get
around you.

475
00:31:33,280 --> 00:31:34,920
So it should be identifying...

476
00:31:34,920 --> 00:31:39,400
There you go. Looks like she has
identified you as an obstacle

477
00:31:39,400 --> 00:31:41,200
and is choosing to turn.

478
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:44,280
So it looks like she's not
going to drive over you.

479
00:31:44,280 --> 00:31:45,320
It does.

480
00:31:46,800 --> 00:31:51,360
Although the wheels are slightly
resetting towards me.

481
00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:53,840
She's going to make a close pass,
I think.

482
00:32:03,280 --> 00:32:04,960
Oh, excellent.

483
00:32:06,200 --> 00:32:08,760
It's gone straight over the GoPro.

484
00:32:13,240 --> 00:32:15,520
So she was very careful with me,

485
00:32:15,520 --> 00:32:17,560
but not so careful with our cameras.

486
00:32:21,960 --> 00:32:24,920
The thing that's impressive
is that nobody's driving.

487
00:32:24,920 --> 00:32:28,280
So even though it doesn't look
like it's driving fast,

488
00:32:28,280 --> 00:32:31,840
you've got to remember that she's
driving across unknown terrain,

489
00:32:31,840 --> 00:32:33,160
making her own decisions.

490
00:32:33,160 --> 00:32:37,920
And this makes this rover,
Perseverance, by far the fastest

491
00:32:37,920 --> 00:32:40,760
thing we've ever sent to the surface
of any other planet.

492
00:32:42,520 --> 00:32:47,040
It's this unique set of skills
that allows the rover to travel

493
00:32:47,040 --> 00:32:48,800
200 to 300 metres every day.

494
00:32:51,960 --> 00:32:55,520
And if Perseverance is going to make
it to La Orotava Crater

495
00:32:55,520 --> 00:32:58,160
by the end of the week,
it'll need to go flat out.

496
00:33:01,520 --> 00:33:05,840
At the end of day two, I head back
to the rover operations floor,

497
00:33:05,840 --> 00:33:09,320
where Vandi and the rover driving
team should have finished the plans

498
00:33:09,320 --> 00:33:11,800
for the first stage of that drive.

499
00:33:13,400 --> 00:33:15,800
So when the rover's route
has been planned,

500
00:33:15,800 --> 00:33:19,560
then those instructions have
first of all got to be checked

501
00:33:19,560 --> 00:33:22,320
and amalgamated in with all
the other instructions

502
00:33:22,320 --> 00:33:25,520
to all the instruments on the rover.
So what's the arm going to do?

503
00:33:25,520 --> 00:33:27,320
What are the experiments
going to do?

504
00:33:27,320 --> 00:33:29,320
Where are the cameras
going to be looking?

505
00:33:29,320 --> 00:33:32,360
And those sequences, those commands,
are all put together

506
00:33:32,360 --> 00:33:34,600
in this meeting, which is called
the cam meeting,

507
00:33:34,600 --> 00:33:36,080
the command approval meeting.

508
00:33:36,080 --> 00:33:39,320
And only when everybody's happy,
and all those commands

509
00:33:39,320 --> 00:33:42,560
have been sent to simulators -
twice, actually -

510
00:33:42,560 --> 00:33:45,080
that check that everything's
going to be OK,

511
00:33:45,080 --> 00:33:49,400
can those commands be signed off
and sent to the Deep Space Network,

512
00:33:49,400 --> 00:33:51,520
and onwards to the rover on Mars.

513
00:33:55,160 --> 00:33:57,760
In here, the team are putting
together the final list

514
00:33:57,760 --> 00:34:00,200
of instructions that will
determine exactly

515
00:34:00,200 --> 00:34:01,840
what the rover does tomorrow.

516
00:34:03,560 --> 00:34:05,760
There are thousands of lines of code

517
00:34:05,760 --> 00:34:08,280
and each one must be scrutinised.

518
00:34:09,320 --> 00:34:12,040
A single bug in the software
could jeopardise

519
00:34:12,040 --> 00:34:14,040
the carefully plotted drive plan.

520
00:34:18,200 --> 00:34:21,200
What we do after we finish
on this shift is we really celebrate

521
00:34:21,200 --> 00:34:24,040
the effort that everybody put
together, and we actually hit

522
00:34:24,040 --> 00:34:27,040
the gong behind me, that we would
love for you to do it today.

523
00:34:27,040 --> 00:34:29,040
Really? Because that is
the tremendous honour.

524
00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:30,560
Am I supposed to say something?

525
00:34:30,560 --> 00:34:32,240
""I declare this meeting closed.""

526
00:34:32,240 --> 00:34:34,080
That sounds about right to me.

527
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:40,680
And with that bang of the gong,

528
00:34:40,680 --> 00:34:44,880
the instructions are sent
off on their long journey to Mars.

529
00:34:48,160 --> 00:34:51,040
All being well,
the rover should receive them

530
00:34:51,040 --> 00:34:52,760
and finally be able to start

531
00:34:52,760 --> 00:34:55,360
on its record-breaking journey
in the morning.

532
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:10,000
Perseverance has already changed
the way we look at the Red Planet.

533
00:35:12,280 --> 00:35:15,000
The photos it takes
can be stitched together

534
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:17,760
into astonishing panoramas.

535
00:35:20,680 --> 00:35:24,800
Scenes that let us stand
on the surface of another world.

536
00:35:26,720 --> 00:35:31,640
It is a stark and barren
landscape, dimmer than the Earth.

537
00:35:32,640 --> 00:35:35,600
Because it's farther from the sun,
less than half the amount

538
00:35:35,600 --> 00:35:37,920
of sunlight reaches the surface.

539
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:43,120
But, in some ways, it looks
remarkably familiar.

540
00:35:43,120 --> 00:35:46,080
There are sand dunes and boulder
fields that could have been

541
00:35:46,080 --> 00:35:49,720
photographed in deserts
here on Earth.

542
00:35:49,720 --> 00:35:53,040
There are even clouds in
the orange-coloured skies.

543
00:35:57,600 --> 00:36:02,920
And because Perseverance is the only
Martian rover to carry microphones,

544
00:36:02,920 --> 00:36:05,880
we can hear the sounds of Mars
for the first time.

545
00:36:08,120 --> 00:36:11,120
The whistling of the wind

546
00:36:11,120 --> 00:36:14,800
that stirs up the dust devils that
ghost across the surface.

547
00:36:19,600 --> 00:36:23,560
Perseverance has even observed
a solar eclipse,

548
00:36:23,560 --> 00:36:27,440
as Mars's moon Phobos passes in
front of the sun.

549
00:36:30,160 --> 00:36:33,840
But although there are undoubted
similarities to the Earth,

550
00:36:33,840 --> 00:36:36,680
Mars is also a very alien world.

551
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:40,280
Because it's half the diameter
of our planet,

552
00:36:40,280 --> 00:36:44,000
gravity on the surface is just 38%
as strong.

553
00:36:46,560 --> 00:36:49,640
And while the Earth is wet,
warm and welcoming,

554
00:36:49,640 --> 00:36:52,800
Mars is a desolate,
inhospitable place.

555
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:58,680
Its dusty surface is bone dry,
and covered by a thin

556
00:36:58,680 --> 00:37:03,240
carbon dioxide atmosphere
just 1% the density of Earth's.

557
00:37:05,240 --> 00:37:09,720
The average temperature
is -63 degrees Celsius.

558
00:37:11,480 --> 00:37:14,400
It is cold, dry and dead.

559
00:37:16,280 --> 00:37:19,840
This is the world that Perseverance
is exploring.

560
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:43,480
Day three, and it's an early
start at JPL.

561
00:37:51,400 --> 00:37:53,080
Just see it there.

562
00:37:55,280 --> 00:37:57,400
So coincidentally, early morning
at JPL,

563
00:37:57,400 --> 00:38:00,760
we've just walked into
Mission Control,

564
00:38:00,760 --> 00:38:05,040
and that bright point of light
in the sky there, Venus,

565
00:38:05,040 --> 00:38:08,920
and just below it, you can just see
this faint red pixel

566
00:38:08,920 --> 00:38:10,800
in the morning sky.

567
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:12,720
That's Mars.

568
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:16,600
In the brightening sky,

569
00:38:16,600 --> 00:38:19,040
Mars is too faint for our cameras.

570
00:38:22,640 --> 00:38:25,920
But somewhere out there,
Perseverance will hopefully

571
00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:28,760
have just completed the first
stage of its drive.

572
00:38:31,960 --> 00:38:33,760
So how did the drive go yesterday?

573
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:37,520
It looks like it went well,
but we really can't tell yet.

574
00:38:37,520 --> 00:38:41,200
The data comes down in bits
and pieces, and right now

575
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:44,560
we have an image that was taken
in the late afternoon

576
00:38:44,560 --> 00:38:48,880
at about the time I would
expect the drive to stop.

577
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:52,320
This is looking forward,
and if we look backward,

578
00:38:52,320 --> 00:38:54,200
we should be able to see
the rover tracks.

579
00:38:54,200 --> 00:38:56,160
So now we're looking back
the way we came.

580
00:38:56,160 --> 00:39:00,000
So it looks just as you would expect
if it had executed its full drive.

581
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:01,400
That's interesting, actually,

582
00:39:01,400 --> 00:39:06,200
if you go back to that one, it's
just so obvious when you say it.

583
00:39:06,200 --> 00:39:09,640
You can tell it's late afternoon
because of the long shadows on Mars.

584
00:39:09,640 --> 00:39:11,160
Yeah, it's like Earth, you know,

585
00:39:11,160 --> 00:39:14,000
it's not surprising.
You figure it out. Of course. Yeah.

586
00:39:15,840 --> 00:39:19,640
When the telemetry from the rover
returns to Earth,

587
00:39:19,640 --> 00:39:22,640
it shows exactly how well the rover
has fared on its drive.

588
00:39:25,880 --> 00:39:29,160
To start off, it follows Vandi's
route through the treacherous

589
00:39:29,160 --> 00:39:31,000
sand patches and boulders.

590
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:37,400
And then, as the AutoNav takes over,
the rover swings north

591
00:39:37,400 --> 00:39:40,560
and drives itself
towards La Orotava Crater.

592
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:47,640
Covering a total distance of
204 metres

593
00:39:47,640 --> 00:39:49,600
and 96 centimetres.

594
00:39:52,360 --> 00:39:54,400
It's a great start to the journey.

595
00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:00,920
But after this initial success,

596
00:40:00,920 --> 00:40:04,240
the team are now facing an enforced
change of plan.

597
00:40:05,520 --> 00:40:08,600
Tomorrow, the mission will
temporarily lose access

598
00:40:08,600 --> 00:40:10,480
to the Deep Space Network.

599
00:40:12,240 --> 00:40:14,840
For 24 hours, they will not be able
to communicate

600
00:40:14,840 --> 00:40:16,600
with the rover on Mars.

601
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:20,960
So to keep up with the schedule,
they've been forced into

602
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:22,880
a risky change of strategy.

603
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:28,920
So we're making a two-day drive
plan, because tomorrow

604
00:40:28,920 --> 00:40:32,680
we don't have access to the antennas
that communicate with the rover.

605
00:40:32,680 --> 00:40:35,280
So we send two days' worth
of instructions and just let

606
00:40:35,280 --> 00:40:38,120
the rover do its thing and we get
a day off.

607
00:40:38,120 --> 00:40:41,400
So how far would you hope to get?
About 500 metres.

608
00:40:41,400 --> 00:40:44,600
Oh, really? Yeah, that's...
That'll be a big jump.

609
00:40:46,440 --> 00:40:49,000
Today, they will be doing
a two-stop plan.

610
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:51,680
So when you're doing your assessment
today, let's make sure

611
00:40:51,680 --> 00:40:55,760
that everything is green
and go for these activities

612
00:40:55,760 --> 00:40:57,440
that will be coming up.

613
00:40:59,560 --> 00:41:02,160
Now, we just heard that the plan
for the next two days

614
00:41:02,160 --> 00:41:04,440
is for Perseverance to do
a two-day drive.

615
00:41:04,440 --> 00:41:08,120
And as I speak, you can see
there, Canberra Deep Space Network

616
00:41:08,120 --> 00:41:11,840
antennae 35, there's communication
upwards to MRO.

617
00:41:11,840 --> 00:41:13,680
That's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter.

618
00:41:13,680 --> 00:41:16,320
So those are probably the
instructions that are going

619
00:41:16,320 --> 00:41:20,640
to Perseverance to tell
it what to do on that two-day drive.

620
00:41:22,520 --> 00:41:25,760
As the commands hurtle their way
towards Mars,

621
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:28,840
I want to find out how Perseverance
got to Jezero Crater.

622
00:41:35,080 --> 00:41:38,480
Jezero is the most dangerous
location that NASA has ever

623
00:41:38,480 --> 00:41:40,800
tried to land a spacecraft on Mars.

624
00:41:43,920 --> 00:41:47,200
It is full of hazards
that could be fatal to the mission.

625
00:41:49,920 --> 00:41:53,040
But if there's one place to come
to find the engineers who could

626
00:41:53,040 --> 00:41:57,240
pull off this feat of precision
landing, it's JPL.

627
00:42:00,920 --> 00:42:05,000
And this is JPL's motto,
Dare Mighty Things.

628
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:08,800
And JPL lives up, definitely,
to that motto,

629
00:42:08,800 --> 00:42:12,560
as you can see from this award
cabinet, the trophy cabinet.

630
00:42:12,560 --> 00:42:15,480
And it's just a history of space
exploration. For anyone who's

631
00:42:15,480 --> 00:42:18,480
interested in our exploration
of the universe,

632
00:42:18,480 --> 00:42:21,240
then this is just magnificent.

633
00:42:21,240 --> 00:42:23,720
You see awards for Voyager,

634
00:42:23,720 --> 00:42:25,880
Mars Exploration Rovers,

635
00:42:25,880 --> 00:42:30,800
the Dawn Mission, Cassini,
just everything.

636
00:42:30,800 --> 00:42:33,880
What's that one up there?
That's quite ornate, isn't it?

637
00:42:33,880 --> 00:42:37,040
Appreciation for your support
and participation

638
00:42:37,040 --> 00:42:42,360
in The American Space Experience
at Disneyland.

639
00:42:47,960 --> 00:42:51,560
Upstairs from the trophy cabinet
is the office of Al Chen,

640
00:42:51,560 --> 00:42:55,400
the engineer who was in charge
of designing the entry, descent

641
00:42:55,400 --> 00:42:58,000
and landing system that would
allow Perseverance

642
00:42:58,000 --> 00:42:59,720
to touch down in Jezero.

643
00:43:01,800 --> 00:43:04,760
The scientists tell us about, you
know, the potential for life there.

644
00:43:04,760 --> 00:43:07,360
But when we look at it from
a landing perspective,

645
00:43:07,360 --> 00:43:09,680
all you can see are the ways
we're going to die there.

646
00:43:09,680 --> 00:43:12,720
The death that's out there.
It's a site unlike any other place

647
00:43:12,720 --> 00:43:13,960
we've tried to land on Mars.

648
00:43:13,960 --> 00:43:16,440
It's just got hazards
all over the place.

649
00:43:16,440 --> 00:43:19,440
If we turn on the slope hazards
here, you see the edge of the delta,

650
00:43:19,440 --> 00:43:20,920
which is that 60 metre-ish cliff.

651
00:43:20,920 --> 00:43:22,680
And then, of course, the edges
of craters,

652
00:43:22,680 --> 00:43:24,480
and those are places we don't want
to land.

653
00:43:24,480 --> 00:43:25,680
But of course, that's not it.

654
00:43:25,680 --> 00:43:27,800
These are all the rocks
that we could see from space,

655
00:43:27,800 --> 00:43:30,640
which means about a half metre
tall or so, or more.

656
00:43:30,640 --> 00:43:33,120
If you manage to encounter
one of those red places,

657
00:43:33,120 --> 00:43:35,040
you're very likely
to have a bad day.

658
00:43:35,040 --> 00:43:38,520
So those blue areas, they're
the safe areas. That's right.

659
00:43:38,520 --> 00:43:42,480
When I look at that, it looks
like mainly hazard to me.

660
00:43:45,400 --> 00:43:49,120
Al's job was to design a system
that would allow Perseverance

661
00:43:49,120 --> 00:43:53,960
to identify and then land in one
of the safe areas near the delta.

662
00:44:04,440 --> 00:44:08,240
But the first time his landing
system could be fully tested

663
00:44:08,240 --> 00:44:11,040
was on February the 18th, 2021...

664
00:44:16,280 --> 00:44:20,400
..as the spacecraft approached Mars
at the end of its six-month journey.

665
00:44:20,400 --> 00:44:22,040
You are not triggered for talk.

666
00:44:30,560 --> 00:44:33,600
It's kind of weird to have the only
test that you ever get a chance

667
00:44:33,600 --> 00:44:36,920
to do, you know, in front of
everybody else in the world, right?

668
00:44:36,920 --> 00:44:38,360
Definitely, my heart was racing.

669
00:44:38,360 --> 00:44:40,800
I probably didn't want to know
what my blood pressure was.

670
00:44:42,520 --> 00:44:45,480
As the spacecraft makes
its final approach,

671
00:44:45,480 --> 00:44:49,000
it's travelling at
20,000km per hour.

672
00:44:55,120 --> 00:44:58,720
The job of Al's entry, descent
and landing system is to slow

673
00:44:58,720 --> 00:45:02,640
it down to walking pace by the time
it reaches the surface.

674
00:45:09,600 --> 00:45:12,240
Because of the delay
in communication with Mars,

675
00:45:12,240 --> 00:45:14,480
the whole process is automated.

676
00:45:15,640 --> 00:45:20,160
All the crew in Mission Control
can do is watch and wait.

677
00:45:21,440 --> 00:45:24,240
They call it the seven minutes
of terror.

678
00:45:28,760 --> 00:45:30,480
In the first stage of the descent,

679
00:45:30,480 --> 00:45:33,960
the spacecraft skims across the top
of the Martian atmosphere.

680
00:45:36,520 --> 00:45:39,320
Even though it's much thinner
than the Earth's, the friction

681
00:45:39,320 --> 00:45:43,400
is immense, causing the spacecraft's
heat shield to glow red-hot.

682
00:45:57,040 --> 00:45:59,480
After four minutes, the spacecraft
has slowed

683
00:45:59,480 --> 00:46:01,640
to 1,500 kilometres an hour.

684
00:46:02,880 --> 00:46:06,080
It's now just 11km
above the planet's surface.

685
00:46:09,920 --> 00:46:12,560
Filmed with the lander's cameras,

686
00:46:12,560 --> 00:46:15,600
this is the actual video
of the parachute deploying

687
00:46:15,600 --> 00:46:17,480
in the Martian atmosphere.

688
00:46:21,520 --> 00:46:23,640
As the heat shield falls away,

689
00:46:23,640 --> 00:46:28,560
the unique artificial intelligence
system Al designed kicks in.

690
00:46:28,560 --> 00:46:31,880
Its job is to scan the ground
below and identify

691
00:46:31,880 --> 00:46:33,360
a safe landing zone.

692
00:46:38,800 --> 00:46:41,160
2km above the surface...

693
00:46:44,880 --> 00:46:47,360
..the parachute is released

694
00:46:47,360 --> 00:46:49,880
and the eight lander rockets fire up

695
00:46:49,880 --> 00:46:52,720
to steer the craft towards its
chosen landing site.

696
00:46:57,920 --> 00:47:01,160
And then the most
nerve-racking moment.

697
00:47:07,120 --> 00:47:11,280
The rover is lowered the last
few metres on cables,

698
00:47:11,280 --> 00:47:13,960
touching down in a swirl
of Martian dust.

699
00:47:25,960 --> 00:47:29,560
Where did Perseverance choose
to come down?

700
00:47:29,560 --> 00:47:32,800
Perseverance came down in the Seitah
area, so we ended up kind of

701
00:47:32,800 --> 00:47:35,880
down in this region right
about here.

702
00:47:35,880 --> 00:47:37,760
You can see the hazards
that are out there.

703
00:47:37,760 --> 00:47:40,840
But you can see that the area right
around the rover is nice and clean.

704
00:47:40,840 --> 00:47:43,800
It's the parking
lot we were looking for.

705
00:47:47,200 --> 00:47:50,760
The first pictures taken
by Perseverance on the surface

706
00:47:50,760 --> 00:47:53,400
showed just how precise
the landing was.

707
00:47:56,200 --> 00:48:00,160
It had picked out a tiny area
of flat ground in a landscape filled

708
00:48:00,160 --> 00:48:02,240
with boulders and sand dunes.

709
00:48:05,640 --> 00:48:09,800
But this landscape was not
always so dry and dusty.

710
00:48:09,800 --> 00:48:11,400
It was once submerged.

711
00:48:16,280 --> 00:48:18,320
About 3.8 billion years ago,

712
00:48:18,320 --> 00:48:21,760
Jezero Crater was filled with water,

713
00:48:21,760 --> 00:48:24,680
forming a lake 45km across.

714
00:48:31,160 --> 00:48:34,760
On Earth, we always find
life where there's water.

715
00:48:36,080 --> 00:48:38,520
If the same is true on Mars,

716
00:48:38,520 --> 00:48:40,600
then life could have existed

717
00:48:40,600 --> 00:48:45,080
in Jezero Lake at almost
exactly the same time

718
00:48:45,080 --> 00:48:47,400
that it was evolving on Earth.

719
00:48:57,280 --> 00:48:59,480
With the Deep Space Network down,

720
00:48:59,480 --> 00:49:02,920
there will be no update
from Perseverance today.

721
00:49:06,120 --> 00:49:09,040
But a couple of hours' drive
from JPL

722
00:49:09,040 --> 00:49:12,040
is a unique lake called
the Salton Sea.

723
00:49:14,080 --> 00:49:17,000
Set amongst the desert mountains,

724
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:20,520
I could almost imagine the lake
in Jezero Crater.

725
00:49:23,760 --> 00:49:27,200
I've come here to meet
astrobiologist Tim Lyons.

726
00:49:32,200 --> 00:49:35,040
We're sat here in the middle
of a desert.

727
00:49:35,040 --> 00:49:38,280
Very hot, very dry.
No sign of rain.

728
00:49:38,280 --> 00:49:41,360
And yet there's this lake.
So why is the lake here?

729
00:49:41,360 --> 00:49:44,760
Well, the lake is here because of
an engineering disaster.

730
00:49:44,760 --> 00:49:47,360
In 1905, an irrigation canal
was breached

731
00:49:47,360 --> 00:49:50,640
by floodwaters from the Colorado,

732
00:49:50,640 --> 00:49:53,400
and it drained almost unabatedly
into this basin for two years.

733
00:49:53,400 --> 00:49:56,600
Subsequent to that, it has received
agricultural runoff.

734
00:49:56,600 --> 00:50:00,280
So the water that we're looking
at now is essentially waste water.

735
00:50:00,280 --> 00:50:02,440
It's a pretty nasty place,
to be honest with you.

736
00:50:02,440 --> 00:50:04,280
And the fish are not doing
very well,

737
00:50:04,280 --> 00:50:06,680
and the birds are correspondingly
being impacted.

738
00:50:06,680 --> 00:50:10,560
But algae, bacteria,
microbes are thriving.

739
00:50:10,560 --> 00:50:13,600
It's not a healthy environment,
but it is teeming with life.

740
00:50:18,920 --> 00:50:22,200
It's this lake's unique
microbial ecosystem

741
00:50:22,200 --> 00:50:25,840
that makes it an ideal place for
studying the origin of life

742
00:50:25,840 --> 00:50:28,640
on Earth and on Mars.

743
00:50:33,960 --> 00:50:36,600
Look at these pools of colour.

744
00:50:36,600 --> 00:50:37,920
Pools of life!

745
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:40,720
This is the stuff.

746
00:50:40,720 --> 00:50:44,800
That's the warm little pond
teeming with life.

747
00:50:44,800 --> 00:50:48,080
It looks just like...
I'm a physicist.

748
00:50:48,080 --> 00:50:51,320
It just looks like some
floating scum.

749
00:50:51,320 --> 00:50:53,560
That's one description of it, yeah.

750
00:50:53,560 --> 00:50:56,400
So this is what you'd call
a microbial mat?

751
00:50:56,400 --> 00:50:59,680
Well, I would say that this might
be a microbial mat in the making.

752
00:50:59,680 --> 00:51:03,520
And so this is what early
Earth life was like.

753
00:51:03,520 --> 00:51:07,000
Some of our very best, most
convincing evidence for life

754
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:10,760
going back in time on Earth
are microbial mats, things

755
00:51:10,760 --> 00:51:15,640
like this pond that end up with
these laminated concentrations,

756
00:51:15,640 --> 00:51:17,920
things we call stromatolites,

757
00:51:17,920 --> 00:51:21,040
found in places like Australia that
go back, convincingly,

758
00:51:21,040 --> 00:51:23,080
to three and a half billion
years ago,

759
00:51:23,080 --> 00:51:26,680
and some people would argue
maybe even to 3.7 billion years ago.

760
00:51:26,680 --> 00:51:29,280
That's very close to the window
of time

761
00:51:29,280 --> 00:51:31,480
that is being studied in Jezero.

762
00:51:31,480 --> 00:51:35,760
So if we were to imagine sort
of, what, 3.8 billion years ago,

763
00:51:35,760 --> 00:51:38,400
standing on the shores of
Jezero Crater,

764
00:51:38,400 --> 00:51:40,680
is there any chance
it may have looked like this?

765
00:51:40,680 --> 00:51:42,320
Oh, absolutely. I think so.

766
00:51:42,320 --> 00:51:44,640
I think even a sceptic
would have to admit that.

767
00:51:44,640 --> 00:51:47,080
And so here we're looking
at the actual life

768
00:51:47,080 --> 00:51:48,600
that may have been present,

769
00:51:48,600 --> 00:51:51,680
analogous life present
on Mars in Jezero,

770
00:51:51,680 --> 00:51:54,840
3.8, 3.7 billion years ago.

771
00:52:18,400 --> 00:52:20,800
Now I suppose you might
reasonably ask,

772
00:52:20,800 --> 00:52:23,320
why are we so interested
in the question,

773
00:52:23,320 --> 00:52:26,760
""Did life exist on a planet
millions of miles away

774
00:52:26,760 --> 00:52:29,000
""three and a half billion
years ago?""

775
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:31,960
I don't think, actually, that's
a reasonable question

776
00:52:31,960 --> 00:52:34,560
because the question, ""Are we alone
in the universe?""

777
00:52:34,560 --> 00:52:37,680
is one of the most
profound philosophical questions.

778
00:52:37,680 --> 00:52:41,200
But if you want to be more pragmatic
about it, then you might

779
00:52:41,200 --> 00:52:43,800
be interested in how life
began here.

780
00:52:43,800 --> 00:52:47,400
How did we come to be here on Earth?

781
00:52:47,400 --> 00:52:51,200
And the evidence for the origin
of life on Earth

782
00:52:51,200 --> 00:52:55,200
has actually largely been erased,
because Earth is an active world.

783
00:52:55,200 --> 00:52:58,040
There's plate tectonics which take
the evidence

784
00:52:58,040 --> 00:53:00,760
and literally take it down
inside the planet.

785
00:53:00,760 --> 00:53:04,680
There's weathering with rain
and wind and the oceans.

786
00:53:04,680 --> 00:53:08,360
And so there's very little evidence
of what Earth was like

787
00:53:08,360 --> 00:53:10,320
three and a half billion years ago.

788
00:53:10,320 --> 00:53:14,280
But on Mars, it's different,
because Mars is a planet

789
00:53:14,280 --> 00:53:18,360
that's been in deep freeze for
three and a half billion years.

790
00:53:18,360 --> 00:53:21,520
There is no plate tectonics.
There's very little weathering.

791
00:53:23,360 --> 00:53:28,360
So if life began on Mars,
the evidence may still be there.

792
00:53:30,240 --> 00:53:34,000
So paradoxically, if you're
interested in how we came

793
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:37,920
to be here, the answer might lie
up there.

794
00:53:43,040 --> 00:53:46,320
It's these profound questions
about the origin of life

795
00:53:46,320 --> 00:53:49,560
that make Perseverance's mission
so important.

796
00:53:51,560 --> 00:53:53,520
But searching for signs
of ancient life

797
00:53:53,520 --> 00:53:56,240
on the surface of Mars isn't easy.

798
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:05,920
Finding the remnants of it and then
proving that it really is evidence

799
00:54:05,920 --> 00:54:09,000
of life is the rover's
biggest challenge.

800
00:54:20,520 --> 00:54:23,960
Back at JPL,
I'm meeting Luther Beegle...

801
00:54:23,960 --> 00:54:25,640
Hello, Luther. Hey.

802
00:54:25,640 --> 00:54:29,800
..one of the chief scientists
on the Perseverance team.

803
00:54:29,800 --> 00:54:32,240
It would be one of
the greatest discoveries

804
00:54:32,240 --> 00:54:35,160
in the history of science,
wouldn't it?

805
00:54:35,160 --> 00:54:38,640
In the history of civilisation.
""We're not alone in the universe.""

806
00:54:38,640 --> 00:54:42,800
So how much would it take
to convince you?

807
00:54:42,800 --> 00:54:46,920
I know that you can never convince
a roomful of scientists.

808
00:54:46,920 --> 00:54:48,080
Not all of them.

809
00:54:48,080 --> 00:54:50,640
No, we're not... We're not
convincing a roomful of scientists

810
00:54:50,640 --> 00:54:52,720
on what they had for lunch.

811
00:54:52,720 --> 00:54:56,320
But I don't know what that level
of convincing would be.

812
00:54:56,320 --> 00:54:58,840
It's something that's going to take
a lot of evidence and a lot

813
00:54:58,840 --> 00:55:03,440
of chains, and a lot of different
measurements to prove out.

814
00:55:03,440 --> 00:55:06,240
Luther is in charge of an instrument
called Sherlock.

815
00:55:07,200 --> 00:55:09,920
Located at the end
of the rover's arm,

816
00:55:09,920 --> 00:55:13,240
it's a laser scanner designed
to detect

817
00:55:13,240 --> 00:55:16,200
the faintest chemical traces
that life leaves behind.

818
00:55:18,560 --> 00:55:20,400
And we can demonstrate its abilities

819
00:55:20,400 --> 00:55:23,800
with some of the most ancient
evidence of life on Earth.

820
00:55:26,360 --> 00:55:29,680
Life always leaves its imprint
on its environments.

821
00:55:29,680 --> 00:55:32,040
I can show you in this
particular sample here,

822
00:55:32,040 --> 00:55:35,320
this is a stromatolite from
the Strelley pool formation

823
00:55:35,320 --> 00:55:38,360
in Australia. It's about
3.5 billion years old.

824
00:55:38,360 --> 00:55:41,240
I love the way you throw
that away, by the way.

825
00:55:41,240 --> 00:55:43,280
Three and a half billion years old.

826
00:55:43,280 --> 00:55:45,920
Yeah. I mean, it just looks
like a rock to me.

827
00:55:45,920 --> 00:55:47,040
So what... What...

828
00:55:47,040 --> 00:55:50,960
How would you convince me or anyone
else that was biological?

829
00:55:50,960 --> 00:55:53,240
Well, if I wet this rock, you
can kind of see

830
00:55:53,240 --> 00:55:55,800
the lines a little bit
better. And so...

831
00:55:58,840 --> 00:56:01,920
So here you can really see, they
really come out a little bit better.

832
00:56:01,920 --> 00:56:04,400
Oh, yeah. So you can see
the white layer and the black layer,

833
00:56:04,400 --> 00:56:06,840
back and forth. Yeah, I can see
those really clearly. Yeah.

834
00:56:06,840 --> 00:56:08,960
So why does that indicate
biological activity?

835
00:56:08,960 --> 00:56:11,320
These particular stromatolites
are curved,

836
00:56:11,320 --> 00:56:12,800
have different formations,

837
00:56:12,800 --> 00:56:15,800
that could only have been created
through biological processes.

838
00:56:15,800 --> 00:56:19,240
So are you looking for patterns
like this on Mars?

839
00:56:19,240 --> 00:56:21,480
We are looking for patterns
like this on Mars

840
00:56:21,480 --> 00:56:25,000
as a first indication that this
is either a sedimentary rock,

841
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:26,440
or a stromatolite.

842
00:56:26,440 --> 00:56:29,600
And then we have to do the next
layer of analysis on those rocks.

843
00:56:31,760 --> 00:56:34,480
And this is where Sherlock comes in.

844
00:56:34,480 --> 00:56:38,280
After scraping away the surface
of the rock, it zooms in

845
00:56:38,280 --> 00:56:40,360
to examine it in microscopic detail.

846
00:56:42,240 --> 00:56:45,360
Using the reflected light
from lasers to detect

847
00:56:45,360 --> 00:56:48,440
the tiny variations
in chemical composition

848
00:56:48,440 --> 00:56:51,280
that are left behind
by living organisms.

849
00:56:52,960 --> 00:56:57,160
So here you can see what a Sherlock
scan, where we went in and looked

850
00:56:57,160 --> 00:57:00,040
at where the organic molecules
on this particular rock was.

851
00:57:00,040 --> 00:57:03,480
The purple material here
is the ancient organic material.

852
00:57:03,480 --> 00:57:06,400
You can see that there are lines
associated with this,

853
00:57:06,400 --> 00:57:09,360
where the basic biology then grew
and died,

854
00:57:09,360 --> 00:57:12,280
and grew and died, and moved
up the rock like this.

855
00:57:12,280 --> 00:57:17,200
So these are literally the remains
of organisms that lived potentially

856
00:57:17,200 --> 00:57:20,160
billions of years ago. Potentially
billions of years ago.

857
00:57:22,520 --> 00:57:26,640
The great hope is that Perseverance
will find similar signs of life

858
00:57:26,640 --> 00:57:28,040
when it reaches the delta.

859
00:57:32,320 --> 00:57:33,440
You must be waiting...

860
00:57:33,440 --> 00:57:36,120
I know the Perseverance
landed, and there's a lot

861
00:57:36,120 --> 00:57:37,960
of geology being done.
You must be saying,

862
00:57:37,960 --> 00:57:40,120
""Can you just get
round to the delta, please?""

863
00:57:40,120 --> 00:57:41,960
We do. ""Can we go? Can we go?
Can we go?

864
00:57:41,960 --> 00:57:44,160
""I want to go to the delta.
I want to go to the delta.""

865
00:57:44,160 --> 00:57:45,560
But we understand the geology.

866
00:57:45,560 --> 00:57:48,040
You know, we're a big giant
400-person team, so you kind

867
00:57:48,040 --> 00:57:49,240
of want to work together.

868
00:57:49,240 --> 00:57:51,240
But at the same time,
""Can we can get to the delta?

869
00:57:51,240 --> 00:57:52,480
""Can we get to the delta?

870
00:57:52,480 --> 00:57:54,720
""Can we stay at the delta
for a while?"" Yeah.

871
00:57:54,720 --> 00:57:58,920
So images like this, you know,
potentially, in a golden scenario,

872
00:57:58,920 --> 00:58:02,760
we could expect results
like this in a few months?

873
00:58:02,760 --> 00:58:05,640
Yeah, in months rather than years,

874
00:58:05,640 --> 00:58:08,120
which is nice
to see the finish line.

875
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:16,360
It is a tantalising thought that we
may soon get our first hints,

876
00:58:16,360 --> 00:58:18,520
our first pieces of evidence

877
00:58:18,520 --> 00:58:21,880
that life may once
have filled this crater.

878
00:58:37,920 --> 00:58:40,480
Day five.

879
00:58:40,480 --> 00:58:44,600
After 24 hours of radio silence,
contact is re-established

880
00:58:44,600 --> 00:58:46,480
with Perseverance on Mars...

881
00:58:48,240 --> 00:58:51,240
..and we get our first update
on the two-day drive.

882
00:58:55,240 --> 00:58:58,640
Photos and telemetry show the first
part of the drive

883
00:58:58,640 --> 00:59:00,600
has gone according to plan.

884
00:59:00,600 --> 00:59:05,960
The rover covering another
259 metres and 37 centimetres

885
00:59:05,960 --> 00:59:08,920
around the edge of the Seitah
sand dunes.

886
00:59:10,040 --> 00:59:14,040
But it seems that this is as far
as the rover will be going for now.

887
00:59:22,760 --> 00:59:25,160
News filters through that
the instructions

888
00:59:25,160 --> 00:59:27,880
for the second day's drive
had a bug in them

889
00:59:27,880 --> 00:59:30,200
and were never received
by the rover.

890
00:59:34,360 --> 00:59:36,520
To find out what went wrong,

891
00:59:36,520 --> 00:59:40,840
I'm off to find deputy mission
scientist Katie Stack Morgan.

892
00:59:42,240 --> 00:59:45,280
So do you know what happened
overnight when the data came down?

893
00:59:45,280 --> 00:59:48,400
Yes. So we had planned two days'
worth of driving.

894
00:59:48,400 --> 00:59:52,200
And that's a brand-new capability
for Mars rovers, being able to plan

895
00:59:52,200 --> 00:59:54,560
drives in a row like that.

896
00:59:54,560 --> 00:59:58,320
But we encountered an issue that
prevented us from uplinking

897
00:59:58,320 --> 01:00:01,520
both of those drives, and sending
both of those drives to the rover.

898
01:00:01,520 --> 01:00:04,720
It's interesting to me that the
problem was not with... on Mars.

899
01:00:04,720 --> 01:00:06,280
No issue on Mars at all.

900
01:00:06,280 --> 01:00:09,560
But it's the computer
software, basically. That's right.

901
01:00:09,560 --> 01:00:11,480
You know, and these things
happen all the time.

902
01:00:11,480 --> 01:00:14,080
And we deal with them. In
a way this is helpful to us,

903
01:00:14,080 --> 01:00:17,040
because by giving the rover
a whole day to recharge,

904
01:00:17,040 --> 01:00:19,640
we then fill up our batteries all
the way to the top,

905
01:00:19,640 --> 01:00:22,240
and we can get ready to do
long drives in the weekend plan.

906
01:00:22,240 --> 01:00:24,640
So - silver lining to that,
to not being able

907
01:00:24,640 --> 01:00:25,960
to get that other drive up.

908
01:00:29,160 --> 01:00:32,560
Having fallen another day
behind schedule, the rover now

909
01:00:32,560 --> 01:00:35,680
has to travel 750 metres in just
two days

910
01:00:35,680 --> 01:00:37,720
to reach La Orotava crater

911
01:00:37,720 --> 01:00:39,400
by the end of the week.

912
01:00:42,320 --> 01:00:46,720
But Perseverance isn't the only
vehicle that the team has on Mars.

913
01:00:46,720 --> 01:00:51,000
And this week, I've also come
to learn about its companion.

914
01:00:53,960 --> 01:00:58,000
Ingenuity, the first-ever
extraterrestrial helicopter.

915
01:00:59,800 --> 01:01:03,840
I'm fascinated by this machine
because it was designed to do

916
01:01:03,840 --> 01:01:09,920
the seemingly impossible - to fly
in Mars's almost vanishingly thin

917
01:01:09,920 --> 01:01:13,440
atmosphere, just 1% as thick
as the Earth's.

918
01:01:22,720 --> 01:01:26,000
To find out how Ingenuity
achieves such a feat,

919
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:30,600
I'm meeting Havard Grip, the
helicopter's chief pilot, who's

920
01:01:30,600 --> 01:01:34,720
taking me to see the engineering
model of the helicopter.

921
01:01:37,600 --> 01:01:40,600
So this is our helicopter lab.

922
01:01:40,600 --> 01:01:45,560
It's probably the most important
space that we have as a project.

923
01:01:45,560 --> 01:01:49,480
So here you want to stay away
from the model in the middle,

924
01:01:49,480 --> 01:01:51,000
and the hardware along the edges.

925
01:01:51,000 --> 01:01:52,920
I'm really... I'm really excited
to see this.

926
01:01:52,920 --> 01:01:56,040
It's smaller than I imagined.

927
01:01:56,040 --> 01:02:01,080
Although the blades look, to me,
much bigger than I'd imagined.

928
01:02:01,080 --> 01:02:02,760
Much thicker.
That's right.

929
01:02:02,760 --> 01:02:05,880
So the main thing you notice
is just the size of the rotor.

930
01:02:05,880 --> 01:02:07,720
1.2 metres, tip to tip.

931
01:02:07,720 --> 01:02:09,400
It's just huge, you know,

932
01:02:09,400 --> 01:02:13,280
And if that was on Earth
with this same kind of rotor,

933
01:02:13,280 --> 01:02:15,720
it could lift a huge amount of mass.

934
01:02:15,720 --> 01:02:20,520
But on Mars, you need that just
to lift this tiny little helicopter

935
01:02:20,520 --> 01:02:24,520
off the ground.
How much does it weigh? 1.8kg.

936
01:02:24,520 --> 01:02:26,560
Is that all? That's it, yeah.

937
01:02:30,640 --> 01:02:35,320
Even at 1.8 kilos, it wasn't clear
that Ingenuity would be able to fly

938
01:02:35,320 --> 01:02:36,720
in Mars's atmosphere.

939
01:02:39,560 --> 01:02:44,400
On April 19, 2021, Perseverance
pointed its cameras

940
01:02:44,400 --> 01:02:48,280
at the helicopter, as it prepared
for its first flight.

941
01:02:51,800 --> 01:02:55,760
And millions of miles away
at JPL, its engineering team

942
01:02:55,760 --> 01:02:57,800
waited for news...

943
01:02:57,800 --> 01:02:59,880
..of success or failure.

944
01:03:49,960 --> 01:03:51,840
I see you brought your logbook,
which has got

945
01:03:51,840 --> 01:03:53,960
to be the coolest logbook.

946
01:03:55,160 --> 01:03:58,440
It's pretty neat. It's called the
pilot's logbook

947
01:03:58,440 --> 01:04:00,000
for planets and moons.

948
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:03,800
Yeah. So it's you and
the Apollo astronauts.

949
01:04:03,800 --> 01:04:06,240
That's basically...
That's pretty much it.

950
01:04:06,240 --> 01:04:08,600
I love this. So the remarks
are fantastic.

951
01:04:08,600 --> 01:04:11,920
""First powered flight by an aircraft
on another world.""

952
01:04:11,920 --> 01:04:14,280
That's right. That's fantastic.

953
01:04:14,280 --> 01:04:16,600
It was fun to write that, yeah.

954
01:04:17,720 --> 01:04:21,680
""Climb to three metres, turns
96 degrees to the right.""

955
01:04:22,920 --> 01:04:25,480
That's just wonderful. That will go
down in history, won't it?

956
01:04:25,480 --> 01:04:27,840
That's going to be one of those
things that has a picture.

957
01:04:27,840 --> 01:04:32,040
It is aviation history, you know,
so it's pretty special

958
01:04:32,040 --> 01:04:33,360
to be part of it.

959
01:04:38,640 --> 01:04:42,280
Ingenuity's place in history
is assured.

960
01:04:42,280 --> 01:04:46,080
Initially, it was only designed
to survive for three months and make

961
01:04:46,080 --> 01:04:47,400
just five flights.

962
01:04:48,720 --> 01:04:54,400
But over a year later, it was still
going strong, making 20 flights,

963
01:04:54,400 --> 01:04:58,320
clocking up over 36 minutes'
total flight time,

964
01:04:58,320 --> 01:05:00,240
and covering over 4km.

965
01:05:01,520 --> 01:05:06,000
But its real contribution
to the mission may still be to come.

966
01:05:07,880 --> 01:05:12,240
If the helicopter can make
it to the delta, this ability to fly

967
01:05:12,240 --> 01:05:14,280
over the steep slopes and cliffs

968
01:05:14,280 --> 01:05:17,640
that the rover can't access
will prove invaluable.

969
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:24,200
But even reaching the delta
will be an enormous challenge.

970
01:05:25,840 --> 01:05:30,560
And just before our seven-day rover
mission began, Ingenuity attempted

971
01:05:30,560 --> 01:05:32,880
the next flight on that journey.

972
01:05:34,920 --> 01:05:40,280
It's very exciting, actually,
because yesterday, Earth time,

973
01:05:40,280 --> 01:05:43,840
the helicopter flew and we don't
know what happened to it.

974
01:05:43,840 --> 01:05:46,800
Actually, the data came down last
night, and this is the meeting

975
01:05:46,800 --> 01:05:48,120
where the engineering teams

976
01:05:48,120 --> 01:05:50,760
look at the data from the
helicopter, and see what it did.

977
01:05:50,760 --> 01:05:53,800
And they've allowed us... It wasn't
clear they were going to do this,

978
01:05:53,800 --> 01:05:56,960
but they've allowed us to go
into the meeting and watch

979
01:05:56,960 --> 01:06:01,520
as they review the engineering data
from the flight.

980
01:06:08,760 --> 01:06:12,040
This is a make or break
flight for Ingenuity.

981
01:06:14,680 --> 01:06:18,000
Rather than taking the long
way round to the delta,

982
01:06:18,000 --> 01:06:20,280
it's going to attempt to take
a short cut

983
01:06:20,280 --> 01:06:22,800
across the treacherous
Seitah sand dunes.

984
01:06:24,480 --> 01:06:27,080
But the helicopter relies
on Perseverance

985
01:06:27,080 --> 01:06:29,480
for its communication with Earth.

986
01:06:29,480 --> 01:06:32,360
And this journey will take
the vehicles further apart

987
01:06:32,360 --> 01:06:33,720
than ever before.

988
01:06:33,720 --> 01:06:37,920
So a safe landing in a spot
where it can maintain radio contact

989
01:06:37,920 --> 01:06:40,160
with the rover will be crucial.

990
01:06:56,920 --> 01:06:59,560
As the team go
through the flight data,

991
01:06:59,560 --> 01:07:02,200
there's a nervous wait.

992
01:07:24,040 --> 01:07:28,080
These are the pictures Ingenuity
took during the flight.

993
01:07:29,040 --> 01:07:30,560
As it looks down at its shadow,

994
01:07:30,560 --> 01:07:34,440
we can track its path as it rises
ten metres into the air,

995
01:07:34,440 --> 01:07:38,320
then traverses the 370 metres
to its new landing spot...

996
01:07:41,000 --> 01:07:43,960
..from where it should be able
to stay in communication

997
01:07:43,960 --> 01:07:46,920
with Perseverance
as it drives to the delta.

998
01:07:59,840 --> 01:08:02,280
That's really interesting,

999
01:08:02,280 --> 01:08:06,080
and what really strikes me is that

1000
01:08:06,080 --> 01:08:10,520
this helicopter was not
really designed to last this long.

1001
01:08:10,520 --> 01:08:13,200
They thought it would maybe fly
four or five times.

1002
01:08:13,200 --> 01:08:15,960
It's now had its 21st
flight, and it's all working

1003
01:08:15,960 --> 01:08:17,840
and it's recharging properly.

1004
01:08:17,840 --> 01:08:21,080
So it's a, you know, it's a
tremendous engineering achievement.

1005
01:08:22,160 --> 01:08:25,320
Remember you're flying a little
helicopter autonomously

1006
01:08:25,320 --> 01:08:27,640
on the surface of another planet.

1007
01:08:27,640 --> 01:08:30,360
Nobody's flying it,
it's flying itself.

1008
01:08:37,840 --> 01:08:40,480
If you told the 12-year-old me

1009
01:08:40,480 --> 01:08:42,320
who first wrote to JPL

1010
01:08:42,320 --> 01:08:44,120
that one day I'd be here

1011
01:08:44,120 --> 01:08:48,960
seeing a helicopter fly on Mars,
I wouldn't have believed it.

1012
01:08:50,480 --> 01:08:54,960
But Ingenuity is just one of many
reminders of how far our

1013
01:08:54,960 --> 01:08:56,720
technology has advanced.

1014
01:09:00,720 --> 01:09:05,120
This is a piece of history
because this is the first picture

1015
01:09:05,120 --> 01:09:08,400
ever returned of the surface
of Mars by spacecraft.

1016
01:09:08,400 --> 01:09:10,880
It's Mariner 4, 1965.

1017
01:09:10,880 --> 01:09:14,600
And you might see actually,
it's kind of a fuzzy picture.

1018
01:09:14,600 --> 01:09:16,680
It's actually hand-drawn.

1019
01:09:16,680 --> 01:09:21,000
These are strips of tape that came
out of the printer with numbers

1020
01:09:21,000 --> 01:09:24,320
printed on, which are the data
from the cameras on Mariner 4,

1021
01:09:24,320 --> 01:09:26,360
and they correspond to colours.

1022
01:09:26,360 --> 01:09:28,040
And the data link was so slow

1023
01:09:28,040 --> 01:09:30,480
that the engineers and,
in particular,

1024
01:09:30,480 --> 01:09:32,720
one engineer called Richard Grumm,

1025
01:09:32,720 --> 01:09:34,360
got so bored with waiting

1026
01:09:34,360 --> 01:09:37,000
that he went to an art shop
in Pasadena,

1027
01:09:37,000 --> 01:09:38,640
bought these crayons,

1028
01:09:38,640 --> 01:09:42,720
these are the real ones, in this
box, and then sat there colouring

1029
01:09:42,720 --> 01:09:45,960
it in so he could see the image
from Mariner.

1030
01:09:51,760 --> 01:09:54,720
Compare that to the high resolution
images that we're getting

1031
01:09:54,720 --> 01:09:56,400
back from Perseverance.

1032
01:09:57,600 --> 01:09:58,640
Yeah.

1033
01:09:58,640 --> 01:10:00,880
There's technology marching on.

1034
01:10:31,000 --> 01:10:32,120
Day six begins.

1035
01:10:34,720 --> 01:10:39,440
And once again, we're waiting
to hear from Perseverance.

1036
01:10:39,440 --> 01:10:43,240
Overnight, it should have received
the instructions for the delayed

1037
01:10:43,240 --> 01:10:46,000
second half of its two-day drive.

1038
01:10:50,240 --> 01:10:53,680
And the incoming data reveals
an astonishing day

1039
01:10:53,680 --> 01:10:55,120
of auto nav driving.

1040
01:10:57,160 --> 01:11:02,040
Perseverance has recorded the second
furthest distance any Martian rover

1041
01:11:02,040 --> 01:11:04,720
has ever travelled in a single day.

1042
01:11:04,720 --> 01:11:08,720
297 metres and 60 centimetres.

1043
01:11:11,120 --> 01:11:15,160
So far this week, the rover
has covered over 760 metres.

1044
01:11:16,200 --> 01:11:21,120
But with only one day to go in our
time at JPL, La Orotava crater

1045
01:11:21,120 --> 01:11:23,840
is still nearly half
a kilometre away.

1046
01:11:27,640 --> 01:11:31,960
It will take a Herculean effort
to reach there tomorrow.

1047
01:11:31,960 --> 01:11:34,720
And while Vandi and the rover
driving team build the plan

1048
01:11:34,720 --> 01:11:35,840
for that drive...

1049
01:11:39,960 --> 01:11:43,320
..I have another appointment
with Optimism in the Mars yard.

1050
01:11:50,000 --> 01:11:52,720
Today, the engineering team
are running tests on what may

1051
01:11:52,720 --> 01:11:56,440
be the most important and ambitious
system on the rover.

1052
01:11:58,800 --> 01:12:00,880
Starting move to contact.

1053
01:12:02,640 --> 01:12:06,120
All right, Greta, you can kick
off coring.

1054
01:12:06,120 --> 01:12:08,080
All right. Yep.

1055
01:12:08,080 --> 01:12:10,000
Sending coring in three, two, one.

1056
01:12:20,520 --> 01:12:23,200
Perseverance, as you can see
and hear,

1057
01:12:23,200 --> 01:12:25,160
is equipped with a drill.

1058
01:12:25,160 --> 01:12:26,600
And drills are always noisy.

1059
01:12:26,600 --> 01:12:29,440
Be less noisy on Mars, by the way,
because of the much

1060
01:12:29,440 --> 01:12:31,040
less dense atmosphere.

1061
01:12:34,240 --> 01:12:36,440
We're at a depth of 3.9mm

1062
01:12:36,440 --> 01:12:38,960
out of our target five millimetres.
Thanks, Greta.

1063
01:12:43,040 --> 01:12:47,640
On Mars, Perseverance uses exactly
the same system to collect cylinders

1064
01:12:47,640 --> 01:12:52,240
of rock that may contain key
evidence for the existence of life.

1065
01:12:53,960 --> 01:12:58,240
So far, it's collected and stored
eight samples, with room for 30

1066
01:12:58,240 --> 01:12:59,920
more when it reaches the delta.

1067
01:13:02,960 --> 01:13:07,160
And the reason that this process
is so important is that, one day,

1068
01:13:07,160 --> 01:13:10,760
these samples will hopefully
be brought back to Earth.

1069
01:13:15,160 --> 01:13:18,560
Mini Wadhwa is the science lead
for the mission that will return

1070
01:13:18,560 --> 01:13:20,960
the Martian rocks to this planet.

1071
01:13:22,280 --> 01:13:25,520
Why is it so important to bring
the samples back to Earth?

1072
01:13:25,520 --> 01:13:28,080
Because I suppose, naively,
""We've got

1073
01:13:28,080 --> 01:13:29,920
""this tremendously sophisticated
robot.

1074
01:13:29,920 --> 01:13:31,200
""It's got the samples.

1075
01:13:31,200 --> 01:13:34,600
""Why doesn't it just look
for signs of life itself?""

1076
01:13:34,600 --> 01:13:36,680
This is an incredible machine.

1077
01:13:36,680 --> 01:13:40,920
But the kinds of analyses
that we want to be able to do

1078
01:13:40,920 --> 01:13:44,480
with the samples is going to require
really the best and most

1079
01:13:44,480 --> 01:13:45,920
sophisticated instrumentation

1080
01:13:45,920 --> 01:13:47,560
that you have available on the
Earth.

1081
01:13:47,560 --> 01:13:51,440
And it's just not possible
on a small rover like that.

1082
01:13:51,440 --> 01:13:56,120
The other factor is that we want
to be able to reproduce results.

1083
01:13:56,120 --> 01:13:58,360
I mean, can you imagine
what it would be like if somebody

1084
01:13:58,360 --> 01:14:02,760
actually found evidence
of past life in these samples?

1085
01:14:02,760 --> 01:14:04,760
We'd want to verify those results,

1086
01:14:04,760 --> 01:14:06,360
and we'd want to verify them

1087
01:14:06,360 --> 01:14:07,920
in independent laboratories.

1088
01:14:07,920 --> 01:14:11,880
That's not something you can do
with a remote laboratory on Mars.

1089
01:14:11,880 --> 01:14:15,480
You've got to bring them back
here, so that the best scientists

1090
01:14:15,480 --> 01:14:18,680
and the best labs can
really have at it.

1091
01:14:18,680 --> 01:14:21,880
Yeah, I suppose it is an example
of extraordinary claims

1092
01:14:21,880 --> 01:14:25,120
require extraordinary evidence,
isn't? Exactly.

1093
01:14:27,800 --> 01:14:32,280
Bringing the samples back to Earth
will not be a trivial task.

1094
01:14:35,320 --> 01:14:38,320
To do it, engineers have designed a
mission

1095
01:14:38,320 --> 01:14:40,640
unlike anything I've ever seen.

1096
01:14:40,640 --> 01:14:42,880
It's called Mars Sample Return.

1097
01:14:46,480 --> 01:14:49,400
The Mars Sample Return mission
sounds really simple

1098
01:14:49,400 --> 01:14:50,560
as a concept, right?

1099
01:14:50,560 --> 01:14:54,040
All you've got to do is get some
samples from the surface of Mars

1100
01:14:54,040 --> 01:14:55,480
and bring them back to Earth.

1101
01:14:55,480 --> 01:14:59,720
But actually, when you hear
the engineering solution,

1102
01:14:59,720 --> 01:15:02,440
how to do that, it sounds
fantastical.

1103
01:15:04,200 --> 01:15:06,440
So there are two missions
that fly to Mars.

1104
01:15:06,440 --> 01:15:09,880
One is the so-called fetch rover,
which is a little rover,

1105
01:15:09,880 --> 01:15:12,160
which is going to land
on the surface of Mars,

1106
01:15:12,160 --> 01:15:14,880
and it's going to drive
around and it's going to pick

1107
01:15:14,880 --> 01:15:18,200
up the samples, bring them
back to an ascent vehicle,

1108
01:15:18,200 --> 01:15:20,960
which is the thing that's going
to launch those samples into orbit.

1109
01:15:23,800 --> 01:15:26,520
And then the sample thing
itself detaches away.

1110
01:15:26,520 --> 01:15:29,560
And it's only about a basketball
size, maybe a bit bigger.

1111
01:15:29,560 --> 01:15:33,160
And then another mission comes
from Earth, and it has to locate

1112
01:15:33,160 --> 01:15:36,960
this thing that's in orbit somewhere
around Mars, and then it has to kind

1113
01:15:36,960 --> 01:15:39,280
of go and grab it in space.

1114
01:15:39,280 --> 01:15:42,200
And then when it gets to Earth,
it'll detach,

1115
01:15:42,200 --> 01:15:45,440
with this precious cargo in it, will
enter the Earth's atmosphere.

1116
01:15:45,440 --> 01:15:47,320
No rockets, no parachutes.

1117
01:15:48,400 --> 01:15:52,400
It will just impact into the sand
somewhere in Utah.

1118
01:15:52,400 --> 01:15:56,000
And then they'll go and find it
and bring it back into laboratories.

1119
01:15:56,000 --> 01:16:00,200
And that, believe it or not,
is the simplest and safest

1120
01:16:00,200 --> 01:16:04,840
engineering solution to bringing
something about that big, filled

1121
01:16:04,840 --> 01:16:07,520
with samples from Mars,
back to Earth.

1122
01:16:16,680 --> 01:16:19,200
Now, all that might sound
like science fiction, but actually

1123
01:16:19,200 --> 01:16:23,400
it's going to have to become science
fact pretty soon, because the first

1124
01:16:23,400 --> 01:16:27,240
bits of the sample return mission
is supposed to launch in 2026,

1125
01:16:27,240 --> 01:16:30,200
which is only, what, about four
years away.

1126
01:16:30,200 --> 01:16:31,760
They're preparing for it now.

1127
01:16:31,760 --> 01:16:35,200
In fact, up there - see that tower?

1128
01:16:35,200 --> 01:16:36,720
That's the test-bed

1129
01:16:36,720 --> 01:16:41,520
for the dropping the capsule
that returns those samples to Earth,

1130
01:16:41,520 --> 01:16:44,360
to see, when it hits the ground,
if it survives.

1131
01:16:44,360 --> 01:16:47,160
So it is not an exaggeration to say,

1132
01:16:47,160 --> 01:16:49,880
as I'm going to say it, that I think

1133
01:16:49,880 --> 01:16:53,680
the best engineers in the world
are working on this project.

1134
01:16:57,400 --> 01:17:00,520
Here at JPL,
development is well under way.

1135
01:17:01,840 --> 01:17:04,560
They're already testing the systems
that will launch the rocket

1136
01:17:04,560 --> 01:17:06,360
from the surface of Mars.

1137
01:17:09,680 --> 01:17:13,480
And the capsule that will crash
into the Utah desert.

1138
01:17:14,680 --> 01:17:18,000
If all goes to plan, the samples
collected on Mars could be returned

1139
01:17:18,000 --> 01:17:21,520
to Earth by as early as 2031.

1140
01:17:25,560 --> 01:17:27,920
It's undoubtedly a risky mission.

1141
01:17:30,600 --> 01:17:34,240
But there may also be risks
when the Martian rocks are safely

1142
01:17:34,240 --> 01:17:35,280
back on Earth.

1143
01:17:37,040 --> 01:17:41,360
And that's what I want to
investigate on my last day at JPL.

1144
01:17:59,720 --> 01:18:03,240
Bringing Martian samples back
to Earth is going to be vital

1145
01:18:03,240 --> 01:18:07,000
if we're ever going to prove that
there was life on Mars.

1146
01:18:09,640 --> 01:18:14,160
But there is an outside possibility
that those samples could also cause

1147
01:18:14,160 --> 01:18:16,200
a problem for life on Earth.

1148
01:18:17,600 --> 01:18:19,320
Welcome.

1149
01:18:19,320 --> 01:18:23,600
Oh, I mean, I've got to say,
there are badges of every mission

1150
01:18:23,600 --> 01:18:25,200
that I grew up with here.

1151
01:18:25,200 --> 01:18:26,720
So what's this room?

1152
01:18:26,720 --> 01:18:28,960
This is the spacecraft
assembly facility.

1153
01:18:28,960 --> 01:18:31,080
It's where all of the magic happens.

1154
01:18:31,080 --> 01:18:35,720
Every single spacecraft built at JPL
was assembled in this room.

1155
01:18:36,680 --> 01:18:40,440
Moogega Cooper is one of the people
whose job it is to make sure

1156
01:18:40,440 --> 01:18:42,400
that our planet stays safe.

1157
01:18:43,440 --> 01:18:45,680
So you have one of the best
job titles, I think,

1158
01:18:45,680 --> 01:18:49,480
which is Planetary Protection Lead
for Mars 2020.

1159
01:18:49,480 --> 01:18:51,840
So what is planetary protection?

1160
01:18:51,840 --> 01:18:53,960
Planetary protection is two-fold.

1161
01:18:53,960 --> 01:18:56,800
We have to make sure that,
as we send spacecraft

1162
01:18:56,800 --> 01:18:58,840
out into the solar system,

1163
01:18:58,840 --> 01:19:03,000
whether to planets, moons or
asteroids, we have to make sure

1164
01:19:03,000 --> 01:19:06,560
that we don't spread our
contaminants to those places

1165
01:19:06,560 --> 01:19:08,880
of interest, especially
if it could harbour life.

1166
01:19:08,880 --> 01:19:12,360
And the flip side,
if we were to bring samples back

1167
01:19:12,360 --> 01:19:15,040
to our own planet, we have to make
sure our planet is protected

1168
01:19:15,040 --> 01:19:18,080
from anything that might be harmful
out there.

1169
01:19:18,080 --> 01:19:21,720
So are we worried about microbes
from Mars? Yeah.

1170
01:19:21,720 --> 01:19:25,040
In fact, the assumption is to handle
it as if it's hazardous

1171
01:19:25,040 --> 01:19:26,560
until proven otherwise.

1172
01:19:26,560 --> 01:19:28,960
The level of precaution
that is going to be taken

1173
01:19:28,960 --> 01:19:32,400
with these samples is that
of a hazardous material.

1174
01:19:32,400 --> 01:19:34,840
So when we bring the samples back,

1175
01:19:34,840 --> 01:19:37,520
so we've heard this audacious idea -

1176
01:19:37,520 --> 01:19:40,200
I mean, Mars sample return
is terrifying, from an engineering

1177
01:19:40,200 --> 01:19:43,520
perspective - but essentially
you're going to crash it into Utah.

1178
01:19:43,520 --> 01:19:44,880
Right. A controlled crash.

1179
01:19:44,880 --> 01:19:46,520
I know that's not the language.

1180
01:19:46,520 --> 01:19:49,560
There's going to be a controlled
descent... There we go.

1181
01:19:49,560 --> 01:19:52,240
..without parachutes, into Utah.

1182
01:19:52,240 --> 01:19:54,680
So what is the procedure
from then on?

1183
01:19:54,680 --> 01:19:56,760
So you have this capsule,
sealed capsule...

1184
01:19:56,760 --> 01:19:59,000
Yeah. ..in the desert.
What happens to it?

1185
01:19:59,000 --> 01:20:03,240
The goal in general is to take
that capsule, bring it to a facility

1186
01:20:03,240 --> 01:20:07,040
that is unlike any facility
that exists today on our planet,

1187
01:20:07,040 --> 01:20:10,680
to safely contain anything
that might be in that sample

1188
01:20:10,680 --> 01:20:12,960
while we open it up, extract
the samples

1189
01:20:12,960 --> 01:20:15,240
and interrogate it scientifically.

1190
01:20:15,240 --> 01:20:17,240
So it will be a... It will be...

1191
01:20:17,240 --> 01:20:20,040
We will build a bio lab
like no other.

1192
01:20:20,040 --> 01:20:22,000
Exactly. Essentially. Yeah.

1193
01:20:25,160 --> 01:20:28,920
For the Martian samples, Nasa
is planning on creating the most

1194
01:20:28,920 --> 01:20:31,240
biosecure laboratory ever built.

1195
01:20:32,920 --> 01:20:36,480
More secure than the labs
like these that handle lethal

1196
01:20:36,480 --> 01:20:38,880
diseases like Ebola and smallpox.

1197
01:20:41,520 --> 01:20:44,600
But while taking all possible
precautions is definitely the right

1198
01:20:44,600 --> 01:20:45,840
thing to do...

1199
01:20:47,800 --> 01:20:50,080
..it's probably
too late to protect us

1200
01:20:50,080 --> 01:20:51,720
from Martian contamination.

1201
01:20:53,120 --> 01:20:55,840
When we speak about planetary
protection, that sort of gives

1202
01:20:55,840 --> 01:20:59,040
the sense that Mars and Earth
are completely isolated

1203
01:20:59,040 --> 01:21:00,280
from each other.

1204
01:21:00,280 --> 01:21:04,080
But that's certainly not
the case because this

1205
01:21:04,080 --> 01:21:05,480
is a piece of Mars.

1206
01:21:06,480 --> 01:21:11,960
It's from a Martian meteorite
that fell in Nigeria in 1962.

1207
01:21:11,960 --> 01:21:16,120
Now, that raises an interesting
possibility, because if rocks

1208
01:21:16,120 --> 01:21:18,360
can be transferred from Mars
to Earth,

1209
01:21:18,360 --> 01:21:21,160
and actually about 500kg of Mars

1210
01:21:21,160 --> 01:21:24,320
floats down onto the Earth every
year,

1211
01:21:24,320 --> 01:21:27,080
then maybe so can life.

1212
01:21:29,800 --> 01:21:33,560
The idea that life could migrate
between the planets

1213
01:21:33,560 --> 01:21:35,920
may sound incredible.

1214
01:21:35,920 --> 01:21:39,520
But there are scientists who believe
it's possible that life

1215
01:21:39,520 --> 01:21:42,560
could have arisen on Earth
and been carried to Mars

1216
01:21:42,560 --> 01:21:43,680
on a meteorite.

1217
01:21:47,520 --> 01:21:52,720
And it's also possible that life
began on Mars and was transported

1218
01:21:52,720 --> 01:21:53,760
to the Earth.

1219
01:21:57,040 --> 01:21:59,480
Now, we don't know if that happened.

1220
01:22:01,080 --> 01:22:04,000
But a key step towards finding out

1221
01:22:04,000 --> 01:22:06,680
would be to find traces
of life on Mars.

1222
01:22:08,760 --> 01:22:13,600
And it certainly adds an extra
dimension to Perseverance's mission.

1223
01:22:21,400 --> 01:22:25,200
As our week at JPL comes
to a close, we get a final

1224
01:22:25,200 --> 01:22:27,000
update from Perseverance.

1225
01:22:30,360 --> 01:22:33,240
It's still trundling
towards La Orotava.

1226
01:22:34,600 --> 01:22:37,880
The telemetry showing
it's completed another

1227
01:22:37,880 --> 01:22:41,440
240 metres and 70 centimetres
of auto nav driving.

1228
01:22:43,680 --> 01:22:47,440
It's 200 metres short
of the crater.

1229
01:22:47,440 --> 01:22:51,040
But it's still been a remarkable
week.

1230
01:22:51,040 --> 01:22:53,680
So are you happy with the way
the rover's performed?

1231
01:22:53,680 --> 01:22:57,120
Because I know that this was a big
week for you, making this transition

1232
01:22:57,120 --> 01:23:00,720
from the first scientific
campaign to the long drive

1233
01:23:00,720 --> 01:23:01,840
around to the delta.

1234
01:23:01,840 --> 01:23:03,680
Yes, this was a big week
for the mission

1235
01:23:03,680 --> 01:23:04,800
and a major turning point.

1236
01:23:04,800 --> 01:23:07,320
We've been moving our way slowly
through the crater floor.

1237
01:23:07,320 --> 01:23:10,240
But now with this goal of getting
to the delta as quickly as possible,

1238
01:23:10,240 --> 01:23:14,160
we're really flexing the rover's
legs, so to speak, and trying

1239
01:23:14,160 --> 01:23:15,360
out a new mode of operation.

1240
01:23:15,360 --> 01:23:18,200
And that led to some unexpected
surprises for us.

1241
01:23:18,200 --> 01:23:20,240
Yeah, that's what I find
really interesting.

1242
01:23:20,240 --> 01:23:22,800
What I've learned is that, even
though you know this rover

1243
01:23:22,800 --> 01:23:27,240
well, now, the moment you ask
it to do something slightly

1244
01:23:27,240 --> 01:23:30,240
different, then you learn
a lot more about the rover.

1245
01:23:30,240 --> 01:23:33,080
But the way it behaves on Mars
and that terrain

1246
01:23:33,080 --> 01:23:34,760
can always surprise us.

1247
01:23:38,680 --> 01:23:43,160
This is the rover's eye view
of the journey it's made this week.

1248
01:23:43,160 --> 01:23:47,040
Even with the hiccups, the drill
stuck in a rock, and the day lost

1249
01:23:47,040 --> 01:23:48,600
to a software error,

1250
01:23:48,600 --> 01:23:52,600
Perseverance has still covered
over a kilometre.

1251
01:23:52,600 --> 01:23:58,000
At 1003 metres, it's the furthest
any planetary rover has ever

1252
01:23:58,000 --> 01:24:00,880
travelled in such a short
space of time.

1253
01:24:10,040 --> 01:24:12,800
JPL's motto is Dare Mighty Things.

1254
01:24:14,520 --> 01:24:18,600
And after spending a week watching
Perseverance drive over the surface

1255
01:24:18,600 --> 01:24:20,880
of Mars in search of alien life,

1256
01:24:20,880 --> 01:24:24,680
my overriding impression is that
that is entirely appropriate.

1257
01:24:24,680 --> 01:24:28,120
The sheer engineering excellence,

1258
01:24:28,120 --> 01:24:29,920
the attention to detail,

1259
01:24:29,920 --> 01:24:35,000
the teamwork required to do that
is nothing short of astounding.

1260
01:24:35,000 --> 01:24:40,320
It turns out that, if we try to
answer the most profound questions,

1261
01:24:40,320 --> 01:24:43,320
to acquire new knowledge
about the universe, not

1262
01:24:43,320 --> 01:24:48,000
because it's useful in some sense,
but just because we want to know,

1263
01:24:48,000 --> 01:24:49,880
brings out the best in us.

1264
01:25:00,120 --> 01:25:02,520
But the end of our week at JPL

1265
01:25:02,520 --> 01:25:04,560
is not the end of the story.

1266
01:25:06,720 --> 01:25:10,120
Several weeks later,
Ingenuity is still flying.

1267
01:25:11,600 --> 01:25:14,440
It's now clocked up almost an hour
of flight time,

1268
01:25:14,440 --> 01:25:18,360
and is still sending
back remarkable aerial photographs,

1269
01:25:18,360 --> 01:25:20,320
including these images

1270
01:25:20,320 --> 01:25:22,200
of the mission's parachute

1271
01:25:22,200 --> 01:25:23,920
and protective back shell,

1272
01:25:23,920 --> 01:25:27,120
that were last seen as they were
jettisoned on the descent

1273
01:25:27,120 --> 01:25:28,920
on to the Martian surface.

1274
01:25:30,760 --> 01:25:34,480
Ingenuity made it to the delta
in another seven hops

1275
01:25:34,480 --> 01:25:36,360
across the Seitah sand dunes.

1276
01:25:39,320 --> 01:25:41,640
And the rover kept on driving.

1277
01:25:44,040 --> 01:25:48,880
Covering the remaining 4km in just
31 days,

1278
01:25:48,880 --> 01:25:53,200
capturing some truly wonderful
pictures, as it approached the steep

1279
01:25:53,200 --> 01:25:54,680
scarps of the Delta.

1280
01:25:56,800 --> 01:25:59,920
The rover and helicopter
are already investigating

1281
01:25:59,920 --> 01:26:01,960
the delta sedimentary rocks.

1282
01:26:04,000 --> 01:26:08,720
And have begun searching them
for the faint signs of ancient life.

1283
01:26:09,880 --> 01:26:12,000
Whatever Perseverance finds,

1284
01:26:12,000 --> 01:26:16,760
it will tell us something
important about ourselves.

1285
01:26:23,920 --> 01:26:26,520
I think there are three
possibilities for what Perseverance

1286
01:26:26,520 --> 01:26:28,800
might find on Mars.

1287
01:26:28,800 --> 01:26:32,760
One, which sounds like the most
disappointing possibility,

1288
01:26:32,760 --> 01:26:34,840
is it sees no sign of life at all.

1289
01:26:34,840 --> 01:26:38,800
If we establish that there was water
in Jezero Crater,

1290
01:26:38,800 --> 01:26:41,680
all the conditions
were right - geological activity,

1291
01:26:41,680 --> 01:26:43,240
all the right ingredients,

1292
01:26:43,240 --> 01:26:46,120
and yet, life did not begin.

1293
01:26:46,120 --> 01:26:49,880
Then that may be telling us
that we're alone, certainly

1294
01:26:49,880 --> 01:26:51,280
in our neighbourhood.

1295
01:26:51,280 --> 01:26:54,520
The second possibility
is that we find life.

1296
01:26:54,520 --> 01:26:58,480
But the life is very similar
to life here on Earth.

1297
01:26:58,480 --> 01:27:00,320
That would be... It would be
wonderful.

1298
01:27:00,320 --> 01:27:02,880
We'd know that there are two
planets in our solar system

1299
01:27:02,880 --> 01:27:04,280
that are living worlds.

1300
01:27:04,280 --> 01:27:07,440
But it might suggest that
there was only one genesis

1301
01:27:07,440 --> 01:27:08,840
in our solar system.

1302
01:27:08,840 --> 01:27:12,520
But we know that material
moves from Mars to Earth.

1303
01:27:12,520 --> 01:27:15,640
We have Martian meteorites
here, and from Earth to Mars.

1304
01:27:15,640 --> 01:27:20,320
And so, then, I suppose, the story
becomes, ""Where did life begin?""

1305
01:27:20,320 --> 01:27:23,840
It is certainly possible that life
began on Mars,

1306
01:27:23,840 --> 01:27:27,160
and was transferred
here to Earth.

1307
01:27:27,160 --> 01:27:29,920
I suppose, in that sense,
we're Martians.

1308
01:27:29,920 --> 01:27:31,800
What a discovery that would be.

1309
01:27:33,560 --> 01:27:37,560
The third possibility is
that we find signs that life existed

1310
01:27:37,560 --> 01:27:40,560
on Mars, and that life is
very different to the life we see

1311
01:27:40,560 --> 01:27:42,920
here on Earth - has a different
biochemistry.

1312
01:27:42,920 --> 01:27:45,160
There was a different genesis.

1313
01:27:45,160 --> 01:27:47,440
That would mean that life began

1314
01:27:47,440 --> 01:27:51,120
separately in two places
in our solar system,

1315
01:27:51,120 --> 01:27:54,080
and that will tell us a tremendous
amount, because it will tell us

1316
01:27:54,080 --> 01:27:57,120
that we can assume that wherever
the conditions

1317
01:27:57,120 --> 01:27:59,840
are right, life begins.

1318
01:27:59,840 --> 01:28:02,560
That will be a profound discovery,

1319
01:28:02,560 --> 01:28:04,480
will change the way we think

1320
01:28:04,480 --> 01:28:05,800
of our universe,

1321
01:28:05,800 --> 01:28:10,160
because it will mean that we are in
a living universe.

1322
01:28:10,160 --> 01:28:12,520
It should change the way you look at
those points of light

1323
01:28:12,520 --> 01:28:13,720
in the sky.

1324
01:28:13,720 --> 01:28:16,360
Many of them, most of them
have planets around them.

1325
01:28:16,360 --> 01:28:19,880
And I think we'll be able to assume
that a good number of them

1326
01:28:19,880 --> 01:28:21,200
are living worlds.
