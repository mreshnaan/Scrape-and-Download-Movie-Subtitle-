00:01:41,726 --> 00:01:43,561
Hey, Mom! Your book!

2
00:01:43,603 --> 00:01:46,398
William, c'mon,
Ludo, that's us!

3
00:01:47,232 --> 00:01:49,234
<i>Christmas Kills Me</i>

4
00:02:43,788 --> 00:02:46,166
Madame, the bathroom, please?

5
00:02:46,207 --> 00:02:48,126
I don't know.

6
00:02:51,755 --> 00:02:54,007
FOR SALE

7
00:04:07,747 --> 00:04:09,082
You bastard!

8
00:04:50,206 --> 00:04:52,625
Goddamn winter!

9
00:05:26,659 --> 00:05:28,661
THANKS FOR EVERYTHING

10
00:05:58,024 --> 00:06:00,068
One peep during the interview,

11
00:06:00,110 --> 00:06:02,654
you'll get socks for Christmas. Got it?

12
00:06:06,032 --> 00:06:10,328
She's wife of Minister Pierre Mercier
and sister of Christine C,

13
00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:14,124
who wrote the hit we played,
<i>Thanks for Everything!</i>

14
00:06:14,165 --> 00:06:17,752
Above all, she's the author
of the wonderful blog,

15
00:06:17,794 --> 00:06:19,004
<i>My Life Kills Me.
</i>- Right.

16
00:06:19,045 --> 00:06:20,839
Our guest is Marianne Cyr

17
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:24,259
who'll fill us in
on her alter ego, Mom on the Run.

18
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:27,762
She's accompanied by
her two little devils,

19
00:06:27,804 --> 00:06:31,016
whose antics we follow on the blog

20
00:06:31,057 --> 00:06:35,145
under their nicknames,
Destroyer and Kamikaze.

21
00:06:35,186 --> 00:06:37,063
Hi, Marianne.
Hello.

22
00:06:37,105 --> 00:06:41,443
With a politician husband,
two young kids at home, a blog,

23
00:06:41,484 --> 00:06:43,403
your charity work...
Yes.

24
00:06:43,445 --> 00:06:46,531
And a third book, <i>Christmas Kills Me...</i>

25
00:06:46,573 --> 00:06:48,950
how do you find time for yourself?

26
00:06:48,992 --> 00:06:50,869
It's simple, I don't.

27
00:06:53,663 --> 00:06:58,209
She has a nanny, cleaning lady,
trainer, husband and therapist...

28
00:06:58,251 --> 00:07:00,754
No wonder she has no time, Christ!

29
00:07:01,713 --> 00:07:02,713
Sorry.

30
00:07:03,089 --> 00:07:05,050
Where was I?

31
00:07:06,593 --> 00:07:08,428
Can I help you?

32
00:07:08,970 --> 00:07:10,388
I know how to count.

33
00:07:12,265 --> 00:07:15,560
Are you the Charlotte Cantin
who's famous?

34
00:07:15,602 --> 00:07:17,604
<i>Cardin? </i>Charlotte Cardin?

35
00:07:18,313 --> 00:07:19,981
Right, Cardin!

36
00:07:20,023 --> 00:07:21,608
No, I'm Christine C.

37
00:07:22,108 --> 00:07:24,569
C?
It's for Cyr.

38
00:07:24,611 --> 00:07:25,945
Christine Cyr.

39
00:07:29,741 --> 00:07:31,284
Are you an actress?

40
00:07:31,326 --> 00:07:33,661
No, I'm a singer.

41
00:07:34,954 --> 00:07:36,831
I just sang here.

42
00:07:39,918 --> 00:07:43,338
Right. 10, 20, 25...

43
00:07:44,631 --> 00:07:46,800
I am your father!

44
00:07:51,554 --> 00:07:52,972
Sir, please?

45
00:07:59,646 --> 00:08:00,605
Hello?

46
00:08:00,647 --> 00:08:02,982
<i>Why don't you return my calls?</i>

47
00:08:03,608 --> 00:08:06,486
I'll block your number, Bruno.
Stop calling!

48
00:08:07,445 --> 00:08:09,447
I have to see you! I'll die!

49
00:08:09,489 --> 00:08:11,199
What's left to say?

50
00:08:11,241 --> 00:08:12,450
Keep your coat on.

51
00:08:12,992 --> 00:08:14,536
I'm hot!
<i>I love you.</i>

52
00:08:14,577 --> 00:08:16,705
Is that Dad?
No, it's not.

53
00:08:16,746 --> 00:08:19,082
Don't touch, it's fragile!

54
00:08:19,124 --> 00:08:21,835
I need to see you.
I just want to talk.

55
00:08:22,252 --> 00:08:24,587
I can't. And it's not a good idea.

56
00:08:24,629 --> 00:08:26,381
<i>One hour, Marianne. Just an hour!</i>

57
00:08:27,465 --> 00:08:29,300
Let time do its work.

58
00:08:30,844 --> 00:08:31,970
I'll die!

59
00:08:32,512 --> 00:08:34,848
No, you won't. People don't die from...

60
00:08:37,809 --> 00:08:39,519
Is there someone else?

61
00:08:39,561 --> 00:08:42,355
Shit, there's someone else.
Who is he?

62
00:08:42,397 --> 00:08:44,190
Of course there is, I'm married.

63
00:08:45,066 --> 00:08:48,987
I have to go.
No! Just an hour, Marianne. Please!

64
00:08:49,029 --> 00:08:52,198
I can't sleep.
I can't stop thinking about you.

65
00:08:53,241 --> 00:08:54,409
I want to see you.

66
00:08:55,535 --> 00:08:59,205
Wednesday at 10. Half an hour.
It's the last time. OK?

67
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:02,042
Yes! Our café?

68
00:09:02,083 --> 00:09:06,129
It's not <i>our </i>café, it's <i>a </i>café.
OK, I have to go.

69
00:09:06,171 --> 00:09:09,049
What are you two up to? Seriously!

70
00:09:52,384 --> 00:09:54,094
EVENT ROOM

71
00:10:18,451 --> 00:10:21,413
<i>Hello?
</i>- Élyse Laberge?

72
00:10:21,454 --> 00:10:22,831
Yes, speaking.

73
00:10:22,872 --> 00:10:27,627
<i>Jean-Paul Cyr. I'd like to meet.
I have something to show you...</i>

74
00:10:28,211 --> 00:10:33,258
How much would information
about your ex-husband be worth?

75
00:10:33,299 --> 00:10:34,843
<i>What do you mean?</i>

76
00:10:34,884 --> 00:10:39,639
<i>I know where he is.
I have pictures of him. Lots.</i>

77
00:11:14,007 --> 00:11:15,175
Finally!

78
00:11:17,344 --> 00:11:19,304
Daddy!
Hey, big boy!

79
00:11:19,346 --> 00:11:21,264
C'mere, sweetie.

80
00:11:21,306 --> 00:11:23,308
Did you have a good day?
Yes.

81
00:11:26,353 --> 00:11:27,854
I hate Christmas!

82
00:11:29,439 --> 00:11:31,983
Can I make you a drink?
<i>One </i>drink?

83
00:11:35,278 --> 00:11:36,988
Stop! Stop!

84
00:11:37,030 --> 00:11:38,448
You have to share!

85
00:13:15,545 --> 00:13:18,256
No, not here, please!

86
00:13:29,309 --> 00:13:32,312
Another ten days of
bloody Christmas spirit.

87
00:13:32,812 --> 00:13:35,231
I can't wait for it to be over!

88
00:13:35,940 --> 00:13:38,943
Since you're so cheery,
my older kids asked

89
00:13:39,486 --> 00:13:42,822
if their mom could
celebrate Christmas here.

90
00:13:44,115 --> 00:13:45,158
Again?

91
00:13:46,117 --> 00:13:48,578
She's come the last five years.

92
00:13:48,620 --> 00:13:52,499
Your family's welcome.
The boys'd love to see your sister.

93
00:13:53,166 --> 00:13:55,001
You know she's still mad.

94
00:13:55,043 --> 00:13:57,796
It's been a year. Reach out.

95
00:13:57,837 --> 00:14:01,675
After her meltdown at New Year's,
she owes me an apology.

96
00:14:03,051 --> 00:14:04,177
What?

97
00:14:05,178 --> 00:14:09,140
If I'm not mistaken,
I recall you threw a glass of wine...

98
00:14:09,182 --> 00:14:11,518
It was an accident, I tripped.

99
00:14:14,521 --> 00:14:17,941
We miss her CD launch
and she reacts like...

100
00:14:17,982 --> 00:14:20,318
like I'd given her cancer.

101
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:24,322
She and her boyfriend spent
all their savings producing it.

102
00:14:24,364 --> 00:14:27,158
And? It flopped, like I warned.

103
00:14:27,701 --> 00:14:29,953
One of her songs was a hit.

104
00:14:33,623 --> 00:14:37,210
Why doesn't your ex celebrate
with her boyfriend?

105
00:14:37,544 --> 00:14:39,004
'Cause...

106
00:14:39,045 --> 00:14:41,006
he dumped her.

107
00:14:41,047 --> 00:14:42,966
And she's...

108
00:14:43,008 --> 00:14:46,886
probably depressed...
and possibly ready to kill.

109
00:14:48,263 --> 00:14:51,391
Great, let's invite her, too.

110
00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:54,561
Three days at the cottage,
we'll manage.

111
00:15:09,117 --> 00:15:11,619
Hello.
We're looking for Marianne Cyr.

112
00:15:12,912 --> 00:15:13,913
Marianne?

113
00:15:14,914 --> 00:15:17,751
About your dad, I guess.

114
00:15:29,179 --> 00:15:32,724
Thanks again.
I didn't know who else to call.

115
00:15:32,766 --> 00:15:38,646
I'll drive you home. And tomorrow
we'll get it towed to the scrapyard.

116
00:15:38,688 --> 00:15:41,649
Scrapyard? My car?

117
00:15:41,691 --> 00:15:43,902
But I need it.

118
00:15:43,943 --> 00:15:49,532
Christine, it's 18 years old. I know
it's hard, but it's time to say goodbye.

119
00:15:49,574 --> 00:15:53,578
I have shows all over during the holidays.

120
00:15:53,620 --> 00:15:55,246
What'll I do?

121
00:15:56,164 --> 00:15:57,749
I'll lend you mine.

122
00:16:04,089 --> 00:16:06,257
Why did I ever leave you?

123
00:16:06,299 --> 00:16:07,926
Which time?

124
00:16:08,635 --> 00:16:09,886
The last one.

125
00:16:09,928 --> 00:16:11,262
The long version?

126
00:16:12,806 --> 00:16:14,140
God no!

127
00:16:18,687 --> 00:16:22,148
Need a hand?
Nah, it's all good.

128
00:16:33,493 --> 00:16:37,580
Aren't the refineries picturesque?
What were you doing here?

129
00:16:38,248 --> 00:16:40,834
A gig at a car dealership.

130
00:16:46,673 --> 00:16:50,635
Even if you were really, really nice
to help me,

131
00:16:50,677 --> 00:16:52,554
you're not coming in.

132
00:16:52,595 --> 00:16:54,597
We don't have to go in.

133
00:16:54,639 --> 00:16:57,017
We can do it in the car.

134
00:17:00,186 --> 00:17:01,855
I was joking!

135
00:17:29,549 --> 00:17:30,717
Jeez!

136
00:17:38,224 --> 00:17:39,309
Marianne?

137
00:17:41,394 --> 00:17:44,356
Don't you ever answer your phone?

138
00:17:45,357 --> 00:17:48,276
Wonderful seeing you.
A year goes by so fast.

139
00:17:48,318 --> 00:17:49,194
Bye!

140
00:17:49,235 --> 00:17:50,695
No, stop it.

141
00:17:50,737 --> 00:17:51,863
Wait, it's...

142
00:17:51,905 --> 00:17:52,822
What?

143
00:17:52,864 --> 00:17:53,865
Dad's dead.

144
00:17:53,907 --> 00:17:54,908
Dead?

145
00:17:55,408 --> 00:17:58,411
Like, how, dead?
Like, dead, dead.

146
00:17:58,453 --> 00:18:00,205
How many ways can you be dead?

147
00:18:00,246 --> 00:18:01,289
Who's dead?

148
00:18:01,331 --> 00:18:03,750
Hi.
Why hello, Olivier!

149
00:18:04,250 --> 00:18:06,211
So you're still together?

150
00:18:06,252 --> 00:18:08,713
We split up, we got together...

151
00:18:08,755 --> 00:18:11,049
And now...
No, we're not together.

152
00:18:11,091 --> 00:18:14,177
She called because her car broke down.

153
00:18:14,219 --> 00:18:16,096
So I...
He gave me a boost.

154
00:18:17,430 --> 00:18:18,807
Same old, same old.

155
00:18:18,848 --> 00:18:20,725
Who died?
Her dad.

156
00:18:20,767 --> 00:18:22,560
He's your dad too.

157
00:18:22,602 --> 00:18:24,521
He'll never see me weep.

158
00:18:24,562 --> 00:18:25,689
Duh... he's dead!

159
00:18:25,730 --> 00:18:29,067
Look, thanks for the visit,
but we're busy.

160
00:18:29,109 --> 00:18:30,777
No, look. I'm sorry.

161
00:18:31,194 --> 00:18:33,738
I'm stressed out, let's start over.

162
00:18:33,780 --> 00:18:35,240
She's stressed.

163
00:18:35,281 --> 00:18:36,616
Dad's dead.

164
00:18:38,118 --> 00:18:39,327
He died here,

165
00:18:39,369 --> 00:18:43,081
in Québec.
He collapsed in a motel room.

166
00:18:43,123 --> 00:18:44,749
Wasn't he in Panama?

167
00:18:44,791 --> 00:18:47,043
Search me.
Why a motel room?

168
00:18:47,085 --> 00:18:49,254
You'll have to ask him.

169
00:18:49,295 --> 00:18:51,423
Clear your agenda.
We have work.

170
00:18:51,464 --> 00:18:54,926
The morgue, funeral home, sell his house...

171
00:18:54,968 --> 00:18:57,095
I need it done in 3 days.

172
00:18:57,137 --> 00:18:59,097
I have Christmas to organize.

173
00:18:59,139 --> 00:19:01,016
That's just like him!

174
00:19:01,057 --> 00:19:05,937
He never calls, disappears.
Then bang, without warning...

175
00:19:05,979 --> 00:19:08,565
Thoughtless to croak like that.

176
00:19:08,606 --> 00:19:09,983
Guess I'll be off.

177
00:19:13,486 --> 00:19:15,280
I'll be off, OK?

178
00:19:29,502 --> 00:19:31,629
Yes, it's him.

179
00:19:31,671 --> 00:19:35,550
A lot of scrapes for a guy
who died of a heart attack.

180
00:19:35,592 --> 00:19:40,180
The injuries happened before.
There's no proof they're related.

181
00:19:47,604 --> 00:19:49,481
Should we say something?

182
00:19:49,522 --> 00:19:51,691
Take as much time as you need.

183
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:01,201
I'm...
Yeah, me too.

184
00:20:01,242 --> 00:20:04,204
I'm done.
I think we're good.

185
00:20:08,041 --> 00:20:10,752
Look, his phone.
What are you doing?

186
00:20:11,211 --> 00:20:13,505
Well...
Stop, it's his private life.

187
00:20:13,546 --> 00:20:17,676
Private life? He's dead.
It's still not your business.

188
00:20:17,717 --> 00:20:22,764
I'll look through my half of his stuff,
you do what you want with yours.

189
00:20:22,806 --> 00:20:23,806
Work for you?

190
00:20:24,224 --> 00:20:25,392
OK.

191
00:20:34,442 --> 00:20:37,779
What's that?
So now you're interested?

192
00:20:37,821 --> 00:20:40,990
No idea. Photos of people we don't know.

193
00:20:46,246 --> 00:20:50,208
You said it'd be quick.
I'm fed up with shelling out.

194
00:20:50,250 --> 00:20:53,128
<i>Think I do this for kicks?
I'm fed up, too.</i>

195
00:20:53,169 --> 00:20:56,715
I haven't started Christmas shopping.
My wife's on my case.

196
00:20:57,173 --> 00:20:59,050
You blew your chance!

197
00:20:59,426 --> 00:21:01,720
He surprised me. What can I say?

198
00:21:01,761 --> 00:21:05,932
You're staking out his place
and he surprises you. Way to go!

199
00:21:06,266 --> 00:21:08,184
Where is the old bastard?

200
00:21:08,226 --> 00:21:09,602
<i>I dunno.</i>

201
00:21:10,770 --> 00:21:14,399
If he talks to my ex, you're screwed too.

202
00:21:14,441 --> 00:21:16,901
You're an accessory. That's jail.

203
00:21:16,943 --> 00:21:19,320
<i>I said I'd look after him and I will.</i>

204
00:21:19,362 --> 00:21:21,364
But I have to find him first.

205
00:21:21,406 --> 00:21:23,408
<i>Goddamn scumbag.</i>

206
00:21:23,450 --> 00:21:25,493
That's him. Yada, yada, yada.

207
00:21:26,619 --> 00:21:28,747
I checked my agenda.

208
00:21:28,788 --> 00:21:32,876
I could make time for a memorial
for Dad on the 27th.

209
00:21:32,917 --> 00:21:35,795
But at the cottage - we'll all be there.

210
00:21:35,837 --> 00:21:37,213
Why a memorial?

211
00:21:37,797 --> 00:21:39,966
I dunno, to...

212
00:21:40,425 --> 00:21:42,385
to honor his...
His what?

213
00:21:42,427 --> 00:21:47,432
How he never looked after us?
How he made us move five times a year?

214
00:21:47,474 --> 00:21:50,352
How he'd disappear and forget us?
Christine...

215
00:21:50,393 --> 00:21:53,772
Or visit Mom in palliative care
with his bimbo?

216
00:21:53,813 --> 00:21:54,939
He's our father.

217
00:21:54,981 --> 00:21:59,819
His last call he asked me to write
a hit for the next Céline Dion,

218
00:21:59,861 --> 00:22:01,154
from Latin America.

219
00:22:08,161 --> 00:22:10,080
Do you want his ashes?
Yuck!

220
00:22:10,121 --> 00:22:12,832
I don't want corpse dust at home.

221
00:22:12,874 --> 00:22:17,671
We'll leave him here.
We can rent him a locker.

222
00:22:20,215 --> 00:22:22,801
Ladies, my sympathies.

223
00:22:22,842 --> 00:22:24,427
How much is a locker?

224
00:22:24,469 --> 00:22:28,556
The rental cost varies.
You have the prices there.

225
00:22:30,642 --> 00:22:32,352
$7000?

226
00:22:32,727 --> 00:22:34,646
$7000 for a locker?

227
00:22:34,979 --> 00:22:37,691
For a niche that's at eye level.

228
00:22:37,732 --> 00:22:41,319
But we have cheaper plans.
It depends on his last wishes.

229
00:22:41,361 --> 00:22:43,655
To return to his birthplace.

230
00:22:43,697 --> 00:22:49,369
I'm not going to the Magdalen Islands!
I didn't say we would. I'm answering...

231
00:22:49,411 --> 00:22:51,329
A plane ticket's $1000!

232
00:22:51,371 --> 00:22:54,165
Could you show a little decorum?

233
00:22:54,207 --> 00:22:57,877
We should've given his body to science.
His first good deed.

234
00:23:00,130 --> 00:23:02,841
I guess you won't be selecting an urn?

235
00:23:02,882 --> 00:23:04,384
It won't be necessary.

236
00:23:08,221 --> 00:23:09,597
Ladies?

237
00:23:24,446 --> 00:23:25,739
We won't stay long.

238
00:23:26,239 --> 00:23:28,533
A quick check and we hire a broker.

239
00:23:28,575 --> 00:23:30,410
I don't have time for this.

240
00:23:30,452 --> 00:23:31,369
I know.

241
00:23:31,411 --> 00:23:32,746
Your life kills you.

242
00:23:34,330 --> 00:23:39,252
I know you hate me for reasons
that might interest a therapist, but...

243
00:23:40,795 --> 00:23:43,048
Can we focus until this is done?

244
00:23:43,089 --> 00:23:45,842
Right. You have no idea why I'm pissed.

245
00:23:48,345 --> 00:23:49,763
A non-aggression pact?

246
00:23:49,804 --> 00:23:50,972
OK.

247
00:23:51,014 --> 00:23:52,140
Thanks.

248
00:23:52,599 --> 00:23:53,599
Move over!

249
00:24:02,734 --> 00:24:04,152
It's not locked?

250
00:24:04,611 --> 00:24:05,779
Anybody home?

251
00:24:12,827 --> 00:24:15,747
My god! I don't like this!

252
00:24:30,220 --> 00:24:31,805
What happened?

253
00:24:37,811 --> 00:24:39,020
Marianne!

254
00:24:43,191 --> 00:24:44,401
Careful!

255
00:24:44,442 --> 00:24:46,486
I'll call the police.
No!

256
00:24:48,113 --> 00:24:49,113
We call no one.

257
00:24:49,364 --> 00:24:51,616
Want the cops mucking around?

258
00:24:51,658 --> 00:24:55,453
Yeah, messy with a book tour
and Pierre's campaign,

259
00:24:55,495 --> 00:24:58,707
but that's blood.
Fine, call the police.

260
00:25:00,417 --> 00:25:02,502
No, hold on.

261
00:25:02,544 --> 00:25:07,007
You have to declare any act of violence
in a house for sale.

262
00:25:07,882 --> 00:25:11,594
Wouldn't you like your half
of the sale price, fast?

263
00:25:15,348 --> 00:25:16,349
OK.

264
00:25:18,018 --> 00:25:22,564
We clean up, sell the place,
split the cash and we're done.

265
00:25:22,605 --> 00:25:25,108
We'll keep it short and sweet.

266
00:25:33,366 --> 00:25:34,366
I'll call'em!

267
00:25:55,096 --> 00:25:56,139
Hello?

268
00:25:57,098 --> 00:25:58,098
<i>Hello?</i>

269
00:26:17,494 --> 00:26:19,204
What's she doing?

270
00:26:25,377 --> 00:26:26,336
Your...

271
00:26:26,378 --> 00:26:27,378
No!

272
00:26:27,879 --> 00:26:28,879
Sorry.

273
00:26:29,464 --> 00:26:30,464
Yes?

274
00:26:31,132 --> 00:26:33,551
No, it's just...

275
00:26:33,593 --> 00:26:34,552
your coat.

276
00:26:34,594 --> 00:26:36,805
It'll get soaked in the slush.

277
00:26:37,639 --> 00:26:38,932
Thanks!
OK.

278
00:26:38,973 --> 00:26:41,309
Are you the owner?

279
00:26:41,351 --> 00:26:44,312
No, the house belongs to my father.

280
00:26:45,605 --> 00:26:46,773
Are you interested?

281
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:49,109
Maybe.
Really?

282
00:26:49,150 --> 00:26:50,860
Can I speak to him?

283
00:26:50,902 --> 00:26:51,903
My father?

284
00:26:51,945 --> 00:26:55,031
No, he's not here now.

285
00:26:55,448 --> 00:26:57,450
But I'm the one selling it.

286
00:26:57,951 --> 00:27:02,455
I can't show it to you now
because we're doing repairs.

287
00:27:02,789 --> 00:27:04,457
I'll give you my number.

288
00:27:04,958 --> 00:27:06,459
So we can talk

289
00:27:06,501 --> 00:27:08,211
before I hire an agent.

290
00:27:08,878 --> 00:27:10,755
Right, good idea!

291
00:27:10,797 --> 00:27:12,841
Because with an agent,

292
00:27:13,341 --> 00:27:15,343
they take a cut and all.

293
00:27:17,846 --> 00:27:18,846
Here.

294
00:27:20,306 --> 00:27:21,975
Thanks.
Good!

295
00:27:35,321 --> 00:27:37,949
Where's that goddamn scumbag?

296
00:28:14,569 --> 00:28:16,863
I called Olivier.
And?

297
00:28:16,905 --> 00:28:18,573
He'll fix the door.

298
00:28:22,369 --> 00:28:24,371
What?
No, nothing.

299
00:28:24,412 --> 00:28:25,580
Tell me.

300
00:28:25,622 --> 00:28:29,292
It's just... you have a weird way
of not being together.

301
00:28:29,334 --> 00:28:32,170
We can be friends
even though we split up.

302
00:28:40,261 --> 00:28:41,721
Answer it.
No, you.

303
00:28:43,973 --> 00:28:46,726
<i>Hi. Could I speak to Jean-Paul?</i>

304
00:28:46,768 --> 00:28:48,561
He's not available.

305
00:28:48,603 --> 00:28:50,605
Can I take a message?

306
00:28:50,647 --> 00:28:52,023
<i>Could you tell him</i>

307
00:28:52,065 --> 00:28:54,025
<i>that Élyse called?
</i>- Élyse.

308
00:28:54,067 --> 00:28:55,735
I have what he wants.

309
00:28:55,777 --> 00:28:57,987
<i>OK, can you give me your number?</i>

310
00:28:58,613 --> 00:29:01,074
He has it. Thanks.

311
00:29:03,159 --> 00:29:04,703
What a bitch.

312
00:29:04,744 --> 00:29:07,288
<i>I'm going to your house. I love you</i>

313
00:29:07,330 --> 00:29:08,873
Please, no!

314
00:29:12,794 --> 00:29:14,671
Where are you going?

315
00:29:22,804 --> 00:29:24,514
What are they up to?

316
00:29:52,459 --> 00:29:53,626
Pierre?

317
00:29:53,668 --> 00:29:54,794
Hi!

318
00:30:00,342 --> 00:30:02,802
My dad's place is a mess!

319
00:30:04,137 --> 00:30:05,138
The boys here?

320
00:30:05,180 --> 00:30:08,933
They're at the movies with my daughter.
Your colleague's here.

321
00:30:09,809 --> 00:30:10,810
OK.

322
00:30:12,395 --> 00:30:13,730
Hi.

323
00:30:14,898 --> 00:30:17,192
I worried when you didn't come.

324
00:30:17,233 --> 00:30:18,526
You're never late.

325
00:30:18,568 --> 00:30:20,403
An emergency.

326
00:30:20,445 --> 00:30:21,780
Right.

327
00:30:21,821 --> 00:30:24,783
I couldn't reach you so I dropped by.

328
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:27,494
Your husband
told me about your dad.

329
00:30:28,411 --> 00:30:30,497
My condolences.
Yeah.

330
00:30:30,538 --> 00:30:33,541
Sorry, I didn't think to call you.

331
00:30:33,583 --> 00:30:35,960
I've been run ragged the last days.

332
00:30:36,002 --> 00:30:38,296
My dad's house and...
You work together?

333
00:30:38,338 --> 00:30:39,506
Yes.
No.

334
00:30:40,256 --> 00:30:43,426
I mean, yes, we...

335
00:30:43,468 --> 00:30:47,138
we work together at my publisher's,
but not directly.

336
00:30:47,180 --> 00:30:49,641
He freelances for my publisher.

337
00:30:49,683 --> 00:30:50,892
Her novel.

338
00:30:50,934 --> 00:30:53,228
Her stories.
That's what he meant.

339
00:30:53,269 --> 00:30:55,063
What do you do?
Not you!

340
00:30:55,647 --> 00:30:56,606
OK.

341
00:30:56,648 --> 00:30:59,234
I'm... a consultant.
Yeah.

342
00:31:00,360 --> 00:31:06,199
So if I were to call the publisher now
and ask to speak to Bruno,

343
00:31:06,700 --> 00:31:08,493
a secretary will answer,

344
00:31:08,535 --> 00:31:10,578
‟May I take a message?”

345
00:31:12,038 --> 00:31:13,498
Tell him, Marianne.

346
00:31:13,540 --> 00:31:14,541
Shut up!

347
00:31:14,582 --> 00:31:16,167
What?
Enough lies.

348
00:31:16,209 --> 00:31:20,672
Marianne's the woman of my dreams.
We're madly in love.

349
00:31:20,714 --> 00:31:22,007
Pierre...

350
00:31:22,048 --> 00:31:24,050
It's over, I swear.

351
00:31:24,092 --> 00:31:27,178
We didn't want to hurt you.
It just happened.

352
00:31:27,220 --> 00:31:28,555
It was blind passion!

353
00:31:28,596 --> 00:31:31,224
It wasn't. It's been over for weeks.

354
00:31:31,266 --> 00:31:32,266
OK.

355
00:31:33,601 --> 00:31:37,897
I'll tell the boys you're staying in town
for your dad's funeral.

356
00:31:38,314 --> 00:31:40,900
We'll talk to them after New Year's.

357
00:31:41,401 --> 00:31:44,946
I'll pick them up.
When I come back, I'd like you gone.

358
00:31:45,280 --> 00:31:47,782
And take that with you.

359
00:31:47,824 --> 00:31:49,034
Where'll I go?

360
00:31:49,075 --> 00:31:50,618
You'll figure that out.

361
00:31:50,660 --> 00:31:52,203
Pierre! We have to talk.

362
00:31:52,245 --> 00:31:54,539
My love, I'll look after you.
Stop!

363
00:31:54,581 --> 00:31:56,624
My roommate's
home for Christmas.

364
00:31:56,666 --> 00:31:58,335
Leave me alone!

365
00:32:02,088 --> 00:32:03,757
Marianne, wait!

366
00:32:17,729 --> 00:32:19,564
What are you doing the 24th?

367
00:32:21,024 --> 00:32:22,150
Why?

368
00:32:22,192 --> 00:32:24,903
We said that if we didn't have plans...

369
00:32:24,944 --> 00:32:27,280
Well, you see, I do have plans.

370
00:32:27,739 --> 00:32:29,115
You do?

371
00:32:29,157 --> 00:32:31,493
Can I come?
I don't have anything...

372
00:32:31,534 --> 00:32:32,534
Is it working?

373
00:32:33,787 --> 00:32:35,163
It'd be complicated.

374
00:32:37,457 --> 00:32:38,750
You have a date.

375
00:32:38,792 --> 00:32:40,794
We're going to her family's.

376
00:32:42,337 --> 00:32:43,755
So it's serious?

377
00:32:44,381 --> 00:32:46,508
It's potentially serious.

378
00:32:49,052 --> 00:32:50,303
Good!

379
00:32:51,262 --> 00:32:52,305
Congratulations.

380
00:32:54,641 --> 00:32:55,975
I didn't know that...

381
00:32:56,810 --> 00:32:58,103
Anyway...

382
00:33:00,897 --> 00:33:02,440
Looks, brains...

383
00:33:02,482 --> 00:33:04,025
I bet she has it all.

384
00:33:04,067 --> 00:33:05,151
Yup.

385
00:33:05,193 --> 00:33:06,193
All of it.

386
00:33:06,736 --> 00:33:08,947
And I bet she wants kids.

387
00:33:12,992 --> 00:33:16,287
Were you with her the night...
It's been 3 months.

388
00:33:16,329 --> 00:33:17,997
And about that night...

389
00:33:18,039 --> 00:33:20,000
What night?

390
00:33:21,876 --> 00:33:22,876
Thanks.

391
00:33:24,587 --> 00:33:25,672
Three months?

392
00:33:26,506 --> 00:33:28,383
I didn't know how to tell you.

393
00:33:28,883 --> 00:33:30,927
I wouldn't have made a scene.

394
00:33:31,428 --> 00:33:33,471
I know you wouldn't.

395
00:33:33,513 --> 00:33:34,931
It's not your style.

396
00:33:35,348 --> 00:33:36,558
But?

397
00:33:38,685 --> 00:33:42,897
Let's say you tend to find me cuter
when I'm not available.

398
00:33:45,275 --> 00:33:47,235
She's a lucky girl.

399
00:33:49,112 --> 00:33:50,572
I dunno.

400
00:33:50,613 --> 00:33:53,825
You had your chance.
Yeah, but me...

401
00:33:53,867 --> 00:33:55,577
My specialty's...

402
00:33:55,618 --> 00:33:59,497
running away from anything like
success or happiness.

403
00:34:09,215 --> 00:34:11,718
I'll be going, OK?
Yeah.

404
00:34:32,614 --> 00:34:33,907
Bye, Marianne.

405
00:34:41,498 --> 00:34:43,833
I'll take Dad's ashes
to the Islands.

406
00:34:45,251 --> 00:34:46,211
Now?

407
00:34:46,252 --> 00:34:49,047
Pierre invited his ex and their kids.

408
00:34:49,089 --> 00:34:51,424
His ex still comes for Christmas?

409
00:34:51,466 --> 00:34:56,721
I can't face her guzzling all our booze
and insinuating I wrecked her family.

410
00:34:57,430 --> 00:34:59,766
I'd rather deliver
a dead guy's ashes.

411
00:35:00,392 --> 00:35:03,520
Are you showing the house
or serving drinks?

412
00:35:19,994 --> 00:35:20,995
Christ.

413
00:35:21,454 --> 00:35:22,455
What?

414
00:35:26,042 --> 00:35:27,210
What is it?

415
00:35:34,134 --> 00:35:36,636
How much is that?
Quite a lot.

416
00:35:36,678 --> 00:35:38,096
Don't touch it!

417
00:35:38,138 --> 00:35:40,598
We can't keep it, it's dirty money.

418
00:35:40,640 --> 00:35:43,309
It's the first gift JP ever gave us.

419
00:35:43,351 --> 00:35:45,645
You're gonna spend it $20 at a time?

420
00:35:45,687 --> 00:35:46,646
Well...
No!

421
00:35:46,688 --> 00:35:48,773
You deposit that, the bank gets nosy.

422
00:35:48,815 --> 00:35:51,818
I have $68.97 in the bank.

423
00:35:52,360 --> 00:35:53,653
I have a cavity.

424
00:35:54,154 --> 00:35:58,033
I still owe tons of money
for producing my CD.

425
00:35:58,074 --> 00:36:02,454
While madame's sunning in Martinique
with her perfect family,

426
00:36:02,495 --> 00:36:03,455
me...

427
00:36:03,496 --> 00:36:08,626
I'll be singing at the curling club
New Year's party in L'Assomption!

428
00:36:08,668 --> 00:36:11,588
So to answer, yeah,
I'll keep that money.

429
00:36:18,636 --> 00:36:20,096
Lock up when you go.

430
00:36:24,684 --> 00:36:25,769
Wait!

431
00:36:28,772 --> 00:36:30,273
I'll come with you.

432
00:36:32,776 --> 00:36:34,319
You hate his guts.

433
00:36:34,361 --> 00:36:37,822
If I sing White fucking Christmas
at another party,

434
00:36:37,864 --> 00:36:39,407
I'll slit my wrists.

435
00:36:41,659 --> 00:36:43,370
Can we stop at my place...

436
00:36:44,871 --> 00:36:46,373
to get clean undies,

437
00:36:46,414 --> 00:36:47,582
a toothbrush...

438
00:36:48,792 --> 00:36:49,793
OK.

439
00:36:50,335 --> 00:36:51,419
Wait up!

440
00:37:00,929 --> 00:37:01,888
<i>What now?</i>

441
00:37:01,930 --> 00:37:04,683
They're leaving with some of his things.

442
00:37:05,850 --> 00:37:07,352
<i>Where to?
</i>- I dunno.

443
00:37:07,394 --> 00:37:10,355
They didn't call to say, ‟Hey, Réjean.

444
00:37:10,397 --> 00:37:13,566
We're going bowling and then visit Dad.”

445
00:37:13,608 --> 00:37:14,859
They didn't say.

446
00:37:14,901 --> 00:37:17,654
Look, Réjean. Don't act smart.

447
00:37:35,755 --> 00:37:37,924
There they are. One's in her car.

448
00:37:37,966 --> 00:37:40,427
The other's carrying two bags,

449
00:37:41,970 --> 00:37:44,222
a guitar...
<i>Why a guitar?</i>

450
00:37:44,264 --> 00:37:45,306
What guitar?

451
00:37:45,640 --> 00:37:48,560
<i>I don't know what guitar. A mini-guitar...</i>

452
00:37:48,601 --> 00:37:49,936
A guitar.

453
00:37:50,687 --> 00:37:53,648
A kind of ukulele. A guitar.

454
00:37:53,690 --> 00:37:56,401
A ukelele? Why's she taking that?
<i>Look...</i>

455
00:37:56,443 --> 00:37:58,611
I'm not a big music fan.

456
00:37:58,653 --> 00:37:59,738
<i>OK.</i>

457
00:37:59,779 --> 00:38:00,739
Pop the trunk!

458
00:38:00,780 --> 00:38:04,200
<i>Well, tail them,
and don't let them out of your sight.</i>

459
00:38:08,204 --> 00:38:09,664
Here we go.

460
00:38:25,221 --> 00:38:26,848
Oh, sweetheart!

461
00:39:19,567 --> 00:39:20,944
Who are those people?

462
00:39:23,363 --> 00:39:25,365
I dunno, friends of Dad.

463
00:39:25,407 --> 00:39:26,408
Come on.

464
00:39:27,033 --> 00:39:30,912
It's rare you photograph friends with...
What's it called?

465
00:39:30,954 --> 00:39:32,122
A zoom.

466
00:39:32,872 --> 00:39:36,668
A zoom's for pictures from far away,
in secret.

467
00:39:36,710 --> 00:39:38,378
Like paparazzi.

468
00:39:38,420 --> 00:39:41,172
Who knows? Maybe they're stars there.

469
00:39:41,214 --> 00:39:43,508
Think they're tied
to Dad's break-in?

470
00:39:43,550 --> 00:39:45,844
I'm going to scatter his ashes.

471
00:39:45,885 --> 00:39:47,595
Play detective without me.

472
00:40:00,650 --> 00:40:01,609
What?

473
00:40:01,651 --> 00:40:02,736
Careful!

474
00:40:02,777 --> 00:40:03,945
Sorry.
Jeez!

475
00:40:19,753 --> 00:40:21,588
Must you?

476
00:40:24,591 --> 00:40:26,343
The radio?
My head aches.

477
00:40:27,010 --> 00:40:28,219
Fine!

478
00:40:28,261 --> 00:40:29,721
One more thing.

479
00:40:34,267 --> 00:40:35,769
What are you doing?

480
00:40:36,144 --> 00:40:37,354
It's freezing!

481
00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:40,648
Please close it. C'mon!

482
00:40:40,690 --> 00:40:43,360
Your car's as hot as an old-age home.

483
00:40:43,401 --> 00:40:45,028
Take off your coat.

484
00:40:55,955 --> 00:40:57,040
Really?

485
00:41:03,797 --> 00:41:05,298
I must say,

486
00:41:05,340 --> 00:41:07,884
I sure missed our easy intimacy.

487
00:41:12,681 --> 00:41:14,641
I guess you...

488
00:41:19,354 --> 00:41:20,897
You guess I what?

489
00:41:21,314 --> 00:41:24,067
You don't want to share.
I can't hear you.

490
00:41:51,845 --> 00:41:52,846
Hello!

491
00:41:54,180 --> 00:41:55,181
Cut it out.

492
00:42:12,407 --> 00:42:14,576
East, along the river, I guess.

493
00:42:16,077 --> 00:42:17,829
Does he have a house there?

494
00:42:17,871 --> 00:42:19,414
How should I know?

495
00:42:19,456 --> 00:42:21,958
He's blackmailing me,
not a golf buddy.

496
00:42:22,709 --> 00:42:24,377
Find him or we're screwed.

497
00:42:24,419 --> 00:42:26,338
Listen, dammit.

498
00:42:26,379 --> 00:42:27,672
I'm not Colombo!

499
00:42:27,714 --> 00:42:29,758
<i>I know you're not Colombo.</i>

500
00:42:29,799 --> 00:42:33,345
<i>He didn't have a mustache.
</i>- I know he didn't.

501
00:42:33,386 --> 00:42:35,388
That's not what I mean.

502
00:42:35,430 --> 00:42:37,599
A hot chicken sandwich for me.

503
00:42:37,640 --> 00:42:39,351
And I'm torn between fries

504
00:42:39,392 --> 00:42:41,770
and your cheesecake.

505
00:42:41,811 --> 00:42:42,854
No, fries.

506
00:42:42,896 --> 00:42:44,105
Please.

507
00:42:44,397 --> 00:42:45,857
Your face is familiar.

508
00:42:46,483 --> 00:42:48,526
Could be...

509
00:42:48,568 --> 00:42:49,778
<i>Thanks for Everything</i>?

510
00:42:49,819 --> 00:42:51,696
Yup.

511
00:42:51,738 --> 00:42:53,198
I knew it was you.

512
00:42:53,823 --> 00:42:56,034
That song was my story.

513
00:42:57,494 --> 00:42:59,496
Nice, being friends with a star.

514
00:42:59,537 --> 00:43:01,456
No, she's my sister.

515
00:43:02,374 --> 00:43:04,209
You must be so proud!

516
00:43:07,337 --> 00:43:08,338
It gets intense.

517
00:43:09,172 --> 00:43:10,172
I bet!

518
00:43:10,799 --> 00:43:13,760
I guess you'll have a new CD soon.

519
00:43:13,802 --> 00:43:15,303
It's been a while.

520
00:43:15,345 --> 00:43:19,182
No, my album came out just last year, so...

521
00:43:19,766 --> 00:43:21,685
Yeah. Eight songs in a year!

522
00:43:22,352 --> 00:43:24,604
Lucky you're not paid by the hour.

523
00:43:27,399 --> 00:43:28,692
Don't overdo it.

524
00:43:30,110 --> 00:43:31,444
God!

525
00:43:34,489 --> 00:43:35,489
There.

526
00:43:42,288 --> 00:43:43,288
Thanks.

527
00:43:44,124 --> 00:43:45,166
We gotta go!

528
00:43:45,208 --> 00:43:46,376
What's wrong?

529
00:43:47,002 --> 00:43:48,086
Move it!

530
00:43:48,128 --> 00:43:49,129
My hot chicken!

531
00:43:50,296 --> 00:43:51,965
I'm starving!

532
00:43:54,134 --> 00:43:55,301
C'mon!

533
00:43:58,805 --> 00:44:01,307
She OK?
Sorry, Miss. We have to go.

534
00:44:01,808 --> 00:44:03,768
She's a bundle of nerves.

535
00:44:03,810 --> 00:44:05,311
See you.
Bye!

536
00:44:27,667 --> 00:44:29,878
The door's not open.

537
00:44:33,506 --> 00:44:35,759
Are they dummies or what?

538
00:44:41,514 --> 00:44:42,766
On the road again!

539
00:45:48,623 --> 00:45:50,750
How much money do you think it is?

540
00:45:51,084 --> 00:45:53,712
I don't know, and I don't want to.

541
00:45:53,753 --> 00:45:56,631
What?
I have enough problems without JP's.

542
00:45:56,923 --> 00:45:59,217
You're a ray of sunshine.
How come?

543
00:45:59,259 --> 00:46:02,929
We can't listen to radio
or open the window.

544
00:46:02,971 --> 00:46:05,890
We can't look at photos or talk.

545
00:46:05,932 --> 00:46:08,351
Or know what's wrong.
I'm sorry.

546
00:46:09,602 --> 00:46:11,104
It's just that...

547
00:46:12,772 --> 00:46:14,566
I saw someone back there.

548
00:46:15,442 --> 00:46:17,485
At the gas station?
Yeah.

549
00:46:17,986 --> 00:46:18,986
Who?

550
00:46:19,779 --> 00:46:21,698
Someone I didn't want to see.

551
00:46:22,115 --> 00:46:25,869
C'mon! Is it someone you work with?

552
00:46:31,875 --> 00:46:34,210
Is it a man, a woman?

553
00:46:40,842 --> 00:46:41,842
No.

554
00:46:42,052 --> 00:46:43,386
Not very good.

555
00:46:45,638 --> 00:46:46,931
The window!

556
00:46:51,186 --> 00:46:52,479
Got a napkin?

557
00:46:52,812 --> 00:46:54,397
Use your coat.

558
00:46:55,398 --> 00:46:57,942
I could've had an accident!

559
00:46:57,984 --> 00:46:59,277
Are you crazy?

560
00:47:01,738 --> 00:47:04,366
Careful, the car's worth a fortune.

561
00:47:06,284 --> 00:47:07,827
Think you're funny?

562
00:47:07,869 --> 00:47:09,162
Yes!

563
00:47:29,349 --> 00:47:32,602
Is it someone who trolls you on your blog?

564
00:47:34,270 --> 00:47:37,107
A guy who works for the mafia?

565
00:47:44,531 --> 00:47:45,865
Which side?

566
00:47:45,907 --> 00:47:50,745
A political enemy of Pierre's
who has state secrets on tourism?

567
00:47:50,787 --> 00:47:52,914
I'll take this side.

568
00:47:59,379 --> 00:48:00,547
What's wrong?

569
00:48:00,588 --> 00:48:02,841
Dirty sheets. I can't sleep here.

570
00:48:02,882 --> 00:48:04,217
Don't be a princess!

571
00:48:04,259 --> 00:48:07,220
I'm not sleeping
in some stranger's pubes.

572
00:48:07,554 --> 00:48:08,888
Too gross!

573
00:49:01,649 --> 00:49:02,609
Excuse me?

574
00:49:02,650 --> 00:49:04,402
Can I help you?

575
00:49:06,029 --> 00:49:07,029
No.

576
00:49:08,740 --> 00:49:09,740
Bye.

577
00:49:10,158 --> 00:49:11,409
What's going on?

578
00:49:13,036 --> 00:49:16,748
I'd respectfully ask you to screw off,
if you don't mind.

579
00:49:17,457 --> 00:49:20,001
Wait, are you a friend of Marianne's?

580
00:49:20,835 --> 00:49:22,087
Who are you again?

581
00:49:23,129 --> 00:49:24,881
My name's not important.

582
00:49:26,216 --> 00:49:29,344
You neither. So beat it!

583
00:49:29,386 --> 00:49:31,429
It's not your car.
Is it yours?

584
00:49:33,348 --> 00:49:34,933
No, but...
Exactly.

585
00:49:34,974 --> 00:49:36,976
Beat it.
OK.

586
00:49:37,560 --> 00:49:39,646
I'll have to call the police.

587
00:49:39,688 --> 00:49:41,439
I'll smash your pretty face.

588
00:49:42,816 --> 00:49:44,818
Jesus Christ!

589
00:49:44,859 --> 00:49:47,153
What is this bullshit?

590
00:49:48,154 --> 00:49:49,154
What the...?

591
00:49:55,328 --> 00:49:56,328
Sir?

592
00:49:56,913 --> 00:49:57,913
You OK?

593
00:50:01,459 --> 00:50:02,459
My god!

594
00:50:43,710 --> 00:50:45,462
What happened?
OK.

595
00:50:46,046 --> 00:50:49,090
Don't freak out,
but that guy I saw before...

596
00:50:49,132 --> 00:50:51,259
He's here, so we're leaving.

597
00:50:51,301 --> 00:50:52,927
Marianne, who is he?

598
00:50:52,969 --> 00:50:55,305
Pack up.
Sure it's the same guy?

599
00:50:55,347 --> 00:50:57,849
No, I just feel like chatting.

600
00:50:57,891 --> 00:51:00,477
Fine, but you owe me an explanation.

601
00:51:00,518 --> 00:51:02,020
In the car!

602
00:51:02,062 --> 00:51:04,606
Did you talk to him?
He has a gun!

603
00:51:06,024 --> 00:51:07,024
Shit!

604
00:51:10,028 --> 00:51:12,822
<i>911 Shediac, how may I help you?</i>

605
00:51:12,864 --> 00:51:14,949
Hello, I'm at the Shediac Motel.

606
00:51:14,991 --> 00:51:16,534
An armed man is after me.

607
00:51:16,576 --> 00:51:20,705
He's in a car-share and he has curly hair.
Come quick!

608
00:51:20,747 --> 00:51:22,957
Hurry!

609
00:51:27,879 --> 00:51:28,879
Too much?

610
00:51:29,089 --> 00:51:31,049
Who are you?
What?

611
00:51:31,091 --> 00:51:33,301
It has to sound like an emergency.

612
00:53:22,160 --> 00:53:23,453
Hello.

613
00:53:25,288 --> 00:53:26,539
On the ground!

614
00:53:26,581 --> 00:53:28,083
Hands behind your head!

615
00:53:29,542 --> 00:53:31,670
Don't move!
I'm not resisting!

616
00:54:22,595 --> 00:54:23,595
Thanks.

617
00:54:31,187 --> 00:54:32,647
Want some music?

618
00:54:32,689 --> 00:54:33,689
Yeah.

619
00:54:38,611 --> 00:54:39,779
This alright?

620
00:54:41,448 --> 00:54:43,783
I always hated that song.
OK.

621
00:54:43,825 --> 00:54:44,993
No problem.

622
00:54:47,954 --> 00:54:49,164
That's good.

623
00:54:56,796 --> 00:54:59,132
You always loved soppy songs.

624
00:55:02,260 --> 00:55:05,430
It's a huge hit.
Yeah, sure.

625
00:56:17,127 --> 00:56:18,670
Don't!

626
00:56:18,712 --> 00:56:20,422
My kids can't see me smoke.

627
00:56:22,424 --> 00:56:24,342
I found a house for rent.

628
00:56:24,384 --> 00:56:26,011
In Hâvre-aux-Maisons...

629
00:56:26,052 --> 00:56:28,346
Two bedrooms, bathrooms...
Book it.

630
00:56:28,388 --> 00:56:30,390
There's another in...
Book it!

631
00:56:30,432 --> 00:56:33,351
Two bedrooms,
I don't care, book anything.

632
00:56:33,393 --> 00:56:35,562
I need your credit card.

633
00:56:39,816 --> 00:56:44,696
Not cheap for an Airbnb.
So what? We have a fortune in the trunk.

634
00:56:44,738 --> 00:56:48,408
If you want a fight,
call Pierre and fight with him.

635
00:57:03,965 --> 00:57:05,675
The guy is someone...

636
00:57:08,428 --> 00:57:10,430
I had an adventure with.

637
00:57:11,348 --> 00:57:13,099
An adventure?

638
00:57:14,184 --> 00:57:16,311
You?
What?

639
00:57:16,686 --> 00:57:19,981
Can't I be fucked up, too -
with our loser parents?

640
00:57:20,023 --> 00:57:22,984
You don't always acknowledge your roots.

641
00:57:24,277 --> 00:57:27,197
I thought you guys were good.
From your blog...

642
00:57:27,238 --> 00:57:28,782
We are good.

643
00:57:29,366 --> 00:57:31,743
Pierre's perfect, our life's perfect.

644
00:57:32,243 --> 00:57:35,497
I'm the problem. I'm never satisfied.

645
00:57:36,831 --> 00:57:38,166
Who's the guy?

646
00:57:42,170 --> 00:57:44,547
A waiter in a café where I write.

647
00:57:46,716 --> 00:57:48,385
It's fine, go for it.

648
00:57:48,760 --> 00:57:50,970
I'm my own harshest critic.

649
00:57:51,012 --> 00:57:54,099
I'm in no position to judge you.

650
00:57:58,645 --> 00:58:00,313
Olivier has a girlfriend.

651
00:58:01,523 --> 00:58:03,066
A girlfriend?

652
00:58:03,108 --> 00:58:04,275
Yup.

653
00:58:05,735 --> 00:58:06,820
OK...

654
00:58:06,861 --> 00:58:09,322
So when he was there it was just...

655
00:58:09,364 --> 00:58:11,157
Like I said...
Yeah.

656
00:58:11,199 --> 00:58:13,159
I'm in no position to judge.

657
00:58:19,332 --> 00:58:20,875
Has it lasted long?

658
00:58:20,917 --> 00:58:22,085
No.

659
00:58:22,752 --> 00:58:25,505
No, it wasn't long, or very often.

660
00:58:26,923 --> 00:58:27,923
Four months.

661
00:58:28,591 --> 00:58:30,844
Maybe five. Well, seven.

662
00:58:31,177 --> 00:58:33,388
Including four trying to end it.

663
00:58:36,224 --> 00:58:37,267
OK.

664
00:58:42,397 --> 00:58:45,608
Sometimes I hear myself
blogging about crap like

665
00:58:47,068 --> 00:58:50,363
how well-folded laundry soothes the soul.

666
00:58:50,739 --> 00:58:53,950
I want to stab myself
just to feel something.

667
00:58:59,205 --> 00:59:00,832
What are you doing?

668
00:59:00,874 --> 00:59:01,875
You see?

669
00:59:01,916 --> 00:59:03,626
You can feel something.

670
00:59:04,294 --> 00:59:05,294
Good news!

671
00:59:06,212 --> 00:59:07,213
Jeez!

672
00:59:08,089 --> 00:59:09,299
Stub it out.

673
00:59:11,634 --> 00:59:13,261
How old are you?

674
00:59:51,466 --> 00:59:53,301
After New Year's,

675
00:59:53,343 --> 00:59:56,179
I wanted to call, but I just didn't.

676
00:59:56,680 --> 00:59:57,680
Yeah.

677
00:59:58,973 --> 01:00:01,059
I guess that was easier.

678
01:00:01,351 --> 01:00:02,351
You?

679
01:00:03,311 --> 01:00:04,311
What do you mean?

680
01:00:05,980 --> 01:00:07,691
You never thought to call?

681
01:00:08,274 --> 01:00:09,359
What for?

682
01:00:11,194 --> 01:00:15,657
I dunno, to apologize for behaving
like a spoiled brat

683
01:00:16,324 --> 01:00:19,077
and ruining the party for everyone.

684
01:00:19,119 --> 01:00:20,954
Well, for everything that night.

685
01:00:22,497 --> 01:00:23,832
Except maybe

686
01:00:23,873 --> 01:00:27,377
for when you told off Pierre's ex.

687
01:00:28,712 --> 01:00:31,798
That was my best Christmas present ever.

688
01:00:40,640 --> 01:00:43,351
In fact, yes, I thought of calling.

689
01:00:44,811 --> 01:00:47,147
Since you didn't come to my launch,

690
01:00:47,188 --> 01:00:48,773
I thought we were even.

691
01:00:48,815 --> 01:00:50,483
I have a life, you know.

692
01:00:50,525 --> 01:00:53,194
We know.
You're not the prom queen.

693
01:00:53,236 --> 01:00:56,322
Why'd you invest everything in your CD,

694
01:00:56,865 --> 01:00:58,658
just to indulge your whims?

695
01:00:58,992 --> 01:01:01,161
Why not line up a producer?

696
01:01:01,202 --> 01:01:03,705
Everyone I spoke to wanted to put

697
01:01:03,747 --> 01:01:05,290
glitter on my music.

698
01:01:05,331 --> 01:01:08,710
They wanted me to change my hair,
my clothes...

699
01:01:08,752 --> 01:01:10,045
fire Olivier,

700
01:01:10,086 --> 01:01:11,963
hype myself on talk shows...

701
01:01:12,005 --> 01:01:14,883
host radio contests...
Everything I'm not.

702
01:01:15,467 --> 01:01:18,219
At least I did it my way.
And went broke.

703
01:01:20,513 --> 01:01:21,513
So?

704
01:01:23,308 --> 01:01:26,394
Happiness and success aren't all bad.

705
01:01:26,436 --> 01:01:27,896
You should try it.

706
01:01:27,937 --> 01:01:29,105
You're right, Marianne.

707
01:01:29,147 --> 01:01:31,775
Tell me how happy you are right now.

708
01:01:37,822 --> 01:01:39,491
You don't read my blog.

709
01:01:39,532 --> 01:01:41,034
I do too.
You don't.

710
01:01:41,076 --> 01:01:42,035
I do.

711
01:01:42,077 --> 01:01:45,413
I see the pictures of you
busy being beautiful

712
01:01:45,455 --> 01:01:48,833
in great places with your kids
and powerful hubby.

713
01:01:48,875 --> 01:01:51,586
You'd react to what I wrote about you.

714
01:01:54,130 --> 01:01:56,091
I had nothing to add.

715
01:01:58,468 --> 01:01:59,969
I never mentioned you.

716
01:02:02,681 --> 01:02:04,599
Bravo, you got me!

717
01:02:04,641 --> 01:02:06,184
I don't always read it.

718
01:02:06,226 --> 01:02:07,227
You never do!

719
01:02:07,268 --> 01:02:10,522
What can I say? I don't know that woman.

720
01:02:10,563 --> 01:02:12,315
I don't recognize you.

721
01:02:13,358 --> 01:02:15,193
Seriously, try as I might,

722
01:02:15,235 --> 01:02:17,946
I don't get what kills you
about your life.

723
01:02:18,405 --> 01:02:19,698
Besides boredom.

724
01:02:19,739 --> 01:02:22,117
Next time you need a bad guy
for a song,

725
01:02:22,158 --> 01:02:23,535
don't use me.

726
01:02:23,576 --> 01:02:24,786
OK?
What?

727
01:02:24,828 --> 01:02:27,706
Your goddamn hit's about me,
don't pretend.

728
01:02:27,747 --> 01:02:31,584
‟I lived with a heart of stone,
a prisoner to your grey zone.”

729
01:02:31,626 --> 01:02:32,626
Stop the car.

730
01:02:33,086 --> 01:02:35,630
We're almost there.
Stop, let me out.

731
01:02:35,672 --> 01:02:36,631
Are you crazy?

732
01:02:36,673 --> 01:02:38,133
Stop the fucking car!

733
01:02:43,972 --> 01:02:45,181
What are you doing?

734
01:03:32,729 --> 01:03:33,855
Christine!

735
01:03:49,788 --> 01:03:53,583
<i>Élyse Laberge Divorces
8 Years After Sauvageau Disappears</i>

736
01:03:55,293 --> 01:03:57,545
The car keys. Gimme 'em!

737
01:03:57,587 --> 01:03:58,963
Why?
Gimme the keys!

738
01:03:59,005 --> 01:04:00,005
Take it easy!

739
01:04:09,766 --> 01:04:11,059
It's the same guy.

740
01:04:11,559 --> 01:04:14,562
He's older, but that's him, right?
Yeah.

741
01:04:16,064 --> 01:04:17,524
Ok, here, listen.

742
01:04:18,274 --> 01:04:22,696
""After pleading guilty
to a $107-million Ponzi scheme

743
01:04:22,737 --> 01:04:26,199
and defrauding his clients,
friends, and family,

744
01:04:26,241 --> 01:04:29,369
Guy Sauvageau had dropped off the radar.

745
01:04:29,411 --> 01:04:33,331
His wife, Élyse Laberge,
was seen as guilty by association,

746
01:04:33,373 --> 01:04:36,376
and tried to make a new life.”

747
01:04:36,418 --> 01:04:37,544
So it seems

748
01:04:38,545 --> 01:04:40,380
Sauvageau flew the coop,

749
01:04:40,755 --> 01:04:42,841
leaving his wife with the mess.

750
01:04:42,882 --> 01:04:45,093
The cops are still
searching for him.

751
01:04:45,135 --> 01:04:46,970
Did Dad spot him in Panama?

752
01:04:47,429 --> 01:04:50,849
He struck gold by blackmailing him.

753
01:04:50,890 --> 01:04:52,600
The money in his freezer.

754
01:04:54,978 --> 01:04:55,978
Wait!

755
01:04:56,396 --> 01:04:58,606
He was outside Dad's yesterday.

756
01:04:59,941 --> 01:05:01,151
No!
I swear!

757
01:05:01,943 --> 01:05:03,903
You're sure?
Absolutely sure!

758
01:05:03,945 --> 01:05:06,906
I told him his coat was stuck
in his car door.

759
01:05:06,948 --> 01:05:10,076
He asked me about the house,
he was interested.

760
01:05:14,080 --> 01:05:15,665
I gave him my number.

761
01:05:16,166 --> 01:05:18,543
Dad's screwing us over even now.

762
01:06:02,879 --> 01:06:04,422
Marianne!
What?

763
01:06:04,923 --> 01:06:06,383
Her name is Élyse!

764
01:06:06,424 --> 01:06:07,384
Who?

765
01:06:07,425 --> 01:06:09,761
Sauvageau's wife, Élyse Laberge.

766
01:06:09,803 --> 01:06:11,388
Yeah, we read it. So?

767
01:06:11,429 --> 01:06:13,890
The name on the envelope.

768
01:06:18,561 --> 01:06:20,063
Sir...
Yes?

769
01:06:20,105 --> 01:06:23,733
I'd like a coffee, please. Very, very strong.
- OK.

770
01:06:23,775 --> 01:06:24,775
A scotch.

771
01:06:26,152 --> 01:06:27,779
What? It's the holidays.

772
01:06:28,697 --> 01:06:30,156
Your coffee.
Thanks.

773
01:06:33,618 --> 01:06:36,788
Spending Christmas with your family?

774
01:06:36,830 --> 01:06:41,167
We don't have family here,
but our parents were born in Gros Cap.

775
01:06:42,293 --> 01:06:47,882
I thought so! You're the girls of
Jean-Paul, of Joseph, of Xavier.

776
01:06:47,924 --> 01:06:49,467
Right.

777
01:06:50,218 --> 01:06:53,555
I thought I recognized that smile!

778
01:06:53,596 --> 01:06:55,140
Your mom's smile.

779
01:06:55,849 --> 01:06:58,184
My wife went to school with her.

780
01:06:58,226 --> 01:07:00,186
Really?
You bet! Normand Langford.

781
01:07:01,271 --> 01:07:03,523
A pal of your parents.
Christine.

782
01:07:03,565 --> 01:07:06,443
How is your mom?
Died of cancer 21 years ago.

783
01:07:07,444 --> 01:07:08,987
Real sorry to hear that.

784
01:07:09,529 --> 01:07:11,364
Anita was a good soul.

785
01:07:11,823 --> 01:07:15,452
What's news of Jean-Paul?
News is, he died, too. 3 days ago.

786
01:07:20,957 --> 01:07:22,042
To Jean-Paul,

787
01:07:22,083 --> 01:07:25,712
whose middle name was Trouble.

788
01:07:26,296 --> 01:07:28,256
To Jean-Paul.
JeanPaul.

789
01:07:31,718 --> 01:07:35,305
Back in the day,
there were three kinds of islanders.

790
01:07:35,930 --> 01:07:38,183
Those he'd borrowed money from.

791
01:07:38,558 --> 01:07:41,227
Those he'd borrowed girlfriends from.

792
01:07:41,686 --> 01:07:44,022
And the third and most dangerous...

793
01:07:44,064 --> 01:07:46,066
his ex-girlfriends!

794
01:07:46,107 --> 01:07:48,318
That pretty much sums it up.

795
01:07:48,985 --> 01:07:50,653
His favorite game was

796
01:07:50,695 --> 01:07:55,325
to welcome every rookie policeman
to the Magdalen Islands.

797
01:07:55,367 --> 01:07:58,453
Invite him on his boat for a beer.

798
01:07:58,495 --> 01:07:59,913
Three hours later,

799
01:07:59,954 --> 01:08:01,706
the cop is drunk as a skunk.

800
01:08:01,748 --> 01:08:04,709
Next day, the cop wakes up
on Entrée Island,

801
01:08:04,751 --> 01:08:10,340
hung over, no money, no map, nothing...
And no idea where he is.

802
01:08:11,424 --> 01:08:14,636
JP calls the station to pick the guy up.

803
01:08:15,261 --> 01:08:16,554
<i>What a Jean-Paul!</i>

804
01:08:19,599 --> 01:08:20,599
Thanks.

805
01:08:22,602 --> 01:08:26,272
Think I'd let JP's girls pay? Never!

806
01:08:26,314 --> 01:08:28,066
Put that away.
Thank you.

807
01:08:28,108 --> 01:08:29,150
To Jean-Paul.

808
01:08:34,364 --> 01:08:37,242
<i>From: Pierre
Subject: Divorce. Call my lawyer.</i>

809
01:09:11,568 --> 01:09:12,819
What's wrong?

810
01:09:12,861 --> 01:09:13,861
You OK?

811
01:09:14,487 --> 01:09:15,488
Look.

812
01:09:25,290 --> 01:09:28,752
We scatter Jean-Paul
here, now, in the Gulf.

813
01:09:29,961 --> 01:09:32,130
Out to sea, just like he was.

814
01:09:33,631 --> 01:09:35,800
We'll head back tomorrow.

815
01:09:35,842 --> 01:09:39,763
You'll go home.
You'll work it out with Pierre.

816
01:09:42,974 --> 01:09:44,017
I don't know.

817
01:09:44,476 --> 01:09:46,603
You can't do it from here.

818
01:09:48,355 --> 01:09:52,442
I'll come with you.
I'll stay in the car, in case.

819
01:09:56,446 --> 01:09:57,697
I'll get Dad.
OK.

820
01:10:11,544 --> 01:10:14,047
Thanks so much. It's this one here.

821
01:10:39,406 --> 01:10:40,406
Very kind.

822
01:11:11,021 --> 01:11:13,148
That's not his ashes.
It's him!

823
01:11:13,189 --> 01:11:14,816
He's on board!
Who?

824
01:11:14,858 --> 01:11:16,901
The guy, he's here!
Calm down.

825
01:11:16,943 --> 01:11:18,611
I am calm!

826
01:11:19,529 --> 01:11:20,905
I'm calm.

827
01:11:21,239 --> 01:11:22,657
Which guy? Where?

828
01:11:22,699 --> 01:11:24,200
In my trunk!

829
01:11:24,701 --> 01:11:26,453
What do you mean?
I mean

830
01:11:26,494 --> 01:11:28,580
there's a guy in my trunk!

831
01:11:28,621 --> 01:11:30,040
Which guy, your lover?

832
01:11:30,081 --> 01:11:31,583
No, not him, the guy!

833
01:11:31,624 --> 01:11:33,376
How many guys are after you?

834
01:11:33,418 --> 01:11:36,004
The guy who was outside Dad's!

835
01:11:36,046 --> 01:11:37,797
He's in my trunk!

836
01:11:37,839 --> 01:11:40,091
How many scotches did you have?

837
01:11:40,675 --> 01:11:42,969
If you don't believe me, go look!

838
01:11:43,011 --> 01:11:45,055
This is crazy.

839
01:11:45,096 --> 01:11:46,264
Who put him there?

840
01:11:46,306 --> 01:11:47,724
How do I know?

841
01:11:48,433 --> 01:11:50,101
We gotta get rid of him.

842
01:11:50,143 --> 01:11:52,103
Good thinking, Sherlock!

843
01:11:52,145 --> 01:11:54,647
It's the best I can come up with.

844
01:11:54,689 --> 01:11:57,901
Dump a 200-lb guy overboard
without being seen?

845
01:11:57,942 --> 01:11:59,819
Sorry, I'm brainstorming!

846
01:12:05,033 --> 01:12:06,659
We'll call the police.

847
01:12:07,744 --> 01:12:09,371
And say what?

848
01:12:09,412 --> 01:12:13,041
We want the creep arrested
for breaking into my trunk?

849
01:12:13,083 --> 01:12:15,043
It's true!
It'll look bad for Pierre.

850
01:12:15,085 --> 01:12:17,170
He's running again.

851
01:12:20,924 --> 01:12:22,092
Let's go!

852
01:12:30,100 --> 01:12:31,351
My darling.

853
01:12:47,742 --> 01:12:48,702
Hello?

854
01:12:48,743 --> 01:12:49,953
<i>Where are you?</i>

855
01:12:50,662 --> 01:12:51,871
<i>I dunno.</i>

856
01:12:51,913 --> 01:12:53,123
What do you mean?

857
01:12:53,623 --> 01:12:57,210
<i>I should be at my in-laws'
making Christmas pudding.</i>

858
01:12:57,711 --> 01:12:59,713
My wife'll have my head.

859
01:12:59,754 --> 01:13:01,673
<i>Who cares about your pudding?</i>

860
01:13:02,215 --> 01:13:03,508
Where's that bastard?

861
01:13:04,342 --> 01:13:07,178
<i>You come find him
if you're not happy.</i>

862
01:13:07,220 --> 01:13:10,348
<i>I'm warning you,
this'll cost you bigtime.</i>

863
01:13:10,390 --> 01:13:12,058
<i>You hear?</i>

864
01:13:14,352 --> 01:13:15,520
Darnit!

865
01:13:16,730 --> 01:13:19,524
He'd better stop hounding me.

866
01:13:23,069 --> 01:13:26,698
We've done nothing wrong.
That's easy to prove.

867
01:13:26,740 --> 01:13:29,534
And the half-mill you're carrying?

868
01:13:31,995 --> 01:13:33,496
Was he alive?

869
01:13:33,538 --> 01:13:35,665
I think so.

870
01:13:37,917 --> 01:13:39,377
What's good about it?

871
01:13:39,419 --> 01:13:42,130
Less jail time for kidnapping
than murder.

872
01:13:42,172 --> 01:13:44,591
You two are hiding something!

873
01:13:45,592 --> 01:13:47,177
It didn't occur to me.

874
01:13:47,927 --> 01:13:52,015
I told my wife I'd served
JP and Anita's girls.

875
01:13:52,057 --> 01:13:55,602
She tells me her girl sings
<i>Thanks for Everything!</i>

876
01:13:57,228 --> 01:13:59,105
That's me.
It's her.

877
01:13:59,397 --> 01:14:02,734
My daughter sang it all summer,
wall-to-wall.

878
01:14:02,776 --> 01:14:04,444
I hear you. Sorry.

879
01:14:04,486 --> 01:14:07,030
<i>Here's my number.
Oh, thanks!</i>

880
01:14:07,072 --> 01:14:09,574
<i>My wife would love
if you dropped by.</i>

881
01:14:09,616 --> 01:14:11,576
<i>Why not?
Sure, we can do that.</i>

882
01:14:11,618 --> 01:14:12,911
<i>Since we're here.</i>

883
01:14:18,083 --> 01:14:19,209
Dammit!

884
01:14:26,132 --> 01:14:30,887
I often helped JP out
by flying him on his errands.

885
01:14:31,930 --> 01:14:33,473
A real entrepreneur,

886
01:14:33,515 --> 01:14:34,432
your dad...

887
01:14:34,474 --> 01:14:36,142
<i>Lemme outta the goddamn car!</i>

888
01:14:39,896 --> 01:14:40,896
Look.

889
01:14:44,150 --> 01:14:45,652
Should I call him?

890
01:14:46,653 --> 01:14:47,653
Yeah.

891
01:14:48,238 --> 01:14:49,322
Yeah, call him.

892
01:15:01,001 --> 01:15:02,335
Hello?

893
01:15:03,461 --> 01:15:05,338
Come open your trunk.

894
01:15:06,589 --> 01:15:08,842
<i>Where are you taking me?</i>

895
01:15:08,883 --> 01:15:10,844
We didn't know you were there.

896
01:15:10,885 --> 01:15:12,804
Ask his name? What's he doing?

897
01:15:12,846 --> 01:15:14,180
Why are you there?

898
01:15:15,056 --> 01:15:17,017
Lemme out, I'll tell you.

899
01:15:17,058 --> 01:15:20,562
<i>Sir, we can't get to the car
during the crossing.</i>

900
01:15:20,603 --> 01:15:23,231
<i>We'll reach Cap-aux-Meules
in two hours.</i>

901
01:15:23,273 --> 01:15:24,858
Jesus holy Christ!

902
01:15:24,899 --> 01:15:27,318
<i>The goddamn Magdalen Islands!</i>

903
01:15:27,360 --> 01:15:28,319
<i>OK.</i>

904
01:15:28,361 --> 01:15:30,572
We can do one of two things.

905
01:15:32,574 --> 01:15:34,868
You get me out of here.

906
01:15:35,326 --> 01:15:36,786
Or I call the police.

907
01:15:37,579 --> 01:15:39,497
And you explain why I'm here.

908
01:15:39,539 --> 01:15:41,750
He'll call the cops!
He's bluffing!

909
01:15:41,791 --> 01:15:43,835
Yeah?
He'd have called already.

910
01:15:43,877 --> 01:15:46,046
He can't.
He sounds serious.

911
01:15:46,087 --> 01:15:47,172
Let me.

912
01:15:47,964 --> 01:15:52,594
Sir? If you call, we'll show them
the pictures of you and Sauvageau.

913
01:15:52,635 --> 01:15:54,596
Say we'll let him out on shore.

914
01:15:54,637 --> 01:15:58,391
We don't want trouble.
We'll let you out on shore.

915
01:15:59,184 --> 01:16:02,687
They'll get the pictures
if anything happens to us.

916
01:16:07,233 --> 01:16:08,443
Want a scotch?

917
01:16:17,410 --> 01:16:21,247
Goddamn shitty Christmas to hell.

918
01:16:27,295 --> 01:16:28,963
Goddamn fucking Christmas!

919
01:16:29,464 --> 01:16:32,676
Sir, the woman of my dreams is in danger.

920
01:16:32,717 --> 01:16:34,636
And you say that this woman

921
01:16:34,678 --> 01:16:38,640
is the wife of the environment minister.
No, tourism.

922
01:16:38,682 --> 01:16:40,058
Tourism?
Right.

923
01:16:40,350 --> 01:16:43,269
Who you're tailing, to propose to her.

924
01:16:43,311 --> 01:16:44,311
Yes!

925
01:16:45,063 --> 01:16:46,231
She's...

926
01:16:47,399 --> 01:16:48,608
the woman of my dreams.

927
01:16:50,777 --> 01:16:52,904
Does the minister's wife know

928
01:16:52,946 --> 01:16:54,906
she's your dream woman?
Sir!

929
01:16:54,948 --> 01:16:57,283
There's an armed man in her trunk.

930
01:16:57,742 --> 01:16:59,285
I know, I put him there.

931
01:16:59,327 --> 01:17:03,456
You want us to save her from
an armed man you locked in her trunk

932
01:17:04,499 --> 01:17:06,251
and whose weapon you had.

933
01:17:07,252 --> 01:17:09,963
Said that way, it sounds nuts, I know.

934
01:17:10,005 --> 01:17:13,091
The guy you put in
the minister's wife's car...

935
01:17:13,133 --> 01:17:14,300
Who is he?

936
01:17:14,342 --> 01:17:16,553
I thought it was her lover.

937
01:17:17,220 --> 01:17:18,471
But...

938
01:17:19,806 --> 01:17:20,806
I dunno.

939
01:17:24,227 --> 01:17:25,979
I've the right to one call?

940
01:17:37,657 --> 01:17:39,200
Loosen up.

941
01:17:39,242 --> 01:17:41,369
You look like
you're smuggling coke.

942
01:17:41,411 --> 01:17:43,997
I'm not used to transporting bodies.

943
01:17:49,127 --> 01:17:51,463
This is no time for laughing.

944
01:17:51,504 --> 01:17:52,672
I'm not laughing.

945
01:17:53,131 --> 01:17:54,174
Sir?

946
01:17:55,091 --> 01:18:00,180
As soon as we're off the ferry,
we'll find a quiet spot to let you out.

947
01:18:01,014 --> 01:18:02,640
Quit laughing!

948
01:18:03,141 --> 01:18:04,309
I'm sorry!

949
01:18:04,351 --> 01:18:06,436
Is he coming over here?

950
01:18:10,023 --> 01:18:11,900
Hello.
Hello.

951
01:18:11,941 --> 01:18:15,445
We got a call from the RCMP
about a stowaway.

952
01:18:15,487 --> 01:18:17,489
I need to check your trunk.

953
01:18:17,530 --> 01:18:20,033
Marianne Cyr,
Minister Mercier's wife.

954
01:18:20,992 --> 01:18:24,621
My sister and I are here
to scatter our father's ashes.

955
01:18:24,662 --> 01:18:26,873
There's no one else in the car.

956
01:18:27,374 --> 01:18:29,501
Please park next to my cruiser.

957
01:18:29,542 --> 01:18:30,960
Alright.
Thank you.

958
01:18:47,852 --> 01:18:49,104
Let me talk.

959
01:18:49,145 --> 01:18:51,064
What'll you say?
No idea.

960
01:19:05,537 --> 01:19:07,414
Sorry for the inconvenience.

961
01:19:07,747 --> 01:19:10,208
Procedure requires us to check.

962
01:19:10,542 --> 01:19:14,713
Welcome to the Islands, happy holidays,
and my sympathies.

963
01:19:14,754 --> 01:19:15,754
Very kind.

964
01:19:24,431 --> 01:19:28,476
Marianne, were you hallucinating?
I'm not crazy, he was there.

965
01:20:27,577 --> 01:20:29,204
He was here, I swear!

966
01:20:29,245 --> 01:20:31,164
Oh no!

967
01:20:31,206 --> 01:20:33,333
Shit!
What's wrong?

968
01:20:33,375 --> 01:20:34,793
He took the cash!

969
01:20:35,877 --> 01:20:37,462
That's your only worry,

970
01:20:37,504 --> 01:20:39,214
the money?
We've no choice.

971
01:20:39,255 --> 01:20:40,423
We call the cops.

972
01:20:40,465 --> 01:20:42,300
And say what?
The truth.

973
01:20:42,342 --> 01:20:44,803
Yeah? And what truth, exactly?

974
01:20:44,844 --> 01:20:47,722
We drove here to scatter Dad's ashes,

975
01:20:47,764 --> 01:20:51,017
and on the way we discovered
a man in your trunk.

976
01:20:51,351 --> 01:20:52,602
A stranger

977
01:20:52,644 --> 01:20:54,187
who was bleeding...

978
01:20:54,229 --> 01:20:57,857
who took off with the fortune
we found in Dad's fridge.

979
01:21:00,527 --> 01:21:02,320
You're right, it won't fly.

980
01:21:02,362 --> 01:21:06,074
We tell them the truth,
but leave out some things.

981
01:21:06,116 --> 01:21:09,035
We call the cops because he threatened us.

982
01:21:09,911 --> 01:21:11,705
We said nothing to the crew

983
01:21:11,746 --> 01:21:13,373
or the cop just now.

984
01:21:13,415 --> 01:21:14,415
But suddenly,

985
01:21:14,874 --> 01:21:16,501
we remember. Is that it?

986
01:21:16,543 --> 01:21:19,212
Damn, crime is so complicated.

987
01:22:06,885 --> 01:22:07,927
Yes!

988
01:22:15,643 --> 01:22:16,770
Shit.

989
01:22:17,395 --> 01:22:18,563
What's wrong?

990
01:22:18,605 --> 01:22:20,774
The ferry's every two days.

991
01:22:24,444 --> 01:22:26,112
We weren't introduced.

992
01:22:31,618 --> 01:22:34,496
I'll break her arm,
put down the tchotchke!

993
01:22:34,537 --> 01:22:36,623
Put the bird down! Put it down!

994
01:22:37,624 --> 01:22:38,624
What do you want?

995
01:22:39,084 --> 01:22:41,419
We want our money back.

996
01:22:41,461 --> 01:22:43,880
Don't antagonize the criminal, please.

997
01:22:43,922 --> 01:22:47,759
I hate to be grossly materialistic,
but I'm broke.

998
01:22:47,801 --> 01:22:50,637
Let's not worry about our finances now.

999
01:22:51,304 --> 01:22:54,766
I'm fed up with your
stinking condescension!

1000
01:22:54,808 --> 01:22:55,934
What?

1001
01:22:55,975 --> 01:22:57,811
But when your husband keeps you,

1002
01:22:57,852 --> 01:23:00,814
and work's a hobby...
Pierre supports the family!

1003
01:23:04,150 --> 01:23:06,820
Sorry to intrude on your tête-à-tête.

1004
01:23:06,861 --> 01:23:08,613
When does JP arrive?

1005
01:23:08,655 --> 01:23:11,074
I gotta see him, now!

1006
01:23:13,159 --> 01:23:14,327
Jean-Paul Cyr?

1007
01:23:14,369 --> 01:23:16,579
Christ, where is he?
He's dead.

1008
01:23:16,996 --> 01:23:18,456
Dead? How's he dead?

1009
01:23:18,498 --> 01:23:20,125
I saw him last week.

1010
01:23:20,166 --> 01:23:21,668
Lots happens in a week.

1011
01:23:22,002 --> 01:23:23,503
You fucking with me?

1012
01:23:24,671 --> 01:23:26,631
This is him! He's in here!

1013
01:23:28,383 --> 01:23:29,509
Goddamn.

1014
01:23:30,093 --> 01:23:32,012
Goddammit to hell, shit!

1015
01:23:32,721 --> 01:23:34,973
For a week I've chased a dead man?

1016
01:23:35,015 --> 01:23:36,808
Look at the bright side.

1017
01:23:37,308 --> 01:23:38,601
The chase is over.

1018
01:23:38,643 --> 01:23:40,353
But I won't get paid.

1019
01:23:40,395 --> 01:23:43,273
The loot you stole from us
will console you.

1020
01:23:43,648 --> 01:23:47,569
And you won't get nailed with a murder rap.

1021
01:23:47,610 --> 01:23:49,529
We can split the money.

1022
01:23:49,571 --> 01:23:52,032
As accomplices, we'll shut up.

1023
01:23:52,073 --> 01:23:53,491
Really, Christine?

1024
01:23:53,533 --> 01:23:57,871
We're here to scatter Dad's ashes,
not get involved.

1025
01:23:57,912 --> 01:24:01,041
Except you've seen me,
you have the photos.

1026
01:24:01,082 --> 01:24:02,876
We have a PR problem.

1027
01:24:02,917 --> 01:24:05,462
You'll never hear from us again!

1028
01:24:05,503 --> 01:24:08,673
That's what your dad said,
but then he'd want more.

1029
01:24:08,715 --> 01:24:10,050
You don't know us.

1030
01:24:10,091 --> 01:24:14,721
Our family specialty is keeping silent.
We haven't spoken in a year.

1031
01:24:15,472 --> 01:24:17,390
Especially if it's important.

1032
01:24:18,016 --> 01:24:20,977
We're gonna take a little stroll
on the cliffs.

1033
01:24:21,811 --> 01:24:22,771
Move.

1034
01:24:22,812 --> 01:24:25,106
Don't make me pull out my gun.

1035
01:24:25,148 --> 01:24:26,524
Move. Out.

1036
01:24:30,320 --> 01:24:31,571
You're hurting me!

1037
01:24:32,113 --> 01:24:34,074
I know where our dad stashed more money.

1038
01:24:34,115 --> 01:24:36,826
We could split it.
Cut the bullshit. Move!

1039
01:24:40,205 --> 01:24:41,456
Don't hurt her!

1040
01:24:41,498 --> 01:24:43,375
Stay where I can see you.

1041
01:24:44,876 --> 01:24:45,877
Marianne...

1042
01:24:45,919 --> 01:24:48,797
It's true I was horrible at Christmas.

1043
01:24:50,006 --> 01:24:51,299
It's the holidays.

1044
01:24:52,258 --> 01:24:53,843
I get unbearable.

1045
01:24:55,845 --> 01:24:57,639
No, I should apologize.

1046
01:24:57,931 --> 01:25:00,767
I know how much your launch meant to you.

1047
01:25:00,809 --> 01:25:04,354
You're so busy.
I'm an adult, I should've let it go.

1048
01:25:04,396 --> 01:25:08,608
Quit gabbing!
You're busting my balls. Let's go!

1049
01:25:12,028 --> 01:25:12,987
Who is it?

1050
01:25:13,029 --> 01:25:14,114
Answer!

1051
01:25:15,490 --> 01:25:17,325
It's my husband. Can I?

1052
01:25:17,367 --> 01:25:18,368
Think I'm stupid?

1053
01:25:18,827 --> 01:25:20,286
We had a fight.

1054
01:25:20,328 --> 01:25:21,663
I can't end like this.

1055
01:25:21,996 --> 01:25:24,582
It's Christmas!
I know it's Christmas!

1056
01:25:24,624 --> 01:25:26,084
Please, my husband!

1057
01:25:26,126 --> 01:25:27,210
Move it!

1058
01:25:27,252 --> 01:25:28,420
One minute!

1059
01:25:28,461 --> 01:25:31,673
Let a mother say goodbye
to the father of her children?

1060
01:25:31,715 --> 01:25:32,674
No, move!

1061
01:25:32,716 --> 01:25:34,509
Don't you have a family?

1062
01:25:34,551 --> 01:25:37,303
I can't believe we're going to die with JP.

1063
01:25:37,345 --> 01:25:39,347
I love you, Marianne!
I love you, too!

1064
01:25:39,389 --> 01:25:41,391
Don't jump, Christine! Run!

1065
01:25:41,433 --> 01:25:44,394
I won't let him kill you.

1066
01:25:45,145 --> 01:25:46,521
Hey, big mouth.

1067
01:25:46,563 --> 01:25:49,482
I'll let you jump first, happy now?

1068
01:26:02,120 --> 01:26:03,329
You pack a punch.

1069
01:26:03,830 --> 01:26:06,291
Me? I wasn't aiming for his head.

1070
01:26:06,332 --> 01:26:08,251
He doesn't look good.

1071
01:26:10,170 --> 01:26:11,129
Check his pulse.

1072
01:26:11,171 --> 01:26:12,172
Why me?

1073
01:26:12,672 --> 01:26:14,674
You're good at things. Go on!

1074
01:26:22,849 --> 01:26:23,933
Is he dead?

1075
01:26:23,975 --> 01:26:24,975
I dunno.

1076
01:26:30,273 --> 01:26:31,273
What now?

1077
01:26:34,819 --> 01:26:35,945
Oh my god!

1078
01:26:35,987 --> 01:26:37,280
What?

1079
01:26:37,322 --> 01:26:40,700
His name's Sauvageau.
Like the other guy.

1080
01:26:47,457 --> 01:26:48,667
Where you going?

1081
01:26:48,708 --> 01:26:50,585
Hey?
I'll be back!

1082
01:26:50,627 --> 01:26:52,462
To get his truck.

1083
01:26:55,882 --> 01:26:57,050
Careful with him.

1084
01:26:57,967 --> 01:26:59,135
He's not helping.

1085
01:26:59,177 --> 01:27:00,178
Go!

1086
01:27:00,220 --> 01:27:01,846
OK, that's it!

1087
01:27:01,888 --> 01:27:03,390
Hold on!

1088
01:27:06,184 --> 01:27:08,019
Do you have to answer?

1089
01:27:08,812 --> 01:27:09,812
It's Pierre.

1090
01:27:11,064 --> 01:27:12,023
Hello?

1091
01:27:12,065 --> 01:27:13,149
<i>Are you OK?</i>

1092
01:27:14,067 --> 01:27:15,193
<i>Where are you?</i>

1093
01:27:15,235 --> 01:27:17,987
I'm on the Islands with my sis.
<i>The Islands?</i>

1094
01:27:18,029 --> 01:27:20,073
We came to scatter Dad's ashes.

1095
01:27:21,491 --> 01:27:22,575
Pierre?

1096
01:27:23,201 --> 01:27:25,662
Could we just talk?

1097
01:27:25,704 --> 01:27:28,873
<i>Marianne, I got a call from the RCMP.</i>

1098
01:27:28,915 --> 01:27:29,874
Oh no!

1099
01:27:29,916 --> 01:27:31,835
<i>Your boyfriend...</i>

1100
01:27:31,876 --> 01:27:33,461
<i>He was given one call.</i>

1101
01:27:33,503 --> 01:27:34,879
He called me.

1102
01:27:34,921 --> 01:27:36,131
Imagine my joy.

1103
01:27:36,923 --> 01:27:38,216
<i>What did he want?</i>

1104
01:27:39,092 --> 01:27:40,468
He made no sense.

1105
01:27:40,510 --> 01:27:44,389
He was raving
you're being chased by a criminal

1106
01:27:44,431 --> 01:27:46,474
who he put in your car.

1107
01:27:46,516 --> 01:27:47,851
<i>He wasn't with me.</i>

1108
01:27:47,892 --> 01:27:50,353
Marianne, should I be worried?

1109
01:27:52,564 --> 01:27:53,523
No.

1110
01:27:53,565 --> 01:27:54,899
It's under control.

1111
01:27:55,608 --> 01:27:56,608
<i>OK.</i>

1112
01:27:57,402 --> 01:27:59,320
<i>So you're both alright?</i>

1113
01:27:59,362 --> 01:28:01,364
Yeah, we'll catch

1114
01:28:01,406 --> 01:28:04,534
the first ferry and drive back.

1115
01:28:04,576 --> 01:28:06,286
But could you and I

1116
01:28:06,327 --> 01:28:07,704
just maybe...

1117
01:28:08,288 --> 01:28:10,290
<i>I dunno, talk, Pierre?</i>

1118
01:28:10,331 --> 01:28:12,459
The boys want to say hello.

1119
01:28:12,500 --> 01:28:13,543
Here they are.

1120
01:28:14,794 --> 01:28:15,837
It's Mom.

1121

Mom!

1122

<i>Hi, sweetheart!</i>

1123
01:28:20,175 --> 01:28:22,635
We got your present,
but it's a secret.

and when I sat on his lap,</i>

1126
01:28:29,225 --> 01:28:30,643
<i>Yeah, I heard it!</i>

1127
01:28:30,685 --> 01:28:32,520
<i>When will you come home?</i>

1128
01:28:32,562 --> 01:28:33,646
Soon.

1129
01:28:34,064 --> 01:28:35,023
<i>I miss you!</i>

<i>Me too, lots.</i>

Bye, guys.

1135
01:28:54,334 --> 01:28:55,335
It's OK.

1136
01:28:57,921 --> 01:28:59,923
What do we do with him?

1137
01:29:01,383 --> 01:29:02,842
C'mon, I have an idea.

1138
01:29:04,928 --> 01:29:07,305
Yes! The money's here!

1139
01:29:14,854 --> 01:29:15,897
What the hell?

1140
01:29:36,501 --> 01:29:37,961
Where am I?

<i>That thug will remember
his visit to the Islands!</i>

It's JP.

1147
01:30:58,917 --> 01:31:00,377
What's JP?

1148
01:31:01,628 --> 01:31:02,796
My song.

1149
01:31:04,756 --> 01:31:06,132
It's about JP.

1150
01:31:15,809 --> 01:31:16,893
Alright, girls?

1151
01:31:35,286 --> 01:31:36,286

Merry Christmas, you bastard.

Do we do it here?

1156
01:32:46,900 --> 01:32:48,485
Sure, might as well.

1157
01:32:49,277 --> 01:32:50,528
What do I do?

1158
01:32:50,987 --> 01:32:52,697
Open the box and throw?

1159
01:32:52,739 --> 01:32:54,741
We could say a few words.
OK.

1160
01:32:55,867 --> 01:32:56,951

1161
01:32:59,120 --> 01:33:00,205

Dad, maybe?

1163
01:33:01,790 --> 01:33:02,999
Your call.

1164
01:33:05,210 --> 01:33:06,210
Bye.

1165

No hard feelings!

OK, seriously...

1167
01:33:16,888 --> 01:33:18,181
Thank you.

1168
01:33:20,225 --> 01:33:21,726
You do it.

1169
01:33:22,727 --> 01:33:24,062
Well...

1170
01:33:25,980 --> 01:33:29,901
Strictly in terms of biology,
he did give us life.

1171
01:33:30,276 --> 01:33:34,447
Given our upbringing,
we're lucky we weren't both committed.

1172
01:33:35,615 --> 01:33:38,910
OK, a tribute before my fingers freeze.
Yes!

1173

Thanks for genes

Are you alright?

1179
01:34:27,334 --> 01:34:29,627
It's everywhere!
Dad's in my eyes!

1180
01:34:29,669 --> 01:34:30,628
Look.

1181
01:34:30,670 --> 01:34:32,464
What?
Is Dad in my eyes?

1182

- Okay? No more running.
- Fine.

148
00:12:50,804 --> 00:12:52,239
Do you promise?

149
00:12:52,273 --> 00:12:55,075
You might be the worst criminal
in the history of the sport.

150
00:12:55,109 --> 00:12:57,278
- I am not a criminal.
- Clearly.

151
00:12:57,311 --> 00:12:59,146
I'm not. I swear to God,
this isn't me.

152
00:12:59,179 --> 00:13:02,483
I only agreed to kill
that guy Walter
because my kid's in jail.

153
00:13:02,517 --> 00:13:04,118
I need the money
to get him a lawyer.

154
00:13:04,151 --> 00:13:08,322
You agreed to kill someone
so that your kid
could have a lawyer?

155
00:13:08,355 --> 00:13:09,390
Yeah.

156
00:13:10,759 --> 00:13:12,860
Are you stupid?

157
00:13:15,530 --> 00:13:18,966
- [alarm blaring]
- [guard] Welcome
to the jungle, motherfuckers.

158
00:13:20,735 --> 00:13:24,171
You don't eat.
You don't sleep.

159
00:13:24,204 --> 00:13:28,777
You can't even shit
without my permission.

160
00:13:28,809 --> 00:13:33,447
I don't give a fuck
if your eyes pop out
and your face turns red.

161
00:13:35,215 --> 00:13:37,451
But you don't have to worry
about that, do you...

162
00:13:37,484 --> 00:13:39,253
chocolate drop?

163
00:13:40,789 --> 00:13:41,955
Who'd you sell crack to?

164
00:13:41,989 --> 00:13:46,360
Your sister? Your aunt?
Your baby mama?

165
00:13:47,328 --> 00:13:49,997
I bet you think you and me
are the same.

166
00:13:50,030 --> 00:13:51,566
Best believe
I'll bust your black ass

167
00:13:51,832 --> 00:13:55,202
just as quick as I'd bust
that white bread cracker
standing next to you.

168
00:13:57,806 --> 00:14:00,040
And who the fuck
are you supposed to be?

169
00:14:01,442 --> 00:14:03,177
What's your fucking name?

170
00:14:05,580 --> 00:14:07,147
Billy Powers.

171
00:14:08,583 --> 00:14:10,317
Billy Powers...

172
00:14:12,019 --> 00:14:14,455
Welcome to the jungle,
motherfucker.

173
00:14:20,094 --> 00:14:22,196
What the fuck are you
telling me right now?

174
00:14:22,229 --> 00:14:25,866
- I'm not really sure,
Pauly.
- Why is that?

175
00:14:25,899 --> 00:14:29,738
I guess because
I'm short on information.

176
00:14:29,771 --> 00:14:32,841
- You're short?
- On information, yeah.

177
00:14:32,873 --> 00:14:36,143
Well, I need you
not to be, Dom.

178
00:14:36,176 --> 00:14:38,580
I can't even
fucking repeat that.

179
00:14:38,613 --> 00:14:40,013
I'll find out
what happened.

180
00:14:40,047 --> 00:14:43,651
Well, that's good.
That's really fucking good.

181
00:14:43,685 --> 00:14:45,986
- Yeah.
- This?

182
00:14:47,622 --> 00:14:49,624
- Not good, Dom.
- I know that.

183
00:14:49,657 --> 00:14:51,793
Well, it's good
you fucking know.
That's good.

184
00:14:51,826 --> 00:14:54,061
I hope you also know
that this is on you.

185
00:14:54,094 --> 00:14:56,029
This is your fucking fault.

186
00:14:57,131 --> 00:14:59,466
Go. Go fucking
take care of it.

187
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:01,536
You give me fucking <i>agita.</i>

188
00:15:03,470 --> 00:15:05,507
[bird cawing]

189
00:15:06,907 --> 00:15:09,009
Sorry, was that
cook a friend of yours?

190
00:15:12,479 --> 00:15:13,681
What happened?

191
00:15:15,517 --> 00:15:19,953
If it's okay with you,
maybe we can skip
the pleasantries.

192
00:15:19,987 --> 00:15:22,489
I've been kidnapped,
I'm walking back to the car.

193
00:15:22,524 --> 00:15:23,558
Let's just leave it
at that.

194
00:15:24,391 --> 00:15:27,461
You don't have
to put your hands up.
That's great.

195
00:15:28,996 --> 00:15:31,766
- This is obviously
an awkward situation.
- Yes.

196
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:33,934
Well, I figured maybe if I knew
a thing or two about you,

197
00:15:33,967 --> 00:15:37,971
- it wouldn't have
to be-- Right.
- It won't be awkward. Okay.

198
00:15:38,005 --> 00:15:40,441
I'm Lola.
I've said that already.

199
00:15:40,474 --> 00:15:43,944
I moved to Costa Rica
a few years ago to open
an acting school

200
00:15:43,977 --> 00:15:46,648
because living here
reminded me of two things...

201
00:15:46,681 --> 00:15:48,883
failure and trauma.
Anything else?

202
00:15:48,917 --> 00:15:51,118
[stammering] You, uh--

203
00:15:51,151 --> 00:15:52,854
You opened
an acting school
in Costa Rica?

204
00:15:52,887 --> 00:15:55,122
- It didn't work out.
- That's shocking.

205
00:16:00,862 --> 00:16:02,597
I'm sorry about all this.

206
00:16:05,265 --> 00:16:06,500
Okay.

207
00:16:10,872 --> 00:16:12,339
[exhales sharply]

208
00:16:15,677 --> 00:16:18,312
Wasn't your car
right here?

209
00:16:24,051 --> 00:16:25,620
Fuck, I give up.

210
00:16:27,054 --> 00:16:31,291
Just fuck it all, man!
Just fucking... fuck!

211
00:16:36,497 --> 00:16:37,765
Are you fucking crying?

212
00:16:39,066 --> 00:16:42,504
- I'm really not a criminal.
- Yeah.

213
00:16:42,537 --> 00:16:45,205
- I'm getting that.
- I'm trying to do right
by my son.

214
00:16:45,239 --> 00:16:47,341
That's all I'm trying to do.

215
00:16:47,374 --> 00:16:49,209
This poor fucking kid
never had a chance.

216
00:16:49,243 --> 00:16:51,478
You think I'm an asshole?
You should meet his mother.

217
00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:55,415
If you want to run now,
or walk, or whatever,

218
00:16:55,449 --> 00:16:56,918
I'm not gonna hold it
against you,

219
00:16:56,951 --> 00:16:58,418
so you can go ahead.

220
00:17:00,889 --> 00:17:02,657
Well, are you
just gonna sit there?

221
00:17:02,690 --> 00:17:07,160
No, I'm either
currently wanted
for murder, or I'm...

222
00:17:07,194 --> 00:17:10,097
Yeah, I'm gonna be murdered
by the guys who hired me

223
00:17:10,130 --> 00:17:11,465
to murder the guy
I did not murder.

224
00:17:11,498 --> 00:17:14,368
So, yeah, sitting here seems--
seems like the move.

225
00:17:19,507 --> 00:17:22,744
You got any better ideas?
I'll take any suggestions.

226
00:17:26,948 --> 00:17:28,516
Maybe I can help you.

227
00:17:29,717 --> 00:17:32,020
- Are you fucking with me?
- No, I wouldn't do that.

228
00:17:32,052 --> 00:17:34,221
You're a big scary man
with a gun.

229
00:17:34,254 --> 00:17:36,156
Also, pretty sure
you're out of bullets.

230
00:17:38,993 --> 00:17:40,562
Why would you help me?

231
00:17:42,195 --> 00:17:43,831
Maybe we can
help each other.

232
00:17:47,134 --> 00:17:51,573
I should have my fucking head
examined for trusting
this idiot again.

233
00:17:51,606 --> 00:17:53,808
- It's my fault.
- No, no, no, no.

234
00:17:53,841 --> 00:17:55,743
It's my fault.
It was your fault
10 years ago,

235
00:17:55,777 --> 00:17:58,078
when you told me he'd throw
the fucking fight.

236
00:17:58,111 --> 00:18:00,447
It's my fault for listening
the second time, okay?

237
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:03,551
Fool me once,
shame on you.
Fool me twice...

238
00:18:03,585 --> 00:18:05,920
It's just
that we grew up together.

239
00:18:05,954 --> 00:18:07,454
He used to be a smart fuck.

240
00:18:07,487 --> 00:18:10,725
- I don't know what happened.
- I just said it was my fault.

241
00:18:10,758 --> 00:18:13,193
You want to get me hot?

242
00:18:13,226 --> 00:18:16,598
Yeah, but you said
it was your fault
for listening to me,

243
00:18:16,631 --> 00:18:18,600
which kind of makes it my fault
if you think about it.

244
00:18:18,633 --> 00:18:20,267
I don't want to fucking
think about it.

245
00:18:20,300 --> 00:18:22,202
That's what I'm saying,
Dom, okay?

246
00:18:22,235 --> 00:18:23,905
Now you want to get me
fucking hot?

247
00:18:23,938 --> 00:18:27,075
You want to get me fucking hot,
or you want to let it go?

248
00:18:27,107 --> 00:18:29,242
- Fine.
- Thank you, that is fine.
Thank you.

249
00:18:29,276 --> 00:18:30,678
Now tomorrow, first thing,

250
00:18:30,712 --> 00:18:32,880
I want you to go and see
that fucking degenerate cowboy

251
00:18:32,914 --> 00:18:35,617
and see if you can straighten
this fucking out, all right?

252
00:18:35,650 --> 00:18:38,620
Who knows? Maybe it's all
for the best.

253
00:18:38,653 --> 00:18:42,155
- You did the right thing.
- What?

254
00:18:42,189 --> 00:18:43,658
You did the right thing,
I'm saying,

255
00:18:43,691 --> 00:18:45,793
having
the guy clipped.

256
00:18:45,827 --> 00:18:48,696
He owed you 100 grand
for six weeks.
You did the right thing.

257
00:18:48,730 --> 00:18:50,497
Are you being
a fucking wise ass
right now?

258
00:18:50,531 --> 00:18:54,234
- Are you fucking with me, Dom?
- What do you mean?

259
00:18:54,267 --> 00:18:56,303
What do I mean?
What do you mean,
what the fuck do I mean?

260
00:18:56,336 --> 00:18:59,807
It didn't fucking work.
It didn't work. What do you
mean, ""I had him clipped""?

261
00:18:59,841 --> 00:19:01,308
- I'm just saying.
- Don't say.

262
00:19:01,341 --> 00:19:03,443
I don't want you
to fucking say,
all right? Do!

263
00:19:03,477 --> 00:19:04,879
I don't want you
to fucking say.

264
00:19:04,912 --> 00:19:07,649
In retrospect, I would like
to have my hundred stacks,

265
00:19:07,682 --> 00:19:10,652
- if that's okay with you.
- I got it.

266
00:19:10,685 --> 00:19:14,522
Good. Now, tomorrow
first thing,
you go out there

267
00:19:14,555 --> 00:19:17,190
and you take care
of this fucking thing
with this cowboy.

268
00:19:17,224 --> 00:19:18,593
Hopefully,
with some success,

269
00:19:18,626 --> 00:19:22,664
and then I want you to find
that fucking cunt Jackie

270
00:19:22,697 --> 00:19:25,733
and I want you
to bring him to me directly.

271
00:19:25,767 --> 00:19:27,401
Are we fucking clear?

272
00:19:28,569 --> 00:19:30,437
- Yeah, yeah. We're clear.
- Yeah, yeah.

273
00:19:30,470 --> 00:19:33,240
What the fuck
is going on with you?

274
00:19:37,712 --> 00:19:40,815
[Jackie] What's happening?
What's happening?

275
00:19:40,848 --> 00:19:42,215
What the fuck
are you doing?

276
00:19:42,249 --> 00:19:44,217
- What are you doing?
- Why are you hiding?

277
00:19:44,251 --> 00:19:45,820
No one knows that I work
at that fucking diner.

278
00:19:45,853 --> 00:19:47,689
- I'm being fucking discreet.
- Oh, discreet!

279
00:19:47,722 --> 00:19:50,525
And pertaining to the others
of concern, one's dead

280
00:19:50,558 --> 00:19:52,527
and for all we know,
the other might have
killed him, okay?

281
00:19:52,560 --> 00:19:54,327
- Shh!
- Just relax.
Oh, don't shush me!

282
00:19:54,361 --> 00:19:55,630
This is my fucking
neighborhood, okay?

283
00:19:55,663 --> 00:19:57,565
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.

284
00:19:57,598 --> 00:19:59,534
By the way, speaking
of your fucking neighborhood,

285
00:19:59,567 --> 00:20:01,502
what were you doing
working at that shithole?

286
00:20:01,536 --> 00:20:03,270
- You're clearly rich.
- No, no, no.

287
00:20:03,303 --> 00:20:06,239
This is my mom's house.
She's rich.

288

Truth be told,
her ex-husbands are rich.

289
00:20:08,109 --> 00:20:09,977
- She's just lucky.
- Uh-huh.

290
00:20:12,747 --> 00:20:14,916
I'm sorry, did you say
ex-husbands with an ""S""?

291
00:20:14,949 --> 00:20:17,250
All four of them.
Rich and dead.

292
00:20:17,284 --> 00:20:18,920
They call my mom
""The Black Widow.""

Oh, great.

some of the money

and I get to go back
to Costa Rica and pay
my mortgage.

305
00:21:05,398 --> 00:21:08,970
You gonna say anything
or are you just gonna keep
nodding your head like that?

306
00:21:09,003 --> 00:21:11,239
Okay, why are we
getting married?

307

Because... [sighs]

it's the sole condition
of my mother's will.

nice things.

to Mr. Thomas here

1146

that we're gonna go ahead
and set this matter for a trial,

1147

in custody until that time.

that's a good idea,

- Thank you.

my client was found to be

1152

and marijuana.

1153

on the other juveniles

1156

for the so-called kidnapping,
but the way I understand it,

1157
01:09:58,900 --> 01:10:03,203
they took a classmate against
his will back to one
of their parents' homes.

- Kidnapping.

Right. Again, I'm not here
to speak on what
those other children did,

1160
01:10:09,811 --> 01:10:12,013

he showed up after the fact

1161
01:10:12,046 --> 01:10:15,516
and he had no idea
what was going on
until after he arrived.

I can't answer
that question,
Your Honor,

that that question
doesn't need to be answered.

the right decision
to leave immediately,

the drinking and smoking,

1168

the only thing Billy Powers
is guilty of is bad taste.

1169

that he should be allowed

1170

to stay with his mother
while awaiting trial.

Of course, with the court's
recommendation for monitoring.

to my next question.
Where is the mother?

were never answered.

that the probation office
did as well, yet no call back?

Billy is a big boy.
I'll write to him.

1310
01:25:50,350 --> 01:25:51,919
[stammers] What are you,
a tough guy with a gun now?

1311
01:25:51,953 --> 01:25:54,522
- I'm supposed
to be scared of you?
- This is not my fault.

1312
01:25:54,555 --> 01:25:57,125
We are not
in this situation
because of me.

1313
01:25:57,157 --> 01:25:58,860
No, no. I'm not talking
about that.

1314
01:25:58,893 --> 01:26:01,129
I'm talking about you
specifically.

1315
01:26:01,194 --> 01:26:03,196
Once a bitch,
always a bitch.

1316
01:26:03,230 --> 01:26:04,632
- If I'm a bitch...
- Uh-huh.

1317
01:26:04,666 --> 01:26:08,136
...it's because
every single time
I help you out,

1318
01:26:08,168 --> 01:26:09,904
I get fucked in the ass!

1319
01:26:09,937 --> 01:26:12,940
You looked like you
were gonna piss yourself
your first day at Central.

1320
01:26:12,974 --> 01:26:14,408
If it wasn't for me,

1321
01:26:14,441 --> 01:26:16,544
you wouldn't have lasted
three seconds in that place,
okay?

1322
01:26:16,577 --> 01:26:18,412
Jackie, I'm not
fucking playing,
all right?

1323
01:26:18,445 --> 01:26:21,415
[stammers] You're gonna do it,
or I'm gonna fucking shoot you.

1324
01:26:21,448 --> 01:26:23,483
[laughing]
I fucking dare you
to put that gun down.

1325
01:26:23,518 --> 01:26:25,953
I fucking dare you.
Please.

1326
01:26:25,987 --> 01:26:28,355
- Without the fucking gun!
- Okay.

1327
01:26:28,388 --> 01:26:29,891
Can I put my fucking clothes
on first?

1328
01:26:29,924 --> 01:26:32,126
Put your clothes on!
I don't want your balls
in my face!

1329
01:26:32,160 --> 01:26:34,595
- [Jackie] Oh, fuck!
- Fuck! Fucking...

1330
01:26:34,629 --> 01:26:35,963
[grunting]

1331
01:26:37,699 --> 01:26:39,100
Oh!

1332
01:26:39,133 --> 01:26:40,267
Fuck.

1333
01:26:40,300 --> 01:26:42,870
[grunting, groaning]

1334
01:26:55,183 --> 01:26:56,918
[body thuds]

1335
01:26:56,951 --> 01:26:58,986
[panting]

00:01:58,026 --> 00:01:59,379
Welcome.

2
00:01:59,794 --> 00:02:01,477
Have a great time shopping.

3
00:02:49,644 --> 00:02:50,542
Okay.

4
00:02:50,578 --> 00:02:53,012
Let's meet up later then.
Alright. Okay.

5
00:03:12,867 --> 00:03:15,176
Why are you so restless?

6
00:03:15,203 --> 00:03:18,627
Do you have to make me
look for you all over?

7
00:03:19,841 --> 00:03:22,457
Why aren't you answering me?
Are you deaf?

8
00:03:22,744 --> 00:03:25,656
I'm sorry, lady

9
00:03:26,181 --> 00:03:28,763
what did you call me? Lady?

10
00:03:28,983 --> 00:03:31,178
You just don't listen.
Come here.

11
00:03:31,419 --> 00:03:34,183
I told you to come here

12
00:03:34,389 --> 00:03:35,583
come here.

13
00:03:37,826 --> 00:03:39,088
Come here now.

14
00:03:41,763 --> 00:03:45,005
Say it to me once more.
What did you call me?

15
00:03:45,867 --> 00:03:47,823
Answer me!

16
00:03:48,336 --> 00:03:51,578
Are you making fun of me?
Making fun of an adult?

17
00:03:53,041 --> 00:03:57,159
Oh, you're hurting me! I'm sorry

18
00:04:02,016 --> 00:04:04,598
mom~ mom~

19
00:04:06,855 --> 00:04:09,050
will you do this again?
Or won't you?

20
00:04:09,090 --> 00:04:11,069
I won't do it again

21
00:04:14,429 --> 00:04:17,159
go and wash your face.
Stop crying by the time I count to 3

22
00:04:17,365 --> 00:04:19,765
one, two...

23
00:04:26,107 --> 00:04:32,000
Oh, hi honey.
I'm at the department store

24
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:34,646
I have nothing much to do
without you!

25
00:04:35,984 --> 00:04:39,283
You know I relieve stress
through shopping.

26
00:04:39,521 --> 00:04:41,534
So you're coming home
tomorrow morning?

27
00:04:41,756 --> 00:04:45,271
What do you want for breakfast?
Did you buy me a present?

28
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:47,916
A handbag?

29
00:04:55,637 --> 00:04:58,344
Get a grip.

30
00:04:58,373 --> 00:05:02,639
How else do you think I survive
raising someone else's kid?

31
00:05:02,811 --> 00:05:05,575
You're always saying that money
is everything to me

32
00:05:05,847 --> 00:05:10,750
once poverty comes through the door,
love is gone out the window

33
00:05:13,354 --> 00:05:15,788
don't forget what I'm
telling you now. Bye...

34
00:05:20,862 --> 00:05:21,886
Oh!

35
00:05:59,767 --> 00:06:07,617
Princess Aurora

36
00:06:41,776 --> 00:06:43,459
What's he doing?

37
00:06:43,978 --> 00:06:46,139
- Can you turn off the siren?
- What?

38
00:06:46,347 --> 00:06:48,542
- Turn off the siren, please.
- What?

39
00:06:48,583 --> 00:06:51,438
turn off the siren.
Oh, we're actually...

40
00:06:51,719 --> 00:06:54,335
- I'm sorry.
- Sorry for what?

41
00:06:54,556 --> 00:06:55,909
Turn it off

42
00:06:59,194 --> 00:07:02,925
you're always doing what you're told
= welcome!

43
00:07:05,066 --> 00:07:06,749
Please turn on your lights

44
00:07:07,068 --> 00:07:11,129
we're the police. =-yes?

45
00:07:11,172 --> 00:07:16,826
- We're here to investigate the crime scene.
- Yes, so what?

46
00:07:18,146 --> 00:07:20,239
Have a great time shopping!

47
00:07:21,149 --> 00:07:22,855
Screw the shopping

48
00:07:23,718 --> 00:07:26,881
do they expect police to
pay for parking?

49
00:07:26,921 --> 00:07:30,550
Don't get angry.
Here, we need validation

50
00:07:32,460 --> 00:07:33,836
oh, geez

51
00:07:36,731 --> 00:07:37,993
look inside

52
00:07:38,233 --> 00:07:39,882
keep up the good work

53
00:07:40,235 --> 00:07:42,066
oh, shit!

54
00:07:43,571 --> 00:07:50,135
I pray to you lord,

55
00:07:50,812 --> 00:07:56,079
to help guide those poor in need

56
00:07:56,384 --> 00:07:58,909
- amen!
- Amen

57
00:07:59,554 --> 00:08:01,265
I think the body was
stabbed dozens of times

58
00:08:01,289 --> 00:08:03,211
with a sharp object like a spear

59
00:08:03,558 --> 00:08:06,891
it doesn't seem like an accident.
More like revenge

60
00:08:07,162 --> 00:08:10,131
where can you buy kitchenware?
= kitchenware?

61
00:08:10,298 --> 00:08:11,981
A fork has three Spears, right?

62
00:08:13,768 --> 00:08:15,656
You've been peeking
during your prayer

63
00:08:17,172 --> 00:08:22,804
such a sensual body and
smooth skin

64
00:08:23,011 --> 00:08:26,526
this is the best car for those
with a pride to match

65
00:08:26,748 --> 00:08:30,058
a beautiful and sexy wife
who listens to you

66
00:08:30,084 --> 00:08:32,450
wouldn't that be fantastic?

67
00:08:32,620 --> 00:08:34,724
I prefer a lover than a wife

68
00:08:34,756 --> 00:08:36,951
she can be both a wife
and a lover

69
00:08:37,125 --> 00:08:39,116
she'd be attracting attention.

70
00:08:39,160 --> 00:08:41,469
But you'll be the
only one she wants

71
00:08:41,863 --> 00:08:47,301
scientific and initial
investigation are

72
00:08:47,602 --> 00:08:50,332
key to every case.

73
00:08:50,371 --> 00:08:51,882
You need to explore all the
options you have

74
00:08:51,906 --> 00:08:54,739
explore all the options!

75
00:08:54,776 --> 00:08:58,075
- You must use your head!
- Use your head

76
00:09:00,014 --> 00:09:05,611
are you laughing? How can you
laugh at a time like this?

77
00:09:06,821 --> 00:09:08,812
Anyway, try to
organize the facts

78
00:09:08,857 --> 00:09:10,688
in a scientific way!

79
00:09:11,793 --> 00:09:15,160
Yes, sir. We don't have the
murder weapon yet

80
00:09:15,396 --> 00:09:16,941
there's a high chance that
a kitchen utensil was used

81
00:09:16,965 --> 00:09:20,025
so I've requested the forensic
lab to investigate them

82
00:09:20,235 --> 00:09:22,546
we're looking the crime as both
incidental or calculated revenge

83
00:09:22,570 --> 00:09:23,914
keeping both options open,
we're investigating

84
00:09:23,938 --> 00:09:26,247
possible suspects
around the victim.

85
00:09:26,274 --> 00:09:27,707
What else?

86
00:09:29,177 --> 00:09:32,089
We've come to a conclusion that..
The murderer is female

87
00:09:32,347 --> 00:09:35,350
a woman! =-yes

88
00:09:35,583 --> 00:09:37,289
how did you find that out?

89
00:09:37,318 --> 00:09:40,810
That's great work. Well done!

90
00:09:41,423 --> 00:09:43,516
In any case,

91
00:09:43,858 --> 00:09:46,053
you are fools if you can't
figure this one out.

92
00:09:46,294 --> 00:09:49,604
I'm sure the criminal's face was
caught on the security cameras

93
00:09:49,631 --> 00:09:52,486
narrow them down, one by one.

94
00:09:53,902 --> 00:09:56,336
Get to it! Move it! Come on!

95
00:10:00,475 --> 00:10:04,923
What are you doing, pastor?
Praying again?

96
00:10:08,983 --> 00:10:10,052
Ms. jung soon-jung,

97
00:10:10,084 --> 00:10:11,228
did you pack your own lunch again?

98
00:10:11,252 --> 00:10:12,025
Yes.

99
00:10:12,053 --> 00:10:13,099
Oh, Ms. jung

100
00:10:13,321 --> 00:10:15,321
I heard you've got your license
for heavy machinery

101
00:10:15,523 --> 00:10:17,753
guess you'll be selling
trucks too?

102
00:10:17,792 --> 00:10:19,680
My dream is to drive a crane

103
00:10:19,727 --> 00:10:23,845
- you get better commission.
- That's scary.

104
00:10:24,399 --> 00:10:27,129
You look great today. = thanks.

105
00:10:39,113 --> 00:10:42,514
Cameras for each shop.
40 shops in all.

106
00:10:42,750 --> 00:10:44,433
One in each aisle & corner

107
00:10:45,220 --> 00:10:48,371
shit, I'll never
go through this all

108
00:10:48,723 --> 00:10:51,783
did they teach you how to curse
at the police academy?

109
00:10:55,897 --> 00:10:57,512
Well, detective oh,

110
00:10:58,533 --> 00:11:00,785
why do you want to be a pastor?

111
00:11:01,836 --> 00:11:05,021
What does a pastor do?
They guide sinners

112
00:11:05,273 --> 00:11:06,228
policemen do the same thing.

113
00:11:06,274 --> 00:11:07,536
We catch the sinners

114
00:11:07,575 --> 00:11:10,157
and put them in jail.
= let's take a look.

115
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:13,672
Gotcha

116
00:11:15,617 --> 00:11:17,414
that's her, isn't it?

117
00:11:19,587 --> 00:11:21,805
But who's gonna talk to her?

118
00:11:37,872 --> 00:11:39,430
What's that?

119
00:11:42,844 --> 00:11:44,493
It's a magic wand

120
00:11:44,712 --> 00:11:47,021
she's learning magic these days

121
00:11:47,582 --> 00:11:51,313
wow, the wand looks great.

122
00:11:51,352 --> 00:11:54,321
Did your mom buy it for you?

123
00:11:55,824 --> 00:11:57,655
Did your dad buy it?

124
00:12:02,263 --> 00:12:04,572
On the day of the murder,

125
00:12:08,970 --> 00:12:12,030
when you were at
the department store

126
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:14,617
with your mother
in the bathroom...

127
00:12:14,642 --> 00:12:17,008
She's not my mother.

128
00:12:17,545 --> 00:12:18,625
Oh, okay

129
00:12:18,847 --> 00:12:23,147
did she fight with anyone?

130
00:12:24,886 --> 00:12:26,979
Did you see the face?

131
00:12:28,690 --> 00:12:31,067
I want to put that
bad guy in jail

132
00:12:31,092 --> 00:12:33,401
that lady is not a bad person!

133
00:12:33,661 --> 00:12:35,310
What lady?

134
00:12:35,530 --> 00:12:38,328
The lady.
You don't know a thing!

135
00:12:43,471 --> 00:12:46,929
- How's my hair?
- The color came out great.

136
00:12:47,208 --> 00:12:50,302
It looks great

137
00:12:51,613 --> 00:12:52,932
I'm leaving now

138
00:12:53,114 --> 00:12:54,274
come this way

139
00:12:54,449 --> 00:12:55,791
you've ordered dinner, remember?

140
00:12:55,817 --> 00:12:58,194
That was ages ago.

141
00:12:58,219 --> 00:13:00,687
I'm not waiting for that

142
00:13:00,722 --> 00:13:02,280
delivery is here.

143
00:13:03,091 --> 00:13:09,235
Hey, I almost collapsed
waiting for you

144
00:13:09,264 --> 00:13:11,300
we had back to back deliveries

145
00:13:11,332 --> 00:13:13,095
well, too bad.

146
00:13:13,334 --> 00:13:16,576
I'm no longer hungry.
Take it back

147
00:13:16,604 --> 00:13:18,253
okay?

148
00:13:20,642 --> 00:13:22,530
Ordering food and sending
it back again.

149
00:13:22,577 --> 00:13:24,317
Talk about being rude

150
00:13:24,345 --> 00:13:28,679
what did you just say?

151
00:13:28,883 --> 00:13:33,308
- I didn't say anything.
- Yes, you said something.

152
00:13:33,555 --> 00:13:35,534
You're calling me rude?

153
00:13:35,890 --> 00:13:38,495
How dare you call me that?

00:13:38,526 --> 00:13:43,304
- Did you really say that?
- No. I didn't say that

Hurry on out

Apologize before you leave

don't order from that place
from now on. Got it?

You had me waiting a long time

say to me?

we have a murder case?

You need to eat to work hard

00:15:39,547 --> 00:15:41,640
- I'll see you there.
- Okay, alright. Let's eat.

oh, no. It's not me.
1 didn't do it

206
00:20:48,623 --> 00:20:52,024
I'm positive that I made holes

207
00:20:52,060 --> 00:20:54,096
so that she could breathe

208
00:20:54,129 --> 00:20:56,597
or else, she'd suffocate.
And we never plaster hands

209
00:20:56,631 --> 00:20:59,122
that's right.
Why would we do her hands?

210
00:20:59,167 --> 00:21:00,850
Then, why did you
leave her alone?

00:21:01,136 --> 00:21:02,364

00:23:55,677 --> 00:23:57,053
Yes

you get married,

256
00:23:59,914 --> 00:24:03,975

258
00:24:08,923 --> 00:24:12,199

you were last

00:24:12,227 --> 00:24:14,457
Friday between 11 to 12:30 am?

260
00:24:14,496 --> 00:24:16,748
I was here in my office

261
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:21,933
oh, honey. You have company

262
00:24:28,810 --> 00:24:31,335
What are you doing here

263
00:24:31,579 --> 00:24:33,627
instead of going after
the criminals?

264
00:24:34,349 --> 00:24:37,079
This is an invasion of privacy

265

commissioner last weekend

her airway and gullet

276
00:25:15,690 --> 00:25:19,023

277
00:25:19,060 --> 00:25:22,882
as there are evident marks on
her neck, shoulders, and stomach

278
00:25:23,465 --> 00:25:26,138
and there are fingernail marks...

279

Fingernail marks!

280
00:25:27,335 --> 00:25:29,326

the killer is female

by a woman. And so was this one!

Don't you feel the connection?

283
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:34,676
What connection?

00:25:34,709 --> 00:25:36,631
Oh, you're too dull

00:25:37,112 --> 00:25:39,160

want us to see?

287
00:26:03,972 --> 00:26:05,405
How's the ride?

288
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:06,907
It feels good

289
00:26:15,083 --> 00:26:19,179

291

292

from this place

296

but, surely you must overcome that

297

I was oblivious of this fact
during the initial investigation

I've come to the conclusion

the acts of a single killer.
They all involve a child

331
00:30:46,221 --> 00:30:50,157
department store victim
and these ones?

332
00:30:50,859 --> 00:30:54,886
For instance, did the two women
know each other?

333
00:30:55,163 --> 00:30:59,281
We cannot find the link as of yet

334
00:31:01,136 --> 00:31:03,991
well, let's organize
a special team

335
00:31:04,239 --> 00:31:06,707
to focus on this case

336
00:31:06,741 --> 00:31:08,242
and please take extra precaution

337
00:31:08,276 --> 00:31:10,312
when you talk to the press

338
00:31:10,345 --> 00:31:11,391
yes sir

339
00:31:16,851 --> 00:31:18,591
I'm on my way back.

340
00:31:18,620 --> 00:31:20,599
Did the test driver return yet?

341
00:31:37,806 --> 00:31:39,785
Are you still studying
to become a pastor?

342
00:31:41,476 --> 00:31:43,239
Yeah

343
00:31:44,312 --> 00:31:48,408
but I haven't gotten that
far because I've been busy

344
00:31:48,917 --> 00:31:51,260
it's funny that you're trying
to help other people

345
00:31:51,286 --> 00:31:52,992
when you have troubles
of your own when you

346
00:31:53,021 --> 00:31:54,943
couldn't even take care of
your own family

347
00:31:55,056 --> 00:31:56,978
don't you think so?

348
00:31:58,927 --> 00:32:00,940
You must pray a lot

349
00:32:02,497 --> 00:32:06,524
do you pray for min-ah
and me from time to time?

350
00:32:07,368 --> 00:32:08,960
Often

351
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:16,007
when you become a pastor,

352
00:32:16,544 --> 00:32:19,240
will you be able to
save min-ah's soul?

353
00:32:26,988 --> 00:32:30,924
Why did you come here?
To pray for me?

354
00:33:39,894 --> 00:33:42,180
We look like we're
committing adultery

355
00:33:42,897 --> 00:33:44,569
people used to think I was your

356
00:33:44,599 --> 00:33:47,067
mistress because of
our age difference

357
00:33:49,370 --> 00:33:50,689
you should go now

358
00:33:50,972 --> 00:33:52,132
don't you need a ride?

359
00:33:52,941 --> 00:33:55,671
I'll take a cab

360
00:33:56,711 --> 00:33:58,087
fine, then

361
00:33:58,413 --> 00:33:59,937
ah, wait

362
00:34:01,116 --> 00:34:05,541
have you been to a department
store lately?

363
00:34:05,887 --> 00:34:10,119
Well? Did someone see me there?

364
00:34:11,593 --> 00:34:15,711
= no, never mind
what? You're making me feel bad.

365
00:34:16,764 --> 00:34:18,629
At times,

366
00:34:21,536 --> 00:34:23,219
I'm scared of you

367
00:35:08,149 --> 00:35:10,219
Detective, don't get me wrong.

368
00:35:10,251 --> 00:35:12,890
I've stopped doing
this long time ago

369
00:35:27,335 --> 00:35:28,597
Thanks. Here you go

370
00:35:28,636 --> 00:35:31,275
- no way, I can't take this.
- Come on!

371
00:35:31,306 --> 00:35:32,625
Okay

372
00:35:33,208 --> 00:35:34,288
you can leave

373
00:35:37,312 --> 00:35:38,631
yes, sir!

374
00:38:15,403 --> 00:38:20,158
Hanseung barbecue

375
00:38:30,285 --> 00:38:34,130
Hey! Where have you been
all this time?

376
00:38:34,556 --> 00:38:39,004
I was at my elementary
school reunion today

377
00:38:39,294 --> 00:38:40,818
I didn't want to go

378
00:38:41,496 --> 00:38:44,624
but kwang-su forced me to go

379
00:38:44,666 --> 00:38:45,951
so I went

380
00:38:46,167 --> 00:38:47,270
but...

381
00:38:47,435 --> 00:38:48,980
So you were at your
elementary school reunion?

382
00:38:49,004 --> 00:38:50,437
Yes

383
00:38:50,472 --> 00:38:53,635
and that's because kwang-su
forced you to go?

384
00:38:53,675 --> 00:38:54,937
Yes.

385
00:38:55,710 --> 00:38:59,976
Kwang-su was just
here for dinner

386
00:39:00,348 --> 00:39:04,011
oh, really?

387
00:39:04,252 --> 00:39:09,121
When did he get here?
He should have called me first

388
00:39:09,758 --> 00:39:13,569
why do you always
go for my head?

389
00:39:13,595 --> 00:39:15,847
Get ready to close up.
It's already three

390
00:39:16,698 --> 00:39:18,529
yes, mother

391
00:39:19,768 --> 00:39:21,383
excuse me.

392
00:39:22,971 --> 00:39:24,734
We're done for the day

393
00:39:25,106 --> 00:39:28,690
the beef here is too thick

394
00:39:29,878 --> 00:39:32,312
damn it. The scissors are
right there

395
00:39:37,986 --> 00:39:42,161
It's all burnt!
Don't you like it?

396
00:39:44,192 --> 00:39:46,444
It tastes fine

397
00:39:46,928 --> 00:39:51,979
I can't eat it thinking
of my family

398
00:39:52,234 --> 00:39:54,327
are you from yanbian?

399
00:39:55,837 --> 00:39:58,089
Can you tell?

400
00:40:02,477 --> 00:40:07,835
But we're closing now

401
00:40:08,149 --> 00:40:10,128
you have to eat up

402
00:40:30,372 --> 00:40:31,270
Mister

403
00:40:31,306 --> 00:40:33,911
oh, you surprised me.

404
00:40:33,942 --> 00:40:35,569
I didn't even hear you coming

405
00:40:35,610 --> 00:40:36,838
are you on your way out?

406
00:40:36,878 --> 00:40:39,608
Are you off somewhere? =-yes.

407
00:40:39,814 --> 00:40:43,910
I'm sorry.
Can you find another cab?

408
00:40:43,952 --> 00:40:45,419
Why?

409
00:40:46,221 --> 00:40:51,181
Because, it's the first guest.

410
00:40:51,226 --> 00:40:53,205
Are you refusing a passenger?

411
00:40:54,696 --> 00:40:57,915
Don't be so defensive

412
00:40:58,199 --> 00:41:01,828
what bad luck so early in the morning.
= mister...

413
00:41:02,804 --> 00:41:04,601
Are you in a hurry?

414
00:41:06,441 --> 00:41:08,454
I asked you if you're in a hurry

415
00:41:09,544 --> 00:41:11,796
yes, I am

416
00:41:18,486 --> 00:41:19,919
Play it

417
00:41:20,455 --> 00:41:21,774
what?

418
00:41:23,224 --> 00:41:25,590
Play it if you want to

419
00:41:34,569 --> 00:41:37,811
[ Know how dad feels now

420
00:41:37,839 --> 00:41:40,069
she's a great singer

421
00:41:40,108 --> 00:41:42,030
when he said that life is lonely

422
00:41:42,077 --> 00:41:43,874
have a piece of gum

423
00:41:45,080 --> 00:41:53,078
I heard his sad voice as
he whispered in my sleep

424
00:41:55,356 --> 00:42:00,555
[ know how dad feels now

425
00:42:00,595 --> 00:42:04,531
when he said that life is lonely

426
00:42:05,100 --> 00:42:10,333
the song he used to sing as
he looked into the sky

427
00:42:10,372 --> 00:42:14,490
[ saw his sad smile

428
00:42:21,483 --> 00:42:23,553
Mister, is it still
unlucky to pick up

429
00:42:23,585 --> 00:42:25,746
a female at the beginning
of the shift?

430
00:42:25,787 --> 00:42:30,565
It's all superstition

431
00:42:31,626 --> 00:42:34,959
but I'm sure it's
based on something

432
00:42:35,063 --> 00:42:37,315
I was in an accident a while ago

433
00:42:37,565 --> 00:42:40,125
my first passenger
had been a woman

434
00:42:40,168 --> 00:42:43,262
and I knew that
something was weird

435
00:42:43,571 --> 00:42:45,664
did you feel weird today, too?

436
00:42:47,909 --> 00:42:49,797
Mister, if...

437
00:42:50,111 --> 00:42:55,014
If a six-year-old girl asked you

438
00:42:55,283 --> 00:42:58,593
for a ride,
would you allow that?

439
00:42:58,620 --> 00:43:02,283
Sure. Children are people, too

440
00:43:05,493 --> 00:43:08,587
what if the girl didn't have
enough to pay for the fare?

441
00:43:10,231 --> 00:43:15,794
If the kid was short
of just 2 dollars,

442
00:43:16,738 --> 00:43:19,320
would you still take her home?

443
00:43:20,642 --> 00:43:22,769
What are you saying?

444
00:43:23,078 --> 00:43:26,058
If the child, the child...

445
00:43:27,816 --> 00:43:32,628
Mister, I don't have enough money
for the taxi ride

446
00:43:32,654 --> 00:43:37,523
would you still take me home?

447
00:43:37,559 --> 00:43:39,481
Huh, mister?

448
00:43:39,527 --> 00:43:43,918
What is this? Get out!
Who the hell are you?

449
00:43:44,132 --> 00:43:47,226
Get out! You must be crazy

450
00:43:47,402 --> 00:43:50,291
get out. Get out

451
00:43:50,805 --> 00:43:54,707
get out, you

452
00:45:16,057 --> 00:45:20,209
The murderer is a real psycho

453
00:45:21,162 --> 00:45:24,051
and what's with the
Princess Aurora stickers?

454
00:45:27,969 --> 00:45:29,402
Yes, chief

455
00:45:31,940 --> 00:45:33,407
in misari?

456
00:45:34,342 --> 00:45:35,695
Yeah...

457
00:45:37,245 --> 00:45:39,076
Got it, sir

458
00:45:39,681 --> 00:45:41,729
we have to go to misari now

459
00:45:42,050 --> 00:45:43,972
what for? It doesn't fall
under our jurisdiction

460
00:45:44,252 --> 00:45:47,016
a taxi driver was murdered this morning

461
00:45:47,055 --> 00:45:48,299
- in a weird fashion.
- Let's go.

462
00:45:48,323 --> 00:45:49,642
Okay

463
00:45:52,627 --> 00:45:54,424
I didn't order barbecue.

464
00:45:54,629 --> 00:45:57,097
I just ordered beef stew

465
00:45:57,399 --> 00:46:00,823
it's on the house. Cheer up

466
00:46:01,603 --> 00:46:03,696
thank you

467
00:46:09,844 --> 00:46:11,675
Why are you laughing

468
00:46:12,113 --> 00:46:16,834
I think that Korea is full of
strange things

469
00:46:17,118 --> 00:46:19,996
why do you cut beef with scissors?

470
00:46:20,021 --> 00:46:22,421
Well, because...

471
00:46:23,658 --> 00:46:25,421
It's convenient

472
00:46:29,931 --> 00:46:35,164
can you let me work here?

473
00:46:35,203 --> 00:46:37,569
I'll do anything

474
00:46:38,206 --> 00:46:42,711
- I have no place to go.
- A bottle of soju, please.

475
00:46:42,744 --> 00:46:46,202
A job? I can't decide on my own

476
00:46:46,247 --> 00:46:48,112
my mother's in charge of that

477
00:46:54,522 --> 00:46:58,344
- I'll be free in about 30 minutes.
- Hey!

478
00:46:58,560 --> 00:47:01,723
- What are you doing?
- The customers want some soju

479
00:47:01,763 --> 00:47:03,378
okay, mom

480
00:47:32,294 --> 00:47:36,287
- Oh, you're all wet.
- It's okay.

481
00:47:40,802 --> 00:47:43,202
You're even sexier
when you're wet

482
00:47:45,240 --> 00:47:47,800
do you know what 'sexy' means?

483
00:47:48,877 --> 00:47:53,052
I don't. What does it mean?

484
00:47:54,082 --> 00:47:57,415
Something nice

485
00:48:13,301 --> 00:48:15,428
Stay still

486
00:48:16,004 --> 00:48:18,165
I said I'd give you a job

487
00:48:19,174 --> 00:48:21,005
oh, shit. I'm going crazy

488
00:48:30,085 --> 00:48:32,212
- Where are you?
- I'm going, mom.

489
00:48:34,489 --> 00:48:35,865
Stay put for a second

490
00:48:49,404 --> 00:48:50,404
You like it?

491
00:48:56,511 --> 00:48:58,376
Oh, shit. You're making me hot

492
00:48:58,413 --> 00:49:00,631
me, too

493
00:49:05,019 --> 00:49:06,577
stay still

494
00:49:07,589 --> 00:49:10,717
close your eyes.
Keep them closed

495
00:49:13,428 --> 00:49:15,293
shit, today's my lucky day

496
00:49:40,055 --> 00:49:41,055
What is this?

497
00:49:41,089 --> 00:49:42,556
Don't move

498
00:49:45,093 --> 00:49:47,857
if you move an inch,
I'll cut this off

499
00:49:48,096 --> 00:49:50,382
you know that these scissors
are very sharp, don't you?

500
00:49:52,467 --> 00:49:54,742
Don't move. = you bitch!

501
00:49:54,769 --> 00:49:57,329
I told you not to move

502
00:50:05,346 --> 00:50:07,029
Oh, why are you doing this?

503
00:50:07,249 --> 00:50:09,774
Why am I doing this? Why?

504
00:50:10,151 --> 00:50:12,972
I wonder why. I really do wonder

505
00:50:13,855 --> 00:50:16,710
these scissors are really handy

506
00:50:18,793 --> 00:50:22,035
you have a dirty mouth.
Don't you want to curse now?

507
00:50:22,063 --> 00:50:25,612
- Hello?
- Do it, now!

508
00:50:27,168 --> 00:50:28,908
Hey, you fucking asshole!

509
00:50:28,937 --> 00:50:30,825
Who's this calling in the
= it's a woman.

510
00:50:30,872 --> 00:50:35,832
- Middle of the night and cursing?
- Hey you stupid bitch.

511
00:50:35,877 --> 00:50:38,550
= it hurts like hell

512
00:50:38,580 --> 00:50:40,320
Myeong-Gil, myeong-Gil!

513
00:50:40,348 --> 00:50:41,940
Mom...

514
00:50:48,723 --> 00:50:52,659
Maybe it's not here.
I don't see it

515
00:50:53,128 --> 00:50:55,380
no, it should be here

516
00:50:55,664 --> 00:50:57,188
I'm sure it""s here somewhere

517
00:50:59,067 --> 00:51:04,118
it's like looking for
a needle in a haystack

518
00:51:06,007 --> 00:51:07,235
I'm sorry

519
00:51:16,985 --> 00:51:18,361
I found it!

520
00:51:21,322 --> 00:51:23,367
Would have been nice if she
put it somewhere noticeable

521
00:51:23,391 --> 00:51:24,551
give it to me

522
00:51:26,528 --> 00:51:27,756

523
00:51:35,437 --> 00:51:43,435
I heard his sad voice as he
whispered in my sleep

524
00:51:45,313 --> 00:51:50,603
[ know how dad feels now

525
00:51:51,486 --> 00:51:53,954

526
00:51:54,656 --> 00:51:56,612
It's a voice of a kid singing

00:52:00,095 --> 00:52:01,175

528
00:52:02,497 --> 00:52:03,600

540
00:53:03,058 --> 00:53:05,424
Barbecue restaurant... hanseung?

541
00:53:05,627 --> 00:53:06,787

Oh, shit

545
00:54:36,851 --> 00:54:38,352
I didn't keep still this time

546
00:54:38,386 --> 00:54:39,386
I told the director...

547
00:54:43,091 --> 00:54:43,989
What is that?

548
00:54:44,025 --> 00:54:45,561
Did you see that? =-yes.

549
00:54:45,594 --> 00:54:46,856
What is it?

550
00:54:47,295 --> 00:54:48,705
Looks like scissors

551
00:54:48,730 --> 00:54:50,652
- what are you doing?
- It was scissors, right?

552
00:54:50,699 --> 00:54:52,291
Oh my gosh

553
00:54:52,434 --> 00:54:54,834

554
00:54:55,570 --> 00:54:57,106
what's he doing?

555
00:54:57,138 --> 00:54:59,447
What are you doing, mister?
Go away

556
00:55:24,199 --> 00:55:28,556
You're on to something.
Aren't you?

557
00:55:30,472 --> 00:55:33,532
Tell the chief to put out
a notice for arrest

558
00:55:33,775 --> 00:55:35,311
and get a trace on the cell phone

559
00:55:35,343 --> 00:55:39,768
who's the suspect?
Shit, I'm going crazy

560
00:55:40,148 --> 00:55:43,128

563
00:55:55,130 --> 00:55:58,622
it's my wife. My ex-wife

564
00:56:01,903 --> 00:56:03,518
the mother of our dead child

565
00:56:09,311 --> 00:56:10,778
Hand this in for me

566
00:56:11,346 --> 00:56:13,394
- what is it?
- Resignation.

567
00:56:14,649 --> 00:56:15,752
Sir!

568
00:56:25,026 --> 00:56:26,493
The phone has been turned off,

569
00:56:26,528 --> 00:56:31,579
you will be connected to a
voice mail after the beep

570
00:56:31,800 --> 00:56:32,903
it's me

571
00:56:35,370 --> 00:56:38,282
let's meet up.
We have to meet at least once

572
00:56:39,107 --> 00:56:41,575
it can be our last time together

573
00:56:43,244 --> 00:56:44,711
just this once. Call me

574
00:58:13,001 --> 00:58:15,014
That won't do

575
00:58:15,236 --> 00:58:17,397
you need to warm up

576
00:58:21,643 --> 00:58:24,282
what's going on, Ms. jung soon-jung.
I couldn't reach you

577
00:58:24,513 --> 00:58:26,037
that's not nice

578
00:58:32,087 --> 00:58:33,554
Long time no see

579
00:59:06,488 --> 00:59:10,936
The suspect has
killed five people

580
00:59:11,359 --> 00:59:13,941
the modus operandi is
extremely violent

581
00:59:14,195 --> 00:59:17,323
and she uses the
most unusual weapons

582
00:59:17,565 --> 00:59:23,401
cosmetic plaster,
plastic bag, duct tape

583
00:59:23,705 --> 00:59:28,551
and she even used scissors

584
00:59:28,577 --> 00:59:32,308
she uses them in the oddest ways.
= what is her motive?

585
00:59:32,714 --> 00:59:36,286
Her 6-year-old daughter was

586
00:59:36,317 --> 00:59:38,922
kidnapped by a lunatic

587
00:59:38,953 --> 00:59:42,047
she was deserted after
being raped and killed

588
00:59:42,257 --> 00:59:44,418
that must have ticked her off

589
00:59:44,692 --> 00:59:46,944
but her killer was caught

590
00:59:47,195 --> 00:59:51,347
what does she have
against those 5 people?

591
00:59:51,733 --> 00:59:58,138
I don't know that yet

592
00:59:58,373 --> 00:59:59,931
I'm sorry

593
01:00:00,175 --> 01:00:03,269
you must find out so that

594
01:00:03,311 --> 01:00:05,324
we can prevent the next murder

595
01:00:07,182 --> 01:00:09,013
I'm sorry

596
01:00:09,784 --> 01:00:12,844
her ex-husband, who was that?

597
01:00:13,421 --> 01:00:16,788
Yeah, detective oh.
Where is he now?

598
01:00:22,831 --> 01:00:28,758
Sir, I thought you quit your job

599
01:00:29,004 --> 01:00:30,528
why are you here?

600
01:00:31,339 --> 01:00:35,935
I'm here to look into every
lead I can track down

601
01:00:36,278 --> 01:00:37,836
why are you here?

602
01:00:38,079 --> 01:00:40,206
I thought you knew everything
about that case

603
01:00:43,251 --> 01:00:46,800
shit. Why does it seem like
someone else's story?

604
01:00:49,257 --> 01:00:50,451
Let me take a look

605
01:00:54,062 --> 01:00:58,328
the victims do not surface on
any of the official records

606
01:00:59,601 --> 01:01:02,001
I don't know who else is left

607
01:01:05,140 --> 01:01:06,664
nothing

608
01:01:12,881 --> 01:01:15,099
Defendant's attorney,
Kim woo-tack

609
01:01:20,055 --> 01:01:21,215
clgood luck!

610
01:01:21,589 --> 01:01:23,204
Where are you going?

611
01:01:23,558 --> 01:01:25,685
The chief wants me
to bring you in.

612
01:01:26,294 --> 01:01:27,886
Are you going to arrest me?

613
01:01:34,302 --> 01:01:37,123
You must be busy,
having your phone turned off

614
01:01:38,640 --> 01:01:41,404
if you want to meet me,
you must look for me

615
01:01:41,910 --> 01:01:44,526
I'm sure you can find me
if you put your mind to it

616
01:01:45,947 --> 01:01:49,405
hurry up. I'll be waiting

617
01:02:37,065 --> 01:02:38,680
This was just practice

618
01:02:41,102 --> 01:02:44,105
I heard you sold your Porsche.
It looked like a new car

619
01:02:44,939 --> 01:02:46,622
it's not like I'm in my 20's

620
01:02:46,875 --> 01:02:49,275
I don't want to be in the
public eye anymore

621
01:02:50,678 --> 01:02:52,964
why do you think
I still drive a BMW?

622
01:02:56,885 --> 01:02:59,080
What happened to the person
that you told me to defend?

623
01:02:59,120 --> 01:03:00,291
Indicted?

624
01:03:00,321 --> 01:03:01,481
Not yet

625
01:03:02,557 --> 01:03:06,311
- what do you mean not yet?
- It's not over yet.

626
01:03:06,561 --> 01:03:07,880
What isn't over?

627
01:03:09,064 --> 01:03:10,986
The crime

628
01:03:11,166 --> 01:03:12,633
what crime?

629
01:03:13,435 --> 01:03:14,595
Murder

630
01:03:16,171 --> 01:03:17,695
murder?

631
01:03:19,875 --> 01:03:21,740
Murder...

632
01:03:23,278 --> 01:03:27,510
You know, the thing is...
There's no such thing as crime

633
01:03:29,618 --> 01:03:33,167
it's a matter of whether you can
be protected by the law or not

634
01:03:35,557 --> 01:03:38,412
murder, burglary, rape...

635
01:03:39,294 --> 01:03:41,534
It happens every day since the
beginning of human history

636
01:03:41,896 --> 01:03:45,832
when we call it a crime,
it becomes one

637
01:03:46,134 --> 01:03:48,227
and it's just as easy
to turn it over

638
01:03:48,870 --> 01:03:51,998
what we call law is
something very funny

639
01:03:57,178 --> 01:03:58,975
Thank you for calling Kim
and park law firm

640
01:03:59,013 --> 01:04:01,447

01:04:05,186 --> 01:04:06,892
I'm sorry. I can't give out

643
01:04:06,921 --> 01:04:08,718
his number to anyone

644
01:04:08,757 --> 01:04:11,760

648
01:04:18,300 --> 01:04:22,418
huh?

649
01:04:28,076 --> 01:04:31,079
Hello. This is Mr. Kim's phone.

650
01:04:31,279 --> 01:04:32,780
He's unable to come
to the phone now

651
01:04:32,814 --> 01:04:35,374
who is this answering?

652
01:04:35,984 --> 01:04:38,452
It's me. Don't you
recognize my voice?

653
01:04:38,486 --> 01:04:40,613
What are you doing there?

654
01:04:40,655 --> 01:04:45,263
Me? I'm having a date with Mr. Kim

655
01:04:45,293 --> 01:04:47,693
where are you?
No, you won't dare do it

656
01:04:49,864 --> 01:04:51,547
guess where I'm at right now

657
01:05:22,764 --> 01:05:26,552
Do you know why I like you?

658
01:05:28,336 --> 01:05:30,975
You never try to use
your body to seduce me

659
01:05:31,473 --> 01:05:32,940
that's cool

660
01:05:45,820 --> 01:05:47,105
You carrying a lot of money?

661
01:05:47,389 --> 01:05:49,482
No, it's my phone...

662
01:06:08,109 --> 01:06:09,940
Now for the real action!

663
01:06:11,780 --> 01:06:13,247
Okay?

664
01:06:14,749 --> 01:06:17,365
Okay...

665
01:07:01,096 --> 01:07:02,620
Bitch!

666
01:07:05,300 --> 01:07:07,006
You're totally crazy

667
01:07:09,137 --> 01:07:12,561
you crazy bitch.
Who the hell are you?

668
01:07:12,941 --> 01:07:14,408
What the...

669
01:07:19,848 --> 01:07:21,588
Mister!

670
01:07:21,616 --> 01:07:23,891
I want to go home

671
01:07:23,919 --> 01:07:27,741
my mom's waiting

672
01:07:30,759 --> 01:07:31,919
crazy bitch

673
01:08:58,880 --> 01:09:00,586
The suspect,

674
01:09:00,615 --> 01:09:03,015
I mean your ex-wife's
number has appeared

675
01:09:03,051 --> 01:09:05,178
you were right.
Kim wu-taek is the next target.

676
01:09:05,520 --> 01:09:07,568
I'm on my way

677
01:09:08,390 --> 01:09:10,005
both of their phones
have been turned off

678
01:09:45,727 --> 01:09:46,955
No one's answering?

679
01:09:47,195 --> 01:09:48,571
I just got through on his phone

680
01:09:48,596 --> 01:09:50,644
I'm sure he's there. = hello.

681
01:09:52,834 --> 01:09:54,028
Ninth floor.

682
01:09:55,637 --> 01:09:57,104
Hurry up!

683
01:09:58,039 --> 01:09:59,358
Take the next one

684
01:09:59,507 --> 01:10:03,022

- I'm busy. Sorry.

685
01:10:05,080 --> 01:10:06,456
Door closing

686
01:10:19,261 --> 01:10:21,024
Let's go up together.
You said the car's here

687
01:11:06,575 --> 01:11:10,238
I'll be there in a second.
One minute?

688
01:11:18,086 --> 01:11:19,678
So many of them

689
01:11:26,394 --> 01:11:27,394
Sir

690
01:11:28,763 --> 01:11:30,537
what happened? Did she get away?

691
01:11:30,565 --> 01:11:32,101
I'm sorry. I barely missed her

692
01:11:32,133 --> 01:11:34,442
it's a total mess

693
01:11:37,372 --> 01:11:38,669
where are you now?

694
01:11:38,707 --> 01:11:43,610
I'm in my car.
Don't you ask me where I'm going?

695
01:11:44,212 --> 01:11:45,588
Where are you headed?

696
01:11:49,851 --> 01:11:51,375
Try to guess

697
01:11:51,653 --> 01:11:53,154
ask her if the victim

698
01:11:53,188 --> 01:11:55,110
is still alive

699
01:11:55,357 --> 01:11:58,087
what happened to the lawyer?
Is he still alive?

700
01:11:58,126 --> 01:12:00,082
He's alive

701
01:12:00,929 --> 01:12:03,693
guess why I let him live

702
01:12:05,100 --> 01:12:06,988
it's been too easy so far.

703
01:12:07,302 --> 01:12:09,350
It's been quite a bore

704
01:12:10,472 --> 01:12:13,179
so, I want to give him a chance

705
01:12:13,208 --> 01:12:16,450
and make a decision later.
Whether to let him live or die.

706
01:12:17,579 --> 01:12:21,481
So you'll have to find me soon

707
01:12:22,517 --> 01:12:24,803
how can we be sure he's alive?

708
01:12:25,086 --> 01:12:26,439
Can we talk to him?

709
01:12:28,223 --> 01:12:29,508
Of course

710
01:12:31,626 --> 01:12:33,753
here, talk

711
01:12:35,897 --> 01:12:37,000
hello?

712
01:12:38,366 --> 01:12:39,537
This is the police

713
01:12:39,568 --> 01:12:42,002
save me. I'm at...

714
01:12:44,906 --> 01:12:48,057
Hello? Where are you?

715
01:12:48,410 --> 01:12:51,652
Use your head. Or try praying

716
01:12:59,988 --> 01:13:04,345
A stolen BMW.
License number 01 Jo 6743.

717
01:13:04,392 --> 01:13:06,405
A murder suspect has kidnapped a victim

718
01:13:06,761 --> 01:13:09,559
they fled
“top palace"" around 21:14

719
01:13:09,598 --> 01:13:11,395
the suspect is 33 years old

720
01:13:11,833 --> 01:13:13,721
the woman's name is
jung soon-jung

721
01:13:13,768 --> 01:13:14,871
appearance?

722
01:13:14,903 --> 01:13:16,951
Her appearance...

723
01:13:19,241 --> 01:13:27,159
- She's 160 centimeters in height.
- 160 centimeters in height.

724
01:13:28,183 --> 01:13:31,072
.- Big eyes.
- Big eyes...

725
01:13:33,054 --> 01:13:35,102
And she looks kind

726
01:13:35,357 --> 01:13:36,710
and?

727
01:13:43,131 --> 01:13:47,192
Do you think the jung soon-jung
you know is the real jung soon-jung?

728
01:13:48,570 --> 01:13:50,583
Don't you remember
me from somewhere?

729
01:13:52,774 --> 01:13:55,868
Of course you don't remember

730
01:13:57,379 --> 01:14:02,407
do you remember who oh min-ah is?

731
01:14:07,155 --> 01:14:10,556
I'm giving you a chance to live.

732
01:14:11,259 --> 01:14:12,965
You won't get a second chance

733
01:14:13,328 --> 01:14:17,321
if you don't remember min-ah,
you must die.

734
01:14:17,632 --> 01:14:19,998
You have a good memory

735
01:14:20,702 --> 01:14:24,251
that's how you became a lawyer

736
01:14:24,739 --> 01:14:31,929
I know how dad feels now

737
01:14:32,180 --> 01:14:38,312
when he said that life is lonely

738
01:14:40,121 --> 01:14:48,119
I heard his sad voice as
he whispered in my sleep

739
01:15:01,309 --> 01:15:03,015
Look at that. Look at that.

740
01:15:03,044 --> 01:15:04,875
I can't get it off

741
01:15:05,046 --> 01:15:07,685
I told you not to do it

742
01:15:07,716 --> 01:15:10,423
you're tickling me

743
01:15:10,452 --> 01:15:13,341
are you ticklish? Here?

744
01:15:13,388 --> 01:15:15,094
Where?

745
01:15:17,025 --> 01:15:20,085
I'm going to punish you for
not listening to me

746
01:15:20,362 --> 01:15:21,659
start singing

747
01:15:21,696 --> 01:15:28,101
I know how dad feels now

748
01:15:28,437 --> 01:15:34,512
when he said that life is lonely

749
01:15:54,896 --> 01:15:56,181
What is it?

750
01:16:02,671 --> 01:16:05,196
I know who oh min-ah
is a year ago,

751
01:16:05,240 --> 01:16:07,071
the Hong gi-beom case

752
01:16:07,109 --> 01:16:09,452
a six-year-old girl was
kidnapped and raped

753
01:16:09,478 --> 01:16:11,036
she was killed and abandoned

754
01:16:11,079 --> 01:16:13,365
she's oh min-ah, isn't she?

755
01:16:34,903 --> 01:16:38,054
Took you long enough, bastard

756
01:16:50,218 --> 01:16:53,039
Do you know what the
dead leave behind?

757
01:16:56,491 --> 01:16:58,709
Nothing, really

758
01:16:59,995 --> 01:17:03,692
the dead are remembered
by those alive

759
01:17:03,732 --> 01:17:07,316
memories are all you have

760
01:17:09,037 --> 01:17:10,504
but

761
01:17:12,641 --> 01:17:13,573
how many people
do you think will

762
01:17:13,608 --> 01:17:15,917
remember a six-year-old girl?

763
01:17:17,646 --> 01:17:19,261
Not many

764
01:17:21,450 --> 01:17:24,089
but you of all people should
have remembered her

765
01:17:24,352 --> 01:17:25,430
you accepted bribes
from the criminal

766
01:17:25,454 --> 01:17:27,729
who did terrible
things to my girl

767
01:17:27,756 --> 01:17:30,361
and you let him off
by pleading that

768
01:17:30,392 --> 01:17:32,166
he was mentally ill

769
01:17:32,193 --> 01:17:35,833
you let him have it easy at
the mental institution

770
01:17:35,864 --> 01:17:37,820
instead of prison

771
01:17:38,033 --> 01:17:41,366
you should have remembered her name
when you eat and when you sleep

772
01:17:41,403 --> 01:17:43,598
and everytime you take a breath!

773
01:17:43,638 --> 01:17:45,651
How could you forget?

774
01:17:54,015 --> 01:18:00,420
But a promise is a promise, right?

775
01:18:02,257 --> 01:18:05,954
Congratulations.
You passed the first test.

776
01:18:08,163 --> 01:18:10,119
But the second one awaits

777
01:18:17,806 --> 01:18:19,000
How are you sir?

778
01:18:19,674 --> 01:18:21,892
Do you have a hunch?

779
01:18:23,211 --> 01:18:24,769
Actually,

780
01:18:27,082 --> 01:18:29,812
today's is my little
girl's birthday

781
01:18:33,088 --> 01:18:35,397
she died on her birthday...

782
01:18:36,658 --> 01:18:38,125
Where is her grave?

783
01:18:38,326 --> 01:18:39,504
Don't people usually
go to the cemetery?

784
01:18:39,528 --> 01:18:42,588
We cremated her.
= wait. Wait. Wait.

785
01:18:42,964 --> 01:18:47,708
A hostage? Where?

786
01:18:47,736 --> 01:18:49,203
Okay, wait

787
01:18:49,704 --> 01:18:53,014
a woman claiming to be soon-jung
called up the TV station

788
01:18:53,041 --> 01:18:56,113
telling them she was holding a hostage
at the sanitary landfill center

789
01:18:56,144 --> 01:18:57,850
the landfill center

790
01:18:58,313 --> 01:19:00,076
that's where our girl was found

791
01:19:00,382 --> 01:19:02,486
that's it. Let's go move it guys

792
01:19:02,517 --> 01:19:03,870
move it, move it!

793
01:19:24,339 --> 01:19:29,538
Princess Aurora was her nickname

794
01:19:29,911 --> 01:19:32,471
she used to love that cartoon

795
01:19:37,052 --> 01:19:39,100
the day she disappeared,

796
01:19:42,490 --> 01:19:44,742
soon-jung called me

797
01:19:47,963 --> 01:19:51,387
we were divorced.
But since I was her father.

798
01:19:54,269 --> 01:19:58,421
And a policeman,
she thought I'd take care of it

799
01:20:03,445 --> 01:20:05,572
But I was no help at all

800
01:20:12,554 --> 01:20:15,114
I told her to make a
police report

801
01:20:16,691 --> 01:20:18,784
I was too busy to help out

802
01:20:19,728 --> 01:20:21,684
stop it would you?

803
01:20:21,730 --> 01:20:25,154
You'll get ill if you
keep recalling the past

804
01:20:25,634 --> 01:20:29,001
look at that crowd out there...

805
01:20:29,204 --> 01:20:32,537
But why would the suspect,

806
01:20:33,908 --> 01:20:36,103
I mean your ex-wife...

807
01:20:38,747 --> 01:20:42,262
Why would she call
the TV station?

808
01:21:11,479 --> 01:21:19,477
I heard his sad voice as he
whispered in my sleep.

809
01:21:20,555 --> 01:21:22,955
- What is that?
- Get rid of the cameras.

810
01:21:23,959 --> 01:21:25,881
- Shit, off with the cameras
- Shit, be quiet!

811
01:21:25,927 --> 01:21:27,189
Hello

812
01:21:27,229 --> 01:21:30,835
I'm Princess Aurora

813
01:21:30,866 --> 01:21:33,960
thank you for coming here

814
01:21:34,669 --> 01:21:37,251
today is my birthday.

815
01:21:39,608 --> 01:21:45,444
But no one is coming to see me

816
01:21:47,249 --> 01:21:50,434
this is a lonely place

817
01:21:51,386 --> 01:21:55,231
it's quite lonely here

818
01:21:55,256 --> 01:21:57,724
where is she?

819
01:21:57,993 --> 01:21:58,561
I think it's coming from
the crane operating room

820
01:21:58,593 --> 01:22:00,879
that's why I'm having
a birthday party

821
01:22:01,263 --> 01:22:04,391
that's why I invited the police.

822
01:22:04,666 --> 01:22:07,305
My daddy is also a policeman.

823
01:22:07,569 --> 01:22:09,036
I'm sure my daddy is here too.

824
01:22:09,204 --> 01:22:11,434
Daddy!

825
01:22:11,473 --> 01:22:15,409
Daddy, where are you?

826
01:22:16,611 --> 01:22:18,351
Is that your wife? =-yes.

827
01:22:18,380 --> 01:22:21,565
- I'm here, daddy.
- Shall we go and arrest her?

828
01:22:23,318 --> 01:22:24,580
Shit

829
01:22:24,853 --> 01:22:27,071
teams 1 and 2, move to the
back of the crane

830
01:22:27,456 --> 01:22:29,600
team 3, position under the crane
to go after the hostage

831
01:22:29,624 --> 01:22:31,307
he's not here...

832
01:22:32,460 --> 01:22:34,769
The camera's good

833
01:22:35,230 --> 01:22:37,070
the lighting's great.
Let's not make it a show.

834
01:22:37,199 --> 01:22:39,485
Should use your discretion
when you're filming

835
01:22:39,968 --> 01:22:43,267
do you even know why
she's doing this? Shit!

836
01:22:43,605 --> 01:22:45,823
Do you know what
she's going through?

837
01:23:00,756 --> 01:23:04,931
It's me. Do you see me?

838
01:23:06,628 --> 01:23:08,550
Let's talk

839
01:23:10,832 --> 01:23:13,448
I'm going to go over there.

840
01:23:13,802 --> 01:23:15,781
Talk to me

841
01:23:16,271 --> 01:23:18,364
I don't want to talk to you

842
01:23:18,673 --> 01:23:23,155
oh sung-ho, what gives you
the right to talk to me?

843
01:23:23,712 --> 01:23:25,543
Because you're her father?

844
01:23:26,214 --> 01:23:28,978
You don't have a rightto
claim to be her father

845
01:23:29,251 --> 01:23:30,718
you're a cop,
but you couldn't even

846
01:23:30,752 --> 01:23:33,482
protect your own daughter

847
01:23:34,456 --> 01:23:39,985
did you know that it's
min-ah's birthday today?

848
01:23:40,829 --> 01:23:43,354
But in this very spot,

849
01:23:43,598 --> 01:23:46,817
my daughter was killed
and was found dead

850
01:23:47,636 --> 01:23:49,763
naked!

851
01:23:51,973 --> 01:23:53,895
A six-year-old girl

852
01:23:54,242 --> 01:23:56,676
my little angel

853
01:23:56,978 --> 01:23:59,890
she was killed by an animal
and left here to die

854
01:23:59,915 --> 01:24:02,133
in the middle of all this waste

855
01:24:03,518 --> 01:24:05,645
my girl was left to die
in this place where

856
01:24:05,687 --> 01:24:09,418
all the waste in Seoul lies

857
01:24:09,758 --> 01:24:14,183
and where is that
son of a bitch now?

858
01:24:15,931 --> 01:24:18,843
He's being treated in a hospital

859
01:24:20,402 --> 01:24:22,324
what were you doing?

860
01:24:22,604 --> 01:24:26,005
You didn't even know it was
min-ah's birthday that day

861
01:24:27,409 --> 01:24:30,207
I'll be going over there.

862
01:24:30,445 --> 01:24:32,345
Let's talk face to face

863
01:24:32,381 --> 01:24:36,499
no, dad! Don't come here, dad

864
01:24:51,933 --> 01:24:55,562
Ms. jung soon-jung,
can you hear me?

865
01:24:55,837 --> 01:24:58,726
This is the chief officer,
byun sang-ho.

866
01:24:58,773 --> 01:25:05,269
Mister, my mom doesn't
want to talk to you now

867
01:25:05,580 --> 01:25:09,277
she must be really mad

868
01:25:09,518 --> 01:25:12,078
my mom gets really scary
when she's mad

869
01:25:12,320 --> 01:25:15,323
what is this? I can't talk to
her like this

870
01:25:15,357 --> 01:25:17,468
keep talking to her so that
we can launch the operation

871
01:25:17,492 --> 01:25:19,414
try to divert her attention

872
01:25:19,928 --> 01:25:21,888
make sure you move carefully
so she doesn't notice

873
01:25:22,664 --> 01:25:24,370
in any case, soon-jung,

874
01:25:24,633 --> 01:25:27,067
please release the hostage

875
01:25:27,102 --> 01:25:29,593
= no.
- Why not?

876
01:25:29,871 --> 01:25:32,567
That lawyer is a bad person

877
01:25:32,774 --> 01:25:35,390
Princess Aurora will punish him

878
01:25:37,079 --> 01:25:38,762
what was your daughter's name?

879
01:25:39,014 --> 01:25:41,744
Min-ah. Oh min-ah

880
01:25:46,655 --> 01:25:48,634
you're a good girl, min-ah.
Aren't you?

881
01:25:48,924 --> 01:25:52,473
Min-ah's a good girl. Right?

882
01:25:57,399 --> 01:26:03,087
Daddy, I'm scared

883
01:26:04,072 --> 01:26:06,506
daddy, I'm so scared

884
01:26:07,742 --> 01:26:11,143
don't cry, min-ah. Don't cry

885
01:26:14,616 --> 01:26:16,265
I'm sorry

886
01:26:17,652 --> 01:26:20,951
I really wanted to see you

887
01:26:21,056 --> 01:26:22,250
make sure to get the suspect

888
01:26:22,290 --> 01:26:24,178
completely immobilized

889
01:26:26,094 --> 01:26:29,313
I'm so scared, daddy

890
01:26:31,933 --> 01:26:35,425
it's okay. It's going to be okay

891
01:26:36,004 --> 01:26:43,376
daddy is sorry to
min-ah and mommy...

892
01:26:44,713 --> 01:26:50,936
Don't cry daddy.
If you cry, it will make me feel sad.

893
01:26:53,288 --> 01:26:56,257
Mommy will be sad, too.

894
01:26:58,660 --> 01:27:02,687
It's okay. It's okay.
Don't worry.

895
01:27:04,499 --> 01:27:07,320
Be sure to act calm,
to prepare for the worst

896
01:27:10,005 --> 01:27:11,768
min-ah

897
01:27:14,509 --> 01:27:17,421
I love you. I love you

898
01:27:19,681 --> 01:27:20,909
cleared to go

899
01:27:22,250 --> 01:27:24,081
daddy

900
01:27:26,354 --> 01:27:28,094
daddy, I don't want to go

901
01:27:28,123 --> 01:27:31,103
daddy! Daddy! Daddy,
I don't want to go

902
01:28:23,211 --> 01:28:24,109
Look this way

903
01:28:24,145 --> 01:28:25,373
I'm sorry

904
01:29:03,018 --> 01:29:05,987
= mom.
- Be careful. Don't run

905
01:29:07,789 --> 01:29:10,485
did you have fun?

906
01:29:11,426 --> 01:29:14,315
What did you learn today,
Princess Aurora?

907
01:29:14,596 --> 01:29:18,862
Look here.
Make it disappear. Poof!

908
01:29:19,201 --> 01:29:23,888
Did you make me disappear?

909
01:29:24,473 --> 01:29:27,510
Min-ah. This is your present.
Happy birthday.

910
01:29:27,542 --> 01:29:28,076
Thank you

911
01:29:28,110 --> 01:29:30,965
what are you doing?
Hurry up. Run!

912
01:29:31,012 --> 01:29:32,479
Bye

913
01:29:32,848 --> 01:29:35,373
you're always making me late.
Get on, quick.

914
01:29:35,417 --> 01:29:39,114
You must feel great - mom,

915
01:29:39,154 --> 01:29:42,157
I feel sorry for do-yeon

916
01:29:42,524 --> 01:29:44,048
why do you say that?

917
01:29:44,326 --> 01:29:48,535
She's her step-mom

918
01:29:48,563 --> 01:29:51,487
when her father's not around,
she always hit do-yeon

919
01:29:51,533 --> 01:29:54,661
that's why she prays every night

920
01:29:54,703 --> 01:29:57,194
that her step-mom would die

921
01:29:59,941 --> 01:30:02,501
min-ah, your birthday is coming up.
What shall we do?

922
01:30:02,744 --> 01:30:07,317
- Let's see what this is.
- Wow, it's my favorite

923
01:30:07,349 --> 01:30:10,750
you must be so happy.
Will you give me one?

924
01:30:22,697 --> 01:30:25,165
I'm on my way min-ah.
Wait for me.

925
01:30:25,767 --> 01:30:26,847
Oh

926
01:30:29,638 --> 01:30:31,629
Oh, shit.

927
01:30:31,673 --> 01:30:33,868
Look where you going, will you?

928
01:30:33,909 --> 01:30:35,615
Oh, you little bitch

929
01:30:36,311 --> 01:30:38,156
why didn't you stay home
if your kid is waiting?

930
01:30:38,180 --> 01:30:41,274
Why did you have to take your
car out and bump into mine?

931
01:30:41,316 --> 01:30:42,852
This is a one-way street

932
01:30:42,884 --> 01:30:44,772
you look like a real fox

933
01:30:45,020 --> 01:30:48,547
hit me if you want.
Take a punch.

934
01:30:48,590 --> 01:30:53,459
- Oh, shin-ok. I got into an accident.
- You're really funny, you know that?

935
01:30:53,495 --> 01:30:54,872
= no, I'm almost there.
Let's hurry up and settle.

936
01:30:54,896 --> 01:30:56,181
I'm nearby

937
01:30:56,531 --> 01:30:58,761
man, she got into an accident.

938
01:30:58,800 --> 01:31:00,688
I told you we shouldn't
hire someone with a kid!

939
01:31:00,735 --> 01:31:04,159
I have a reservation
at the spa. Oh, no!

940
01:31:04,206 --> 01:31:06,037
- You can just go.
- What about the shop?

941
01:31:06,074 --> 01:31:07,541
You can just lock up.

942
01:31:07,776 --> 01:31:09,789
No one's going to take the girl

943
01:31:10,145 --> 01:31:12,158
yes, I can just lock up, right?

944
01:31:12,381 --> 01:31:14,303
Hey, what do you want to do?

945
01:31:15,850 --> 01:31:17,078
Come on out

946
01:31:18,220 --> 01:31:21,041
shouldn't divorce when
you have a kid!

947
01:32:59,521 --> 01:33:02,763
Hey, have a piece of gum

948
01:33:23,311 --> 01:33:29,511
Mister, I'm short of
the taxi fare

949
01:33:29,851 --> 01:33:33,036
I can't believe you're
trying to hitch a ride

950
01:33:33,622 --> 01:33:34,998
damn itl...

951
01:34:11,860 --> 01:34:13,657
Mommy...

952
01:34:34,516 --> 01:34:36,108
Hey kid

953
01:34:36,451 --> 01:34:40,035
what are you doing here?
Do you want a ride?

954
01:34:45,360 --> 01:34:48,090
No, min-ah!

955
01:34:50,399 --> 01:34:55,871
Don't min-ah! No, no, no!

956
01:34:57,906 --> 01:35:02,081
No, min-ah. No! No, min-ah!
= relax. Just relax

957
01:35:28,937 --> 01:35:30,928
Estate policy will be effective

958
01:35:30,972 --> 01:35:33,133
the middle class people
dreaming of their

959
01:35:33,174 --> 01:35:34,641
own houses are
feeling the crunch

960
01:35:34,676 --> 01:35:36,894
this was Kim ok-kyeom
of ytn news

961
01:35:37,946 --> 01:35:39,356
a regular housewife turned into

962
01:35:39,381 --> 01:35:42,748
a killer after her only
child was killed

963
01:35:42,784 --> 01:35:47,505
we have the latest on the case
dubbed the Princess Aurora murders

964
01:35:48,023 --> 01:35:51,595
this is where the hearing
of a serial killer

965
01:35:51,626 --> 01:35:54,186
jung soon-jung is taking place

966
01:35:54,229 --> 01:35:56,390
after 4 months of
intense deliberation,

967
01:35:56,431 --> 01:36:00,856
she was sentenced
to a life sentence

968
01:36:01,136 --> 01:36:02,694
however, the court has decided

969
01:36:02,738 --> 01:36:06,981
that because she has been
tormented mentally,

970
01:36:07,008 --> 01:36:10,557
she will undergo 6 months of medical
treatment under prison custody

971
01:36:10,779 --> 01:36:13,942
the institution
where she will be

972
01:36:13,982 --> 01:36:16,143
treated is a place where

973
01:36:16,184 --> 01:36:19,642
the criminals with
severe mental...

974
01:36:32,901 --> 01:36:35,483
You still don't want to talk?

975
01:36:40,342 --> 01:36:41,900
Say something

976
01:36:50,285 --> 01:36:52,264
I quit my job

977
01:36:59,060 --> 01:37:04,145
If I'd quit long ago, we wouldn't
have had to go through this

978
01:37:13,842 --> 01:37:16,731
I quit studying to
become a pastor too

979
01:37:23,318 --> 01:37:24,933
Did you meet him?

980
01:37:36,531 --> 01:37:40,194
I've put in my Bible.
Try to read it.

981
01:37:42,570 --> 01:37:46,904
It'll help you out

982
01:37:59,688 --> 01:38:01,303
I'm going

983
01:38:10,599 --> 01:38:12,066
Thanks

984
01:39:58,207 --> 01:40:00,004
You're good at...

985
01:40:04,379 --> 01:40:06,142
Pretending to be a patient

986
01:40:32,140 --> 01:40:34,005
Don't you remember me?

987
01:40:36,078 --> 01:40:37,454
Huh?

988
01:40:40,415 --> 01:40:42,007
Hong gi-beum,

989
01:40:43,251 --> 01:40:47,039
you didn't think you could
escape from me, did you?

990
01:40:47,989 --> 01:40:53,040
I'm min-ah's mother

991
01:41:55,357 --> 01:41:58,451
Mr Hong, get up!

992
01:42:00,162 --> 01:42:03,313
Nurse! Nurse! Nurse!

00:02:30,137 --> 00:02:32,628
He turned into something...

2
00:02:32,672 --> 00:02:36,107
black and dark,
and he attacked me.

3
00:02:36,142 --> 00:02:38,110
What?

4
00:02:38,144 --> 00:02:39,441
Who are you talking about?

5
00:02:42,515 --> 00:02:44,073
Okay.

6
00:02:44,116 --> 00:02:45,083
It's okay.

7
00:02:45,117 --> 00:02:47,551
It was just a little nightmare.

8
00:02:47,586 --> 00:02:49,645
Tom's fine.

9
00:02:49,688 --> 00:02:50,950
What?

10
00:02:50,990 --> 00:02:54,790
How did you know
it was Tom in my dream?

11
00:02:54,827 --> 00:02:56,089
I never said.

12
00:02:59,498 --> 00:03:01,295
I need you close to me.

13
00:03:01,333 --> 00:03:04,598
Can you stay home
with me today?

14
00:03:59,358 --> 00:04:02,521
Dad, I'm worried about you.

15
00:04:02,561 --> 00:04:04,756
It's been 20 years
since Mom died,

16
00:04:04,797 --> 00:04:06,196
and you still haven't healed.

17
00:04:06,232 --> 00:04:09,759
I mean, look at how you obsess
about our health conditions.

18
00:04:11,070 --> 00:04:13,129
You need to get back
into biotech research.

19
00:04:16,542 --> 00:04:17,975
Grandpa.

20
00:04:18,010 --> 00:04:21,207
Oh, Tommy.
I am sorry.

21
00:04:24,015 --> 00:04:26,176
I'm sorry I scared you.

22
00:04:29,187 --> 00:04:30,347
Aah.

23
00:04:39,797 --> 00:04:41,822
Dad, don't worry.

24
00:04:41,866 --> 00:04:43,857
It's just a scratch.

25
00:04:49,641 --> 00:04:52,405
He's still obsessed
about Mom's cancer.

26
00:04:52,443 --> 00:04:53,876
I mean, If I tell him
we could just get

27
00:04:53,912 --> 00:04:56,847
regular check-ups anywhere,
he blows up.

28
00:04:56,881 --> 00:04:59,816
Tom, come back.

29
00:04:59,851 --> 00:05:01,546
No, it's fine.
He'll be all right.

30
00:05:01,586 --> 00:05:04,384
Yuriko, we'll be home soon.

31
00:05:04,422 --> 00:05:05,980
Tom!

32
00:05:07,225 --> 00:05:08,886
Tom, stand by the wall.

33
00:05:08,927 --> 00:05:11,088
Tom!
Stand by the wall!

34
00:05:15,233 --> 00:05:16,757
Stay there!

35
00:05:28,079 --> 00:05:29,512
Raah!

36
00:05:32,650 --> 00:05:34,083
Tom!

37
00:05:34,118 --> 00:05:36,712
Tom! Tom!

38
00:05:36,754 --> 00:05:39,120
Dad!

39
00:05:39,157 --> 00:05:40,146
Tom!

40
00:05:58,242 --> 00:05:59,402
Dad!

41
00:06:04,549 --> 00:06:07,518
Daddy!

42
00:07:37,140 --> 00:07:39,131
Aah!

43
00:07:45,816 --> 00:07:48,808
Aah!

44
00:09:12,868 --> 00:09:14,358
You should eat a little.

45
00:09:19,008 --> 00:09:22,273
How can you be so calm,
sitting there eating breakfast?

46
00:09:22,311 --> 00:09:24,609
Your son was just murdered!

47
00:09:24,647 --> 00:09:26,547
He's dead!

48
00:09:26,582 --> 00:09:28,607
Don't you want to find him?

49
00:09:28,651 --> 00:09:30,209
Don't you want to kill him,

50
00:09:30,252 --> 00:09:32,049
just like he killed Tom?

51
00:09:39,662 --> 00:09:41,755
Hush, little baby

52
00:09:41,797 --> 00:09:44,994
Don't say a word

53
00:09:45,034 --> 00:09:48,231
Mama's gonna buy you a mockingbird

54
00:10:54,902 --> 00:10:57,962
Stupid!

55
00:10:58,006 --> 00:10:59,940
Stupid! Stupid!

56
00:10:59,974 --> 00:11:04,308
Stupid! Stupid!
Stupid! Stupid!

57
00:11:22,730 --> 00:11:26,894
I know exactly
how Yuriko feels, Dad.

58
00:11:28,303 --> 00:11:30,931
I can't forgive.

59
00:11:30,972 --> 00:11:33,202
I can't move on.

60
00:11:33,241 --> 00:11:37,803
Anthony, please,
don't even think about revenge.

61
00:11:40,515 --> 00:11:42,812
Hush, little baby

62
00:11:42,849 --> 00:11:44,840
Don't say a word

63
00:11:44,885 --> 00:11:49,879
Mama's gonna buy you a mockingbird

64
00:11:49,923 --> 00:11:53,381
You said Mom used to sing
this lullaby all the time.

65
00:11:53,427 --> 00:11:57,090
Remember you told me to sing it
whenever I was angry?

66
00:11:57,130 --> 00:12:01,123
Dad, I sang it every time.

67
00:12:01,168 --> 00:12:03,568
Should I have done that?

68
00:12:03,603 --> 00:12:06,470
Yes.

69
00:12:06,506 --> 00:12:07,837
Absolutely.

70
00:12:09,009 --> 00:12:09,998
Absolutely.

71
00:12:17,451 --> 00:12:19,043
Mitsue.

72
00:12:33,367 --> 00:12:35,494
You once told me
about a strange feeling

73
00:12:35,535 --> 00:12:39,335
you get sometimes,

74
00:12:39,373 --> 00:12:44,037
as if your mind and your body
don't belong to you.

75
00:12:46,513 --> 00:12:48,777
I have a strange feeling too.

76
00:12:51,752 --> 00:12:55,279
I feel as if...

77
00:12:55,322 --> 00:12:59,349
outside this apartment,

78
00:12:59,393 --> 00:13:01,020
nothing exists.

79
00:13:03,196 --> 00:13:08,190
I only feel alive
when you hold me tight.

80
00:13:09,936 --> 00:13:13,895
I felt more alive...

81
00:13:13,940 --> 00:13:15,931
when I gave birth to Tom.

82
00:13:19,346 --> 00:13:21,246
I was so happy then.

83
00:13:41,167 --> 00:13:42,725
You're going out?

84
00:13:44,036 --> 00:13:46,129
I'm going to find
Tom's killer.

85
00:13:56,348 --> 00:13:57,337
Uh...

86
00:14:12,865 --> 00:14:14,264
Yuriko, come back.

87
00:14:14,300 --> 00:14:16,632
Come back to me.

88
00:14:16,669 --> 00:14:17,795
Yes, the document you need

89
00:14:17,837 --> 00:14:19,532
for the presentation
is almost finished.

90
00:14:19,572 --> 00:14:20,698
I'll email it right away.

91
00:14:20,739 --> 00:14:22,639
Print out 20 copies.

92
00:14:30,549 --> 00:14:31,516
Yes.

93
00:14:31,550 --> 00:14:32,881
Hi, Anthony. It's me.

94
00:14:32,918 --> 00:14:34,351
I've just been told
that we don't have

95
00:14:34,386 --> 00:14:35,546
that document from you yet.

96
00:14:35,588 --> 00:14:36,816
It's very important, you know.

97
00:14:36,856 --> 00:14:38,414
I fully realize
this is a bad time for you,

98
00:14:38,457 --> 00:14:40,482
but can you make it today?

99
00:14:56,509 --> 00:14:58,534
Yes.

100
00:14:58,577 --> 00:15:00,408
It's delivery service.

101
00:15:00,446 --> 00:15:01,970
I've got your package.

102
00:15:02,014 --> 00:15:03,447
Yes.

103
00:15:03,482 --> 00:15:04,847
Yes, I'm sorry

104
00:15:04,884 --> 00:15:05,908
to have cut you off earlier.

105
00:15:05,951 --> 00:15:06,975
I dropped a pot of hot water,

106
00:15:07,019 --> 00:15:08,884
and I will send
the document right away.

107
00:15:08,921 --> 00:15:10,912
That's all right, Anthony.
Don't worry about it.

108
00:15:10,956 --> 00:15:13,151
The marketing department
needs it, so if could you get...

109
00:15:13,192 --> 00:15:15,160
Anthony is there something
wrong with your...

110
00:15:25,837 --> 00:15:27,566
Please leave it there.

111
00:15:27,605 --> 00:15:29,004
I leave this here,

112
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:32,532
and I need your signature.

113
00:15:32,577 --> 00:15:34,067
Thank you.

114
00:15:34,112 --> 00:15:35,670
Here's a copy.

115
00:15:38,917 --> 00:15:39,906
Aah.

116
00:16:40,745 --> 00:16:42,645
The signs are there.

117
00:16:42,680 --> 00:16:44,545
Request immediate disposal.

118
00:16:44,582 --> 00:16:46,550
The informant was right.

119
00:16:55,827 --> 00:16:59,126
Dead already?

120
00:16:59,163 --> 00:17:02,655
I thought that you'd get
a lot more out of...

121
00:17:02,700 --> 00:17:04,668
Your son showed more fight

122
00:17:04,702 --> 00:17:06,431
when I ran him over.

123
00:17:55,619 --> 00:17:59,646
You killed Tom!

124
00:18:17,207 --> 00:18:19,607
Aah! Aah!

125
00:18:19,643 --> 00:18:22,806
Aah!
Aah!

126
00:19:26,275 --> 00:19:27,435
Hush, little baby

127
00:19:27,476 --> 00:19:28,738
Don't say a word

128
00:19:28,778 --> 00:19:31,645
Subject is now
in parking garage.

129
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:32,840
Transformation proceeding.

130
00:19:32,882 --> 00:19:34,679
Any witnesses?

131
00:19:34,717 --> 00:19:36,412
Only the four of us, I think.

132
00:19:36,452 --> 00:19:38,977
Mama's gonna buy you
a diamond ring

133
00:19:39,021 --> 00:19:41,922
If that diamond ring
turns brass

134
00:19:41,957 --> 00:19:45,051
Mama's gonna buy you
a looking glass

135
00:19:55,037 --> 00:19:56,197
Please leave a message.

136
00:19:56,238 --> 00:19:58,035
Beep!

137
00:19:58,073 --> 00:20:00,371
Welcome to your new life.

138
00:20:00,409 --> 00:20:03,901
I hope you're enjoying it.

139
00:20:07,850 --> 00:20:09,545
Who are you?

140
00:20:11,187 --> 00:20:13,849
A pair of eyes.

141
00:20:13,889 --> 00:20:15,914
I see everything,

142
00:20:15,958 --> 00:20:17,482
you and your family.

143
00:20:17,526 --> 00:20:20,290
I could even tell you
Tom's favorite dessert.

144
00:20:20,329 --> 00:20:22,320
Why did you kill Tom?

145
00:20:23,866 --> 00:20:25,834
I stumbled
on your dad's secret.

146
00:20:25,868 --> 00:20:28,803
That's where this all started.

147
00:20:28,838 --> 00:20:30,669
Check your mail.

148
00:20:39,448 --> 00:20:44,215
""Tetsu.""

149
00:20:47,890 --> 00:20:50,585
""Tetsu Tetsuo.""

150
00:20:52,460 --> 00:20:55,759
Hello, hello, hello.

151
00:20:55,797 --> 00:20:59,733
We are glad you could make
the journey to join us.

152
00:21:18,987 --> 00:21:24,391
Welcome to the newest chapter
in the history of iron.

153
00:22:16,611 --> 00:22:19,603
Dad, what did you do to me?

154
00:22:21,683 --> 00:22:22,980
What did you do?

155
00:22:34,796 --> 00:22:37,230
Dad!

156
00:22:54,014 --> 00:22:55,345
Dad!

157
00:23:21,641 --> 00:23:23,336
Dad!

158
00:23:25,312 --> 00:23:27,371
Dad!

159
00:23:29,983 --> 00:23:31,177
Dad!

160
00:23:31,218 --> 00:23:33,186
Dad!

161
00:23:35,122 --> 00:23:36,487
Dad!

162
00:23:39,226 --> 00:23:40,887
Dad!

163
00:23:42,029 --> 00:23:43,121
Dad!

164
00:27:30,922 --> 00:27:33,755
""Tetsu Tetsuo""

165
00:28:23,607 --> 00:28:27,907
""At long last, my dream is in sight.

166
00:28:27,944 --> 00:28:30,378
""The human body is the natural world's

167
00:28:30,414 --> 00:28:35,283
""most beautiful and functional work of art.

168
00:28:35,319 --> 00:28:37,287
""I am making an artificial body

169
00:28:37,321 --> 00:28:40,654
""not to improve on that work of God,

170
00:28:40,691 --> 00:28:44,422
""but to understand it better.

171
00:28:44,461 --> 00:28:50,457
""Mitsue did everything
she could to help me,

172
00:28:50,500 --> 00:28:53,298
""until she found out
what fearsome powers

173
00:28:53,337 --> 00:28:55,805
an artificial body could have.""

174
00:29:01,611 --> 00:29:05,445
I believed that
we were making androids

175
00:29:05,482 --> 00:29:07,848
that would help
improve human life.

176
00:29:07,884 --> 00:29:10,546
But look at what we've created.

177
00:29:10,587 --> 00:29:12,316
They all have the ability

178
00:29:12,356 --> 00:29:15,291
to transform into powerful weapons.

179
00:29:15,325 --> 00:29:17,953
I never wanted to create
weapons, Mitsue.

180
00:29:17,994 --> 00:29:19,859
But it was the only way
we could bring investment

181
00:29:19,896 --> 00:29:21,193
to the company.

182
00:29:21,231 --> 00:29:24,723
Human weapons, Ride?

183
00:29:24,768 --> 00:29:26,736
No.

184
00:29:26,770 --> 00:29:30,297
I won't do it anymore.

185
00:29:30,340 --> 00:29:32,467
Please, Ride,

186
00:29:32,509 --> 00:29:35,103
tell me you'll stop
this work too.

187
00:29:35,145 --> 00:29:38,273
""My theories on the creation
of an artificial body

188
00:29:38,315 --> 00:29:41,716
""and Japanese

What am I?

204
00:32:22,977 --> 00:32:26,208
Is my dad some kind
of perverted freak?

205
00:32:26,247 --> 00:32:27,908
He had sex with an android?

206
00:32:40,261 --> 00:32:43,662
Mama's gonna buy you
a billy goat

207
00:32:43,698 --> 00:32:46,098
And if that billy goat
won't pull

208
00:32:46,134 --> 00:32:48,102
Mama's gonna buy you
a cart and bull

209
00:32:48,136 --> 00:32:52,334
If that cart and bull turns over

210
00:32:52,373 --> 00:32:54,864
Mama's gonna buy you
a dog named Rover

211
00:32:54,909 --> 00:32:56,706
And if that dog named Rover
won't bark

212
00:32:56,744 --> 00:32:58,871
Mama's gonna buy you
a horse and cart

213
00:32:58,913 --> 00:33:00,005
And if that...

214
00:33:00,048 --> 00:33:01,140
Anthony.

215
00:33:05,553 --> 00:33:07,714
Anthony.

216
00:33:07,755 --> 00:33:10,349
That man emailed me.

217
00:33:10,391 --> 00:33:12,518
He told me to come here.

218
00:33:12,560 --> 00:33:15,427
I'm begging you
for the last time.

219
00:33:16,698 --> 00:33:18,928
We have to find who killed Tom,

220
00:33:18,967 --> 00:33:21,561
and we have to kill him.

221
00:33:21,603 --> 00:33:23,730
We have to kill him, Anthony.

222
00:33:23,771 --> 00:33:26,934
That's the only way
I can be happy again.

223
00:33:26,975 --> 00:33:29,307
I need to feel alive, Anthony.

224
00:33:29,344 --> 00:33:30,606
I had forgotten

225
00:33:30,645 --> 00:33:33,136
what life felt like
until Tom was born.

226
00:33:33,181 --> 00:33:35,945
Now that he's gone,
I'm so scared

227
00:33:35,984 --> 00:33:37,814
I will lose this feeling again.

228
00:33:37,851 --> 00:33:40,376
I'm scared I'll forget
my little boy

229
00:33:40,420 --> 00:33:42,217
and how he made me feel.

230
00:33:42,255 --> 00:33:44,815
The only thing
that keeps me going

231
00:33:44,858 --> 00:33:47,793
is the thought of killing
the man who took him from me.

232
00:33:47,828 --> 00:33:51,161
Leave me alone!

233
00:33:52,199 --> 00:33:53,860
Anthony?

234
00:33:53,900 --> 00:33:55,663
What's happening?

235
00:33:55,702 --> 00:33:57,533
I have a demon inside of me.

236
00:33:58,572 --> 00:33:59,834
Anthony.

237
00:33:59,873 --> 00:34:01,704
No.

238
00:34:01,742 --> 00:34:03,972
You can't come near me!

239
00:34:08,715 --> 00:34:10,444
The wife is in the house.

240
00:34:10,484 --> 00:34:12,008
No sign of Dr. Stoval.

241
00:34:12,052 --> 00:34:13,815
Our information checks out.

242
00:34:13,854 --> 00:34:15,378
The informant appears
to be a hacker

243
00:34:15,422 --> 00:34:18,016
and the same man who killed
the boy for reasons unknown.

244
00:34:18,058 --> 00:34:19,616
Word of this
must never get out.

245
00:34:19,660 --> 00:34:22,185
Do not involve the police
under any circumstances.

246
00:34:22,229 --> 00:34:23,560
Detain Dr. Stoval

247
00:34:23,597 --> 00:34:24,859
and the informant
if he appears.

248
00:34:24,898 --> 00:34:26,866
Anthony is transforming.

249
00:34:26,900 --> 00:34:29,300
Destroy him
and his wife as well,

250
00:34:29,336 --> 00:34:30,564
if that becomes necessary.

251
00:34:36,009 --> 00:34:37,237
Where is Anthony?

252
00:34:39,946 --> 00:34:40,913
Anthony!

253
00:34:40,947 --> 00:34:41,914
Show yourself.

254
00:34:41,948 --> 00:34:43,245
Show yourself,
or your wife dies,

255
00:34:43,283 --> 00:34:44,272
just like your son.

256
00:34:46,687 --> 00:34:47,881
Coward.

257
00:34:47,921 --> 00:34:49,047
What kind of man are you?

258
00:34:49,089 --> 00:34:50,886
Your son is murdered,
your wife tortured,

259
00:34:50,924 --> 00:34:52,016
and you do nothing.

260
00:34:52,059 --> 00:34:55,517
Yuriko, you should have
married a real man.

261
00:35:05,572 --> 00:35:06,698
Aah!

262
00:35:48,447 --> 00:35:50,711
Aah!

263
00:37:23,041 --> 00:37:24,065
Retreat!

264
00:37:24,108 --> 00:37:25,769
Retreat!

265
00:37:45,864 --> 00:37:49,527
So Anthony wouldn't kill
any of you?

266
00:37:49,567 --> 00:37:51,797
Who in the hell are you?

267
00:37:51,836 --> 00:37:53,895
Your company
would know nothing

268
00:37:53,938 --> 00:37:56,839
about Ride's experiments
if not for me.

269
00:37:56,875 --> 00:38:00,003
Call me an informant.

270
00:38:20,031 --> 00:38:21,589
Status report, Agent One.

271
00:38:21,633 --> 00:38:23,157
What happened?

272
00:38:26,170 --> 00:38:28,638
I terminated Anthony.

273
00:38:28,673 --> 00:38:30,766
I terminated Anthony.

274
00:38:30,808 --> 00:38:32,867
Are Ride and the informant
secured?

275
00:38:32,911 --> 00:38:34,469
Not yet.

276
00:38:34,512 --> 00:38:35,911
Please keep searching.

277
00:38:35,947 --> 00:38:38,108
Not yet.
Please keep searching.

278
00:38:53,564 --> 00:38:55,555
Anthony.

279
00:39:00,571 --> 00:39:02,539
Anthony.

280
00:39:04,475 --> 00:39:06,965
Anthony.

281
00:39:07,010 --> 00:39:09,843
Don't come any closer.

282
00:39:09,880 --> 00:39:11,905
Even now, I'm not sure
if I can control myself

283
00:39:11,949 --> 00:39:14,440
from not killing you.

284
00:39:19,489 --> 00:39:24,085
I need to be with Tom.

285
00:39:24,127 --> 00:39:28,188
It's what's best for everyone.

286
00:39:30,867 --> 00:39:32,198
Aah!

287
00:39:32,235 --> 00:39:35,329
Anthony, don't!

288
00:39:59,129 --> 00:40:01,757
I can't even kill myself.

289
00:40:04,301 --> 00:40:06,963
What's wrong with you?

290
00:40:07,004 --> 00:40:08,904
What are you doing?

291
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:14,336
Were you just gonna
leave me alone?

292
00:40:54,551 --> 00:40:56,984
Hush, little baby

293
00:40:57,019 --> 00:40:58,748
Don't say a word

294
00:40:58,788 --> 00:41:03,725
Mama's gonna buy you a mockingbird

295
00:41:03,759 --> 00:41:10,597
If that mockingbird won't sing

296
00:41:10,633 --> 00:41:13,659
Mama's gonna buy you
a diamond ring

297
00:41:15,171 --> 00:41:18,197
If that diamond ring
turns brass

298
00:41:18,240 --> 00:41:22,802
Mama's gonna buy you
a looking glass

299
00:41:24,447 --> 00:41:30,010
If that looking glass gets broke

300
00:41:30,052 --> 00:41:33,886
Mama's gonna buy you a billy goat

301
00:41:36,926 --> 00:41:43,058
If that billy goat
won't pull

302
00:41:43,099 --> 00:41:48,196
Mama's gonna buy you a cart and bull

303
00:42:13,295 --> 00:42:15,092
Where are you, Ride?

304
00:42:17,800 --> 00:42:20,325
Hello?

305
00:42:20,369 --> 00:42:24,362
Some guy locked me
in a closet here in the house.

306
00:42:24,406 --> 00:42:26,704
He's just let me out.

307
00:42:28,077 --> 00:42:30,443
I'm in the dining room.

308
00:42:30,479 --> 00:42:33,175
I have something
to tell you both.

309
00:42:45,394 --> 00:42:47,190
Yuriko, you need to...

310
00:42:47,228 --> 00:42:48,559
Don't tell me to stay here.

311
00:42:48,596 --> 00:42:51,463
I'm coming with you.

312
00:43:34,842 --> 00:43:38,334
What's happening here, Dad?

313
00:43:40,315 --> 00:43:41,976
Talk to me.

314
00:43:42,016 --> 00:43:43,574
Dad.

315
00:43:43,618 --> 00:43:45,313
What's this about?

316
00:43:48,523 --> 00:43:50,514
I've always worried

317
00:43:50,558 --> 00:43:54,654
that this would happen
to you, Anthony,

318
00:43:54,696 --> 00:43:59,292
that your... anger

319
00:43:59,334 --> 00:44:01,097
would turn you to iron.

320
00:44:01,135 --> 00:44:03,467
Why did you do it?

321
00:44:07,208 --> 00:44:10,234
Your mother

322
00:44:10,278 --> 00:44:12,576
begged me to do this...

323
00:44:15,016 --> 00:44:17,849
Before her lights went out.

324
00:44:20,521 --> 00:44:25,288
She was so dead-set
against this project.

325
00:44:25,326 --> 00:44:28,318
I don't know what made her
suddenly change.

326
00:44:32,634 --> 00:44:36,569
When I die,

327
00:44:36,603 --> 00:44:38,093
dissect me.

328
00:44:39,673 --> 00:44:42,335
Look at me.

329
00:44:42,376 --> 00:44:46,506
Look at my whole body:

330
00:44:46,546 --> 00:44:47,774
My hair,

331
00:44:47,814 --> 00:44:51,910
my skin, my insides,

332
00:44:51,952 --> 00:44:55,513
my bones.

333
00:44:55,555 --> 00:44:58,285
Don't miss any part of me.

334
00:44:58,325 --> 00:45:03,820
Then build your android of me.

335
00:45:03,864 --> 00:45:06,731
Make love to the android.

336
00:45:06,767 --> 00:45:09,292
Make a baby.

337
00:45:11,505 --> 00:45:16,169
I know you say that anger
triggers the transformation,

338
00:45:16,209 --> 00:45:20,043
but it won't happen to me.

339
00:45:20,080 --> 00:45:25,780
As long as I have a child,
I'll always be happy.

340
00:45:25,819 --> 00:45:29,152
I will never become
a human weapon.

341
00:45:31,858 --> 00:45:33,758
I know it, Ride.

342
00:45:33,794 --> 00:45:36,194
Please.

343
00:45:36,229 --> 00:45:40,029
Build my android replica.

344
00:45:40,067 --> 00:45:43,559
I can never give up my dream
to have a child.

345
00:45:56,183 --> 00:45:57,912
Dad, who did this?

346
00:45:57,951 --> 00:45:59,714
The men from the company?

347
00:45:59,753 --> 00:46:02,449
No, no, not them.

348
00:46:02,489 --> 00:46:06,289
It was the one,
the man who took my secrets.

349
00:46:06,326 --> 00:46:08,021
That guy!

350
00:46:12,833 --> 00:46:19,363
The android Mitsue,
she didn't live very long.

351
00:46:20,540 --> 00:46:25,533
You and Tom have android DNA,

352
00:46:25,578 --> 00:46:27,136
so I was always afraid

353
00:46:27,179 --> 00:46:29,977
the same thing would happen

354
00:46:30,015 --> 00:46:32,381
to you both.

355
00:46:32,418 --> 00:46:34,409
Anthony,

356
00:46:34,453 --> 00:46:38,219
your body is a weapon

357
00:46:38,257 --> 00:46:40,521
whose destructive power grows

358
00:46:40,559 --> 00:46:43,858
the angrier you get.

359
00:46:45,364 --> 00:46:48,959
Never let that anger
get out of control.

360
00:46:50,736 --> 00:46:53,569
Swear you'll do that.

361
00:47:05,351 --> 00:47:06,841
Dad!

362
00:47:06,886 --> 00:47:08,046
Dad!

363
00:47:09,288 --> 00:47:10,277
Dad!

364
00:47:11,690 --> 00:47:13,487
Dad!

365
00:48:23,461 --> 00:48:28,125
Ladies and gentlemen...

366
00:48:28,166 --> 00:48:29,827
let's party.

367
00:49:18,149 --> 00:49:21,846
No, I'm not going to end it

368
00:49:21,886 --> 00:49:24,116
with a cheap shot like this.

369
00:49:24,155 --> 00:49:27,090
What I want, Anthony,

370
00:49:27,125 --> 00:49:29,093
is for you
to show the stupid people

371
00:49:29,127 --> 00:49:31,425
of this world what life is
really like.

372
00:49:31,462 --> 00:49:35,159
Brains and blood splattering.

373
00:49:35,199 --> 00:49:37,895
That's reality.

374
00:49:37,936 --> 00:49:44,364
Come on, Anthony, destroy all
of our lazy peaceful dreams.

375
00:49:48,079 --> 00:49:50,240
Awaken to your destiny.

376
00:50:15,906 --> 00:50:20,138
This war isn't over
until I kill him.

377
00:50:20,177 --> 00:50:22,509
He knows how
to hurt you, Anthony.

378
00:50:22,546 --> 00:50:24,480
He knows everything about us.

379
00:50:24,514 --> 00:50:27,972
This is the battle
you were hoping for.

380
00:50:30,787 --> 00:50:34,245
Anthony.

381
00:50:34,291 --> 00:50:35,451
I'm pregnant.

382
00:50:37,094 --> 00:50:39,460
I would have told you,

383
00:50:39,496 --> 00:50:42,226
but after what happened to Tom,
I couldn't.

384
00:50:43,800 --> 00:50:45,062
This has to stop.

385
00:50:45,102 --> 00:50:46,228
I was wrong.

386
00:50:46,269 --> 00:50:48,260
No more killing.

387
00:50:50,774 --> 00:50:51,934
Look at me.

388
00:50:51,975 --> 00:50:54,944
Look at what
my body has become.

389
00:50:54,978 --> 00:50:58,175
My blood is polluted.

390
00:50:58,215 --> 00:51:00,308
I don't want to bring a baby
into this world

391
00:51:00,350 --> 00:51:01,840
with my genetics.

392
00:51:01,885 --> 00:51:05,514
No child can be happy
living like me.

393
00:51:05,555 --> 00:51:08,547
Our baby will.

394
00:51:08,592 --> 00:51:12,028
I want this baby, Anthony.

395
00:51:16,299 --> 00:51:18,164
It's him.

396
00:51:27,544 --> 00:51:29,671
Anthony.

397
00:52:40,049 --> 00:52:43,109
So beautiful.

398
00:53:11,113 --> 00:53:12,808
Come on.

399
00:53:14,917 --> 00:53:16,316
Come over here.

400
00:53:22,625 --> 00:53:26,959
Aim that big gun of yours
right at me.

401
00:53:28,731 --> 00:53:30,062
Go ahead.

402
00:53:45,647 --> 00:53:47,308
Do it, Anthony.

403
00:53:48,883 --> 00:53:50,009
Do it.

404
00:53:51,486 --> 00:53:52,783
Do it.

405
00:53:52,821 --> 00:53:55,483
Do it. Do it.

406
00:53:55,523 --> 00:53:57,081
Do it!

407
00:54:06,034 --> 00:54:08,298
Okay, then.

408
00:54:09,704 --> 00:54:12,468
Allow me to drag
your anger out of you.

409
00:54:23,551 --> 00:54:26,418
Ah.

410
00:54:26,454 --> 00:54:28,888
Yes.

411
00:54:28,923 --> 00:54:31,016
I hear it.

412
00:54:31,059 --> 00:54:32,356
The pulse.

413
00:54:33,628 --> 00:54:36,620
You know, the heartbeat
of a new life.

414
00:54:41,870 --> 00:54:43,394
Put it on her.

415
00:54:44,572 --> 00:54:46,199
Put it on her.

416
00:55:10,298 --> 00:55:14,894
You know what
this pretty thing is, don't you?

417
00:55:14,936 --> 00:55:15,925
It's a bomb.

418
00:55:18,573 --> 00:55:20,165
Come on now, Anthony.

419
00:55:20,208 --> 00:55:24,372
Let's play
one last little game.

420
00:55:24,412 --> 00:55:28,815
In one minute,
I will push this button.

421
00:55:28,850 --> 00:55:30,715
You have two choices.

422
00:55:30,752 --> 00:55:32,242
Number one...

423
00:55:35,522 --> 00:55:38,218
Kill me.

424
00:55:38,258 --> 00:55:39,748
That way, you save your wife

425
00:55:39,793 --> 00:55:41,886
and the child
that she will have.

426
00:55:41,929 --> 00:55:44,363
But that means
the monster lives on.

427
00:55:44,398 --> 00:55:46,696
Choice number two:

428
00:55:46,733 --> 00:55:48,098
I blow them both to pieces.

429
00:55:48,135 --> 00:55:50,194
No more little monster.

430
00:55:50,237 --> 00:55:52,797
The world will have peace.

431
00:55:52,839 --> 00:55:56,297
Well...

126
00:07:41,996 --> 00:07:46,067
Now, which one of you is
the Jane that I'm looking for?

127
00:07:48,402 --> 00:07:49,670
All right then.

128
00:07:50,905 --> 00:07:53,607
Only one way to settle this.

129
00:07:57,111 --> 00:07:58,079
Call it.

130
00:07:58,212 --> 00:07:59,714
-Heads.
-Tails.

131
00:08:00,247 --> 00:08:01,515
Okay, then.

132
00:08:02,717 --> 00:08:05,586
Heads and you get to go free,

133
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:07,555
but she's coming with me.

134
00:08:08,488 --> 00:08:11,491
Tails and you get to go free...

135
00:08:12,460 --> 00:08:13,561
but she's coming with me.

136
00:08:13,694 --> 00:08:16,864
[tense music playing]

137
00:08:24,705 --> 00:08:26,073
[tires screeching]

138
00:08:26,207 --> 00:08:29,510
[calm music playing]

139
00:08:47,161 --> 00:08:50,531
[waves crashing]

140
00:08:57,238 --> 00:08:59,040
[Jane] Did we know
each other then?

141
00:09:00,741 --> 00:09:02,810
All you said was true...

142
00:09:03,744 --> 00:09:05,012
and still...

143
00:09:06,113 --> 00:09:08,082
you left without looking back.

144
00:09:10,851 --> 00:09:12,820
If we could
speak to them now...

145
00:09:14,622 --> 00:09:15,856
what would they say?

146
00:09:15,990 --> 00:09:17,058
Oliver!

147
00:09:17,591 --> 00:09:20,561
[phone ringing]

148
00:09:22,196 --> 00:09:23,597
Hey, Oliver. Hi.

149
00:09:23,731 --> 00:09:25,366
[Oliver]
<i>Let me guess. You're lost.</i>

150
00:09:25,933 --> 00:09:27,601
No, not this time.

151
00:09:27,735 --> 00:09:30,539
I just stopped
to grab a few things, so...

152
00:09:30,671 --> 00:09:32,173
[Oliver] <i>You're good.</i>

153
00:09:32,306 --> 00:09:34,241
<i>Just pull up by the shore.</i>
<i>I'm right here.</i>

154
00:09:35,076 --> 00:09:37,678
All right,
I'll see you soon. [chuckles]

155
00:09:37,812 --> 00:09:39,346
-I can't wait.
-[call ended beeping]

156
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:40,981
Okay.

157
00:09:42,583 --> 00:09:45,820
[rhythmic drumming]

158
00:10:08,709 --> 00:10:09,977
[young Jane]
I love you so much.

159
00:10:10,111 --> 00:10:11,679
[young Oliver] I love you too.

160
00:10:11,812 --> 00:10:13,147
[young Jane]
Your eyes are so beautiful.

161
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:14,648
I can't wait for you
to meet my family.

162
00:10:14,782 --> 00:10:16,150
[Oliver] Jane!

163
00:10:17,218 --> 00:10:18,686
Jane! Jane!

164
00:10:18,819 --> 00:10:20,154
[Jane gasps]

165
00:10:20,522 --> 00:10:22,223
-Oh, wow.
-Yo.

166
00:10:23,824 --> 00:10:25,192
-[Jane] Hi.
-Wow.

167
00:10:25,326 --> 00:10:27,661
[Jane chuckles] Hi.

168
00:10:27,795 --> 00:10:28,929
-Oh, my God.
-Look at you.

169
00:10:29,063 --> 00:10:31,298
-[Jane] Wow.
-Oh, my gosh.

170
00:10:31,432 --> 00:10:32,601
Hey.

171
00:10:32,733 --> 00:10:34,869
Oh, man. I'll hug you.

172
00:10:35,002 --> 00:10:36,403
Okay. [Jane laughs]

173
00:10:39,340 --> 00:10:41,075
[Oliver] It's really nice
to see you.

174
00:10:42,376 --> 00:10:43,711
[Jane] Sorry.

175
00:10:46,780 --> 00:10:48,082
[Jane sighs]

176
00:10:48,550 --> 00:10:50,718
I mean, you look-- in...

177
00:10:51,852 --> 00:10:53,187
When was the last time...

178
00:10:54,755 --> 00:10:55,856
Oh, it was here.

179
00:10:55,990 --> 00:10:58,159
Well, I mean, it was near here.

180
00:10:58,993 --> 00:11:01,028
-That was here?
-Yeah.

181
00:11:01,162 --> 00:11:02,963
Remember, we had
that little spot by the rocks?

182
00:11:03,097 --> 00:11:05,399
I thought that's why
you wanted to meet here.

183
00:11:05,534 --> 00:11:07,334
Oh! No, no, no.

184
00:11:07,468 --> 00:11:08,802
We're not going up there.

185
00:11:10,171 --> 00:11:12,373
I got a show
down on the shore tonight.

186
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:14,576
Oh, wow.

187
00:11:14,975 --> 00:11:16,043
[Oliver] Is that all right?

188
00:11:16,177 --> 00:11:19,146
Uh, you, um-- Yeah, of course.

189
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:20,848
-It's fine. Yeah.
-Okay.

190
00:11:21,215 --> 00:11:22,517
Wow. Jane.

191
00:11:23,384 --> 00:11:25,119
I can't even believe
you're here.

192
00:11:26,687 --> 00:11:28,122
[Jane chuckles]

193
00:11:29,890 --> 00:11:32,092
So wait. You're playing music?

194
00:11:32,226 --> 00:11:34,428
Are-- You're--
D-- drums or wh-?

195
00:11:34,563 --> 00:11:35,729
[Oliver] No, I lead the band.

196
00:11:35,863 --> 00:11:37,264
-It's my music.
-[Jane] What?

197
00:11:37,398 --> 00:11:38,999
[indistinct]

198
00:11:39,133 --> 00:11:41,068
[Oliver] Yeah, I drum a little,
I did when I was younger,

199
00:11:41,202 --> 00:11:42,937
but fell off
when we were together.

200
00:11:43,070 --> 00:11:44,673
Picked it back up with
these folks a few years back

201
00:11:44,805 --> 00:11:46,140
and still going with it.

202
00:11:46,273 --> 00:11:47,942
[Jane] Hi, nice to meet you.
I'm Jane.

203
00:11:48,075 --> 00:11:49,511
[Oliver] An old friend
from way back.

204
00:11:49,644 --> 00:11:51,646
I'm-- Hi. Hi!

205
00:11:51,779 --> 00:11:53,347
Oh, sorry. [laughs]

206
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:55,149
Hi, it's a pleasure
to meet you.

207
00:11:55,282 --> 00:11:56,717
-How are you? Hi.
-[Oliver] Some guys back here--

208
00:11:56,850 --> 00:11:58,252
[Jane] Hi.
Pleasure to meet you.

209
00:11:58,385 --> 00:12:00,555
Hi. Good day.
Hi. Lovely to meet you as well.

210
00:12:00,689 --> 00:12:02,122
-Hello.
-[Oliver] And--

211
00:12:02,256 --> 00:12:05,025
Pleasure. Pleasure. Hi. Hi!

212
00:12:05,159 --> 00:12:07,061
So nice to meet you.

213
00:12:18,205 --> 00:12:20,874
[Jane] We've known each other
for, like, ten years, but I--

214
00:12:21,008 --> 00:12:23,143
[band member] Yeah, he's
never said your name before.

215
00:12:23,277 --> 00:12:25,212
[Jane laughs] Well, I mean,
we haven't seen each other--

216
00:12:25,346 --> 00:12:27,815
Okay, you guys,
we need to rehearse.

217
00:12:27,948 --> 00:12:29,383
[Jane] Nice to meet you all.

218
00:12:29,517 --> 00:12:31,118
They call you Tayo now?

219
00:12:31,553 --> 00:12:32,520
[Oliver] Yeah.

220
00:12:32,654 --> 00:12:34,755
I mean, that's my name.

221
00:12:34,888 --> 00:12:36,357
Oliver was something
my parents came up with

222
00:12:36,490 --> 00:12:38,058
when they came here.

223
00:12:39,093 --> 00:12:40,928
Yeah. It's the band.

224
00:12:41,061 --> 00:12:45,399
Um, well,
I brought a blanket, so.

225
00:12:45,533 --> 00:12:47,401
Oh. Okay.

226
00:12:48,102 --> 00:12:50,204
I-- I mean I don't--
I can go somewhere else.

227
00:12:50,337 --> 00:12:51,872
[Oliver] No, no, no, it's fine.

228
00:12:52,006 --> 00:12:52,940
Yeah, it's--
let me help you with that.

229
00:12:53,073 --> 00:12:54,141
Okay. Oh, I can do it.

230
00:12:54,275 --> 00:12:56,544
-It's--
-[Jane] Oh, okay.

231
00:12:56,678 --> 00:12:57,679
-I got it. Yeah.
-Thank you.

232
00:12:57,811 --> 00:12:59,046
That's nice of you.

233
00:12:59,179 --> 00:13:00,247
[both] All right.

234
00:13:00,381 --> 00:13:01,815
Are you sure I'm okay to stay?

235
00:13:01,949 --> 00:13:03,284
Of course, why not?

236
00:13:04,619 --> 00:13:08,088
I-- I mean, this is your space
and I really don't wanna--

237
00:13:08,222 --> 00:13:09,557
Look, it-- it's all good.

238
00:13:10,824 --> 00:13:12,126
Tayo.

239
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:15,229
You're cool.
We're just gonna run through

240
00:13:15,362 --> 00:13:17,264
our routines for later.
It's all good.

241
00:13:18,232 --> 00:13:19,601
-Okay?
-Okay.

242
00:13:19,734 --> 00:13:20,635
-[Oliver laughs] Okay.
-Okay.

243
00:13:20,769 --> 00:13:23,070
All right. [sighs]

244
00:13:44,291 --> 00:13:47,529
[upbeat disco music playing]

245
00:14:29,336 --> 00:14:30,805
[young Jane]
I love you so much.

246
00:14:30,938 --> 00:14:32,373
[young Oliver] I love you too.

247
00:14:32,507 --> 00:14:34,341
[young Jane] Do you wanna
go on a road trip?

248
00:14:34,475 --> 00:14:36,143
You and me
and two or three kids?

249
00:14:36,276 --> 00:14:38,178
I can't wait for you
to meet my family.

250
00:14:40,981 --> 00:14:44,184
[music continues]

251
00:15:02,002 --> 00:15:03,270
Come on!

253
00:15:11,546 --> 00:15:12,881
Oliver!

254
00:15:13,013 --> 00:15:15,449
Ol-- Oliver,
my whole family is coming.

255
00:15:15,583 --> 00:15:17,151
We have dinner.

256
00:15:19,654 --> 00:15:22,690
What-- you--
you don't wanna go back?

257
00:15:24,592 --> 00:15:26,160
I-- I don't wanna talk
about this right now.

258
00:15:26,293 --> 00:15:27,595
Let's just-- like...

259
00:15:28,362 --> 00:15:30,532
Honey, where are you gonna go?

260
00:15:40,474 --> 00:15:42,376
-[Oliver] Yeah, I got it.
-[Chioma] Oh, my God!

261
00:15:43,845 --> 00:15:45,012
[Oliver] Whoa!

262
00:15:45,145 --> 00:15:48,616
[indistinct chatter]

263
00:15:50,284 --> 00:15:52,052
[Chioma] I wanna make a toast.

264
00:15:52,986 --> 00:15:55,857
To love, life,
and a great show.

268
00:16:02,630 --> 00:16:03,698
[Chioma] Thank you.

269
00:16:03,832 --> 00:16:04,899
[Oliver] By the way, chin-chin.

270
00:16:05,499 --> 00:16:07,000
-Here you go.
-Oh, my gosh, thank you.

271
00:16:07,134 --> 00:16:08,670
That was so beautiful.

272
00:16:09,236 --> 00:16:11,972
That was nothing.
Just warming up.

273
00:16:15,175 --> 00:16:16,977
[Chioma] I mean,
look at you, though.

274
00:16:17,110 --> 00:16:19,379
This is my favorite part
of the meal.

275
00:16:21,683 --> 00:16:22,983
That's the best one.

276
00:16:23,116 --> 00:16:24,017
[dancer] What are
we doing tonight?

277
00:16:24,151 --> 00:16:25,954
[speaking indistinctly]

278
00:16:31,826 --> 00:16:33,561
[laughing]

279
00:16:37,599 --> 00:16:38,566
Thank you.

[Chioma] Pass 'em, pass 'em.

282
00:16:46,774 --> 00:16:48,041
[Oliver] Hey.

283
00:16:49,476 --> 00:16:51,646
[sighs] Get over here.

284
00:16:56,416 --> 00:16:57,519
What'd you think?

285
00:16:57,652 --> 00:17:00,989
I mean,
my heart's still racing.

286
00:17:01,856 --> 00:17:04,993
All the years I knew you, I--
I never saw you move like that.

287
00:17:05,125 --> 00:17:07,762
Wh-- what do you mean?
I-- I danced.

288
00:17:08,295 --> 00:17:09,864
So now you remember?

289
00:17:09,998 --> 00:17:11,231
'Cause earlier it was like,

290
00:17:11,365 --> 00:17:12,466
""Oh, I have a show
on the beach,

I don't remember
anything about,

00:17:14,334 --> 00:17:16,638
you know, those rocks or...""

293
00:17:17,404 --> 00:17:19,007
So now you remember?

294
00:17:19,139 --> 00:17:20,642
Of course I remember.

295
00:17:21,341 --> 00:17:23,176
I-- You're right, I...

296
00:17:25,212 --> 00:17:26,714
I didn't move like that.

[fire crackling]

298

Almost a decade ago, hm?

299
00:17:43,031 --> 00:17:44,264
So...

300
00:17:45,198 --> 00:17:47,467
what do you remember
about that day?

301
00:17:50,738 --> 00:17:51,839

00:58:11,726 --> 00:58:12,927
Yeah, I really
peaked in tenth grade.

832
00:58:13,361 --> 00:58:15,262
Yeah, that was,
like, a great year for me.

833
00:58:15,396 --> 00:58:16,764
[Jane chuckles]

834
00:58:16,897 --> 00:58:18,432
-This is--
-Right.

835
00:58:18,566 --> 00:58:21,268
I don't-- I don't even
know what to say. [chuckles]

836
00:58:21,402 --> 00:58:23,571
Do you wanna maybe
go for a hike or something?

837
00:58:23,704 --> 00:58:25,706
Um, uh...

838
00:58:26,907 --> 00:58:28,209
[Michael] You have time?

839
00:58:28,342 --> 00:58:29,744
Yeah, actually, I do.
I can do that.

840
00:58:29,877 --> 00:58:32,313
All right,
um, it's kind of steep.

841
00:58:32,446 --> 00:58:33,681
Do you have any water?

842
00:58:33,814 --> 00:58:35,216
I know that's probably vodka.

843
00:58:35,349 --> 00:58:36,917
-[Jane chuckles]
-I don't know where I'm going,

844
00:58:37,051 --> 00:58:38,652
so we're gonna
probably be gone for days.

845
00:58:39,220 --> 00:58:42,857
-How old is Molly? Molly.
-[Jane] Molly.

846
00:58:42,990 --> 00:58:44,458
-[Michael] Yes.
-[Jane] Nice work.

847
00:58:44,625 --> 00:58:45,960
-You remembered.
-[Michael] See? Amazing.

848
00:58:46,093 --> 00:58:48,496
-Through the haze.
-[Jane] She's eight.

849
00:58:49,130 --> 00:58:50,531
-[Michael] No way.
-[Jane] Mm-hmm.

850
00:58:51,332 --> 00:58:53,401
[Michael] Oh, please,
tell me she's still in diapers

851
00:58:53,534 --> 00:58:54,969
just to make me feel less old.

852
00:58:55,469 --> 00:58:57,204
-I guess that would be weird.
-[Jane] How would that

853
00:58:57,338 --> 00:58:58,906
-make you feel better?
-[Michael] Well, you know,

854
00:58:59,040 --> 00:59:00,708
-she's still a baby.
-[Jane] She's eight,

855
00:59:00,841 --> 00:59:02,143
-she's not a baby.
-[Michael] What's she doing?

856
00:59:02,276 --> 00:59:03,744
-[Jane] She's at camp.
-[Michael] Oh.

857
00:59:03,878 --> 00:59:05,246
-Where, specifically?
-[Jane] Why?

858
00:59:05,379 --> 00:59:06,747
[Michael] It's a thing,
I collect addresses

859
00:59:06,881 --> 00:59:08,649
of kids camps like stamps.

860
00:59:08,783 --> 00:59:10,151
Don't worry about it.

861
00:59:10,284 --> 00:59:11,952
She's somewhere
in the general Malibu area.

862
00:59:12,086 --> 00:59:13,888
Is it one of those,
like, super genius camps?

863
00:59:14,021 --> 00:59:16,323
Where they make robots
and stuff?

864
00:59:16,457 --> 00:59:17,858
It's a regular kid camp.

865
00:59:18,259 --> 00:59:21,062
-Canoeing and cabins, and...
-I see.

866
00:59:21,195 --> 00:59:23,831
So they make robots
that can row in a canoe.

867
00:59:23,964 --> 00:59:25,199
That's next year.

868
00:59:25,332 --> 00:59:27,068
-That's advanced.
-[Jane sighs]

869
00:59:27,435 --> 00:59:28,769
You, um...

870
00:59:29,970 --> 00:59:31,672
like, what, single? Married?

871
00:59:31,806 --> 00:59:34,141
Oh, my God.
What-- what is this?

872
00:59:34,275 --> 00:59:35,676
Mu-- multiple husbands?

873
00:59:35,810 --> 00:59:38,212
-God. I am single.
-All right.

874
00:59:39,213 --> 00:59:41,282
What was that guy's name,
years ago.

875
00:59:41,415 --> 00:59:42,650
-Dave.
-Dave.

876
00:59:43,384 --> 00:59:45,686
Dave, remember
how he was always like,

877
00:59:45,820 --> 00:59:47,655
""It's Dave. Not David.""

878
00:59:48,155 --> 00:59:50,658
That's all I remember of him,
I think I had, like...

879
00:59:51,725 --> 00:59:53,127
-one drink with him.
-[Jane] Mm-hmm.

880
00:59:53,260 --> 00:59:55,029
He was like,
""Please don't call me David.""

881
00:59:55,663 --> 00:59:57,898
He was, like, a felon, right?

882
00:59:58,032 --> 01:00:01,469
No. He's just a regular
run-of-the-mill asshole.

883
01:00:01,602 --> 01:00:03,104
-Okay.
-Why are you acting

884
01:00:03,237 --> 01:00:05,039
like you don't know
anything about my life?

885
01:00:05,172 --> 01:00:07,141
I see you lurking
on my Instagram stories.

886
01:00:07,274 --> 01:00:09,910
Lurker is what
I have my Instagram set to.

887
01:00:10,044 --> 01:00:11,745
That's all
the accounts I lurk in.

888
01:00:12,179 --> 01:00:15,149
But your dog, that's usually
why I'm on there, 'cause...

889
01:00:15,282 --> 01:00:17,017
so many handkerchiefs
and fun setups

890
01:00:17,151 --> 01:00:19,186
that him look half-human.

891
01:00:19,954 --> 01:00:21,422
-[Jane] What?
-[Michael] You know, like--

892
01:00:21,556 --> 01:00:23,224
-[Jane] Half-human?
-[Michael] Well, you know,

893
01:00:23,357 --> 01:00:25,192
because you, like,
dress him up in people clothes.

894
01:00:25,326 --> 01:00:26,961
-He has all the sweaters.
-[Jane] God, it's pretty normal

895
01:00:27,094 --> 01:00:28,696
to put a cute little
handkerchief on your dog.

896
01:00:28,829 --> 01:00:30,131
[Michael] See,
this is what I'm talking about,

897
01:00:30,264 --> 01:00:31,799
-now you sound crazy.
-[Jane laughs]

898
01:00:32,099 --> 01:00:34,068
-[Michael chuckles]
-How are you?

899
01:00:34,835 --> 01:00:36,804
Uh, you know, we're good,

900
01:00:36,937 --> 01:00:38,405
it-- you know, as you know,

901
01:00:38,540 --> 01:00:42,042
um, Melissa and I
were separated for a while,

902
01:00:42,176 --> 01:00:45,779
a while back, but, well,
then we had a baby,

903
01:00:45,913 --> 01:00:47,648
which, you know,
fixes everything.

904
01:00:48,215 --> 01:00:49,817
-[laughs]
-You had another kid?

905
01:00:49,950 --> 01:00:51,118
Yeah, you know.

906
01:00:51,553 --> 01:00:54,388
Seemed like, you know,
the mature thing to do.

907
01:00:54,889 --> 01:00:57,091
It turns out, uh,
that doesn't necessarily

908
01:00:57,224 --> 01:00:59,793
help a marriage, uh,
as you have a child

909
01:00:59,927 --> 01:01:02,696
that is up all the time,
but, that said,

910
01:01:02,830 --> 01:01:05,065
you know,
we have gone to therapy a lot,

911
01:01:05,199 --> 01:01:07,768
and we have worked on it
and we have worked on it,

912
01:01:07,902 --> 01:01:11,005
and, you know,
like, we're-- it's--

913
01:01:11,138 --> 01:01:12,806
it's this great new place.

914
01:01:13,307 --> 01:01:16,043
And it's, uh,
totally different,

915
01:01:16,177 --> 01:01:19,780
and good,
and I think it's a good spot.

916
01:01:20,814 --> 01:01:22,183
-It was a lot of work, but--
-Wow.

917
01:01:22,316 --> 01:01:25,019
I-- I'm kind of amazed,
you're, like--

918
01:01:25,554 --> 01:01:26,655
Like a mature human being?

919
01:01:26,787 --> 01:01:28,389
You're, like, a full adult now.

920
01:01:28,523 --> 01:01:29,823
Yeah. Oh, look.

921
01:01:30,257 --> 01:01:32,293
That guy escaped
from Jimmy Buffet's band.

922
01:01:32,661 --> 01:01:34,762
Margaritaville for life.

923
01:01:41,702 --> 01:01:45,940
[Jane sniffling]

924
01:01:50,411 --> 01:01:53,180
I need you to know
that it's actually okay.

925
01:01:54,649 --> 01:01:56,917
Is it? Are you sure?

926
01:01:58,385 --> 01:01:59,453
'Cause if even--

927
01:02:00,421 --> 01:02:02,089
It's okay, it's okay.

928
01:02:02,223 --> 01:02:04,693
Just sorry
that I didn't stay in contact.

929
01:02:04,858 --> 01:02:06,026
I really am.

930
01:02:06,160 --> 01:02:08,697
You did, you know,
in your own way.

931
01:02:08,829 --> 01:02:10,864
You'd, like, DM me at 3:00 a.m.

932
01:02:11,232 --> 01:02:14,536
[sobbing] You know,
you could've called,

933
01:02:14,669 --> 01:02:16,237
but you didn't, so...

934
01:02:18,439 --> 01:02:21,475
Get, like,
three glasses of wine in me

935
01:02:21,610 --> 01:02:22,977
and then...

936
01:02:24,011 --> 01:02:25,980
It's my best DMing time.

937
01:02:26,548 --> 01:02:27,948
I mean, I'm--

938
01:02:31,553 --> 01:02:35,990
[melancholic
guitar melody playing]

939
01:02:57,646 --> 01:02:58,946
[Jane sighs]

940
01:03:13,994 --> 01:03:15,329
I'm sorry.

941
01:03:17,464 --> 01:03:18,832
I think it--

942
01:03:18,966 --> 01:03:20,834
I think it actually
really hurt my feelings

943
01:03:20,968 --> 01:03:22,169
when you ghosted me.

944
01:03:22,303 --> 01:03:24,038
It was just a bad joke, too,

945
01:03:24,171 --> 01:03:25,472
and I don't know when to stop.

946
01:03:25,607 --> 01:03:26,974
It's okay.

947
01:03:27,941 --> 01:03:30,712
I-- I feel like now that I know

948
01:03:30,844 --> 01:03:32,179
your whole situation,

949
01:03:32,313 --> 01:03:34,649
I actually
really respect what you did,

950
01:03:34,783 --> 01:03:36,350
because you didn't run away

951
01:03:36,483 --> 01:03:38,553
from your
responsibilities, so...

952
01:03:39,453 --> 01:03:41,623
Yeah, now you just know
I'm half a piece of shit.

953
01:03:41,756 --> 01:03:43,357
[chuckles] You're not.

954
01:03:43,490 --> 01:03:45,225
No, I am.

955
01:03:46,026 --> 01:03:47,729
But, uh, you know.

956
01:03:48,162 --> 01:03:49,830
Thank you for understanding,

957
01:03:49,963 --> 01:03:51,165
-'cause I was--
-You're not.

958
01:03:51,298 --> 01:03:52,767
-You-- you would.
-No, I wouldn't.

959
01:03:52,900 --> 01:03:54,068
-Really.
-You really--

960
01:03:54,201 --> 01:03:55,537
-You would...
-I would not.

961
01:03:55,670 --> 01:03:56,904
...'cause I know
that you're a good person,

962
01:03:57,037 --> 01:03:58,272
so I know you would understand.

963
01:04:00,040 --> 01:04:02,042
-No I'm not.
-You are.

964
01:04:02,943 --> 01:04:04,244
You really are.

965
01:04:06,246 --> 01:04:07,881
Yeah, sometimes, uh...

966
01:04:09,116 --> 01:04:10,384
I wish things were different.

967
01:04:15,222 --> 01:04:17,525
[chuckling] Me too.

968
01:04:18,760 --> 01:04:20,227
But, you know...

969
01:04:21,962 --> 01:04:24,632
[chuckles] People change, and,

970
01:04:24,766 --> 01:04:26,668
um, maybe--

971
01:04:26,801 --> 01:04:28,302
maybe if you really knew me,

972
01:04:28,435 --> 01:04:30,638
you wouldn't even
really like me that much so...

973
01:04:30,772 --> 01:04:32,607
Jane, you're still the same.

974
01:04:32,741 --> 01:04:34,475
-No, I'm not, I swear to you--
-[Michael] No, that--

975
01:04:34,609 --> 01:04:36,009
-that's a compliment.
-No, I-- I've--

976
01:04:36,143 --> 01:04:37,579
I'm not the same person,

977
01:04:37,712 --> 01:04:39,279
-I'm not.
-No, it's why I love you.

978
01:04:39,413 --> 01:04:41,448
-No, please don't say that.
-You know that.

979
01:04:41,583 --> 01:04:42,650
Please don't say that.

980
01:04:42,784 --> 01:04:43,984
I am not joking.

981
01:04:44,118 --> 01:04:45,520
-I always have.
-No.

982
01:04:45,653 --> 01:04:47,522
I'm not trying
to start anything, I swear.

983
01:04:47,655 --> 01:04:48,690
I'm not.

984
01:04:48,823 --> 01:04:50,190
It's just...

985
01:04:51,091 --> 01:04:53,360
in some other world,
some other time...

986
01:04:54,261 --> 01:04:55,630
we would've been together.

987
01:04:56,664 --> 01:04:59,900
Yeah, I mean, maybe, yeah.

988
01:05:12,946 --> 01:05:14,314
Why'd you do that?

989
01:05:14,448 --> 01:05:16,885
[both laughing]

990
01:05:17,017 --> 01:05:18,051
I'm so glad I went running.

991
01:05:18,185 --> 01:05:20,921
[Jane laughing]

992
01:05:23,991 --> 01:05:25,292
Okay.

993
01:05:25,426 --> 01:05:27,361
-Let's do it.
-[chuckling] All right.

994
01:05:28,028 --> 01:05:29,129
-Okay.
-Okay?

995
01:05:29,263 --> 01:05:30,497
-All right.
-Let's run away.

996
01:05:30,931 --> 01:05:31,999
Right now.

997
01:05:32,466 --> 01:05:35,269
If you say the word,
I'll run away with you.

998
01:05:35,402 --> 01:05:36,671
[whispering] Just say it.

999
01:05:37,471 --> 01:05:38,540
Let's go.

1000
01:05:40,340 --> 01:05:42,109
No, I can't, I can't.

1047

the reason
that we ran into each other

1048

is 'cause we just
needed to see each other,

and just be able to walk away,

00:00:23,572 --> 00:00:27,869
I saw this dog that was hit by a car.

2
00:00:27,989 --> 00:00:31,364
She was killed.

3
00:00:31,489 --> 00:00:37,989
Her puppy was right next
to her drinking her milk.

4
00:00:39,156 --> 00:00:43,364
The mother still had milk.

5
00:00:48,781 --> 00:00:53,614
The puppy was hungry.

6
00:00:53,781 --> 00:00:58,744
She was drinking milk and crying.

7
00:00:58,864 --> 00:01:01,822
What did you do with her?

8
00:01:02,572 --> 00:01:05,781
Did you save her?

9
00:02:33,668 --> 00:02:35,882
Shakib, I'll do it myself.

10
00:02:36,002 --> 00:02:38,132
Hey man.
Hello.

11
00:02:38,252 --> 00:02:40,232
How are you?
Not bad.

12
00:02:40,352 --> 00:02:45,507
My old man says hi and asks
if you have any rat poison.

13
00:02:45,627 --> 00:02:49,960
I don't sell any of that.
You know of a place that does?

14
00:02:50,293 --> 00:02:54,923
What do you want it for?
To kill rats!

15
00:02:55,043 --> 00:02:57,522
Tell your old man to come in himself.

16
00:02:58,002 --> 00:03:00,590
That place is beneath you.

17
00:03:00,710 --> 00:03:03,132
It doesn't suit you to go there.

18
00:03:03,252 --> 00:03:04,440
I don't go that often.

19
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:06,710
Once is too many.

20
00:03:06,910 --> 00:03:09,752
You shouldn't be sleeping with strangers.

21
00:03:10,043 --> 00:03:11,798
I'm only with one person.

22
00:03:11,918 --> 00:03:14,673
What did you say?
I'm only with one girl.

23
00:03:14,793 --> 00:03:17,048
It doesn't matter if it's one or ten.

24
00:03:17,168 --> 00:03:18,907
That place is disgusting.

25
00:03:19,027 --> 00:03:21,877
You shouldn't set foot there.

26
00:03:22,418 --> 00:03:24,918
I'm careful.

27
00:03:25,085 --> 00:03:28,002
You're not from around here.
Trust me.

28
00:03:28,643 --> 00:03:32,590
This is a small town. If people find out,
they'll set that place on fire.

29
00:03:32,710 --> 00:03:35,857
They'll raise hell.
I left you the keys.

30
00:03:35,977 --> 00:03:39,627
I could've washed those at home.
I'll wash them.

31
00:03:39,793 --> 00:03:42,460
Anything else?
No.

32
00:03:44,835 --> 00:03:46,715
We want 10 workers.

33
00:03:46,835 --> 00:03:48,590
10!

34
00:03:48,710 --> 00:03:50,793
Only 10 workers!

35
00:03:52,252 --> 00:03:54,107
Sir, only 10!

36
00:03:54,227 --> 00:03:56,460
That's enough.

37
00:03:56,752 --> 00:03:58,877
10!

38
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:13,960
300,000 Tomans a day.

39
00:04:19,918 --> 00:04:21,615
Come on up.

40
00:04:21,735 --> 00:04:24,048
Get in.
Get in.

41
00:04:24,168 --> 00:04:26,877
It's only 300,000 Tomans.

42
00:05:16,627 --> 00:05:21,673
Haji, it's a problem.
No, the other guy.

43
00:05:21,793 --> 00:05:28,377
He threatened them with a knife
and said he won't pay.

44
00:05:28,752 --> 00:05:31,293
Watch it!

45
00:05:32,835 --> 00:05:34,960
Hello?
Anyways, handle this.

46
00:05:37,793 --> 00:05:40,339
Where you going?
The truck is that way.

47
00:05:40,768 --> 00:05:42,715
What's your name?
Shakib.

48
00:05:42,835 --> 00:05:45,293
Come back tomorrow at 6am.

49
00:05:55,918 --> 00:05:59,210
Go get in the truck already.

50
00:06:45,168 --> 00:06:46,632
Take that side.

51
00:06:46,752 --> 00:06:48,215
Hold it.

52
00:06:48,335 --> 00:06:50,377
This way.

53
00:06:53,002 --> 00:06:54,423
Hold it.

54
00:06:54,543 --> 00:06:56,543
Turn it.

55
00:06:59,043 --> 00:07:02,377
Take this wire.
Pass it through.

56
00:07:04,460 --> 00:07:06,460
Go forward.

57
00:07:07,002 --> 00:07:09,168
Pull it.

58
00:07:20,460 --> 00:07:22,460
Do your job.

59
00:07:24,460 --> 00:07:26,340
Be careful.

60
00:07:26,460 --> 00:07:28,423
Wait.

61
00:07:28,543 --> 00:07:30,543
Be careful sir.

62
00:07:31,752 --> 00:07:33,835
Pull it.

63
00:07:34,043 --> 00:07:36,335
Lift it up sir.

64
00:07:36,810 --> 00:07:38,757
It's too heavy sir.

65
00:07:38,877 --> 00:07:40,877
Lift it up.

66
00:08:05,477 --> 00:08:08,377
Tomorrow, be here at the same time.

67
00:08:08,577 --> 00:08:10,668
Here you go.

68
00:08:10,918 --> 00:08:13,668
God bless you.

69
00:08:13,877 --> 00:08:19,293
Where is the car?
The car is over there.

70
00:08:21,210 --> 00:08:23,210
Here.

71
00:08:25,002 --> 00:08:27,293
Be on your way.

72
00:08:30,627 --> 00:08:33,632
Sir, Should I come back tomorrow?

73
00:08:33,752 --> 00:08:36,007
Where do you live?

74
00:08:36,127 --> 00:08:38,090
At a friend's shop.

75
00:08:38,210 --> 00:08:39,507
You don't have a home?

76
00:08:39,627 --> 00:08:40,382
No.

77
00:08:40,502 --> 00:08:44,423
What about wife and kids?
No. They died in the earthquake.

78
00:08:44,543 --> 00:08:46,340
God bless them.

79
00:08:46,460 --> 00:08:47,840
Hassan?
Yes sir?

80
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:50,918
You have any problems
with staying overnight?

81
00:08:52,210 --> 00:08:53,482
Yes sir?

82
00:08:53,602 --> 00:08:57,132
Show Mr. Shakib around.
We don't need your cousin anymore.

83
00:08:57,252 --> 00:09:01,757
But sir, he's already on his way.
You've been saying that for three days.

84
00:09:01,877 --> 00:09:07,835
What do I have him do sir?
Whatever you wanted your cousin to do.

85
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:14,418
Forget it! I'll do everything myself.
You wanted an extra hand this whole week.

86
00:09:14,543 --> 00:09:17,085
I do.
But…

87
00:09:17,710 --> 00:09:22,168
That poor guy is already on his way.
He can turn around.

88
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:27,835
Mr. Shakib, it's a tough job.
You have to work hard.

89
00:09:28,043 --> 00:09:32,423
Help out in the kitchen by day
and stand guard on the set by night.

90
00:09:32,543 --> 00:09:35,132
You can't have any guests over.

91
00:09:35,252 --> 00:09:38,757
Come and pay us already!
Ok, wait a minute.

92
00:09:38,877 --> 00:09:41,252
No friends, no family,
no nothing.

93
00:09:41,835 --> 00:09:45,632
They're production designers.
They built everything you see here.

94
00:09:45,752 --> 00:09:48,543
What was your name?
Shakib.

95
00:09:48,727 --> 00:09:50,727
I'm Hassan.

96
00:09:51,627 --> 00:09:53,007
Sorry to keep you waiting.

97
00:09:53,127 --> 00:09:54,798
I was looking for the blanket.

98
00:09:54,918 --> 00:09:56,882
Come on in!

99
00:09:57,002 --> 00:09:58,340
So this is the place.

100
00:09:58,460 --> 00:10:02,043
If you need anything,
I'm in the red house. Call me.

101
00:10:02,460 --> 00:10:06,757
What about electricity? There's no power.
Maybe later on.

102
00:10:06,877 --> 00:10:11,257
You have to wake up before
the crew arrives. Don't sleep in!

103
00:10:11,377 --> 00:10:17,002
I'll have someone light up
a fire pit, so you keep warm.

104
00:10:18,127 --> 00:10:21,507
You have all that space.
Can't I come over there?

105
00:10:21,627 --> 00:10:25,798
What difference does it make?
The red house has power.

106
00:10:25,918 --> 00:10:30,502
You're not here to party,
you're a night guard.

107
00:10:32,210 --> 00:10:36,252
If it's too hard, I can send
you back with the shuttles.

108
00:10:37,085 --> 00:10:38,923
What do you say?

109
00:10:39,043 --> 00:10:41,043
So?

110
00:10:41,502 --> 00:10:46,335
Don't be a wimp.
Give me some light so I don't fall.

111
00:11:03,752 --> 00:11:06,097
Give me the director's breakfast.

112
00:11:06,377 --> 00:11:10,752
This has meat in it!
Alireza, give me a vegetarian dish.

113
00:11:24,502 --> 00:11:25,757
Come with me for a second.

114
00:11:25,877 --> 00:11:27,798
We need your help!

115
00:11:27,918 --> 00:11:30,377
A little faster.

116
00:11:33,627 --> 00:11:36,507
Come, we need your help.

117
00:11:36,627 --> 00:11:39,590
Wear these.
I have my own

118
00:11:39,710 --> 00:11:42,460
No, you have to wear these now.

119
00:11:43,210 --> 00:11:46,090
We need you on the set.

120
00:11:46,210 --> 00:11:49,460
Wear it, I'll explain later.

121
00:12:04,335 --> 00:12:08,423
Don't look into the camera!
Don't look at the lens! Don't laugh!

122
00:12:08,543 --> 00:12:10,257
Sina, pay attention!

123
00:12:10,377 --> 00:12:13,773
You with the long beard,
go hide in the back.

124
00:12:13,893 --> 00:12:16,673
It'll be over soon.
Quiet please.

125
00:12:16,793 --> 00:12:19,043
3.2.1.

126
00:12:19,243 --> 00:12:20,840
Action!

127
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:23,007
Take off your clothes.

128
00:12:23,127 --> 00:12:25,168
Take them off.

129
00:13:53,168 --> 00:13:55,168
Open the door.

130
00:14:00,535 --> 00:14:01,807
Cut!

131
00:14:01,927 --> 00:14:06,469
I'm coming! It's a cut.
Stop pounding.

132
00:14:08,802 --> 00:14:11,635
I apologize.

133
00:14:13,260 --> 00:14:17,182
Be careful!
Watch your step!

134
00:14:17,302 --> 00:14:20,302
Help them wear their clothes.

135
00:14:21,385 --> 00:14:23,099
I am really sorry.

136
00:14:23,219 --> 00:14:25,074
Watch your steps.

137
00:14:25,194 --> 00:14:28,510
Put them on.
Hurry up.

138
00:14:50,469 --> 00:14:54,885
Watch where you're throwing that!
Sorry, I'll be careful.

139
00:14:55,177 --> 00:14:59,302
Let me help you.
No, I'll get fired.

140
00:15:05,510 --> 00:15:09,265
Stop what you're doing.
Come with me.

141
00:15:09,385 --> 00:15:12,094
Hurry up.

142
00:15:12,677 --> 00:15:16,885
Faster!
We are waiting for you.

143
00:15:22,802 --> 00:15:25,135
Be careful.
Don't fall.

144
00:15:27,010 --> 00:15:29,432
I can't.
Just do it.

145
00:15:29,552 --> 00:15:33,885
Stand over here and look that way.

146
00:15:34,427 --> 00:15:36,802
Ready?

147
00:15:38,719 --> 00:15:41,094
Face this way.

148
00:15:41,302 --> 00:15:43,302
Come closer!

149
00:15:48,744 --> 00:15:51,929
3, 2, 1... Action!

150
00:16:04,635 --> 00:16:08,594
Everything looks so fake.

151
00:16:09,135 --> 00:16:11,432
Is this supposed to be a comedy?

152
00:16:11,552 --> 00:16:14,552
They know nothing about the World War!

153
00:16:14,844 --> 00:16:18,010
They're keeping us
in the rain for this shit?

154
00:16:27,719 --> 00:16:33,094
Is he having a heart attack?
Is this for real?

155
00:16:42,469 --> 00:16:45,469
Take his uniform.

156
00:16:51,135 --> 00:16:54,469
His pants too!
He ruined the uniform.

157
00:16:54,844 --> 00:16:57,010
Hurry up!

158
00:16:57,927 --> 00:17:00,622
Why is it so crowded here?
Please, take a tea break.

159
00:17:00,742 --> 00:17:03,247
Which hospital?
Soroush.

160
00:17:03,367 --> 00:17:06,742
Where is it?
Motahari Street.

161
00:17:13,783 --> 00:17:17,408
Someone has to go with him.
He shouldn't go alone.

162
00:17:17,908 --> 00:17:19,950
Get the car.

163
00:18:36,700 --> 00:18:40,538
Now that we have to repeat everything,
let's ask him to do it right this time.

164
00:18:40,658 --> 00:18:42,497
He's messing it up.
What's wrong with it?

165
00:18:42,617 --> 00:18:44,538
Everything.
The Gas Chamber looks ridiculous.

166
00:18:44,658 --> 00:18:49,455
Let's not rewrite history.
Nothing looks real.

167
00:18:49,575 --> 00:18:51,788
You worry about getting your actor back.

168
00:18:51,908 --> 00:18:55,533
He won't come.
I'm sure you can bring him back.

169
00:18:55,908 --> 00:19:00,033
Are you even listening to me?
Just do as I say.

170
00:19:00,158 --> 00:19:05,247
Put him in the call sheet.
Whatever.

171
00:19:05,367 --> 00:19:07,680
I'm sorry sir.
What is it Shakib?

172
00:19:07,800 --> 00:19:10,672
Can I sleep somewhere else?
Why?

173
00:19:10,792 --> 00:19:14,867
The ceiling leaks when it rains.
I can't sleep.

174
00:19:14,992 --> 00:19:17,205
Alright, I'll look into it.

175
00:19:17,325 --> 00:19:21,005
But don't tell me these things, tell Emad.
I can sleep in the red house.

176
00:19:21,125 --> 00:19:25,830
Who would look after the gas chamber?
There's nothing there.

177
00:19:25,950 --> 00:19:29,283
There are steel beams and film equipment.

178
00:19:29,492 --> 00:19:31,658
You come over here.

179
00:19:33,408 --> 00:19:35,867
They want him to audition.

180
00:19:36,033 --> 00:19:41,705
Audition? He's not an actor.
I don't know, they want him right away.

181
00:19:41,825 --> 00:19:43,372
Go see what they want.

182
00:19:43,492 --> 00:19:45,700
Let's go.
I can't sir.

183
00:19:50,033 --> 00:19:53,450
Can you stop singing please?

184
00:19:54,908 --> 00:19:56,205
What's your name?

185
00:19:56,325 --> 00:19:57,663
Tofighi.

186
00:19:57,783 --> 00:19:58,622
Hossein Tofighi.

187
00:19:58,742 --> 00:20:01,080
Not you, behind you.

188
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:05,450
You sir, with the white apron.
What's your name?

189
00:20:05,617 --> 00:20:08,575
Shakib.
Can you step forward?

190
00:20:11,325 --> 00:20:15,580
But sir, we'll be a laughing stock.
With our prisoners and now our Hitler!

191
00:20:15,700 --> 00:20:18,538
He's our best option.
Let's not rush into things.

192
00:20:18,658 --> 00:20:20,747
We could go over the audition tapes.

193
00:20:20,867 --> 00:20:22,372
Do a makeup test.

194
00:20:22,492 --> 00:20:24,992
I'll give it a shot.

195
00:20:28,825 --> 00:20:32,680
Everyone can take a break.
Mr. Shakib, you come with me.

196
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:35,497
Can we go home?
No, wait around here.

197
00:20:35,617 --> 00:20:36,713
Come with me.

198
00:20:36,833 --> 00:20:40,313
Listen, we are considering you for...
I can't.

199
00:20:40,433 --> 00:20:42,497
What?
Take one of them

200
00:20:42,617 --> 00:20:46,038
No. The director saw something in you.
Let's go.

201
00:20:46,158 --> 00:20:51,538
But I don't know how-
You don't have to know anything.

202
00:20:51,658 --> 00:20:54,205
I can't. I can't talk-
You don't have to.

203
00:20:54,325 --> 00:20:57,455
You'll do a count
and we'll dub over you later.

204
00:20:57,575 --> 00:21:01,325
I'll do the mustache myself.
Sure.

205
00:21:06,825 --> 00:21:10,242
It fits him perfectly.

206
00:21:15,242 --> 00:21:18,330
Take him as far back as you can.

207
00:21:18,450 --> 00:21:23,700
Come stand over here.
Right in the middle.

208
00:21:24,075 --> 00:21:25,747
Let him take your picture.

209
00:21:25,867 --> 00:21:28,742
Let me straighten his hat.

210
00:21:30,075 --> 00:21:31,080
Look over here.

211
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:33,038
Raise your hand!

212
00:21:33,158 --> 00:21:34,747
No, not like that.

213
00:21:34,867 --> 00:21:37,497
Like in a military salute.
Raise your hand.

214
00:21:37,617 --> 00:21:39,122
Higher.
Straight.

215
00:21:39,242 --> 00:21:42,117
Look over here.
Look at me.

216
00:21:46,283 --> 00:21:48,992
Why are you laughing?

217
00:21:51,158 --> 00:21:54,325
It's for the movie.

218
00:21:55,950 --> 00:21:58,825
Is it that bad?

219
00:22:00,033 --> 00:22:02,867
Don't laugh!

220
00:22:24,283 --> 00:22:28,455
Mr. Shakib, just leave it somewhere.
Don't mess with anything.

221
00:22:28,575 --> 00:22:31,497
It's a fragile set.
If something breaks I'll get in trouble.

222
00:22:31,617 --> 00:22:35,663
I didn't want my stuff to be in the way.
It's just a plastic bag!

223
00:22:35,783 --> 00:22:39,497
Use it as a pillow and take it with
you when you leave in the morning.

224
00:22:39,617 --> 00:22:42,413
I can't take it with me day in day out.

225
00:22:42,533 --> 00:22:47,992
Mr. Nosrati said that
you'll only be here tonight.

226
00:22:48,242 --> 00:22:50,122
That's not what he told me.

227
00:22:50,242 --> 00:22:52,038
That's what he told me.

228
00:22:52,158 --> 00:22:54,658
Maybe talk to him again tomorrow.

229
00:22:55,033 --> 00:22:58,450
But it's best if you
didn't say anything at all.

230
00:22:58,950 --> 00:23:04,080
He was so mad because of you,
no one could go near him!

231
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:09,330
Because of me?
Nosrati wanted a real actor.

232
00:23:09,450 --> 00:23:13,205
The director wanted you.
But Nosrati has a point. It's his money.

233
00:23:13,325 --> 00:23:17,497
He doesn't think you can act.
I told them I can't, they insisted.

234
00:23:17,617 --> 00:23:21,788
Everyone's always bullying everyone else.

235
00:23:21,908 --> 00:23:26,788
The director is bullying Nosrati
and he doesn't know what to do.

236
00:23:26,908 --> 00:23:32,372
He thinks you're with them.
Try not to fall out of favor with him.

237
00:23:32,492 --> 00:23:38,705
Tell him what you just told me, you
can't act and you don't even want to.

238
00:23:38,825 --> 00:23:43,205
That you want to return to the gas chamber,
because you're more comfortable there.

239
00:23:43,325 --> 00:23:49,038
Come up with an excuse. Tell him that
the mustache makes you look ridiculous!

240
00:23:49,158 --> 00:23:55,950
It is ridiculous! When you walked in
I laughed my ass off.

241
00:23:56,408 --> 00:23:59,992
Good night man!

242
00:24:13,158 --> 00:24:18,117
I swear we told him not to shave!
Sina, didn't you tell him?

243
00:24:18,492 --> 00:24:23,908
You guys are not taking your
jobs seriously. Get back to work!

244
00:24:24,867 --> 00:24:28,418
Alireza, what do you want?
They're on their way sir.

245
00:24:30,825 --> 00:24:32,825
Sign this.

246
00:24:33,033 --> 00:24:37,283
Why? - So you commit to
not doing anything drastic.

247
00:24:37,575 --> 00:24:40,867
So you don't shave your head next.
Yes sir.

248
00:24:41,033 --> 00:24:44,955
I swear I'll seek damages next time.
I didn't know.

249
00:24:45,075 --> 00:24:47,038
Sign it!

250
00:24:47,158 --> 00:24:50,830
Sign?
- You're not signing your death sentence man!

251
00:24:50,950 --> 00:24:55,080
You're signing this so you
do your job right. Isn't???

252
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:56,580
The sign it.
Give it to me.

253
00:24:56,700 --> 00:24:59,075
What sir?
The ink pad.

254
00:25:02,450 --> 00:25:05,700
But, what about my sleeping arrangement?

255
00:25:06,075 --> 00:25:10,163
I told you to stay with Hassan.
He said I could only stay for one night.

256
00:25:10,283 --> 00:25:15,205
You told him that?
- I didn't! You said he'll come over, I said sure.

257
00:25:15,325 --> 00:25:20,955
But who will look after the gas chamber?
- I can't be there. It rains and the ceiling leaks.

258
00:25:21,075 --> 00:25:23,622
Then you stay at Hitler's, and
you go down to the chamber.

259
00:25:23,742 --> 00:25:28,200
Why me? Mr. Nosrati I've done everything
Get back to work!

260
00:25:55,492 --> 00:25:56,497
Cut!

261
00:25:56,617 --> 00:25:58,788
Don't shoot.

262
00:25:58,908 --> 00:26:02,663
Shakib, didn't I tell you to slap them hard?
- I did.

263
00:26:02,783 --> 00:26:06,038
Harder! It's the tenth take already!
What was his name?

264
00:26:06,158 --> 00:26:08,330
Shakib.
Tell him to come over here.

265
00:26:08,450 --> 00:26:10,080
Go see what he says.

266
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:12,283
Listen to what he has to say.

267
00:26:12,575 --> 00:26:16,992
Everyone stay in your spots.
We'll do another take.

268
00:26:17,117 --> 00:26:19,117
Come here.

269
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:24,947
I want to be alone with him for a second.

270
00:26:26,492 --> 00:26:28,830
Do you know who Hitler was?
Yes.

271
00:26:28,950 --> 00:26:30,950
Who was he?

272
00:26:32,117 --> 00:26:35,668
Forget it.
Do you know who the guy you're slapping is?

273
00:26:36,825 --> 00:26:39,450
No.
Close your eyes.

274
00:26:40,492 --> 00:26:42,492
Close them.

275
00:26:43,533 --> 00:26:46,788
Now pretend you're living
with someone you love.

276
00:26:46,908 --> 00:26:51,200
And you have a kid that
you're willing to die for.

277
00:26:52,742 --> 00:26:56,658
Nothing in the world is worth
more to you than these two.

278
00:26:57,908 --> 00:27:01,122
And then one day, you come
home to play with your kid,

279
00:27:01,242 --> 00:27:05,950
And you find that these people
have cut them into pieces.

280
00:27:06,158 --> 00:27:08,450
What would you have done?

281
00:27:08,617 --> 00:27:11,408
Is this how you would've slapped them?

282
00:27:15,992 --> 00:27:18,825
I wouldn't have slapped them.

283
00:27:49,742 --> 00:27:53,200
They gave me this mansion.

284
00:27:59,075 --> 00:28:01,075
They told me...

285
00:28:01,242 --> 00:28:04,492
Not to do manual labor anymore.

286
00:28:05,658 --> 00:28:08,950
I spend the nights here.

287
00:28:46,908 --> 00:28:49,950
1, 2, 3

288
00:29:03,867 --> 00:29:06,575
Why are you crying?

289
00:29:07,950 --> 00:29:10,033
Where are you?

290
00:30:03,117 --> 00:30:05,913
The asshole wanted to
drug me with a syringe.

291
00:30:06,033 --> 00:30:09,651
So I don't feel the pain
and work for him like a dog.

292
00:30:10,908 --> 00:30:15,122
I can't anymore. Slightest odors
make me want to throw up.

293
00:30:15,242 --> 00:30:19,288
I'll take you back and talk to him.
I won't go back.

294
00:30:19,408 --> 00:30:22,367
Where do you want to go?

295
00:30:22,658 --> 00:30:27,783
I don't know.
You can't sleep in the streets.

296
00:30:29,033 --> 00:30:33,158
Let me stay with you for a few days.

297
00:30:33,575 --> 00:30:35,575
With me?

298
00:30:35,867 --> 00:30:38,117
I don't have a place.

299
00:30:39,117 --> 00:30:43,533
In that house that you're in.
It's not possible.

300
00:30:44,617 --> 00:30:50,533
It is so crowded over there,
they'll see you.

301
00:30:51,158 --> 00:30:55,663
For only three or four days.
I can't.

302
00:30:55,783 --> 00:31:01,747
If he doesn't find me, after
a few days he'll give up.

303
00:31:01,867 --> 00:31:04,372
Then I'll leave town.

304
00:31:04,492 --> 00:31:12,325
If you want to leave town, leave today!
What's the difference?

305
00:31:12,950 --> 00:31:15,325
Don't be such a baby!

306
00:31:15,575 --> 00:31:16,788
Everybody is staring.

307
00:31:16,908 --> 00:31:19,867
Sit down
I don't care

308
00:31:20,450 --> 00:31:25,867
Every day a hundred men
want me for only one thing...

309
00:31:31,617 --> 00:31:33,992
Where is it?
What?

310
00:32:12,617 --> 00:32:18,700
They're leaving.
Run when I tell you. Got it?

311
00:32:47,617 --> 00:32:51,242
Everyone's gone.
No one is here.

312
00:32:53,033 --> 00:32:56,830
What a nice house!
Is it nice?

313
00:32:56,950 --> 00:32:59,450
It suits you.

314
00:33:37,783 --> 00:33:39,783
Shakib?

315
00:33:41,367 --> 00:33:43,367
Mr. Shakib!

316
00:33:44,158 --> 00:33:46,158
I'm coming.

317
00:33:46,783 --> 00:33:50,080
Shakib, where are you?
I'm here.

318
00:33:50,200 --> 00:33:52,413
Why weren't you opening the door?

319
00:33:52,533 --> 00:33:54,038
Were you playing the keyboard?
No.

320
00:33:54,158 --> 00:33:56,122
Don't use it, you'll break it.

321
00:33:56,242 --> 00:33:59,872
It's cold here too.
How could you stay over there?

322
00:33:59,992 --> 00:34:04,414
There's water everywhere.
I'll spend the nights here from now on.

323
00:34:05,450 --> 00:34:09,205
You go over there.
It's more comfortable on that couch.

324
00:34:09,325 --> 00:34:13,205
Are you serious?
- I sleep here, even when you're not around.

325
00:34:13,325 --> 00:34:14,997
Are you sure?
Positive.

326
00:34:15,117 --> 00:34:17,533
Thanks man!

327
00:34:22,533 --> 00:34:25,200
It's so cold!

328
00:34:36,158 --> 00:34:38,575
I'll make my bed.

329
00:34:50,783 --> 00:34:52,330
Don't move.

330
00:34:52,450 --> 00:34:55,908
He will spend the night here.

331
00:34:57,950 --> 00:35:00,955
Was it nice?
What was?

332
00:35:01,075 --> 00:35:05,450
The song that you played.

333
00:35:28,563 --> 00:35:29,459
Cut.

334
00:35:29,579 --> 00:35:32,376
You're all supposed to be dead over there.

335
00:35:32,496 --> 00:35:35,896
Use your brains.
Don't move.

336
00:35:40,063 --> 00:35:42,776
Mr. Shakib, you're ruining the uniform.

337
00:35:42,896 --> 00:35:45,563
Sit on the chair.

338
00:35:46,896 --> 00:35:50,479
Get some tea for Shakib!

339
00:35:52,479 --> 00:35:56,396
You abandoned your post last night!
It was raining.

340
00:36:00,146 --> 00:36:04,604
You can quit if you don't like it.
Just leave Shakib alone.

341
00:36:14,354 --> 00:36:15,851
Excuse me, sir.

342
00:36:15,971 --> 00:36:19,584
Is Hassan upset with me?
No, why?

343
00:36:19,704 --> 00:36:22,313
Because he's acting strange.

344
00:36:22,896 --> 00:36:27,354
You did the right thing.
From now on, tell me everything.

345
00:36:27,729 --> 00:36:33,146
Only because you had asked me to.
I said you did the right thing.

346
00:36:36,396 --> 00:36:39,521
Are you done for today?
Yes.

347
00:36:40,688 --> 00:36:43,234
Are you watching over the house?
Yes.

348
00:36:48,979 --> 00:36:52,521
Shakib, are you taking that for the dog?

349
00:36:53,604 --> 00:36:59,104
Yes.
Take this too. Thanks.

350
00:37:10,896 --> 00:37:14,104
You can't stay here anymore.

351
00:37:15,063 --> 00:37:17,188
They'll find you.

352
00:37:17,438 --> 00:37:21,418
Can't you tell them that
your wife will stay with you?

353
00:37:21,538 --> 00:37:27,229
They asked me if I have a family.
I said no.

354
00:37:27,938 --> 00:37:32,084
Tell them now that you
have a job your wife is back.

355
00:37:32,204 --> 00:37:36,021
What about my kid?
Where is my kid?

356
00:37:36,146 --> 00:37:38,959
Wherever.
They're not going to ask.

357
00:37:39,079 --> 00:37:42,771
I told them that my wife and kid are dead.

358
00:37:43,646 --> 00:37:46,479
Can't you say you remarried?

359
00:37:46,646 --> 00:37:51,501
Remarried in the last 3 days?

360
00:37:51,621 --> 00:37:58,563
They'll fire me. I committed to not
having any guests over.

361
00:37:58,688 --> 00:38:02,854
Just admit that you're too embarrassed
to show me to them.

362
00:38:08,604 --> 00:38:11,563
I found a place.

363
00:38:12,229 --> 00:38:14,229
Where?

364
00:38:17,313 --> 00:38:21,354
Underneath here?
Don't worry.

365
00:38:22,021 --> 00:38:26,629
I'll take you out when they leave.

366
00:38:26,829 --> 00:38:28,818
Mr. Shakib.

367
00:38:28,938 --> 00:38:30,938
Mr. Shakib!

368
00:38:32,304 --> 00:38:34,304
Mr. Shakib!

369
00:38:35,554 --> 00:38:38,784
Yes?
Open the door for a second.

370
00:38:38,904 --> 00:38:42,721
Yes?
Two people are here to see you.

371
00:38:53,179 --> 00:38:57,929
Shakib, get it over with and come and see me.
- Thank you sir.

372
00:39:00,513 --> 00:39:02,513
Hello.
Hello.

373
00:39:02,638 --> 00:39:04,721
You're Shakib?
Yes.

374
00:39:05,679 --> 00:39:08,054
I am Farshid.
Do you know me?

375
00:39:08,346 --> 00:39:11,846
I know Rahim.
You're a client, aren't you?

376
00:39:11,988 --> 00:39:14,451
Can we go talk over there?

377
00:39:14,571 --> 00:39:16,743
Why?
I work here.

378
00:39:16,863 --> 00:39:19,976
I told that guy too.
That we're friends.

379
00:39:20,096 --> 00:39:22,929
We're not here to cause trouble.

380
00:39:26,138 --> 00:39:28,888
You live in that red house?

381
00:39:29,388 --> 00:39:31,429
It's a film set.

382
00:39:31,721 --> 00:39:35,473
What kind of a film are they making here?
I don't know.

383
00:39:37,304 --> 00:39:40,804
When's the last time you saw Ladan?
Ladan?

384
00:39:41,013 --> 00:39:44,162
When did you talk to her last?
Three days ago.

385
00:39:44,296 --> 00:39:46,804
On the phone?
On the phone.

386
00:39:46,971 --> 00:39:49,679
How?
Video call.

387
00:39:51,596 --> 00:39:54,513
You know how to talk to her?
Yes.

388
00:39:54,888 --> 00:39:58,184
How do you know that?
My mother was deaf and mute.

389
00:39:58,304 --> 00:40:00,304
Say something.

390
00:40:00,471 --> 00:40:02,326
What should I say?

391
00:40:02,446 --> 00:40:06,263
Anything. I want to see
if you really know sign language.

392
00:40:13,638 --> 00:40:14,638
Does he know?

393
00:40:14,696 --> 00:40:18,243
Who are you calling a cunt?
You piece of shit.

394
00:40:18,363 --> 00:40:21,368
Give him a straight answer!
You hear me? A straight answer!

395
00:40:21,488 --> 00:40:25,618
Don't make a scene-
You know what he said?

396
00:40:25,738 --> 00:40:28,534
Whatever.
He said it to me.

397
00:40:28,654 --> 00:40:31,263
You better watch out.

398
00:40:32,638 --> 00:40:36,189
Quiet. It's his place of work!
Don't make a scene.

399
00:40:37,846 --> 00:40:40,138
That's not what I said.

400
00:40:40,346 --> 00:40:42,309
It doesn't matter.

401
00:40:42,429 --> 00:40:44,888
When was the last time again?

402
00:40:45,763 --> 00:40:48,138
The last time I was over.

403
00:40:48,429 --> 00:40:50,268
When is that?

404
00:40:50,388 --> 00:40:52,471
Rahim was there.

405
00:40:52,888 --> 00:40:56,346
You mean you haven't seen her since?
Are you sure?

406
00:40:57,221 --> 00:41:00,054
Alright.
Go get the bike.

407
00:41:01,721 --> 00:41:03,684
Go.
Go.

408
00:41:03,804 --> 00:41:06,304
I'm sorry, he's a little nuts.

409
00:41:08,471 --> 00:41:11,679
Just do us a favor.
Keep us posted.

410
00:41:11,888 --> 00:41:16,679
Tell her Farshid wants to see you.
Alright?

411
00:41:18,138 --> 00:41:19,784
Thanks.

412
00:41:19,904 --> 00:41:21,904
Bye.

413
00:43:11,471 --> 00:43:13,351
What is it?

414
00:43:13,471 --> 00:43:15,643
Farshid found us!

415
00:43:15,763 --> 00:43:21,263
They're here?
Did you tell Farshid about me?

416
00:43:21,429 --> 00:43:27,476
How did he find me?
Maybe Shirin told him something.

417
00:43:27,596 --> 00:43:30,929
Why did you tell her?

418
00:43:31,804 --> 00:43:36,888
We'll go to the terminal tonight.
Why?

419
00:43:37,721 --> 00:43:42,268
He suspects that you're here.
He'll come back.

420
00:43:42,388 --> 00:43:45,351
I will hide in the crawl space.

421
00:43:45,471 --> 00:43:51,559
It makes no difference, if he
comes back, he will find you.

422
00:43:51,679 --> 00:43:58,013
How can he find out that
I'm here? Unless you tell him.

423
00:43:58,971 --> 00:44:03,013
We'll go to the terminal tonight.

424
00:44:36,429 --> 00:44:39,888
Pin code?
2003.

425
00:44:43,221 --> 00:44:46,638
Go to the door to get on the bus.

426
00:44:55,304 --> 00:45:00,061
Only a ticket to Tehran was available.
It doesn't make a difference.

427
00:46:14,888 --> 00:46:19,221
Why did you lie to us?
Didn't you say she's not here?

428
00:46:19,721 --> 00:46:23,893
Where you going? I won't hurt
you. You fell in love with her?

429
00:46:24,013 --> 00:46:27,430
What did you do with your money?
I don't have any.

430
00:46:28,388 --> 00:46:32,268
Why is she here?
Get up! Get up!

431
00:46:32,388 --> 00:46:37,054
What's she doing here?
What were you planning?

432
00:46:37,221 --> 00:46:39,351
Did you help her escape?
I didn't know she escaped.

433
00:46:39,471 --> 00:46:42,971
Get up! Get up!
No whining.

434
00:46:43,138 --> 00:46:45,018
Did you help her escape?
I didn't.

435
00:46:45,138 --> 00:46:46,643
Then who did?
She was scared.

436
00:46:46,763 --> 00:46:49,268
Scared of who?
Scared of what?

437
00:46:49,388 --> 00:46:52,143
I raised her! Why would she
be scared of me?

438
00:46:52,263 --> 00:46:54,326
I don't know.

439
00:46:54,446 --> 00:46:56,226
Why would she be scared?

440
00:46:56,346 --> 00:46:58,346
Why?!

441
00:46:58,554 --> 00:47:01,596
Come stand over here.
Right here.

442
00:47:01,888 --> 00:47:03,888
Good job.

443
00:47:04,221 --> 00:47:07,138
Stand right here.

444
00:47:07,513 --> 00:47:11,388
If you don't know, then who does?
Ask her.

445
00:47:11,513 --> 00:47:13,184
I want to ask you.

446
00:47:13,304 --> 00:47:17,143
She said you wanted to drug her.
What drugs?

447
00:47:17,263 --> 00:47:21,471
I wanted to force you to take drugs?

448
00:47:21,846 --> 00:47:24,934
Why would I do that?
Is that really what you told him?

449
00:47:25,054 --> 00:47:27,763
Rahim, we wanted to drug her?

450
00:47:28,138 --> 00:47:30,934
How many hours she's been here?
About 40 hours sir.

451
00:47:31,054 --> 00:47:36,518
10 million for being an asshole.
30 for me not beating her senseless.

452
00:47:36,638 --> 00:47:41,059
And 30 for not hanging you by the balls.
What's the total?

453
00:47:41,179 --> 00:47:43,559
He owes you at least 150.
I don't have it.

454
00:47:43,679 --> 00:47:45,601
Why did you bring her here then?

455
00:47:45,721 --> 00:47:48,346
Why don't you have it?

456
00:47:49,596 --> 00:47:53,513
Grab her and let's go.
Don't take her.

457
00:47:54,721 --> 00:47:56,476
Want her to stay?

458
00:47:56,596 --> 00:47:59,179
150 million.
Should she stay?

459
00:47:59,721 --> 00:48:02,476
I can't pay that much.
How much do you have?

460
00:48:02,596 --> 00:48:05,513
How's 120?
100?

461
00:48:06,846 --> 00:48:11,559
Will you leave her alone if I pay?
I swear I will.

462
00:48:11,679 --> 00:48:17,976
Give me a 100 tomorrow morning and keep her.
- I can't by tomorrow morning.

463
00:48:18,096 --> 00:48:21,596
I can't by tomorrow morning.
You can.

464
00:48:21,796 --> 00:48:26,486
Who would I get it from?
- I don't give a shit. Steal if you have to.

465
00:48:26,629 --> 00:48:28,493
You should've thought of that before.

466
00:48:28,613 --> 00:48:31,301
What're we going to do now?
Give me some time.

467
00:48:31,421 --> 00:48:33,851
I'll come up with it.
Give me a day.

468
00:48:33,971 --> 00:48:35,851
You're getting on my nerves.

469
00:48:35,971 --> 00:48:40,138
Tomorrow morning is only 8 hours away.
Who could I get it from?

470
00:48:43,388 --> 00:48:48,096
Alright. We're friends.
We're buddies.

471
00:48:49,054 --> 00:48:53,476
The day after tomorrow,
you will bring me a 100 million.

472
00:48:53,596 --> 00:48:56,326
If you don't, I will no longer be so civil.

473
00:48:56,446 --> 00:49:00,184
I'll take her with me tonight-
Let her stay here.

474
00:49:00,304 --> 00:49:04,784
I'll come up with the money.
To hell with it. She can stay.

475
00:49:04,904 --> 00:49:08,059
You will bring me a 100 million.
Let's go Rahim.

476
00:49:08,179 --> 00:49:12,054
I'm watching you.

477
00:49:47,929 --> 00:49:50,596
Let me go.

478
00:49:52,929 --> 00:49:58,054
No one is forcing you to
ruin your life because of me.

479
00:50:02,179 --> 00:50:05,638
You've already done more than anyone else.

480
00:50:06,429 --> 00:50:12,179
But I feel like we're playing a game.
We're fooling ourselves.

481
00:50:15,138 --> 00:50:17,929
I will go back tonight.

482
00:50:18,763 --> 00:50:22,138
The money...
I will come up with it.

483
00:50:23,471 --> 00:50:26,429
What if you couldn't?

484
00:50:27,554 --> 00:50:30,846
We will run away together.

485
00:50:52,346 --> 00:50:54,018
Cut!

486
00:50:54,138 --> 00:50:54,984
Cut!

487
00:50:55,104 --> 00:50:57,268
Was that good sir?
Ms. Zareh.

488
00:50:57,388 --> 00:51:03,138
Okay.
Okay! Let's set up the next shot.

489
00:51:04,829 --> 00:51:07,268
What is it Mr. Shakib?
When will the shoot be over?

490
00:51:07,388 --> 00:51:11,388
The shoot? Why do you want to know?
We have 3-4 months left

491
00:51:11,588 --> 00:51:13,018
I can't.

492
00:51:13,138 --> 00:51:16,284
You'll be done much sooner.
We have 3-4 months left

493
00:51:16,404 --> 00:51:18,059
I can't anymore.

494
00:51:18,179 --> 00:51:20,159
You can't anymore?
I have to go.

495
00:51:20,279 --> 00:51:22,434
What do you mean you can't?
You have to.

496
00:51:22,554 --> 00:51:25,768
You can't just leave in the middle of a job.
- I have to leave.

497
00:51:25,888 --> 00:51:31,638
Did someone say something?
My mother needs money for an operation.

498
00:51:32,471 --> 00:51:34,034
She's being hospitalized tomorrow.

499
00:51:34,154 --> 00:51:37,034
How much do you need?
100 million.

500
00:51:37,154 --> 00:51:39,221
100?
100.

501
00:51:39,529 --> 00:51:42,768
You can't come up with a 100 million
on your own, can you?

502
00:51:42,888 --> 00:51:45,304
I'll do my best.

503
00:51:45,763 --> 00:51:49,515
I'm sorry. I didn't want to
put you in this position.

504
00:51:50,721 --> 00:51:55,726
Is this a new game you're playing Shakib?
My mother is dying. It's not a game.

505
00:51:55,846 --> 00:52:00,976
Didn't you tell me you have no one?
I said I don't have a wife and kids.

506
00:52:01,096 --> 00:52:03,559
What was Hassan saying anyways?
What did he say?

507
00:52:03,679 --> 00:52:05,676
Who were the people
who came over last night?

508
00:52:05,796 --> 00:52:09,018
Weren't they the ones who were here yesterday?
- Yes sir.

509
00:52:09,138 --> 00:52:10,601
What do they want?

510
00:52:10,721 --> 00:52:13,471
You owe them money?
No.

511
00:52:14,321 --> 00:52:17,101
They're my cousins. They came
to tell me that my mother is sick.

512
00:52:17,221 --> 00:52:22,471
Your family doesn't believe in phones?
I didn't have reception.

513
00:52:22,638 --> 00:52:27,096
Does 10 million do the job?
No. I need 100 million.

514
00:52:27,263 --> 00:52:31,559
Shakib, you can't just ask for that
the second you realize we need you.

515
00:52:31,679 --> 00:52:34,809
You're literally bribing me now.
You don't owe me anything.

516
00:52:34,929 --> 00:52:36,851
Ms. Zareh didn't let me leave.

517
00:52:36,971 --> 00:52:41,768
If you go, the production will come to a halt.
- If I don't, my mother will die.

518
00:52:41,888 --> 00:52:44,434
Come sign this.
What is it?

519
00:52:44,554 --> 00:52:51,704
Sign it so I can give you the money. We owe you
nothing for acting or guarding after this.

520
00:52:51,904 --> 00:52:55,638
You'll give me all of the money?
Sign it and I will.

521
00:53:02,638 --> 00:53:04,976
This is only 10 million.
Were you expecting a 100?

522
00:53:05,096 --> 00:53:08,143
I need a hundred million.
I have to leave if I don't have that.

523
00:53:08,263 --> 00:53:13,101
That's not my problem. Be thankful that
I didn't charge you for damages to props.

524
00:53:13,221 --> 00:53:15,976
Where you going Shakib?
To raise the money.

525
00:53:16,096 --> 00:53:18,726
I've already spent more than
20 billion on this film.

526
00:53:18,846 --> 00:53:22,101
I'm in debt and I don't
take shit from anyone.

527
00:53:22,221 --> 00:53:24,684
You leave, I'll send you behind bars.

528
00:53:24,804 --> 00:53:27,072
You've spent that much money
and you're worried about this amount?

529
00:53:27,096 --> 00:53:28,809
You know what worries me?

530
00:53:28,929 --> 00:53:30,839
The fact that I've sold my house
and invested it in this film.

531
00:53:30,863 --> 00:53:35,101
That Rastegar overlooked all these real
actors and gave a nobody like you this part.

532
00:53:35,221 --> 00:53:39,101
That's what worries me Mr. Shakib. I already
know the film will not make its money back.

533
00:53:39,221 --> 00:53:43,054
And this is the appreciation you show?

534
00:53:43,179 --> 00:53:46,851
What can I do? You tell me.
Show me a way.

535
00:53:46,971 --> 00:53:50,393
Go get things started with the 10 I
gave you. I'll give you the rest later.

536
00:53:50,513 --> 00:53:53,763
Here.
When?

537
00:53:53,929 --> 00:53:56,809
I will. Once things clear up
a bit I will pay the rest.

538
00:53:56,929 --> 00:54:01,763
It's for an operation,
add something to it.

539
00:54:41,138 --> 00:54:43,138
Did you get it?

540
00:54:46,013 --> 00:54:49,471
20 million now...

541
00:54:49,679 --> 00:54:53,763
80 million later.

542
00:54:54,513 --> 00:54:57,471
Farshid won't budge.

543
00:54:57,721 --> 00:55:01,513
I'll give him this check
and ask for more time.

544
00:55:01,721 --> 00:55:05,429
When they pay me the rest,
we can run away together.

545
00:55:06,013 --> 00:55:09,054
Let's just run away with this 20 million.

546
00:55:09,221 --> 00:55:15,226
Wait a few more days.
I'll get paid when I'm done with my job.

547
00:55:15,346 --> 00:55:18,596
Then we run away together.

548
00:55:41,929 --> 00:55:44,263
1, 2, 3, 4.

549
00:55:59,846 --> 00:56:02,268
Rest assured.
No one will come.

550
00:56:02,388 --> 00:56:07,846
Are you sure no one's around?
Everyone is gone. Hassan is gone too.

551
00:56:25,096 --> 00:56:27,096
Do you like it?

552
00:56:30,554 --> 00:56:32,554
I'll wait for you outside.

553
00:57:25,971 --> 00:57:30,138
Sell this and add it to the money.

554
00:57:30,638 --> 00:57:34,013
I thought they are all fake!

555
00:57:35,471 --> 00:57:40,179
Only this one is gold.
The rest are fake.

556
00:57:40,679 --> 00:57:44,929
Keep this for later.

557
00:58:00,804 --> 00:58:03,846
I lied to you.

558
00:58:06,513 --> 00:58:09,679
Farshid didn't want to drug me.

559
00:58:10,179 --> 00:58:13,096
Why did you lie then?

560
00:58:16,179 --> 00:58:18,971
I wanted to be with you.

561
00:58:19,554 --> 00:58:21,393
With me?

562
00:58:21,513 --> 00:58:23,804
Or that house?

563
00:58:27,679 --> 00:58:30,721
That house.

564
00:58:32,929 --> 00:58:35,804
That's what I wanted at first.

565
00:58:36,763 --> 00:58:39,393
But not anymore.

566
00:58:39,513 --> 00:58:42,096
Now, what do you want?

567
00:58:43,096 --> 00:58:45,096
You.

568
00:58:49,429 --> 00:58:52,101
You and that house.

569
00:58:52,221 --> 00:58:54,596
And a baby!

570
00:58:57,763 --> 00:59:00,846
Don't you want that?

571
00:59:05,221 --> 00:59:06,393
I...

572
00:59:06,513 --> 00:59:07,351
had it...

573
00:59:07,471 --> 00:59:09,184
all.

574
00:59:09,304 --> 00:59:11,559
I don't want it anymore.

575
00:59:11,679 --> 00:59:13,679
Why?

576
00:59:14,346 --> 00:59:18,304
I can't take good care of them.

577
00:59:19,179 --> 00:59:22,596
You've taken good care of me.

578
00:59:26,846 --> 00:59:30,679
I was pregnant once.

579
00:59:32,138 --> 00:59:35,513
But I never gave birth.

580
00:59:36,846 --> 00:59:40,804
It would've been nice
to see what the baby looked like.

581
00:59:41,221 --> 00:59:45,804
My son looked so much like me.

582
00:59:47,013 --> 00:59:54,221
He would call me ""Bib"" instead of ""Shakib"".

583
00:59:55,596 --> 00:59:57,596
Bib!

584
01:00:01,304 --> 01:00:07,184
When we leave this place, let's first go
to your hometown. Pay them a visit.

585
01:00:07,304 --> 01:00:14,846
I can't. My brother-in-laws don't let me
anywhere near their gravestones.

586
01:00:16,429 --> 01:00:19,304
Someone had told them...

587
01:00:19,504 --> 01:00:21,176
That Shakib...

588
01:00:21,296 --> 01:00:25,304
Ran away when the earthquake hit...

589
01:00:25,504 --> 01:00:29,263
And did not save his wife and kid.

590
01:00:30,138 --> 01:00:33,201
I was at work.

591
01:00:33,321 --> 01:00:37,304
I didn't run away.
I wasn't even home.

592
01:00:42,429 --> 01:00:46,054
But I want a baby.

593
01:00:53,513 --> 01:00:56,346
Two of them.

594
01:00:57,804 --> 01:01:00,971
Four!

595
01:02:46,471 --> 01:02:52,513
If I didn't get home by noon.
Go to the Police.

596
01:02:52,638 --> 01:02:57,554
You'll be back.
All Farshid cares about is money.

597
01:02:59,013 --> 01:03:01,743
You have some cash with you?
Yeah.

598
01:03:01,863 --> 01:03:06,013
Can you buy some sweets on your way back?

599
01:03:12,471 --> 01:03:17,554
Hassan, where are you? Mohammad, hurry up!
I'm on my way sir.

600
01:03:23,179 --> 01:03:27,243
I have to go sir. I have something to do.
Hurry up.

601
01:03:27,363 --> 01:03:29,909
We have a lot to do today.
You have to stick around.

602
01:03:30,029 --> 01:03:32,993
My mother is sick.
I had already told them.

603
01:03:33,113 --> 01:03:36,179
Who did you tell?
I told Mr Nosrati.

604
01:03:36,429 --> 01:03:43,138
At first you barely talked and now
you go around me to Nosrati.

605
01:03:53,429 --> 01:03:55,429
Hello Mr. Rahim.

606
01:03:56,721 --> 01:03:59,138
I'll be there in an hour.

607
01:04:01,221 --> 01:04:04,096
Yes sir.

608
01:04:08,554 --> 01:04:11,429
When can this check be cashed?
Today.

609
01:04:11,679 --> 01:04:13,679
What's this?

610
01:04:14,421 --> 01:04:17,043
It's only 20 million.
I couldn't get more.

611
01:04:17,163 --> 01:04:19,343
If you give me one more week
I'll get you the rest.

612
01:04:19,463 --> 01:04:21,968
I'm making more omelets, want some?
You have to ask?

613
01:04:22,088 --> 01:04:24,009
You want some?
No.

614
01:04:24,129 --> 01:04:26,129
So...

615
01:04:26,838 --> 01:04:28,551
What now?

616
01:04:28,671 --> 01:04:30,671
Whatever you say.

617
01:04:31,379 --> 01:04:34,259
You're right.
I should've come up with the money.

618
01:04:34,379 --> 01:04:39,254
If you give me a week I will-
What's in a week? I can't.

619
01:04:39,588 --> 01:04:43,671
Show me a way.
I say come up with the rest by tomorrow.

620
01:04:43,963 --> 01:04:47,671
Tomorrow… Who can come up with 80 in a day?
You.

621
01:04:47,796 --> 01:04:50,504
I don't have anyone to ask.

622
01:04:50,671 --> 01:04:56,129
How did you get the 20?
Come up with the rest the same way!

623
01:04:58,504 --> 01:05:03,088
What if I couldn't?
You can. Stay positive.

624
01:05:04,671 --> 01:05:06,609
Give me at least 3 days.

625
01:05:06,729 --> 01:05:08,729
Where's the omelette?

626
01:05:15,421 --> 01:05:17,551
No thanks.

627
01:05:17,671 --> 01:05:19,713
Take it.

628
01:05:20,338 --> 01:05:21,634
Thank you sir.

629
01:05:21,754 --> 01:05:25,004
The bus broke down.
Can you push?

630
01:05:25,546 --> 01:05:27,468
Push it, here we go!

631
01:05:27,588 --> 01:05:29,879
Push it!

632
01:05:34,504 --> 01:05:40,796
I can't do this.
Call a mechanic.

633
01:05:42,296 --> 01:05:45,129
What's the black smoke?

634
01:05:45,588 --> 01:05:48,629
It's that film shoot.

635
01:05:49,629 --> 01:05:52,296
They'll burn the jungle down!

636
01:09:18,254 --> 01:09:26,254
Can you not sit on the floor
with your uniform? I just ironed it.

637
01:09:27,463 --> 01:09:33,421
Can I use your phone to make a call?
Yeah.

638
01:09:33,921 --> 01:09:35,884
Sure.

639
01:09:36,004 --> 01:09:38,004
Here you go.

640
01:10:17,004 --> 01:10:19,004
Akbar.

641
01:10:19,754 --> 01:10:21,468
Akbar.

642
01:10:21,588 --> 01:10:24,963
What?
The power is out again.

643
01:10:25,213 --> 01:10:27,213
Wait a minute.

644
01:10:30,796 --> 01:10:34,213
Is it back on?
No.

645
01:10:39,713 --> 01:10:42,338
It's back on.

646
01:10:51,838 --> 01:10:53,838
What did you do?

647
01:10:54,354 --> 01:10:54,926
Shakib!

648
01:10:55,046 --> 01:10:57,046
Mr. Shakib!

649
01:10:57,421 --> 01:10:59,421
Ms. Zareh!

650
01:11:09,838 --> 01:11:12,921
No sir.
I wasn't even there.

651
01:11:13,171 --> 01:11:17,171
As soon as I got there,
we rushed him here.

652
01:11:18,338 --> 01:11:20,921
They're stitching him up.

653
01:11:21,546 --> 01:11:25,234
There's only one health clinic in town,
you won't miss it.

654
01:11:25,354 --> 01:11:28,171
Mr. Shakib. Are you feeling better?

655
01:11:30,588 --> 01:11:33,963
What got into you this morning?

656
01:11:35,379 --> 01:11:37,801
Did someone say something to you?

657
01:11:37,921 --> 01:11:40,088
Is your mother feeling better?

658
01:11:42,629 --> 01:11:44,840
Tell me if something has happned.

659
01:11:47,546 --> 01:11:49,879
Neda, step out please.

660
01:11:50,754 --> 01:11:55,129
I said step out.
Sir, can you give us a minute?

661
01:12:00,463 --> 01:12:04,421
What's gotten into you Shakib?
You've upset everyone.

662
01:12:04,963 --> 01:12:11,213
I had nothing to do with everyone.
You didn't? You're kidding me?

663
01:12:11,504 --> 01:12:14,693
Suicide may be nothing to you, but
people lose their shit when they see blood.

664
01:12:14,813 --> 01:12:17,343
The makeup room looks
like a slaughterhouse.

665
01:12:17,463 --> 01:12:21,759
You killed someone and I'm the one
who turned it into a slaughterhouse?

666
01:12:21,879 --> 01:12:26,254
We killed someone?
Who did we kill?

667
01:12:27,463 --> 01:12:32,879
Someone was in that house.
When? Who was in the house?

668
01:12:33,338 --> 01:12:36,629
When you blew the house up,
someone was inside.

669
01:12:40,379 --> 01:12:46,004
That's enough. Your stitches will come off.
Just tell me where she was.

670
01:12:46,129 --> 01:12:49,593
Shakib, that's enough!
Tell me where she was.

671
01:12:49,713 --> 01:12:52,284
Down here.
Down here where? Show me exactly.

672
01:12:52,404 --> 01:12:53,759
Right here.

673
01:12:53,879 --> 01:12:58,468
This is not something you and I could do.
We need heavy duty machinery.

674
01:12:58,588 --> 01:13:02,593
I'm talking to you. Let's go!
We'll come back in the morning.

675
01:13:02,713 --> 01:13:05,843
We can't.
They'll come after her in the morning.

676
01:13:05,963 --> 01:13:09,568
Who will come after her?
Didn't you say no one knows?

677
01:13:09,688 --> 01:13:15,296
The people I paid to
keep from coming after her.

678
01:13:16,671 --> 01:13:20,379
Shakib, what have you done?
Who was this girl?

679
01:13:20,629 --> 01:13:25,093
Please, come search for her.
You've ruined my life.

680
01:13:25,213 --> 01:13:30,463
My life has gone up in flames.
Your life has?!

681
01:13:30,879 --> 01:13:34,693
You fucking asshole,
is your life in ruins or mine?

682
01:13:34,813 --> 01:13:38,343
Is your future up in flames or mine?
No one even knows you!

683
01:13:38,463 --> 01:13:43,468
Who will be held responsible? You or me?!
You will return to your goddamn doghouse,

684
01:13:43,588 --> 01:13:46,143
And live your shitty
life until you drop dead.

685
01:13:46,263 --> 01:13:48,434
It's my life that's on the line here.

686
01:13:48,554 --> 01:13:52,384
I'll go to the police.
Over my dead body.

687
01:13:52,504 --> 01:13:58,009
I swear to God I will pour gas on you
and set you on fire. I fucking will.

688
01:13:58,129 --> 01:14:01,509
You'll do as I say.
You'll go back to the hotel

689
01:14:01,629 --> 01:14:03,718
We'll come in the morning
and we'll look for her.

690
01:14:03,838 --> 01:14:06,843
If we find her, we'll go to the police
and we'll cancel the shoot.

691
01:14:06,963 --> 01:14:12,713
But if we don't find her here, you'll get
back to work and finish your goddamn job.

692
01:14:18,146 --> 01:14:20,176
Can I have a room?
A small one or a big one?

693
01:14:20,296 --> 01:14:24,676
It doesn't matter. Take him and
make sure he has everything he needs.

694
01:14:24,796 --> 01:14:28,009
Have a PA watch over him.

695
01:14:28,129 --> 01:14:31,921
Where were you?
Don't worry about it.

696
01:14:32,088 --> 01:14:33,426
Hurry up!

697
01:14:33,546 --> 01:14:38,921
Shakib, are you feeling better?
- Yes. He's better than both of us. Let's go.

698
01:14:39,879 --> 01:14:42,559
Shakib, tell them if you need something.

699
01:14:43,338 --> 01:14:46,963
Check in on him every two minutes.

700
01:14:47,129 --> 01:14:50,796
Is Rastegar still in his room?
I think so.

701
01:15:03,963 --> 01:15:06,754
Emad, get back to work.

702
01:15:07,129 --> 01:15:10,259
Sina. Will you spend the night here?
Yes sir.

703
01:15:10,379 --> 01:15:12,504
Open the door.

704
01:15:12,796 --> 01:15:14,593
Open it already.

705
01:15:14,713 --> 01:15:20,129
I need some time alone with Shakib.
Close the door.

706
01:15:24,379 --> 01:15:27,926
What's that guy's name?
Farshid.

707
01:15:28,046 --> 01:15:30,213
What's his address?

708
01:15:30,421 --> 01:15:32,504
Why do you want it?

709
01:15:32,629 --> 01:15:38,796
So I can pay him off and beg him
to not show up on the set tomorrow.

710
01:15:41,629 --> 01:15:44,796
Why are you staring at me?
Tell me already.

711
01:15:54,879 --> 01:15:58,129
Mr. Shakib, do you need anything?

712
01:16:01,588 --> 01:16:05,338
Mr. Shakib, are you alright?

713
01:16:14,421 --> 01:16:19,254
Mr. Shakib, get in the car.
Shakib, come here.

714
01:17:04,296 --> 01:17:08,801
What are they doing?
They're searching, what else?

715
01:17:08,921 --> 01:17:13,588
Why didn't they tell us?
What difference does it make?

716
01:17:21,713 --> 01:17:25,759
What was that truck's load?
The big pieces of burnt wood.

717
01:17:25,879 --> 01:17:30,296
How long have they been searching?
It's been a few hours.

718
01:17:31,921 --> 01:17:34,213
Shakib. Shakib!

719
01:17:34,513 --> 01:17:36,113
Shakib, wait a minute!
What're you doing?

720
01:17:36,171 --> 01:17:38,593
Wait!
You think I'm an idiot?

721
01:17:38,713 --> 01:17:42,134
Last night you said
we'll come and search together.

722
01:17:42,254 --> 01:17:45,009
I brought in excavators.
They went through the whole place.

723
01:17:45,129 --> 01:17:49,843
She's not here. She must've escaped.
How are you so sure? We just got here!

724
01:17:49,963 --> 01:17:53,468
I've been in touch with Hassan.
How're you so sure?

725
01:17:53,588 --> 01:17:58,754
Listen to me.
What are you doing? Get out.

726
01:17:58,921 --> 01:18:03,843
Get off! Go away!
What the hell are you doing?

727
01:18:03,963 --> 01:18:07,338
Don't touch his face!
We need it for the shoot.

728
01:18:08,004 --> 01:18:11,134
You assholes.
Let go of him.

729
01:18:11,254 --> 01:18:13,921
Emad!
Let him go!

730
01:18:14,963 --> 01:18:17,213
Please stop!

731
01:18:17,671 --> 01:18:22,384
What's wrong with you boy?!
Are you mental?! Why are you doing this?

732
01:18:22,504 --> 01:18:26,004
Ask him why he cleared this place up?

733
01:18:26,671 --> 01:18:30,426
Ask him why he cleared this place up?
- I told him to. What's it got to do with him?

734
01:18:30,546 --> 01:18:34,605
It's absurd! You want me to not grab my shot because
you want to say goodbye to the remains of the house?

735
01:18:34,629 --> 01:18:36,759
Someone died here.
Did you know that?

736
01:18:36,879 --> 01:18:39,384
Someone was burned in this house,
did you know that?

737
01:18:39,504 --> 01:18:42,296
You all burned her alive, all of you!

738
01:18:42,421 --> 01:18:46,551
When did we ever disrespect you that you

739
01:18:46,671 --> 01:18:51,343
You never respected me. Having us dead
or alive doesn't make a difference to you

740
01:18:51,463 --> 01:18:53,676
No one cares if we're dead or alive.

741
01:18:53,796 --> 01:18:57,926
Why wouldn't we care?
Then how come no one does anything?

742
01:18:58,046 --> 01:18:59,926
Someone has died in there.

743
01:19:00,046 --> 01:19:06,379
Couldn't they hear all of us shouting?
She was deaf. She couldn't hear.

744
01:19:07,379 --> 01:19:11,801
Where's the corpse right now then?
- The corpse has a name. She was a human being.

745
01:19:11,921 --> 01:19:14,879
So where is she right now?
Ask him.

746
01:19:15,629 --> 01:19:19,551
You son-of-a-bitch.
You want me to tell on you?!

747
01:19:19,671 --> 01:19:23,134
What is he talking about? You knew about this?
- Of course I did.

748
01:19:23,254 --> 01:19:26,134
Last night he brought me here
to search for a non-existent body.

749
01:19:26,254 --> 01:19:30,759
I knew he was lying to rip me off again
but I agreed to help him.

750
01:19:30,879 --> 01:19:34,801
I haven't slept all night I brought all
these people here to search for her.

751
01:19:34,921 --> 01:19:39,259
So what happened? Did you find something?
Are you out of your mind? Of course not!

752
01:19:39,379 --> 01:19:43,301
He cleared everything up to cover it up.

753
01:19:43,421 --> 01:19:45,426
Shut your mouth asshole!

754
01:19:45,546 --> 01:19:49,301
He has cleared everything up.
He said we'll come and search together.

755
01:19:49,421 --> 01:19:55,218
Didn't we?
He wants you to believe no one was here.

756
01:19:55,338 --> 01:19:58,843
I asked Hassan to tell
me if he found something.

757
01:19:58,963 --> 01:20:01,426
Didn't you say we shouldn't tell anyone?

758
01:20:01,546 --> 01:20:06,171
I only said shut your mouth
until we actually find a body.

759
01:20:06,421 --> 01:20:08,564
I'm not a murderer.
I wouldn't keep quiet if I saw a body.

760
01:20:08,588 --> 01:20:16,343
Couldn't you have him do the search himself?
- He's suicidal! I was worried.

761
01:20:16,463 --> 01:20:19,189
Why did you clear this place up?
Didn't we have a scene to shoot here?

762
01:20:19,213 --> 01:20:23,926
He told me to and I did.
Who told you? It's my job. No one else's.

763
01:20:24,046 --> 01:20:28,171
Neda, don't talk to me like that.
Rastegar told me to.

764
01:20:28,379 --> 01:20:31,968
Mr. Rastegar, you told him to clear this
place out? Didn't we have a scene here?

765
01:20:32,088 --> 01:20:35,468
Mr. Shakib. You have ruined the film!

766
01:20:35,588 --> 01:20:38,509
First you tried to kill yourself
with a pair of scissors.

767
01:20:38,629 --> 01:20:42,426
The crew has been on the edge ever since.

768
01:20:42,546 --> 01:20:44,397
Everyone is sick to their
stomach because of you.

769
01:20:44,421 --> 01:20:47,926
And now you're lying and
making wild accusations?

770
01:20:48,046 --> 01:20:55,301
Just because I'm illiterate and you grabbed me off
the streets doesn't mean everything I say is a lie.

771
01:20:55,421 --> 01:20:59,843
You want me to tell them what you
were really up to in that house?

772
01:20:59,963 --> 01:21:02,801
A bunch of random ass
people would come and go.

773
01:21:02,921 --> 01:21:05,843
Shakib, did you know someone was here?

774
01:21:05,963 --> 01:21:10,093
She was hiding here,
because she was afraid.

775
01:21:10,213 --> 01:21:11,843
Why didn't you send her away?

776
01:21:11,963 --> 01:21:15,634
No one bothered to tell me
they're blowing up the house.

777
01:21:15,754 --> 01:21:17,676
He's full of shit.
Everybody knew!

778
01:21:17,796 --> 01:21:20,926
Weren't you there when
we were moving in the gas canisters?

779
01:21:21,046 --> 01:21:26,093
You were helping us. Didn't I tell you it's the explosion.
- You're lying.

780
01:21:26,213 --> 01:21:27,926
Stop!
Stop!

781
01:21:28,046 --> 01:21:32,051
Fine, he didn't know.
What about afterwards?

782
01:21:32,171 --> 01:21:35,218
Weren't you here when
the house was on fire?

783
01:21:35,338 --> 01:21:38,968
Why didn't you say anything then?
Are you also a mute who can't talk?!

784
01:21:39,088 --> 01:21:41,838
I was in shock.

785
01:21:42,796 --> 01:21:44,676
I swear I will kill him.

786
01:21:44,796 --> 01:21:46,796
Let go of him.

787
01:21:56,088 --> 01:21:57,384
Tell him to dump his load.

788
01:21:57,504 --> 01:21:59,713
I told you to stop.

789
01:22:01,838 --> 01:22:03,718
Tell him to dump it.

790
01:22:03,838 --> 01:22:07,188
Just let him go through it to make sure!
Dump it!

791
01:22:13,629 --> 01:22:19,629
Mr. Shakib you looked everywhere.
She's not here.

792
01:22:20,171 --> 01:22:20,926
Come over here.

793
01:22:21,046 --> 01:22:23,671
That's enough.
Turn off the engine.

794
01:22:24,088 --> 01:22:26,088
Turn it off.

795
01:22:28,963 --> 01:22:32,213
What're you doing?
Come over here.

796
01:22:32,504 --> 01:22:33,509
Shakib!

797
01:22:33,629 --> 01:22:37,147
Have the other dump trucks come back.
- Trucks? It's just this one and the one that left.

798
01:22:37,171 --> 01:22:38,801
It must've been at least 20 truck loads.

799
01:22:38,921 --> 01:22:40,921
Come over here.

800
01:23:11,504 --> 01:23:13,504
You're killing him!

801
01:23:24,379 --> 01:23:26,379
Get off!

802
01:23:29,213 --> 01:23:31,213
Start the car!

803
01:23:32,879 --> 01:23:34,634
I'll take him to the clinic.
Let's go.

804
01:23:34,754 --> 01:23:37,926
I won't come to the clinic.
It's not up to you. You're bleeding.

805
01:23:38,046 --> 01:23:43,093
Where's Nosrati?
- What do you want? You want to beat him up again?

806
01:23:43,213 --> 01:23:49,634
Your people are the ones who beat me up.
- Of course. You hit their friends and they came to defend them.

807
01:23:49,754 --> 01:23:53,713
Everyone who walked by me, kicked me.

808
01:23:54,921 --> 01:23:58,713
It's easier for you to beat
me than to listen to me..

809
01:23:59,129 --> 01:24:03,819
Why should there even be a fight?
You have a problem, go to the police.

810
01:24:04,296 --> 01:24:11,879
Mr. Shakib. Sometimes being alone gets to us.
Are you sure someone was there with you?

811
01:24:12,504 --> 01:24:14,504
Saeed?

812
01:24:16,254 --> 01:24:19,338
Not right now.
He's bleeding.

813
01:24:19,754 --> 01:24:22,754
I'm taking him to the clinic.

814
01:24:23,754 --> 01:24:26,843
I won't come to the clinic.
What?

815
01:24:26,963 --> 01:24:29,546
How did you know?

816
01:24:30,338 --> 01:24:32,338
Okay.

817
01:24:33,921 --> 01:24:36,801
Let's go to the hotel.

818
01:24:36,921 --> 01:24:40,796
Nosrati says he has news from that girl.

819
01:25:05,504 --> 01:25:08,759
Look at what you've done to yourself
and this goddamn project.

820
01:25:08,879 --> 01:25:10,921
Nosrati, give him a call.

821
01:25:14,421 --> 01:25:16,421
Who are you calling?

822
01:25:26,813 --> 01:25:29,093
Yeah?
How're you Mr. Farshid?

823
01:25:29,213 --> 01:25:33,384
I'm all right.
- Can you talk? I want to talk about that girl, Ladan.

824
01:25:33,504 --> 01:25:36,968
Go ahead.
Can you repeat the things you told me?

825
01:25:37,088 --> 01:25:39,426
I already told you everything.

826
01:25:39,546 --> 01:25:42,343
I'm sorry bro.
I need you to tell me one more time.

827
01:25:42,463 --> 01:25:45,468
She's back.
You mean she's over there right now?

828
01:25:45,588 --> 01:25:50,343
I don't have to explain anything to you.
Can you tell me when she got back?

829
01:25:50,463 --> 01:25:54,134
You asked me to tell you
when she's back and I did.

830
01:25:54,254 --> 01:25:59,009
It doesn't mean you get to call me
to ask follow-up questions.

831
01:25:59,129 --> 01:26:03,088
Thanks man. See Shakib.
He says she's back.

832
01:26:03,504 --> 01:26:05,504
Shakib!

833
01:26:06,046 --> 01:26:08,593
He's not feeling well,
we have to take him to the hospital.

834
01:26:08,713 --> 01:26:10,713
Get some water.

835
01:26:12,421 --> 01:26:14,421
Shakib.

836
01:26:14,588 --> 01:26:16,468
Hurry up!

837
01:26:16,588 --> 01:26:18,921
Drink some water.

838
01:26:23,254 --> 01:26:26,551
Shakib, why do you think
I'm your sworn enemy?

839
01:26:26,671 --> 01:26:28,718
I swear I feel for you man.

840
01:26:28,838 --> 01:26:31,759
You have no idea what
awaits you after this film.

841
01:26:31,879 --> 01:26:33,759
You let a bunch of
animals take you for a ride.

842
01:26:33,879 --> 01:26:35,968
Who was that?
What's his relationship to her?

843
01:26:36,088 --> 01:26:37,759
He knows.

844
01:26:37,879 --> 01:26:41,509
I know their type.
They're only after money.

845
01:26:41,629 --> 01:26:46,176
This girl grew up with them. They
were a gang who tried to screw you over.

846
01:26:46,296 --> 01:26:50,634
You think a runaway girl and a guy who
makes money with her can be compassionate?

847
01:26:50,754 --> 01:26:53,968
If she really loved you,
why didn't she leave him before?

848
01:26:54,088 --> 01:26:57,176
Why did she run away the second
she learned you're acting in a movie?

849
01:26:57,296 --> 01:27:00,926
Because they knew you will be
famous soon and you still don't.

850
01:27:01,046 --> 01:27:04,134
She saw the house and thought
she hit the jackpot.

851
01:27:04,254 --> 01:27:09,634
She didn't know it was a set. She told
that guy and they came to screw you over.

852
01:27:09,754 --> 01:27:13,504
How much did you pay Farshid?
80 million.

853
01:27:14,796 --> 01:27:17,588
If she's back,
why did you pay him?

854
01:27:17,879 --> 01:27:22,051
I paid him last night. He called
me just now to say that she's back.

855
01:27:22,171 --> 01:27:26,593
You paid him to forget about Ladan. Otherwise
you would've gotten your money back.

856
01:27:26,713 --> 01:27:30,718
I can't get my money back from
that vulture! Think before you speak!

857
01:27:30,838 --> 01:27:35,796
Where did you bury her?
- God damn it, he's in a different universe!

858
01:27:36,421 --> 01:27:38,093
Saeed, tell me if something has happened.

859
01:27:38,213 --> 01:27:41,718
I won't back down until you tell me where she is.
- You won't back down?!

860
01:27:41,838 --> 01:27:46,343
Do I have to remind you who you were?
I was a nobody and I'm still a nobody.

861
01:27:46,463 --> 01:27:48,009
Were you a nobody?

862
01:27:48,129 --> 01:27:50,051
Then make the decision
to become a somebody.

863
01:27:50,171 --> 01:27:55,218
Instead of bumming around the brothels,
try to build a life for yourself.

864
01:27:55,338 --> 01:27:59,051
I thought someone was
really dead Mr. Shakib.

865
01:27:59,171 --> 01:28:01,926
I now realize that you don't
have what it takes to do this job.

866
01:28:02,046 --> 01:28:04,218
I was wrong about you.

867
01:28:04,338 --> 01:28:08,634
Nosrati, let's wrap his scenes and then
send him off to do whatever he wants.

868
01:28:08,754 --> 01:28:10,218
Yes, sir.

869
01:28:10,338 --> 01:28:12,176
I don't want to work anymore.

870
01:28:12,296 --> 01:28:16,843
Truth is, I don't want to work with you anymore
either but we have no choice but to continue.

871
01:28:16,963 --> 01:28:18,855
So finish your job or else
there will be consequences.

872
01:28:18,879 --> 01:28:22,634
Don't threaten me. I'm not afraid of
anything. I have nothing more to lose.

873
01:28:22,754 --> 01:28:27,551
You never had anything. Don't talk
as if we took anything away from you.

874
01:28:27,671 --> 01:28:30,801
I wouldn't even be talking to you
if I wasn't stuck in the middle of my film.

875
01:28:30,921 --> 01:28:33,343
You have no choice but to finish the job.

876
01:28:33,463 --> 01:28:35,103
Who are you to tell me what I have to do?

877
01:28:35,129 --> 01:28:37,301
I'm the guy who put clothes on your back.

878
01:28:37,421 --> 01:28:38,426
Immortalized you.

879
01:28:38,546 --> 01:28:40,546
I'm that guy!

880
01:28:41,296 --> 01:28:45,522
Set foot outside of here...
- Mr. Rastegar, wait a second and I'll use your contract to put you behind bars.

881
01:28:45,546 --> 01:28:49,884
He should be in the hospital,
not here where you can threaten him.

882
01:28:50,004 --> 01:28:54,426
Saeed, tell me if you've done something wrong.
- Oh God!

883
01:28:54,546 --> 01:28:57,134
What're you blabbering
about with that nonsense?

884
01:28:57,254 --> 01:28:59,176
What kind of language is that?

885
01:28:59,296 --> 01:29:02,314
What're you suggesting with “something wrong?!""
Did I say you've done something wrong?

886
01:29:02,338 --> 01:29:05,676
I was talking to Saeed.
Why did you take it personally?

887
01:29:05,796 --> 01:29:08,134
Are you also in on this?
What do you mean?

888
01:29:08,254 --> 01:29:09,593
It's clear what I mean.

889
01:29:09,713 --> 01:29:13,009
How is it that we were planning
on shooting such an important scene

890
01:29:13,129 --> 01:29:17,301
You insisted that we fence off the rubble
so not even a cat can get through

891
01:29:17,421 --> 01:29:21,421
and then you tell Saeed
to go clear everything out?!

892
01:29:21,546 --> 01:29:23,801
You think you're a grownup now
and can question me?!

893
01:29:23,921 --> 01:29:28,759
What are you hiding? Saeed doesn't
lift a finger without your permission.

894
01:29:28,879 --> 01:29:33,843
You're making a movie at what cost?
- It's my fault for giving nobodies like you a chance.

895
01:29:33,963 --> 01:29:35,593
Get your things and go back to Tehran.

896
01:29:35,713 --> 01:29:38,926
I don't want to see you again.
You'll never amount to much in life.

897
01:29:39,046 --> 01:29:41,759
I would rather stay a nobody than
to turn into someone like you.

898
01:29:41,879 --> 01:29:44,634
Saeed, don't worry if
Shakib doesn't come back.

899
01:29:44,754 --> 01:29:48,921
Rastegar can play that role just fine.
He'll fit right in.

900
01:29:50,004 --> 01:29:53,218
I'll wait for Shakib to go see if
this girl is there or not.

901
01:29:53,338 --> 01:29:57,827
If she's there, great.
If not, I will personally go to the police.

902
01:30:16,379 --> 01:30:20,343
What're you doing?
Get down from there.

903
01:30:20,463 --> 01:30:23,634
Where are they?
I don't know where they are.

904
01:30:23,754 --> 01:30:26,009
They suddenly moved out.

905
01:30:26,129 --> 01:30:28,259
Shakib, come here.

906
01:30:28,379 --> 01:30:30,843
Do you know him?
He's a friend. Thanks.

907
01:30:30,963 --> 01:30:33,968
Tell Ladan to come here.
Hop on.

908
01:30:34,088 --> 01:30:39,218
Tell Ladan to come before I shout-
Don't you want to go see Ladan? Hop on.

909
01:30:39,338 --> 01:30:41,338
Hop on!

910
01:30:57,838 --> 01:30:59,838
Come.

911
01:31:01,379 --> 01:31:03,134
You brought me here to kill me.

912
01:31:03,254 --> 01:31:06,551
You're the one getting us killed.
Just forget about it.

913
01:31:06,671 --> 01:31:10,259
You threaten us in the neighborhood?
Didn't you say she's back? Where is she?

914
01:31:10,379 --> 01:31:14,301
Forget what I said.
She's not with me.

915
01:31:14,421 --> 01:31:17,759
I don't know where in hell she is.
She ran away and came to you.

916
01:31:17,879 --> 01:31:20,884
And now she's at some other shithole.
You bastard.

917
01:31:21,004 --> 01:31:24,801
Call me whatever you want,
but hear me out.

918
01:31:24,921 --> 01:31:30,176
Nosrati came over with that director and
some well-connected guy and threatened me.

919
01:31:30,296 --> 01:31:35,843
I swear they turned my life upside down.
I had to move out of that place.

920
01:31:35,963 --> 01:31:39,384
If they turn me in I'll get executed.
He'll get executed.

921
01:31:39,504 --> 01:31:46,046
Whoever has set foot in that house
will get fucked. Including yourself.

922
01:31:46,754 --> 01:31:49,468
You helped that girl run away and
then you killed her.

923
01:31:49,588 --> 01:31:51,933
I killed her?
Then who killed her?

924
01:31:52,129 --> 01:31:56,218
What if I tell the police she was my wife?
You asshole

925
01:31:56,338 --> 01:32:00,421
A temporary marriage
with him as my witness.

926
01:32:00,546 --> 01:32:02,718
Should I claim that you kidnapped my wife?

927
01:32:02,838 --> 01:32:05,259
Just forget about it Shakib.
Don't make things any worse.

928
01:32:05,379 --> 01:32:11,009
Ladan has been with me since she was a kid.
She has no parents, no nobody.

929
01:32:11,129 --> 01:32:15,801
When I say she's not around, it means she's not.
When you insist that she is, she comes back to life.

930
01:32:15,921 --> 01:32:18,730
They'll come looking for her, they'll ask
who was she, what was she, where was she?!

931
01:32:18,754 --> 01:32:22,634
I'm going to the police station.
Who is this guy?! Shakib!

932
01:32:22,754 --> 01:32:24,754
Shakib!

933
01:32:27,796 --> 01:32:31,676
Hey man! If you're going to the police
station, take your contract with you.

934
01:32:31,796 --> 01:32:32,676
Here.

935
01:32:32,796 --> 01:32:35,676
You've committed to do your job
or else pay me for damages.

936
01:32:35,796 --> 01:32:38,259
Do you have 23 billion tomans
or should I send you to jail?

937
01:32:38,379 --> 01:32:40,189
You've killed someone
and you're discussing money?

938
01:32:40,213 --> 01:32:43,013
We're saying she wasn't there,
you're the one who insists that she was!

939
01:32:43,088 --> 01:32:43,859
Fine.

940
01:32:43,979 --> 01:32:48,734
Let's go to the station and see whose word they believe.
- Your word over mine. You're more powerful.

941
01:32:48,854 --> 01:32:54,176
No man. It's not about power. It's about the
law. You lied. You were hiding someone there.

942
01:32:54,296 --> 01:32:59,218
And then the day of the fire you came up
with an excuse and ran away.

943
01:32:59,338 --> 01:33:01,776
An excuse?
Yes. An excuse.

944
01:33:01,896 --> 01:33:03,376
You lied to me too.

945
01:33:03,496 --> 01:33:06,043
You told me you wanted
money for your sick mother.

946
01:33:06,163 --> 01:33:09,859
My lawyer looked into it and learned that
your mother died 12 years ago.

947
01:33:09,979 --> 01:33:15,171
Plus you're claiming that no one told you
we were burning the house down...

948
01:33:18,713 --> 01:33:22,331
63 people have signed
a statement saying that you knew.

949
01:33:24,296 --> 01:33:27,046
This is the whole crew.
All of them.

950
01:33:29,254 --> 01:33:35,713
My final word. Either you come
back in to work or I will press charges.

951
01:34:44,996 --> 01:34:46,996
How many of them were there?

952
01:34:47,921 --> 01:34:49,921
Many.

953
01:34:50,838 --> 01:34:57,129
You mean you were just walking in the street
and suddenly a hundred people attacked you?!

954
01:34:59,463 --> 01:35:02,379
Did you get into a fight over that girl?

955
01:35:05,421 --> 01:35:07,421
Shakib...

956
01:35:07,588 --> 01:35:10,838
You can't find a life
partner from a brothel.

957
01:35:11,088 --> 01:35:14,093
You're destroying yourself
with your own hands.

958
01:35:14,213 --> 01:35:16,338
Are you there?
Yes.

959
01:35:16,538 --> 01:35:18,546
Javad?
I'm coming.

960
01:36:23,454 --> 01:36:25,454
What happened Mr. Shakib?

961
01:36:25,713 --> 01:36:28,046
Did you see her?
I did.

962
01:36:28,246 --> 01:36:30,463
Wait.

963
01:36:31,338 --> 01:36:35,509
Was she really there? Or are you
saying that because you're afraid of them?

964
01:36:35,629 --> 01:36:38,338
I said I saw her, didn't I?

965
01:37:13,879 --> 01:37:17,384
I don't know the language.
Trim it more.

966
01:37:17,504 --> 01:37:19,276
I don't know Arabic.
Shorter.

967
01:37:19,396 --> 01:37:22,968
Just do a count and they'll dub over it.
But I don't look like Saddam at all.

968
01:37:23,088 --> 01:37:24,718
Sina. Sina!
It doesn't matter.

969
01:37:24,838 --> 01:37:29,379
Mr. Shakib is here.
Come here Shakib. Sit down right here.

970
01:37:30,713 --> 01:37:34,963
Sir, can you come here please?

971
01:37:36,671 --> 01:37:44,671
How long does it take?
- Once we're done with Hitler, your chapter begins.

972
01:38:17,629 --> 01:38:20,218
Cut. That was good.
Set up the next shot.

973
01:38:20,338 --> 01:38:25,046
Let's take a break,
one last scene and then you're done.

974
01:38:25,713 --> 01:38:28,546
Please go to the gas chamber.
Thanks.

975
01:38:30,546 --> 01:38:32,546
Yes dear?

976
01:38:32,754 --> 01:38:36,718
What is it?
- I would like to return this bracelet to its owner.

977
01:38:36,838 --> 01:38:40,671
Give that to the costume department.

978
01:38:40,796 --> 01:38:45,129
Do you know if this is gold?
I have no idea.

979
01:38:46,129 --> 01:38:52,759
Where did you find this?
- In the rubble of the house, when I was working there.

980
01:38:52,879 --> 01:38:57,588
I want to know if this is gold or not.

981
01:39:00,254 --> 01:39:03,213
I found it in the rubble.

982
01:40:24,171 --> 01:40:26,171
Help.

983
01:40:26,463 --> 01:40:28,176
Help us!

984
01:40:28,296 --> 01:40:30,296
Open the door!

985
01:40:43,213 --> 01:40:44,926
Sepideh?
Yeah?

986
01:40:45,046 --> 01:40:48,551
Is Shakib over there?
Yes, he's here.

987
01:40:48,671 --> 01:40:51,963
Did we break for lunch?
Yeah you can go too.

988
01:40:54,004 --> 01:40:58,384
This guy wants to see you, don't meet up
with any more strangers here.

989
01:40:58,504 --> 01:41:01,338
Here you go sir.
Thanks.

990
01:41:02,463 --> 01:41:06,588
This is the thanks I get?
How could you betray me?

991
01:41:06,963 --> 01:41:09,754
Were you always a thief?

992
01:41:10,796 --> 01:41:16,379
Only you knew I keep the poison
in that safe. Why did you steal it?

993
01:41:16,879 --> 01:41:20,218
You son-of-a-bitch I'm responsible for
every ounce of that thing.

994
01:41:20,338 --> 01:41:22,926
A pinch of it would
kill hundreds of people.

995
01:41:23,046 --> 01:41:24,734
Empty your pockets!

996
01:41:24,854 --> 01:41:27,693
I said empty your pockets!
Hurry!

997
01:41:27,813 --> 01:41:31,546
I said empty your pockets!
Hurry!

998
01:41:34,713 --> 01:41:36,879
Oh dear God!

999
01:41:37,254 --> 01:41:40,088
This is empty!

1000
01:41:41,338 --> 01:41:44,296
Who did you give all this poison to?

1001
01:41:45,296 --> 01:41:49,421
Shakib, my whole body is shaking.

1002
01:41:51,171 --> 01:41:53,838
Did you kill someone?

1003
01:41:54,921 --> 01:41:58,588
Do you have a problem with them?

1004
01:42:00,504 --> 01:42:03,509
Bastard!
Bastard!

1005
01:42:03,629 --> 01:42:07,838
Someone open the door!
Help!

1006
01:44:28,963 --> 01:44:30,484
Get some water.
Water! Water!

1007
01:44:30,604 --> 01:44:33,504
Why did she fall too?

1008
01:44:34,754 --> 01:44:38,171
She's throwing up blood.

1009
01:44:38,463 --> 01:44:41,379
Someone call for help.

1010
01:44:43,796 --> 01:44:47,088
What's happening?

1011
01:44:47,963 --> 01:44:49,963
Help!

1012
01:44:51,754 --> 01:44:55,901
I don't know.
They're throwing up blood.

1013
01:44:56,021 --> 01:44:58,218
Who was the cook?

1014
01:44:58,338 --> 01:45:01,088
Help us.

00:01:22,665 --> 00:01:23,917
Don't talk to him.

2
00:01:24,542 --> 00:01:25,794
He's a scumbag peddler.

3
00:01:37,472 --> 00:01:38,765
Nice to meet you, sir.

4
00:01:39,808 --> 00:01:41,476
I'm Kang Hochang, a lawyer.

5
00:01:42,018 --> 00:01:46,064
My counsel team just left.

6
00:01:46,648 --> 00:01:48,483
They're getting things ready
for your trial.

7
00:01:48,566 --> 00:01:50,610
I specialize in inmate consultations.

8
00:01:51,194 --> 00:01:52,070
I see.

9
00:01:53,029 --> 00:01:55,740
These buttons keep giving me problems.

10
00:01:55,824 --> 00:01:58,618
Every time I stand up,
my shirt gapes open.

11
00:01:58,701 --> 00:02:00,453
""Get buttons replaced.""

12
00:02:01,746 --> 00:02:03,456
This uniform. It's lousy.

13
00:02:03,998 --> 00:02:05,375
Lousy, okay.

14
00:02:05,959 --> 00:02:08,169
Lousy. Replace fabric.

15
00:02:08,253 --> 00:02:10,296
-If you go to my office,
-Yes, sir.

16
00:02:10,839 --> 00:02:13,174
The Times should've arrived.
Make sure you bring me that.

17
00:02:13,258 --> 00:02:15,844
-Sure.
-There's a Bible on my desk.

18
00:02:15,927 --> 00:02:17,011
Bi…

19
00:02:18,221 --> 00:02:19,597
A Bible? Okay.

20
00:02:20,306 --> 00:02:21,891
THE TIMES, BIBLE

21
00:02:21,975 --> 00:02:24,352
Is there anything else you need?

22
00:02:33,695 --> 00:02:34,946
Hello, this is Kang Hochang.

23
00:02:38,283 --> 00:02:39,242
Pardon?

24
00:03:14,277 --> 00:03:15,486
Hello, sir.

25
00:03:17,989 --> 00:03:19,616
I'm Hangyeol's father.

26
00:03:19,699 --> 00:03:20,909
Nice to meet you.

27
00:03:22,785 --> 00:03:24,120
Do I look like a teacher to you?

28
00:03:24,704 --> 00:03:25,622
Excuse me?

29
00:03:27,665 --> 00:03:29,834
I must've missed the mark
with today's outfit.

30
00:03:31,169 --> 00:03:32,462
I'm a parent too.

31
00:03:34,964 --> 00:03:36,591
Oh, I see.

32
00:03:42,847 --> 00:03:44,599
So why did they call us here?

33
00:03:44,682 --> 00:03:47,435
No clue. They called me here
but haven't said why.

34
00:03:48,269 --> 00:03:50,230
Did the kids get into a fight?

35
00:03:51,940 --> 00:03:53,650
What's your son's name?

36
00:03:54,651 --> 00:03:55,944
Do Yoonjae.

37
00:03:56,027 --> 00:03:58,321
Yoonjae? Yoonjae…

38
00:03:58,821 --> 00:04:02,033
It's only natural for boys
to get into fights sometimes.

39
00:04:02,116 --> 00:04:05,954
That's how they grow and mature.
Wouldn't you say?

40
00:04:06,537 --> 00:04:07,830
Some kids might be like that.

41
00:04:09,082 --> 00:04:12,377
But Yoonjae isn't the type to hit anyone.

42
00:04:12,460 --> 00:04:13,836
He's gentle, you see.

43
00:04:23,846 --> 00:04:25,139
Hello.

44
00:04:26,349 --> 00:04:28,059
I'm the Grade 8 Class 3 homeroom teacher.

45
00:04:28,851 --> 00:04:32,188
Oh, hello. I'm Hangyeol's father.

46
00:04:32,272 --> 00:04:33,648
-Nice to meet you.
-Hello.

47
00:04:41,739 --> 00:04:44,117
Would you like coffee or green tea?

48
00:04:45,034 --> 00:04:46,160
Coffee, please.

49
00:04:48,496 --> 00:04:49,455
Thank you.

50
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:01,342
I should've come by sooner to say hello,
but I've been so busy.

51
00:05:01,426 --> 00:05:02,760
Oh, that's not necessary.

52
00:05:02,844 --> 00:05:04,846
I didn't get a chance
to come on Teacher's Day--

53
00:05:04,929 --> 00:05:07,432
-That's hot.
-Are you okay? Oh, no.

54
00:05:08,057 --> 00:05:10,643
-It's fine. It didn't burn me.
-I'll go get you a wet wipe.

55
00:05:11,728 --> 00:05:12,812
Geez, that was hot.

56
00:05:14,105 --> 00:05:15,648
She could've just taken it.

57
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:22,030
You must be the teacher. Hello.

58
00:05:22,905 --> 00:05:24,157
I'm a parent of a student.

59
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:25,867
Oh, I see.

60
00:05:31,289 --> 00:05:33,791
You must be the teacher. Hello.

61
00:05:33,875 --> 00:05:36,544
I apologize for not coming by sooner.
I'm Park Kyubeom's grandfather.

62
00:05:36,627 --> 00:05:38,838
He's a parent of one of the students too.

63
00:05:39,339 --> 00:05:40,214
Do Yoonjae's father.

64
00:05:43,634 --> 00:05:47,305
My, you give off such a warm impression.

65
00:05:47,513 --> 00:05:49,349
You look like a teacher.

66
00:05:52,060 --> 00:05:55,688
Gosh, should I not have come today?

67
00:05:56,689 --> 00:05:58,024
Is this a meeting for fathers?

68
00:05:58,107 --> 00:05:59,442
No.

69
00:05:59,525 --> 00:06:03,237
I'm here because my wife went overseas
to Haiti to volunteer.

70
00:06:04,947 --> 00:06:08,242
She's doing wonderful work.
That's so admirable.

71
00:06:12,330 --> 00:06:15,333
Oh, well, mine is…

72
00:06:16,542 --> 00:06:17,502
Oh…

73
00:06:18,836 --> 00:06:21,798
Hello. You may stay seated.

74
00:06:21,881 --> 00:06:23,341
Looks like everyone's here.

75
00:06:23,841 --> 00:06:25,426
Mr. Jeong, you can go sit over there.

76
00:06:29,889 --> 00:06:33,309
-Are you the dean of students?
-Yes, but I'm here as a parent today.

77
00:06:33,476 --> 00:06:34,936
I'm Jeong Ideun's dad.

78
00:06:35,436 --> 00:06:38,398
I'm Oh Jungsub, the principal
of Haneum International Middle School.

79
00:06:39,649 --> 00:06:43,528
We made an urgent request for you all
to come despite your busy schedules

80
00:06:44,987 --> 00:06:49,242
because the police called the school
early this morning.

81
00:06:59,335 --> 00:07:01,212
Haneum International Middle School.

82
00:07:03,131 --> 00:07:04,674
Our school's PE uniform?

83
00:07:08,219 --> 00:07:10,304
-Geonwoo.
-Is he a student from your school?

84
00:07:11,681 --> 00:07:13,683
A fisherman fished him out of a lake.

85
00:07:14,308 --> 00:07:16,185
He must've gotten him out pretty quickly.

86
00:07:16,769 --> 00:07:19,856
Goodness, he's one lucky kid.

87
00:07:19,981 --> 00:07:21,732
When a person drowns,

88
00:07:21,816 --> 00:07:25,111
their whole body blows up like a balloon,

89
00:07:25,194 --> 00:07:27,447
and their face looks like
it's going to explode.

90
00:07:27,697 --> 00:07:29,449
All the hair on their body falls out too.

91
00:07:29,615 --> 00:07:31,659
It's too hideous to look at.

92
00:07:31,742 --> 00:07:34,787
My gosh, how did the accident happen?

93
00:07:35,705 --> 00:07:36,747
It wasn't an accident.

94
00:07:41,294 --> 00:07:43,504
Geonwoo's homeroom teacher,
Ms. Song Jeonguk,

95
00:07:43,671 --> 00:07:46,257
received a letter from him.

96
00:07:46,883 --> 00:07:48,092
Read it, please.

97
00:08:04,567 --> 00:08:07,320
""I have been the victim of bullying
for a long time now.

98
00:08:07,403 --> 00:08:10,615
I couldn't say a thing
because I was scared they would retaliate.

99
00:08:11,824 --> 00:08:15,411
-They don't see me as a human being.""
-They don't see me as a human being.

100
00:08:16,162 --> 00:08:20,124
I don't see myself
as a human being anymore, either.

101
00:08:21,042 --> 00:08:22,418
I'm sorry, Mom.

102
00:08:23,377 --> 00:08:26,214
-""I'm thankful to be your son.""
-I'm thankful to be your son.

103
00:08:26,797 --> 00:08:28,216
I love you, Mom.

104
00:08:30,134 --> 00:08:32,720
""Grade 8, Class 3, Do Yoonjae.

105
00:08:34,055 --> 00:08:35,556
Park Kyubeom.

106
00:08:37,225 --> 00:08:38,559
Jeong Ideun.

107
00:08:40,102 --> 00:08:41,479
Kang Hangyeol.""

108
00:08:44,524 --> 00:08:45,358
That's it.

109
00:08:47,151 --> 00:08:49,946
Excuse me.
Why is Yoonjae's name in that letter?

110
00:08:51,113 --> 00:08:52,490
He's the first name here.

111
00:08:52,573 --> 00:08:53,449
Yes,

112
00:08:54,033 --> 00:08:56,327
so why is my son's name in that letter?

113
00:08:56,911 --> 00:08:59,413
Excuse me, Mr. Do.

114
00:08:59,497 --> 00:09:02,083
Please calm down and have a seat.

115
00:09:02,416 --> 00:09:04,001
Have a seat.

116
00:09:04,669 --> 00:09:08,130
We'll go ahead and start
our meeting now, as outlined

117
00:09:08,214 --> 00:09:09,840
in our school's bullying policy.

118
00:09:09,924 --> 00:09:12,677
Geonwoo's parents
are supposed to be present as well.

119
00:09:14,053 --> 00:09:17,139
Ms. Song. What does Geonwoo's father do?

120
00:09:17,223 --> 00:09:20,476
His student card only has
information about his mother.

121
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:22,853
I'm only a temporary homeroom teacher,
so I'm not sure.

122
00:09:22,937 --> 00:09:27,942
Excuse me. I suppose you're not aware
as you're only a temporary teacher.

123
00:09:28,025 --> 00:09:30,361
My son donates 30,000 won to UNICEF

124
00:09:30,444 --> 00:09:32,405
every single month

125
00:09:32,905 --> 00:09:35,074
because he feels sorry
for all those dark-skinned kids.

126
00:09:35,157 --> 00:09:36,409
Principal Oh.

127
00:09:36,909 --> 00:09:38,828
Have you questioned the students?

128
00:09:38,911 --> 00:09:43,040
All four kids said the same thing,
that nothing like that ever happened.

129
00:09:43,624 --> 00:09:46,377
See? There's no truth to it.
It's not true.

130
00:09:46,460 --> 00:09:48,337
Oh, Goddess of Mercy…

131
00:09:49,046 --> 00:09:50,548
Where's Hangyeol right now?

132
00:09:50,631 --> 00:09:53,801
The offending students are waiting
in the debate room right now.

133
00:09:54,385 --> 00:09:55,678
What kind of nonsense is that?

134
00:09:56,262 --> 00:09:57,388
Excuse me?

135
00:09:57,972 --> 00:10:01,017
What will the other students think
if our kids aren't in class?

136
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:04,895
You're branding them as criminals
before even having all the details.

137
00:10:04,979 --> 00:10:07,690
Students legally have a right
to be in class.

138
00:10:07,773 --> 00:10:09,191
You should act according to the law.

139
00:10:09,775 --> 00:10:12,153
Why are you detaining innocent children?

140
00:10:12,236 --> 00:10:14,655
They're just staying in the debate room,
not being detained.

141
00:10:14,739 --> 00:10:16,157
That's the same thing.

142
00:10:16,991 --> 00:10:19,827
When your elders are speaking,
you don't need to give your two cents.

143
00:10:23,039 --> 00:10:24,415
Ms. Song.

144
00:10:38,929 --> 00:10:41,599
-Song!
-Song!

145
00:10:47,396 --> 00:10:49,273
-Hey, snap some pictures.
-Goal!

146
00:10:51,233 --> 00:10:52,610
Goal!

147
00:10:55,488 --> 00:10:58,449
Yes. Don't worry, Mr. Chairman.

148
00:10:58,532 --> 00:10:59,742
My apologies.

149
00:11:00,743 --> 00:11:02,828
Oh, yes. Of course.

150
00:11:03,412 --> 00:11:05,956
Of course, we can't allow the school
to become a topic for gossip.

151
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:07,750
Especially not for something like this.

152
00:11:10,294 --> 00:11:11,545
Mr. Do.

153
00:11:12,129 --> 00:11:15,132
Our school has a no-smoking policy.

154
00:11:18,511 --> 00:11:19,970
That's why I'm ventilating the room.

155
00:11:27,687 --> 00:11:30,064
Do Yoonjae, Park Kyubeom,

156
00:11:30,147 --> 00:11:31,982
Jeong Ideun, Kang Hangyeol.

157
00:11:32,066 --> 00:11:33,401
GEONWOO UNCONSCIOUS,
SCHOOL VIOLENCE, SUICIDE NOTE

158
00:11:33,484 --> 00:11:34,944
They're not in alphabetical order.

159
00:11:35,945 --> 00:11:37,029
You're right.

160
00:11:38,489 --> 00:11:41,367
Maybe Hangyeol's name is at the end
because they're roommates.

161
00:11:42,910 --> 00:11:44,286
He shares a room with my son?

162
00:11:47,039 --> 00:11:49,125
I'll bet he's too scared to get any sleep.

163
00:11:51,961 --> 00:11:54,797
Has anything like this
ever happened here before?

164
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:57,007
No way, never.

165
00:11:57,675 --> 00:12:00,469
I didn't want to say this,
but to be honest,

166
00:12:00,678 --> 00:12:04,014
Ms. Song is a temporary teacher.

167
00:12:04,098 --> 00:12:07,101
She may not have a strong sense of
responsibility when it comes to the kids.

168
00:12:07,184 --> 00:12:09,186
How could they make
someone like her a homeroom teacher?

169
00:12:09,270 --> 00:12:11,897
The school is
largely responsible for this.

170
00:12:12,523 --> 00:12:15,401
So why are they spewing nonsense
about the kid getting bullied?

171
00:12:15,985 --> 00:12:18,612
What was his name? The kid who died.

172
00:12:18,863 --> 00:12:21,490
Is he some kind of troublemaker?

173
00:12:21,574 --> 00:12:24,410
It's Kim Geonwoo. And he's not dead.

174
00:12:25,119 --> 00:12:26,787
They said he's just unconscious.

175
00:12:27,288 --> 00:12:29,957
And could you stop talking?
You're making me uncomfortable.

176
00:12:30,875 --> 00:12:32,418
How did I do that?

177
00:12:33,419 --> 00:12:34,962
Just don't listen then.

178
00:12:35,755 --> 00:12:39,383
To be honest…
I don't know if I should say this either,

179
00:12:39,467 --> 00:12:43,512
but Geonwoo is a beneficiary
of a program for low-income students.

180
00:12:43,888 --> 00:12:45,931
Parents of kids like that

181
00:12:46,015 --> 00:12:49,101
often have unreasonable expectations.

182
00:12:49,351 --> 00:12:51,979
I believe that
excessive pressure placed on him

183
00:12:52,062 --> 00:12:55,941
played a big role
in his attempt to take his life.

184
00:12:56,025 --> 00:12:56,984
See?

185
00:12:57,610 --> 00:13:00,654
Kids with problems
have problematic parents.

186
00:13:00,738 --> 00:13:02,531
Why don't we do this then?

187
00:13:04,116 --> 00:13:06,410
Until Geonwoo wakes up,
let's keep the letter undisclosed

188
00:13:06,494 --> 00:13:08,120
and leave it in the care of the principal.

189
00:13:08,370 --> 00:13:12,416
Ms. Song is so young
and lacks a sense of responsibility.

190
00:13:13,626 --> 00:13:15,211
That's what I'm saying.

191
00:13:15,294 --> 00:13:16,921
A suicide note can be used as evidence.

192
00:13:17,004 --> 00:13:18,923
Not disclosing it would be
concealing evidence.

193
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:24,804
-Suicide note? That's not a suicide note.
-Then what would you call it?

194
00:13:24,887 --> 00:13:26,680
It's just a letter.

195
00:13:27,598 --> 00:13:31,060
A suicide note becomes valid
upon the death of the writer

196
00:13:31,143 --> 00:13:32,686
and contains their last words.

197
00:13:33,896 --> 00:13:35,564
Didn't you say he isn't dead yet?

198
00:13:35,648 --> 00:13:38,818
If you do something wrong,
you should be punished for it.

199
00:13:38,901 --> 00:13:42,029
If the contents of that letter come out,
regardless of what the truth is,

200
00:13:42,112 --> 00:13:45,991
the names in that letter
will become the names of criminals.

201
00:13:46,075 --> 00:13:49,954
It's a parent's duty
to lead their child down the right path.

202
00:13:50,871 --> 00:13:52,373
You're not his parent, though.

203
00:13:52,998 --> 00:13:56,585
Instead of being blamed your whole life
for ruining your grandson's future,

204
00:13:56,794 --> 00:13:58,504
tell Kyubeom's dad to come here instead.

205
00:13:59,797 --> 00:14:01,340
I assure you,

206
00:14:01,966 --> 00:14:04,218
every father in the world
thinks and feels the same way.

207
00:14:04,927 --> 00:14:06,387
It's different with grandfathers.

208
00:14:08,722 --> 00:14:09,598
Ms. Song.

209
00:14:11,725 --> 00:14:13,853
But Geonwoo gave this to me…

210
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:16,313
I'll hold on to it for safekeeping.

211
00:14:19,233 --> 00:14:20,192
Read it.

212
00:14:23,112 --> 00:14:23,946
Read it.

213
00:14:26,198 --> 00:14:30,452
""A faculty member may not accept
any object from a student.

214
00:14:31,453 --> 00:14:33,956
If they happen to come
into possession of an object…""

215
00:14:34,039 --> 00:14:35,875
They must notify the principal

216
00:14:37,251 --> 00:14:39,128
and follow his or her orders.

217
00:14:40,421 --> 00:14:42,006
TO MS. SONG JEONGUK

218
00:14:48,929 --> 00:14:50,723
They want to make a group chat.

219
00:14:51,974 --> 00:14:53,392
Could I have your phone number?

220
00:14:54,476 --> 00:14:56,437
I don't know how to do things like that.

221
00:15:04,361 --> 00:15:06,363
Mr. Park, you're quite the frugal man.

222
00:15:07,489 --> 00:15:09,074
I'm sure you've retired,

223
00:15:09,867 --> 00:15:12,077
but you still wear
your police-issued shoes.

224
00:15:13,579 --> 00:15:15,122
Where did you work?

225
00:15:15,331 --> 00:15:18,125
I retired from the National Police Agency
and went into teaching.

226
00:15:18,208 --> 00:15:20,294
You were one of the elite.

227
00:15:21,503 --> 00:15:24,173
Since we've been
brought together like this,

228
00:15:24,256 --> 00:15:27,259
we just wanted to communicate
with each other, that's all.

229
00:15:27,593 --> 00:15:29,345
After all, we're all in the same boat.

230
00:15:30,012 --> 00:15:32,431
I don't get on boats.
I'm prone to getting seasick.

231
00:15:33,641 --> 00:15:35,643
Mr. Kang, take care.

232
00:15:43,108 --> 00:15:46,737
-Geez, why did you do that?
-Do what?

233
00:15:46,820 --> 00:15:49,740
Yoonjae, this isn't going to work.
You need to go back to the States.

234
00:15:50,491 --> 00:15:52,868
Man, I'm not going back.
I just got settled in.

235
00:15:52,952 --> 00:15:56,038
You punk. You call harassing kids
getting settled in?

236
00:15:56,622 --> 00:15:59,041
Then again,
the kids who take it are the idiots.

237
00:16:00,417 --> 00:16:03,212
Do Yoonjae. You need to watch yourself
for the time being.

238
00:16:03,420 --> 00:16:05,923
This is your last warning. Got it?

239
00:16:15,724 --> 00:16:18,102
-Are you okay?
-Yeah.

240
00:16:18,185 --> 00:16:20,854
Will you look up from your phone
when your dad's talking?

241
00:16:25,234 --> 00:16:26,902
So you and Geonwoo are roommates?

242
00:16:27,653 --> 00:16:28,487
Yeah.

243
00:16:30,114 --> 00:16:31,573
Did you hear about the accident?

244
00:16:32,157 --> 00:16:33,075
Yeah.

245
00:16:34,410 --> 00:16:35,828
Nothing happened, right?

246
00:16:37,830 --> 00:16:38,706
Yeah.

247
00:16:39,373 --> 00:16:42,292
Okay. Make sure you keep your mouth shut.

248
00:16:46,255 --> 00:16:47,297
I'm off.

249
00:17:00,644 --> 00:17:04,440
KANG HANGYEOL
KIM GEONWOO

250
00:17:49,860 --> 00:17:50,694
Jesus Christ.

251
00:17:51,737 --> 00:17:52,863
What are you doing here?

252
00:17:52,946 --> 00:17:54,656
Why are you so surprised?

253
00:17:56,325 --> 00:17:59,703
I told you, didn't I?
All dads think and feel the same way.

254
00:18:07,669 --> 00:18:08,837
Ms. Song.

255
00:18:10,964 --> 00:18:12,299
It's tough, isn't it?

256
00:18:15,344 --> 00:18:19,139
It's too bad the school doesn't know
how dedicated you are.

257
00:18:20,808 --> 00:18:22,351
Want me to look into a position for you?

258
00:18:24,895 --> 00:18:25,896
Just a second.

259
00:18:26,647 --> 00:18:27,898
Hello, this is Song Jeonguk.

260
00:18:30,275 --> 00:18:31,860
You got hold of Geonwoo's mom?

261
00:18:32,528 --> 00:18:34,488
Okay, I'll head over
to the hospital right now.

262
00:18:34,571 --> 00:18:36,782
-Sorry, I need to go.
-Sure.

263
00:18:39,326 --> 00:18:40,786
I'm sorry.

264
00:18:45,582 --> 00:18:46,667
Where are you, honey?

265
00:18:47,417 --> 00:18:49,002
The department store at a time like this?

266
00:18:49,795 --> 00:18:52,005
Go to the hospital. Yes, right now.

267
00:18:59,555 --> 00:19:01,056
Song!

268
00:19:03,100 --> 00:19:05,561
-Hey!
-Song, what's up?

269
00:19:09,565 --> 00:19:10,691
See you later!

270
00:19:10,774 --> 00:19:11,859
So long!

271
00:19:11,942 --> 00:19:14,444
Keep going, there you go. Nice job.

272
00:19:14,528 --> 00:19:16,113
Nice. Later!

273
00:19:18,949 --> 00:19:20,993
EMERGENCY MEDICAL CENTER

274
00:19:28,292 --> 00:19:30,460
What… What's wrong, Geonwoo?

275
00:19:30,752 --> 00:19:32,045
Wake up.

276
00:19:34,006 --> 00:19:36,717
-Wake up. Geonwoo!
-Ma'am, please.

277
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:39,595
-Why are you trying to go first?
-You'll really kill him at this rate.

278
00:19:39,678 --> 00:19:42,306
-Ma'am, please. Calm down.
-Geonwoo!

279
00:19:46,018 --> 00:19:48,103
I'm Geonwoo's homeroom teacher.

280
00:19:50,439 --> 00:19:53,108
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

281
00:20:07,998 --> 00:20:09,082
Ma'am.

282
00:20:14,671 --> 00:20:16,006
You punk.

283
00:20:20,052 --> 00:20:23,639
I hit him, and he couldn't even flinch.

284
00:20:29,228 --> 00:20:31,813
Sergeant Lee! Just a second.

285
00:20:33,815 --> 00:20:36,568
When will you start investigating?

286
00:20:36,652 --> 00:20:38,111
We don't investigate suicide attempts.

287
00:20:38,695 --> 00:20:41,198
It might not have been a suicide attempt.

288
00:20:41,323 --> 00:20:45,369
Ma'am. He has cuts all over his wrist.

289
00:20:45,953 --> 00:20:47,579
Looked like he tried hanging himself too.

290
00:20:47,746 --> 00:20:50,457
He's already made a few attempts
to kill himself.

291
00:20:50,707 --> 00:20:52,376
Pay some more attention to your students.

292
00:20:54,836 --> 00:20:58,632
Honey. Ideun's teacher is
talking to the police right now.

293
00:20:58,715 --> 00:21:01,051
The police? What did she say?

294
00:21:01,134 --> 00:21:02,511
I don't know. I can't hear a thing.

295
00:21:02,594 --> 00:21:04,221
For goodness' sake.

296
00:21:04,721 --> 00:21:08,475
SAEMGOL SPICY FRESHWATER FISH STEW

297
00:21:18,902 --> 00:21:20,320
I'm home.

298
00:21:20,404 --> 00:21:21,613
Why are you so late?

299
00:21:21,697 --> 00:21:23,865
Aren't you off today
since you worked last night?

300
00:21:23,949 --> 00:21:25,325
Something came up at school.

301
00:21:25,742 --> 00:21:29,705
They pay their staff peanuts
and milk them for all they're worth.

302
00:21:29,788 --> 00:21:32,082
Are temps not even human beings?

303
00:21:48,181 --> 00:21:49,349
Geonwoo.

304
00:22:01,153 --> 00:22:02,404
Hangyeol?

305
00:22:04,114 --> 00:22:07,367
Why didn't Hangyeol stop him?
He definitely saw him.

306
00:22:18,462 --> 00:22:20,630
It was 5:15 a.m.

307
00:22:22,758 --> 00:22:24,801
3 HOURS

308
00:22:27,220 --> 00:22:28,638
Three hours?

309
00:22:31,558 --> 00:22:34,102
What went on
during those three hours, Geonwoo?

310
00:22:47,908 --> 00:22:48,992
Let's go.

311
00:22:50,202 --> 00:22:51,995
I found it,

312
00:22:52,079 --> 00:22:54,623
so you should be the one to open it.

313
00:23:02,881 --> 00:23:06,176
Damn it.
What building doesn't have an elevator?

314
00:23:19,481 --> 00:23:22,317
-Hello, this is Kang Hochang.
-This is Song Jeonguk.

315
00:23:22,567 --> 00:23:23,944
Did something else happen?

316
00:23:24,027 --> 00:23:27,114
Sir… Did you take something from the room?

317
00:23:28,865 --> 00:23:30,826
I saw that you went to the dorm.

318
00:23:31,576 --> 00:23:35,288
Oh, Hangyeol asked me
to take home some stuff he doesn't use.

319
00:23:35,372 --> 00:23:37,666
Hangyeol's desk is on the right,

320
00:23:37,874 --> 00:23:39,209
but you were on the left.

321
00:23:39,793 --> 00:23:43,964
I assumed the messy desk was my son's.

322
00:23:44,172 --> 00:23:48,218
Mr. Kang. Did you touch
any of Geonwoo's belongings?

323
00:23:48,343 --> 00:23:52,097
Ms. Song. I'm a lawyer.
Do you think I would steal from a kid?

324
00:23:52,681 --> 00:23:55,559
Sorry, but I'll have to
call you back later.

325
00:23:55,642 --> 00:23:56,768
I'm in the middle of work.

326
00:23:56,852 --> 00:23:59,396
MOBILE SOLUTIONS

327
00:24:03,316 --> 00:24:04,276
Welcome.

328
00:24:09,156 --> 00:24:11,074
I'm here to get this phone unlocked.

329
00:24:15,704 --> 00:24:18,165
A service center can do this
for you for free.

330
00:24:18,874 --> 00:24:20,375
-Really?
-But,

331
00:24:20,876 --> 00:24:23,003
I'm sure there's a reason
you came to see me.

332
00:24:23,462 --> 00:24:25,922
It'll cost 200,000 won
to recover the data.

333
00:24:28,884 --> 00:24:30,135
All right, then.

334
00:24:33,472 --> 00:24:34,556
ID, please.

335
00:24:39,102 --> 00:24:40,770
We operate according to the law.

336
00:24:40,854 --> 00:24:42,731
We need proof of identity.

337
00:24:44,024 --> 00:24:44,900
So,

338
00:24:45,984 --> 00:24:47,235
how much in total?

339
00:24:47,986 --> 00:24:51,239
This is a no-parking zone.
Plate number 5232, please move your car.

340
00:24:51,323 --> 00:24:53,450
-Please move your car.
-Just give me a ticket and go.

341
00:24:58,747 --> 00:24:59,998
Do you have any cash on you?

342
00:25:05,128 --> 00:25:07,839
Go grab a bowl of jajangmyeon
on the first floor.

343
00:25:07,923 --> 00:25:09,549
I'll get it to you when I'm done.

344
00:25:23,980 --> 00:25:25,774
IDEUN'S FATHER:
MS. SONG WAS TALKING TO THE POLICE

345
00:25:33,823 --> 00:25:34,908
How old are you?

346
00:25:37,035 --> 00:25:38,620
I was born in the Year of the Rooster.

347
00:25:38,745 --> 00:25:41,122
-The Year of the Rooster.
-Yes.

348
00:25:42,123 --> 00:25:44,876
We're the same age, and we seem to click.

349
00:25:47,087 --> 00:25:48,046
My name's Do Jiyeol.

350
00:25:50,465 --> 00:25:51,550
Kang Hochang.

351
00:25:53,343 --> 00:25:55,136
Delivery. 10,000 won.

352
00:25:59,307 --> 00:26:00,934
You guys are pretty talented.

353
00:26:02,060 --> 00:26:03,937
You even ride your bike down the stairs.

354
00:26:05,021 --> 00:26:06,189
Hurry. I'm busy.

355
00:26:09,150 --> 00:26:10,235
Here. Good work.

356
00:26:10,986 --> 00:26:11,945
Thanks.

357
00:26:21,746 --> 00:26:23,164
Let me see that.

358
00:26:25,667 --> 00:26:27,627
GROUP CHAT

359
00:26:27,711 --> 00:26:30,046
Ideun, Kyubeom.

360
00:26:30,547 --> 00:26:32,841
Ideun, Kyubeom.

361
00:26:36,303 --> 00:26:37,762
I don't see Yoonjae.

362
00:26:39,055 --> 00:26:40,223
What about Hangyeol?

363
00:26:44,269 --> 00:26:45,562
I don't see him either.

364
00:26:49,691 --> 00:26:51,359
What were they looking at?

365
00:26:52,485 --> 00:26:53,820
LET'S GO AGAIN TOMORROW!

366
00:26:54,446 --> 00:26:56,489
Man, the weight's coming right off.

367
00:26:57,532 --> 00:26:59,993
What are you doing, Geonwoo?
Are you ignoring us?

368
00:27:00,869 --> 00:27:03,663
Hurry up and take a piss, jerkoff!

369
00:27:04,289 --> 00:27:07,292
Did that jerk just dodge that? Did you?

370
00:27:07,459 --> 00:27:10,045
I asked you if you dodged it!

371
00:27:10,128 --> 00:27:11,379
-Answer me!
-Hey, Hangyeol.

372
00:27:11,463 --> 00:27:13,840
-Did you dodge it!
-Make sure you're getting everything.

373
00:27:13,923 --> 00:27:15,050
Answer me.

374
00:27:15,842 --> 00:27:18,678
Answer me! Did you dodge that?

375
00:27:18,762 --> 00:27:20,221
Did you?

376
00:27:21,306 --> 00:27:24,392
Go on and take a piss. Hurry up!

377
00:27:24,476 --> 00:27:26,478
Hurry up and do it!

378
00:27:36,738 --> 00:27:38,281
Why would they film something like this?

379
00:27:42,410 --> 00:27:44,746
So, who was the instigator?

380
00:27:46,998 --> 00:27:48,500
That isn't important.

381
00:27:49,626 --> 00:27:52,462
It looks like Yoonjae gave the orders,
and Hangyeol filmed the video.

382
00:27:53,630 --> 00:27:54,923
Are you blind?

383
00:27:55,006 --> 00:27:56,925
Watch it again from the beginning.

384
00:27:57,008 --> 00:27:59,219
Your two kids laid hands on him.

385
00:27:59,803 --> 00:28:00,845
My son was just singing.

386
00:28:00,929 --> 00:28:03,723
No way. Just singing, my foot.

387
00:28:04,057 --> 00:28:06,768
Ma'am, you should say something.

388
00:28:06,851 --> 00:28:08,520
Our kids didn't instigate it.

389
00:28:09,312 --> 00:28:10,480
Aren't their kids worse?

390
00:28:11,481 --> 00:28:13,024
They were all complicit.

391
00:28:14,275 --> 00:28:16,319
If he dies and they investigate,

392
00:28:16,903 --> 00:28:18,071
or if he wakes up and talks,

393
00:28:20,323 --> 00:28:22,117
it's all over.

394
00:28:30,250 --> 00:28:31,668
Let's get this show on the road.

395
00:28:32,377 --> 00:28:33,753
What if he wakes up?

396
00:28:33,837 --> 00:28:35,672
That's why you should hurry up and go.

397
00:28:35,755 --> 00:28:38,842
You're a lawyer. You're good with words.

398
00:28:39,467 --> 00:28:41,052
I'm scientifically minded.

399
00:28:41,636 --> 00:28:44,305
You use your mouth and I'll use my hands.

400
00:28:44,848 --> 00:28:48,810
Let's make this fair
and make use of our talents.

401
00:28:51,813 --> 00:28:52,647
Jeez.

402
00:28:52,731 --> 00:28:54,524
Why are you overthinking it?

403
00:28:54,607 --> 00:28:56,443
We're just helping someone in need.

404
00:28:59,696 --> 00:29:02,490
If he wakes up in the next few days,

405
00:29:02,574 --> 00:29:05,660
he could be discharged right away, so…

406
00:29:06,161 --> 00:29:08,621
I'm in a bit of a pinch.

407
00:29:09,998 --> 00:29:12,834
I understand. All right.

408
00:29:13,710 --> 00:29:15,462
Are you Kim Geonwoo's mother?

409
00:29:17,630 --> 00:29:18,715
Yes.

410
00:29:19,007 --> 00:29:22,969
I'm here as a representative of
Hanuem International Middle School's PTA.

411
00:29:24,637 --> 00:29:25,597
Hello.

412
00:29:34,355 --> 00:29:36,357
Do you think
the principal will give us the note?

413
00:29:37,442 --> 00:29:38,818
He has to.

414
00:29:41,154 --> 00:29:43,114
What do the other parents do?

415
00:29:43,364 --> 00:29:45,658
One's an obnoxious hospital chairman.

416
00:29:46,534 --> 00:29:48,745
One's a retired cop
who's raising his grandson.

417
00:29:48,828 --> 00:29:51,873
And one's a lawyer.
His wife ran out on him.

418
00:29:54,542 --> 00:29:56,336
Just do as I tell you.

419
00:29:56,419 --> 00:29:58,922
Are you threatening me right now?

420
00:29:59,005 --> 00:30:01,758
As the wife of a faculty member,
I completely understand.

421
00:30:01,925 --> 00:30:04,803
But you spent the kids' lunch money
on building this vacation home.

422
00:30:05,386 --> 00:30:07,472
Do you think other people
will understand that?

423
00:30:08,723 --> 00:30:10,183
Our school

424
00:30:10,266 --> 00:30:13,686
has become the best in the country
thanks to my sacrifices and services.

425
00:30:14,270 --> 00:30:15,855
Wouldn't you agree, Mr. Jeong?

426
00:30:15,939 --> 00:30:18,024
Of course. I completely agree.

427
00:30:18,399 --> 00:30:20,777
But if you give us Geonwoo's letter,

428
00:30:21,486 --> 00:30:24,030
I'll make there's not even a cent
out of place on the documents.

429
00:30:25,281 --> 00:30:26,950
I am a math teacher, after all.

430
00:30:28,284 --> 00:30:30,495
Maximum of three years,
minimum of two years.

431
00:30:31,955 --> 00:30:33,998
A middle school student from Daegu…

432
00:30:34,582 --> 00:30:36,167
Maximum of three years and six months…

433
00:30:37,377 --> 00:30:38,711
Three years and six months…

434
00:30:44,175 --> 00:30:45,677
NEW MESSAGE

435
00:30:50,849 --> 00:30:53,309
WE GOT RID OF THE LETTER!
-IDEUN'S DAD

436
00:31:22,547 --> 00:31:26,384
NAM JIHO

437
00:31:29,804 --> 00:31:31,264
NAM JIHO

438
00:31:39,230 --> 00:31:40,940
MESSAGES

439
00:31:41,024 --> 00:31:42,275
I HEARD YOU WERE IN AN ACCIDENT

440
00:31:42,358 --> 00:31:44,360
I'M WORRIED BECAUSE OF
WHAT I SAW THAT DAY, CALL ME

441
00:31:46,613 --> 00:31:47,780
Who are you?

442
00:31:48,531 --> 00:31:50,325
PIN NUMBER

443
00:31:50,408 --> 00:31:52,493
DON'T PRINT RECEIPT

444
00:31:52,577 --> 00:31:55,914
Your request is being processed.
Please wait one moment.

445
00:31:58,458 --> 00:31:59,542
Hello.

446
00:31:59,626 --> 00:32:02,670
Which room is Kim Geonwoo in?
He came in yesterday.

447
00:32:02,754 --> 00:32:03,796
He's been discharged.

448
00:32:04,380 --> 00:32:05,465
He woke up?

449
00:32:05,548 --> 00:32:08,801
No. His mother decided
to move him to a bigger hospital.

450
00:32:10,261 --> 00:32:11,638
I see. Thank you.

451
00:32:12,430 --> 00:32:15,934
The phone is turned off.
You will be transferred to voicemail.

452
00:32:16,017 --> 00:32:17,477
You will be charged after the tone.

453
00:32:24,734 --> 00:32:25,777
Son.

454
00:32:27,195 --> 00:32:28,613
What are you dreaming about?

455
00:32:32,951 --> 00:32:35,787
You haven't been getting any sleep
because you've been studying.

456
00:32:37,205 --> 00:32:39,958
Things have been tough for you,
haven't they?

457
00:32:41,250 --> 00:32:44,337
We're at a big hospital in Seoul.

458
00:32:45,630 --> 00:32:47,674
Your friends' parents

459
00:32:48,299 --> 00:32:52,679
helped us out so you could wake up.

460
00:32:54,847 --> 00:32:56,224
I'm so thankful.

461
00:33:10,697 --> 00:33:12,031
So Geonwoo,

462
00:33:14,367 --> 00:33:15,952
sleep just a bit more

463
00:33:17,787 --> 00:33:19,247
and wake up soon.

464
00:33:21,124 --> 00:33:23,334
I'll be waiting for you.

465
00:34:09,422 --> 00:34:13,301
Gosh, you little punk.

466
00:34:14,469 --> 00:34:18,639
My eyes are about to fall out
from having to watch you.

467
00:34:20,808 --> 00:34:22,602
Geonwoo.

468
00:34:23,311 --> 00:34:24,687
Geonwoo.

469
00:34:25,188 --> 00:34:28,024
Just keep breathing.

470
00:34:29,233 --> 00:34:32,862
If you die, my son will be done for.

471
00:34:33,821 --> 00:34:36,908
Let's live quietly as if you were dead.

472
00:34:41,454 --> 00:34:42,872
There's someone we need to find.

473
00:34:58,012 --> 00:34:59,472
Mrs. Kim?

474
00:35:02,391 --> 00:35:03,726
Mrs. Kim.

475
00:35:14,278 --> 00:35:15,655
Mrs. Kim!

476
00:35:20,660 --> 00:35:21,702
Mrs. Kim!

477
00:35:29,585 --> 00:35:30,628
Stop right there!

478
00:35:35,049 --> 00:35:36,259
Hello, sir.

479
00:35:36,801 --> 00:35:38,177
Oh, you're having lunch.

480
00:35:38,678 --> 00:35:41,305
A kid by the name of Nam Jiho
lives here, right?

481
00:35:43,724 --> 00:35:45,351
Are you here from the detention center?

482
00:35:46,602 --> 00:35:48,896
Someone from the center
already came by this month.

483
00:35:50,439 --> 00:35:52,400
Seeing the kids often
helps us bond with them.

484
00:35:52,900 --> 00:35:55,027
Wait. Which unit did she live in?

485
00:36:32,315 --> 00:36:33,441
Jiho.

486
00:36:39,530 --> 00:36:40,656
Who are you?

487
00:36:46,829 --> 00:36:48,664
KANG HOCHANG

488
00:36:54,170 --> 00:36:55,421
Where's your ID?

489
00:36:56,005 --> 00:36:57,006
ID?

490
00:36:58,007 --> 00:37:00,509
He works for me. He's my office manager.

491
00:37:01,802 --> 00:37:02,970
Like a lackey?

492
00:37:07,266 --> 00:37:10,394
I hear you and Kim Geonwoo
are best friends.

493
00:37:10,478 --> 00:37:11,520
No, we're not.

494
00:37:11,604 --> 00:37:14,357
Yeah, right. I know you are.

495
00:37:16,317 --> 00:37:19,111
Jiho. I'm a lawyer.

496
00:37:20,071 --> 00:37:22,782
I can only help Geonwoo
if I know what happened to him.

497
00:37:25,409 --> 00:37:26,786
You two have met before, right?

498
00:37:27,745 --> 00:37:29,080
Did you see anything that day?

499
00:37:31,499 --> 00:37:33,751
I saw him once after
not having seen him in forever.

500
00:37:36,712 --> 00:37:38,089
On the 15th floor of the apartment.

501
00:37:40,174 --> 00:37:42,176
I got a really bad feeling.

502
00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:43,803
Why?

503
00:37:44,595 --> 00:37:46,180
Geonwoo lives on the first floor.

504
00:37:52,728 --> 00:37:56,232
He said he just came up
to get some fresh air.

505
00:37:57,650 --> 00:37:59,652
I was skeptical, but I let it go.

506
00:38:00,236 --> 00:38:03,489
So you… saved him.

507
00:38:04,865 --> 00:38:06,617
I saw him again not too long ago.

508
00:38:08,911 --> 00:38:10,246
On the first floor.

509
00:38:24,760 --> 00:38:25,886
Eat it.

510
00:38:30,224 --> 00:38:31,892
Eat it. Go on.

511
00:38:33,602 --> 00:38:35,062
Eat it.

512
00:38:44,447 --> 00:38:45,781
Did you see that?

513
00:38:46,991 --> 00:38:48,117
What was that?

514
00:38:48,534 --> 00:38:49,368
What is he doing?

515
00:38:49,952 --> 00:38:51,912
He really ate it like a dog!

516
00:39:02,006 --> 00:39:05,051
Hey, son. Did you eat the gimbap I made?

517
00:39:05,926 --> 00:39:06,969
Yeah…

518
00:39:08,721 --> 00:39:09,889
What's with your voice?

519
00:39:11,098 --> 00:39:12,475
I just woke up.

520
00:39:12,558 --> 00:39:13,684
I see.

521
00:39:14,352 --> 00:39:16,228
I finished my work early today.

522
00:39:16,312 --> 00:39:17,855
I'll be home soon.

523
00:39:17,938 --> 00:39:19,440
I should be there in an hour.

524
00:39:20,649 --> 00:39:23,152
-See you later.
-Bye.

525
00:39:27,698 --> 00:39:29,200
Why the hell is she coming early?

526
00:39:29,283 --> 00:39:32,119
Hey. Why's she coming home early?

527
00:39:32,203 --> 00:39:34,538
Why's she coming early again? Why?

528
00:39:34,622 --> 00:39:37,500
Why? Die!

529
00:39:39,752 --> 00:39:42,797
Why the hell is she coming early again?

530
00:39:43,381 --> 00:39:45,299
I was going to watch the soccer game.

531
00:39:46,884 --> 00:39:48,260
Damn it.

532
00:39:49,387 --> 00:39:52,348
KOREA INFORMATION OLYMPIAD AWARD CEREMONY

533
00:39:52,431 --> 00:39:54,934
Geonwoo looks a lot like his dad.

534
00:39:55,142 --> 00:39:58,562
His dad bit the dust
after he fell off a construction site.

535
00:39:58,771 --> 00:39:59,897
Hey.

536
00:40:01,482 --> 00:40:03,025
Your dad looks so lonely.

537
00:40:05,903 --> 00:40:07,196
You're a good son, Geonwoo.

538
00:40:08,364 --> 00:40:09,698
Time to do your duty as a son.

539
00:40:16,622 --> 00:40:17,665
You should

540
00:40:18,666 --> 00:40:19,500
die too.

541
00:40:20,918 --> 00:40:22,962
Want us to help you? Do you?

542
00:40:25,172 --> 00:40:26,966
Want me to help? Do you?

543
00:40:29,385 --> 00:40:31,095
Do you?

544
00:40:31,846 --> 00:40:34,390
Did you see their faces?

545
00:40:37,184 --> 00:40:38,060
All four of them?

546
00:40:40,104 --> 00:40:41,814
I never said there were four.

547
00:40:43,232 --> 00:40:44,442
There were three kids.

548
00:40:45,693 --> 00:40:48,529
One was tall with a dark complexion
and looked like he played sports.

549
00:40:49,572 --> 00:40:51,449
One had curly hair and was heavyset.

550
00:40:52,199 --> 00:40:56,203
And one was fair-skinned
and pretty like a girl.

551
00:40:57,246 --> 00:40:59,290
He's the one who cut him with a knife.

552
00:40:59,999 --> 00:41:00,833
Right here.

553
00:41:07,715 --> 00:41:10,050
Did Geonwoo die?

554
00:41:11,844 --> 00:41:12,803
What?

555
00:41:12,887 --> 00:41:15,139
I went to his apartment earlier
because I was worried.

556
00:41:15,723 --> 00:41:18,893
All the lights were off,
and I got a weird feeling.

557
00:41:19,101 --> 00:41:21,645
Hey, kid.
You've got some impressive skills,

558
00:41:22,062 --> 00:41:24,273
popping in and out of
other people's homes like that.

559
00:41:24,732 --> 00:41:25,816
The door was open.

560
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:29,570
Listen to this cheeky little brat
lying to us.

561
00:41:30,154 --> 00:41:31,906
I'm not lying!

562
00:41:35,159 --> 00:41:36,160
Come on.

563
00:41:37,369 --> 00:41:40,456
Who would believe a girl
who's been in and out of juvie?

564
00:41:42,583 --> 00:41:44,043
I don't want any part of this.

565
00:41:45,002 --> 00:41:46,212
You guys do whatever you want.

566
00:41:48,130 --> 00:41:52,468
Jiho. You should collect your pay
for your services.

567
00:42:08,609 --> 00:42:11,904
Nam Jiho saw nothing.

568
00:42:12,655 --> 00:42:13,948
That's the truth.

569
00:42:18,744 --> 00:42:19,787
Go.

570
00:42:28,796 --> 00:42:31,507
Hangyeol may not be in the video,
but his name's in the suicide note.

571
00:42:33,300 --> 00:42:35,302
I told you.
It's a letter, not a suicide note.

572
00:42:39,181 --> 00:42:41,892
Mr. Oh, please give it back.

573
00:42:42,601 --> 00:42:44,436
I looked it up
on the education office's site.

574
00:42:44,520 --> 00:42:47,898
Letters are fine because they don't come
with an expectation of reciprocity.

575
00:42:48,482 --> 00:42:50,150
It also doesn't violate
the anti-graft law.

576
00:42:50,943 --> 00:42:53,279
Mr. Oh, Geonwoo's letter…

577
00:42:55,614 --> 00:42:57,658
I went through a lot of trouble for this.

578

580

Hello, Mr. Jeong.

Gosh, ma'am. Congratulations.

582
00:43:30,649 --> 00:43:33,193
I think you owe me a meal.

583
00:43:33,277 --> 00:43:35,654
-That's great news!
-Everyone, have your fill.

584
00:43:35,738 --> 00:43:39,074
-Congratulations! You must be so happy.
-Congratulations.

585
00:43:39,700 --> 00:43:40,784
Eat lots.

588
00:43:44,705 --> 00:43:47,750
-Want me to set you up with a guy?
-Of course, you should.

589
00:43:47,833 --> 00:43:50,044
All right, ladies. Let's drink.

THE DUTIES OF THE FULL-TIME TEACHER
ARE AS FOLLOWS…

595
00:44:29,667 --> 00:44:33,629
NAME: SONG JEONGUK

596
00:44:40,844 --> 00:44:42,096
-Way to go!
-Way to go!

597
00:44:42,179 --> 00:44:44,890
-Good job, everyone.
-Good job.

598
00:44:44,973 --> 00:44:46,934
-Nice work.
-Good job.

599
00:44:47,017 --> 00:44:48,560
-Good job.
-Goodbye.

600
00:44:48,644 --> 00:44:49,895
Jiyeol!

601
00:44:53,482 --> 00:44:55,067
Three, two, one, shock!

602
00:44:56,485 --> 00:44:57,861
Three, two, one, shock!

603
00:45:00,656 --> 00:45:02,741
-Did you try epinephrine?
-We did, but we couldn't--

604
00:45:02,825 --> 00:45:04,243
-Sir--
-Shut up.

605
00:45:05,786 --> 00:45:07,079
Breathe.

606
00:45:09,164 --> 00:45:10,416
Breathe.

607
00:45:11,667 --> 00:45:12,584
Breathe!

608
00:45:16,338 --> 00:45:17,673
Breathe.

609
00:45:18,507 --> 00:45:20,259
Breathe, damn it!

610
00:45:21,260 --> 00:45:22,302
Please!

611
00:45:41,029 --> 00:45:44,992
Now it's no longer a letter
but a suicide note.

612
00:45:53,333 --> 00:45:54,543
Jiyeol.

613
00:45:55,669 --> 00:45:58,338
I tried to save him.

614
00:45:59,089 --> 00:46:00,174
I really did.

615
00:46:03,051 --> 00:46:04,553
This may sound harsh,

616
00:46:05,345 --> 00:46:07,473
but it would've been hard
for both Geonwoo and his mom.

617
00:46:08,515 --> 00:46:10,642
Rather than living in a vegetative state,

618
00:46:13,687 --> 00:46:15,272
his passing like this might be better.

619
00:46:17,399 --> 00:46:19,610
We just have to fulfill all our duties.

620
00:46:20,986 --> 00:46:22,738
And the last piece of evidence is gone.

621
00:46:23,697 --> 00:46:25,866
It's true that his death
makes things easier for us.

622
00:46:29,703 --> 00:46:30,579
Take it away.

623
00:46:32,748 --> 00:46:34,708
Doctor, my Geonwoo isn't dead.

624
00:46:35,209 --> 00:46:37,044
He's still so warm.

625
00:46:37,211 --> 00:46:40,839
Yes, Geonwoo. Mom's here. I'm here.

626
00:46:40,923 --> 00:46:44,468
Geonwoo! Geonwoo, please!

627
00:46:56,647 --> 00:46:57,856
Geonwoo!

628
00:47:00,526 --> 00:47:03,737
Doctor, my Geonwoo isn't dead!

629
00:47:04,738 --> 00:47:07,866
Geonwoo, Mom's here!

630
00:47:08,200 --> 00:47:11,787
You said you could save him!

631
00:47:12,788 --> 00:47:16,291
You told me he would wake up!

632
00:47:43,485 --> 00:47:44,653
I'm sorry.

633
00:47:50,909 --> 00:47:52,077
It was me who killed him.

634
00:47:56,874 --> 00:47:58,083
Geonwoo told me

635
00:47:59,126 --> 00:48:01,545
he didn't want to go to that school.

636
00:48:05,340 --> 00:48:08,010
That it would be hard on me
to have to pay all that money.

637
00:48:09,595 --> 00:48:11,847
He said he wouldn't go.

638
00:48:15,142 --> 00:48:17,144
I made him go.

639
00:48:24,151 --> 00:48:25,527
I killed him.

640
00:48:27,404 --> 00:48:28,947
I killed my son.

641
00:48:33,076 --> 00:48:36,955
No, Mrs. Kim. It wasn't your fault.

642
00:48:38,206 --> 00:48:39,333
Geonwoo…

643
00:48:40,792 --> 00:48:42,836
Geonwoo wanted to tell you he was sorry.

644
00:48:43,879 --> 00:48:46,757
That he was thankful to be your son.

645
00:48:47,257 --> 00:48:49,551
He asked me to tell you that he loved you.

646
00:48:57,935 --> 00:48:59,394
Where did you…

647
00:49:01,480 --> 00:49:02,689
Where did you hear that?

648
00:49:10,197 --> 00:49:12,616
He sent me a letter.

649
00:49:13,742 --> 00:49:15,827
Geonwoo sent you a letter?

650
00:49:17,537 --> 00:49:18,789
In it,

651
00:49:21,041 --> 00:49:24,670
he wrote the names
of the students who bullied him.

652
00:49:25,462 --> 00:49:26,755
I'm so sorry.

653
00:49:27,798 --> 00:49:28,882
I'm sorry.

654
00:49:32,719 --> 00:49:33,971
Yoonjae.

655
00:49:41,311 --> 00:49:44,272
What's the occasion?
I was going to take the school bus.

656
00:49:45,148 --> 00:49:45,983
What's that?

657
00:49:48,610 --> 00:49:50,195
A birthday gift from Yoonjae.

658
00:49:50,278 --> 00:49:52,072
A middle school student doesn't need toys.

659
00:49:54,574 --> 00:49:55,575
Get in.

660
00:50:01,707 --> 00:50:05,293

00:50:10,382 --> 00:50:12,551
-Mrs. Kim.
-My son…

663
00:50:13,677 --> 00:50:15,178
He was bullied.

664
00:50:16,346 --> 00:50:20,809
The names of his bullies
were written in a letter.

665
00:50:23,145 --> 00:50:24,396
Please…

666
00:50:24,813 --> 00:50:26,106
Please catch them.

667
00:50:38,952 --> 00:50:42,664
Look up how to properly
pay respects to a man.

668
00:50:44,124 --> 00:50:44,958
Why?

669
00:50:46,084 --> 00:50:47,377
Just do as you're told.

670
00:50:48,086 --> 00:50:49,629
Just go.

671
00:50:50,130 --> 00:50:52,466
And don't forget to sign the guest book.

672
00:50:52,549 --> 00:50:55,594
Don't stay there to eat either.
Just come out right away, okay?

673
00:50:55,677 --> 00:50:59,347
Honey. Why do I miss our son
all of a sudden?

674
00:51:01,600 --> 00:51:03,894
Focus on taking care
of your living grandson.

677
00:51:13,779 --> 00:51:14,696
Honey!

678
00:51:16,615 --> 00:51:17,574
Dad.

679
00:51:18,700 --> 00:51:21,453
Cry. This is the time for it.

680
00:51:38,136 --> 00:51:42,557
I have greatly sinned
in my thoughts and in my words,

681
00:51:42,766 --> 00:51:45,811
in what I have done
and in what I have failed to do,

682
00:51:46,311 --> 00:51:51,191
through my fault, through my fault,
through my most grievous fault.

683
00:51:51,358 --> 00:51:53,819
Therefore I ask blessed…

684
00:51:53,902 --> 00:51:55,070
WHERE ARE YOU?

685
00:51:55,153 --> 00:51:58,573
I'M GETTING MY COUPON TO HEAVEN
HALLELUJAH

686
00:51:58,657 --> 00:52:00,367
Our son is a good kid.

687
00:52:00,450 --> 00:52:02,744
He's just surrounded by bad kids
who have done bad things.

688
00:52:02,828 --> 00:52:05,747
It'll be a little awkward
if this ends up on his permanent record.

689
00:52:06,331 --> 00:52:09,000
SHOOT, I'M AT A PSYCHIATRIC CLINIC
I'M OFFICIALLY A NUTJOB

690
00:52:09,084 --> 00:52:12,379
The kid's mom reported the case
and threw a wrench in the works.

691
00:52:12,462 --> 00:52:15,006
But I'll wait for the right time

692
00:52:16,424 --> 00:52:17,634
and get it wrapped up.

693
00:52:19,803 --> 00:52:21,555
I'm counting on you.

694
00:52:21,972 --> 00:52:23,557
Don't worry about it, sir.

695
00:52:25,517 --> 00:52:29,104
I'M HAVING DINNER WITH A COP
SO ANNOYING

696
00:52:58,383 --> 00:53:02,679
I'M HAVING DINNER WITH A COP
SO ANNOYING

697
00:53:10,437 --> 00:53:11,897
Don't touch my laptop.

698
00:53:17,777 --> 00:53:18,987
Why did you do it?

699
00:53:19,738 --> 00:53:20,614
Do what?

700
00:53:22,949 --> 00:53:24,284
Why did you do that to him?

701
00:53:27,329 --> 00:53:28,622
It wasn't me.

702
00:53:29,372 --> 00:53:30,624
What was the reason?

703
00:53:32,417 --> 00:53:34,461
Where did things start to go wrong?

704
00:53:36,129 --> 00:53:37,714
Have I wronged you in some way?

705
00:53:39,007 --> 00:53:41,092
And how did Geonwoo wrong you?

706
00:53:41,968 --> 00:53:44,387
Why did you do it? Why!

707
00:53:45,055 --> 00:53:46,431
It wasn't me!

708
00:53:48,141 --> 00:53:49,601
It wasn't me, Dad.

709
00:53:50,852 --> 00:53:53,396
I didn't do anything to Geonwoo.

710
00:53:53,772 --> 00:53:55,899
It was all the other kids.

711
00:53:56,858 --> 00:54:00,195
I swear I didn't do anything.
It wasn't me!

712
00:54:00,779 --> 00:54:02,781
I was just there
because they told me to be.

713
00:54:03,365 --> 00:54:05,700
And I just watched Geonwoo
because I was told to.

714
00:54:06,618 --> 00:54:09,704
Dad, I really didn't do anything.

715
00:54:09,871 --> 00:54:11,289
I swear I didn't.

716
00:54:11,831 --> 00:54:14,668
Please believe me. It wasn't me.

717
00:54:18,922 --> 00:54:20,048
Thank you

718
00:54:21,633 --> 00:54:23,218
for saying it wasn't you.

719
00:54:26,596 --> 00:54:29,391
Ms. Song, what is this insanity?

720
00:54:31,768 --> 00:54:34,229
They say pregnant women
shouldn't go to funerals.

721
00:54:35,480 --> 00:54:38,984
But how can I not be here
when it's for one of our kids?

722
00:54:40,735 --> 00:54:43,655
Kang Geonwoo was such a nice kid.

723
00:54:43,738 --> 00:54:45,824
His name is Kim Geonwoo.

724
00:54:45,907 --> 00:54:48,410
Oh, right. Kim Geonwoo.

725
00:54:48,785 --> 00:54:50,620
He's number one on our class list.

726
00:54:50,704 --> 00:54:53,415
Number two. Number one is Kang Hangyeol.

727
00:54:54,082 --> 00:54:57,294
Oh, that's right. I got the two mixed up.

728
00:54:57,377 --> 00:55:00,422
Ever since they were in seventh grade,
they were such good friends.

729
00:55:01,172 --> 00:55:03,883
They were joined at the hip.

730
00:55:04,509 --> 00:55:05,969
They were best friends?

731
00:55:06,428 --> 00:55:08,263
Ms. Song, I'm disappointed.

732
00:55:08,346 --> 00:55:10,932
A temporary teacher
should still know things like that.

733
00:55:11,891 --> 00:55:13,435
I guess you wouldn't know this, either.

734
00:55:14,019 --> 00:55:17,063
At the beginning of the semester,
they had a bit of a falling out.

735
00:55:22,277 --> 00:55:23,361
Hangyeol.

736
00:55:24,362 --> 00:55:25,655
Kang Hangyeol.

737
00:55:27,490 --> 00:55:28,783
Hangyeol.

738
00:55:29,284 --> 00:55:30,744
Kang Hangyeol!

739
00:55:31,995 --> 00:55:32,912
Hangyeol…

740
00:55:35,915 --> 00:55:38,043
Geonwoo was a close friend of yours.

741
00:55:38,585 --> 00:55:40,545
Did something happen between you two?

742
00:55:44,257 --> 00:55:46,134
Why don't you come clean--

743
00:55:48,261 --> 00:55:49,679
What are you doing?

744
00:55:49,763 --> 00:55:52,182
Giving him a chance to apologize
before Geonwoo's laid to rest.

745
00:55:52,265 --> 00:55:53,600
But he didn't do anything wrong.

746
00:55:53,683 --> 00:55:55,602
Mr. Kang, you have no idea what happened.

747
00:55:55,727 --> 00:55:57,604
Even if you do,
you want to pretend like you don't.

748
00:55:58,396 --> 00:56:00,523
Even if you loiter
outside someone's house,

749
00:56:00,774 --> 00:56:02,525
you can be charged for trespassing.

750
00:56:03,401 --> 00:56:05,695
If I ever see you again, I'll report you.

751
00:56:07,530 --> 00:56:08,698
Leave.

752
00:56:16,664 --> 00:56:18,416
You all are worse than the kids.

753
00:56:20,043 --> 00:56:21,795
You should be ashamed
in front of your kids.

754
00:56:27,050 --> 00:56:28,760
FULL-TIME TEACHER EMPLOYMENT CONTRACT

755
00:56:28,843 --> 00:56:30,929
NAME: SONG JEONGUK

756
00:56:31,012 --> 00:56:33,640
Give me back the letter.

757
00:56:38,812 --> 00:56:41,314
Go work as an exchange teacher
at our sister school overseas.

758
00:56:41,398 --> 00:56:42,440
I teach national history.

759
00:56:44,567 --> 00:56:46,903
You can apply for teacher training
and study overseas.

760
00:56:46,986 --> 00:56:48,696
My specialty is Korean history.

761
00:56:49,697 --> 00:56:51,825
How about studying world history then?

762
00:56:53,243 --> 00:56:54,911
Ms. Song, have you no conscience?

763
00:56:54,994 --> 00:56:58,415
How can a teacher throw their students
under the bus for their own benefit?

764
00:56:58,498 --> 00:57:01,918
For the police to properly investigate,
they need that evidence--

765
00:57:02,001 --> 00:57:04,838
That letter never existed.

766
00:57:04,921 --> 00:57:06,381
Mr. Oh.

767
00:57:08,716 --> 00:57:09,676
Yes?

768
00:57:11,511 --> 00:57:14,806
What? We can't have a funeral bus
coming to the school!

769
00:57:14,889 --> 00:57:15,974
Block it!

770
00:57:16,558 --> 00:57:18,518
Geonwoo was one of our students too.

771
00:57:18,726 --> 00:57:20,979
How can you do this to him
until the very end?

772
00:57:21,062 --> 00:57:23,398
Are you trying to turn the deceased
into a hero?

773
00:57:23,523 --> 00:57:25,108
Do you want to throw a parade for him?

774
00:57:25,191 --> 00:57:26,359
Hurry up and block it!

775
00:57:27,652 --> 00:57:29,612
-Stop!
-Stop the bus!

776
00:57:29,696 --> 00:57:31,281
-Stop!
-Get out of here!

777
00:57:32,657 --> 00:57:34,826
-Get out of here!
-Open the door, sir.

778
00:57:35,743 --> 00:57:38,663
Sir, this is private property.
Move the bus right now.

779
00:57:38,746 --> 00:57:41,124
-Get out. Move the bus.
-What are they doing here?

780
00:57:41,207 --> 00:57:43,460
-Are you out of your mind?
-Why would you come here?

781
00:57:43,543 --> 00:57:45,628
-For goodness' sake.
-Move the bus.

782
00:57:56,431 --> 00:57:57,724
Let's go, Mrs. Kim.

783
00:58:17,994 --> 00:58:19,954
What are you doing? Stop them.

784
00:58:20,038 --> 00:58:22,081
-What are you doing?
-Ms. Song, wait.

785
00:58:23,374 --> 00:58:27,462
Ms. Song. The school is strictly
off-limits to outsiders.

786
00:58:27,545 --> 00:58:29,631
Parents of our students are not outsiders.

787
00:58:30,924 --> 00:58:31,883
Let's go, Mrs. Kim.

788
00:58:32,759 --> 00:58:34,928
-Ms. Song!
-Wait.

789
00:58:35,178 --> 00:58:37,597
-Stop them!
-We can't let you inside.

790
00:58:37,680 --> 00:58:39,390
-You can't do this!
-Ms. Song.

791
00:58:39,474 --> 00:58:41,059
You can't do this.

792
00:58:41,142 --> 00:58:42,727
-Don't let them in!
-You can't go inside.

793
00:58:51,110 --> 00:58:52,570
-Ms. Song!
-You can't go inside.

794
00:58:52,654 --> 00:58:55,782
-We can't let you go inside.
-Ms. Song!

795
00:58:55,865 --> 00:58:57,075
Lock the front doors!

796
00:58:57,575 --> 00:58:59,786
-Lock the doors!
-Please stand back.

797
00:58:59,869 --> 00:59:02,163
-Hurry up and lock the doors!
-Hey! Don't push!

798
00:59:02,622 --> 00:59:04,374
-Ms. Song!
-You shouldn't be doing this.

799
00:59:23,601 --> 00:59:24,894
-No…
-No!

800
00:59:27,230 --> 00:59:28,439
We've locked the doors.

801
01:00:13,776 --> 01:00:14,861
Let's go!

802
01:00:17,238 --> 01:00:18,448
You can do it!

803
01:00:19,824 --> 01:00:21,659
You've got this, Ideun!

804
01:00:22,285 --> 01:00:23,536
Hang in there!

805
01:00:32,003 --> 01:00:32,962
Hey, Kang!

806
01:00:34,547 --> 01:00:35,632
Why are you so late?

807
01:00:35,715 --> 01:00:37,258
-You must've had a trial today.
-Yes.

808
01:00:37,342 --> 01:00:40,094
Look, it's Hangyeol. Look at this.

809
01:00:40,595 --> 01:00:42,347
I got a great shot of Hangyeol.

810
01:00:43,389 --> 01:00:45,642
Honey, look! Here they come!

811
01:00:46,809 --> 01:00:48,311
Hang in there, boys!

812
01:00:49,062 --> 01:00:50,063
Hang in there!

813
01:00:50,813 --> 01:00:52,357
Come on, Hangyeol!

814
01:00:55,443 --> 01:00:57,570
Haneum International is pulling away.

815
01:00:57,820 --> 01:01:01,449
Twenty meters, ten meters, five meters.

816
01:01:01,532 --> 01:01:02,533
Goal!

817
01:01:02,617 --> 01:01:04,369
They've won the race.

818
01:01:14,587 --> 01:01:16,255
Our kids will be okay, right?

819
01:01:17,799 --> 01:01:19,425
They've wrapped up the investigation.

820
01:01:22,970 --> 01:01:24,847
-Yes!
-Haneum Internantional!

821
01:01:24,931 --> 01:01:28,851
HANEUM BULLYING AND SUICIDE INCIDENT
BRING BACK THE LATE KIM GEONWOO!

822
01:01:37,610 --> 01:01:40,655
This isn't right.
How can you just wrap it up like this?

823
01:01:41,364 --> 01:01:43,366
Please relaunch a formal investigation.

824
01:01:43,658 --> 01:01:44,701
Get out of the car.

825
01:01:44,784 --> 01:01:46,786
Geez, the pair of you are
driving me nuts today.

826
01:01:49,997 --> 01:01:51,332
Mrs. Kim.

827
01:01:52,166 --> 01:01:53,501
Ms. Song.

828
01:01:54,919 --> 01:01:57,547
What do you want us to do?
We looked thoroughly but found nothing.

829
01:01:58,089 --> 01:02:01,217
There's no evidence
that the four of them did anything.

830
01:02:01,300 --> 01:02:04,595
I'm the evidence.
I told you, he sent me a letter.

831
01:02:05,430 --> 01:02:06,431
Hand it over then.

832
01:02:08,307 --> 01:02:09,308
See? You don't have it.

833
01:02:09,851 --> 01:02:11,436
She told you she had it before.

834
01:02:13,688 --> 01:02:16,190
She told you she saw the letter!
The suicide note!

835
01:02:18,234 --> 01:02:19,193
Ma'am.

836
01:02:20,111 --> 01:02:21,362
Find the note and bring it.

837
01:02:21,946 --> 01:02:24,323
Until you do,
you can forget the reinvestigation.

838
01:02:25,700 --> 01:02:26,701
Let's go.

839
01:02:27,535 --> 01:02:28,411
-Let's go inside.
-Let's go.

840
01:02:34,333 --> 01:02:35,626
Mrs. Kim.

841
01:02:36,544 --> 01:02:39,297
HANEUM BULLYING AND SUICIDE INCIDENT
BRING BACK THE LATE KIM GEONWOO!

842
01:02:39,380 --> 01:02:42,550
Big smiles, everyone. One, two, three!

843
01:02:42,633 --> 01:02:46,262
Okay, one more time. One, two!

844
01:02:47,180 --> 01:02:50,725
Nice. Let's take one last picture.
One, two, three.

845
01:02:51,476 --> 01:02:53,561
All right. That came out nicely.

846
01:02:53,644 --> 01:02:55,146
-Everybody, clap!
-All right.

847
01:02:57,231 --> 01:02:58,566
Smile bigger.

848
01:02:58,649 --> 01:03:00,067
Hello, Mr. Chairman.

849
01:03:00,902 --> 01:03:02,445
Hold on a second.

850
01:03:02,528 --> 01:03:03,821
What's up?

851
01:03:05,698 --> 01:03:06,657
What?

852
01:03:07,742 --> 01:03:08,576
Say what?

853
01:03:13,164 --> 01:03:17,126
I'm the Grade 8 Class 3 homeroom teacher
at Haneum International Middle School.

854
01:03:17,210 --> 01:03:18,628
My name is Song Jeonguk.

855
01:03:19,128 --> 01:03:22,965
In order to reveal the truth
behind a case of bullying at this school

856
01:03:23,466 --> 01:03:26,969
and demand a proper investigation,
I'm sitting in front of this camera.

857
01:03:27,053 --> 01:03:28,638
The school authorities at Haneum

858
01:03:28,721 --> 01:03:31,140
confiscated a letter written by Geonwoo

859
01:03:31,641 --> 01:03:33,059
and tried to conceal this incident.

860
01:03:33,226 --> 01:03:35,144
The perpetrators named
by Geonwoo in the letter,

861
01:03:35,394 --> 01:03:39,816
Do Yoonjae, Park Kyubeom, Jeong Ideun,
and Kang Hangyeol.

862
01:03:40,566 --> 01:03:42,485
Not one of them has apologized.

863
01:03:42,568 --> 01:03:44,654
To everyone who watches this video,

864
01:03:45,446 --> 01:03:47,824
I'd like to make an earnest request.

865
01:03:51,160 --> 01:03:53,371
Damn it. What if we end up in the slammer?

866
01:03:53,454 --> 01:03:55,081
Come on, no way.

867
01:03:56,040 --> 01:03:57,375
We'll go if we have to.

868
01:03:58,042 --> 01:03:59,961
Just think of it as a mini vacation.

869
01:04:00,545 --> 01:04:02,588
We wouldn't be there for long anyway.

870
01:04:16,352 --> 01:04:17,311
What happened?

871
01:04:17,979 --> 01:04:21,232
The case was picked up
by another precinct.

872
01:04:23,276 --> 01:04:24,485
They're going to reinvestigate.

873
01:04:28,739 --> 01:04:31,617
From now on,
we'll have to get our oars in sync.

874
01:04:32,869 --> 01:04:36,247
If even one of us slips up,
we'll all drown.

875
01:04:36,330 --> 01:04:38,332
There's no way out of this.

876
01:04:39,041 --> 01:04:40,501
Let's have them turn themselves in.

877
01:04:40,710 --> 01:04:43,421
How can you make it sound so simple?

878
01:04:43,504 --> 01:04:46,215
All kids roughhouse a little
when they're playing around.

879
01:04:46,549 --> 01:04:47,967
If that's a crime,

880
01:04:48,467 --> 01:04:51,137
every person who went to school
in this country is a criminal.

881
01:04:51,220 --> 01:04:52,805
We'd have to turn ourselves in first.

882
01:04:54,056 --> 01:04:57,018
What if we just partially acknowledged it?

883
01:04:57,602 --> 01:05:00,521
It might lessen the consequences a bit,
but a criminal is a criminal.

884
01:05:00,605 --> 01:05:01,939
We can't admit to it.

885
01:05:02,023 --> 01:05:04,108
If they turn themselves in,
they won't be innocent.

886
01:05:05,192 --> 01:05:07,194
Reach a settlement with his mother first.

887
01:05:07,278 --> 01:05:08,362
We cannot settle.

888
01:05:09,155 --> 01:05:11,240
If they aren't acquitted,
it'll go on their criminal record.

889
01:05:11,824 --> 01:05:13,200
What are you suggesting we do?

890
01:05:13,701 --> 01:05:15,119
Is there really no way?

891
01:05:15,202 --> 01:05:17,246
The police won't find the evidence.

892
01:05:17,330 --> 01:05:20,249
The letter, the cellphone.
Everything's gone.

893
01:05:21,667 --> 01:05:23,294
We just have to get our stories straight.

894
01:05:23,377 --> 01:05:25,755
With the homeroom teacher
having blown the whistle,

895
01:05:25,838 --> 01:05:27,256
who would even believe us?

896
01:05:27,340 --> 01:05:29,425
She spread false information
and is blackmailing us.

897
01:05:29,508 --> 01:05:31,218
Song Jeonguk is the liar, not us.

898
01:05:31,302 --> 01:05:33,429
She is blackmailing the school
and the parents

899
01:05:33,512 --> 01:05:35,473
to get a full-time teaching position.

900
01:05:36,057 --> 01:05:39,560
That's how we'll drive her into a corner.

901
01:05:41,729 --> 01:05:43,564
-Here she comes!
-There she is.

902
01:05:52,531 --> 01:05:55,326
Is it true you tried to negotiate
a settlement on behalf of the victim?

903
01:05:55,409 --> 01:05:58,329
Were you aware the school filed a suit
for the spread of false information?

904
01:06:13,928 --> 01:06:14,845
Were there any issues?

905
01:06:15,429 --> 01:06:18,641
Who knows? I'm sure Yoonjae did well.
I wasn't in the interrogation room.

906
01:06:19,100 --> 01:06:21,185
-This way, sir.
-Which law firm are you from?

907
01:06:21,560 --> 01:06:22,645
Good day, sir.

908
01:06:32,029 --> 01:06:33,364
His dad's a lawyer?

909
01:06:33,447 --> 01:06:35,282
Apparently so.

910
01:06:36,075 --> 01:06:38,244
They say he's a well-known
inmate consultation attorney.

911
01:06:40,830 --> 01:06:42,164
Don't say a single word.

912
01:06:43,582 --> 01:06:44,667
Okay.

913
01:06:49,547 --> 01:06:50,589
Hi.

914
01:06:51,048 --> 01:06:53,509
So you're Hangyeol.
You're a good-looking kid.

915
01:06:53,592 --> 01:06:54,969
Let's make this quick and easy.

916
01:06:55,052 --> 01:06:56,971
I'd like to finish this quickly too.

917
01:06:57,054 --> 01:06:58,222
Hangyeol.

918
01:06:58,556 --> 01:07:00,558
You saw Geonwoo leave
on the day he drowned, right?

919
01:07:02,560 --> 01:07:04,228
That early in the morning? How?

920
01:07:04,311 --> 01:07:06,731
A dashcam got a perfect shot of your face.

921
01:07:06,814 --> 01:07:09,525
It's possible since they were roommates.
He's also a light sleeper.

922
01:07:09,608 --> 01:07:10,860
Why didn't you stop him from going?

923
01:07:11,444 --> 01:07:13,904
For all he knew,
he could've been out to get some air.

924
01:07:13,988 --> 01:07:16,115
Can't your son speak for himself?

925
01:07:16,198 --> 01:07:18,701
Hey, kid. Let me hear your voice.

926
01:07:18,784 --> 01:07:21,162
So what did Kang Hangyeol do after that?

927
01:07:23,205 --> 01:07:25,249
He fell back asleep
until the morning bell went off.

928
01:07:25,499 --> 01:07:26,500
Is that so?

929
01:07:27,084 --> 01:07:28,252
Let's take a look.

930
01:07:28,586 --> 01:07:29,670
TESTIMONY

931
01:07:34,467 --> 01:07:35,551
In March,

932
01:07:35,634 --> 01:07:38,429
you called Geonwoo to the pool
and subjected him to water torture.

933
01:07:38,512 --> 01:07:40,222
Hangyeol, why'd you ask me to come here?

934
01:07:42,600 --> 01:07:43,976
That never happened.

935
01:07:44,060 --> 01:07:47,021
Kang Hangyeol threatened
and assaulted Geonwoo with a weapon--

936
01:07:47,104 --> 01:07:48,939
Wait, hold on. Who gave that statement?

937
01:07:49,023 --> 01:07:50,816
You stole Yoonjae's drone too, didn't you?

938
01:07:50,900 --> 01:07:54,111
-That was a birthday gift.
-A gift that costs four million won?

939
01:07:54,195 --> 01:07:56,155
Those are all lies made up by Do Yoonjae.

940
01:07:56,238 --> 01:07:57,239
Do you have any evidence?

941
01:07:57,323 --> 01:08:00,951
Do Yoonjae and Jeong Ideun's statements
say the exact same thing.

942
01:08:01,535 --> 01:08:04,163
All the times, locations,
and details match up.

943
01:08:04,789 --> 01:08:06,332
They colluded to come up with a story.

944
01:08:07,041 --> 01:08:08,417
Their lawyer schemed all this up.

945
01:08:09,001 --> 01:08:11,670
Hangeyol. You threatened
to kill Geonwoo before, didn't you?

946
01:08:11,754 --> 01:08:13,130
No, he didn't!

947
01:08:13,214 --> 01:08:15,091
You invited your friends on your birthday

948
01:08:15,174 --> 01:08:17,510
and nearly killed Geonwoo as they watched.

949
01:08:18,552 --> 01:08:20,096
His wrists.

950
01:08:20,179 --> 01:08:22,098
You cut his wrists like this with a knife.

951
01:08:22,181 --> 01:08:23,599
-Isn't that right?
-Detective!

952
01:08:27,561 --> 01:08:28,896
Hangyeol did what?

953
01:08:29,563 --> 01:08:31,816
On his birthday… His birthday…

954
01:08:31,899 --> 01:08:33,818
Did you say he assaulted
and nearly killed Geonwoo?

955
01:08:38,364 --> 01:08:41,700
When Geonwoo is smiling like this?

956
01:08:46,413 --> 01:08:47,623
Ma'am.

957
01:08:47,706 --> 01:08:49,792
Senior Superintendant General Park
wants to see you.

958
01:08:51,961 --> 01:08:55,214
Sir. How have you been?

959
01:08:55,297 --> 01:08:57,091
Just living it easy.

960
01:08:59,593 --> 01:09:02,263
Things must be tough right now
because of your grandson.

961
01:09:04,181 --> 01:09:05,599
I'm too ashamed to face you.

962
01:09:08,060 --> 01:09:10,855
Don't worry about me,

963
01:09:10,938 --> 01:09:12,565
and act according to your convictions.

964
01:09:13,983 --> 01:09:14,984
Ma'am.

965
01:09:15,568 --> 01:09:17,444
-What is it?
-The informant is here.

966
01:09:18,028 --> 01:09:18,863
Right.

967
01:09:19,655 --> 01:09:21,824
Well, take care, sir.

968
01:09:34,503 --> 01:09:36,589
Detective Choi. Bring her in.

969
01:09:41,927 --> 01:09:43,179
Is that the guy?

970
01:09:45,055 --> 01:09:46,432
Geonwoo's lawyer…

971
01:09:46,515 --> 01:09:49,476
Lieutenant Shin. Request an arrest warrant
for Kang Hangyeol.

972
01:09:49,560 --> 01:09:52,104
-Make sure to add destruction of evidence.
-Dad!

973
01:09:52,188 --> 01:09:54,773
-No. It's not true!
-Dad!

974
01:09:55,774 --> 01:09:57,193
-Dad!
-It's not true!

975
01:09:57,610 --> 01:09:58,903
I can explain!

976
01:09:58,986 --> 01:10:01,280
-That's not what happened.
-Dad!

977
01:10:01,530 --> 01:10:02,656
Dad!

978
01:10:02,740 --> 01:10:04,283
I HAVE BEEN THE VICTIM OF BULLYING…

979
01:10:04,366 --> 01:10:06,660
After we get rid of the note,
our work is done, right?

980
01:10:06,744 --> 01:10:11,123
We had to have one more go down
to end this game.

981
01:10:12,249 --> 01:10:13,834
I feel kind of bad for Hangyeol's dad.

982
01:10:13,918 --> 01:10:16,420
What's wrong? Do you want to
switch places with him?

983
01:10:16,503 --> 01:10:17,504
No.

984
01:10:18,923 --> 01:10:22,301
It sure feels reassuring with
the senior superintendent general here.

985
01:10:25,930 --> 01:10:27,932
Sir, thank you.

986
01:10:28,015 --> 01:10:29,725
Don't overthink it.

987
01:10:30,517 --> 01:10:33,520
Just think of our kids
who have their whole lives ahead of them.

988
01:10:33,604 --> 01:10:34,939
All right, let's have a drink.

989
01:10:36,565 --> 01:10:37,691
Cheers!

990
01:10:50,537 --> 01:10:53,040
Jiho!

991
01:10:55,376 --> 01:10:58,170
Nam Jiho!

992
01:11:00,214 --> 01:11:01,382
Nam Jiho!

993
01:11:05,928 --> 01:11:07,346
Where's Jiho?

994
01:11:09,848 --> 01:11:10,975
At home probably.

995
01:11:11,642 --> 01:11:12,893
Why? Don't you know her address?

996
01:11:13,477 --> 01:11:14,645
What's the reason?

997
01:11:15,854 --> 01:11:16,855
Why me?

998
01:11:19,358 --> 01:11:21,443
Why does it have to be my son?

999
01:11:24,655 --> 01:11:25,698
I'm not sure.

1000
01:11:27,199 --> 01:11:28,909
I was curious about that too,

1001
01:11:29,410 --> 01:11:31,578
so I asked my son.

1002
01:11:34,331 --> 01:11:35,582
He just doesn't like him.

1003
01:11:38,752 --> 01:11:39,712
I feel that way too.

1004
01:11:43,924 --> 01:11:45,843
Let go! Let go of me!

1005
01:11:53,058 --> 01:11:54,893
He's going to end up dying at this rate.

1006
01:12:23,797 --> 01:12:26,133
I'm here to see
inmate number 829, Kang Hangyeol.

1007
01:12:26,633 --> 01:12:28,802
Inmate 829 has rejected your visit.

1008
01:12:30,846 --> 01:12:32,806
-Why?
-I said Kang Hochang was here,

1009
01:12:32,890 --> 01:12:34,391
and he refused to come out.

1010
01:12:45,319 --> 01:12:47,946
Ma'am, please tell Hangyeol

1011
01:12:49,531 --> 01:12:51,200
that I'm sorry.

1012
01:13:35,828 --> 01:13:37,454
-Okay.
-Goodbye.

1013
01:13:37,538 --> 01:13:39,790
Get back safely and don't get drenched!

1014
01:13:40,124 --> 01:13:43,127
Don't run! The road's slippery! Goodness.

1015
01:13:44,586 --> 01:13:46,505
-The dorm's going to close soon.
-We're doomed.

1016
01:13:46,588 --> 01:13:48,132
-Let's hurry.
-Hey, be careful.

1017
01:13:59,393 --> 01:14:02,271
-Hello.
-Hi, welcome.

1018
01:14:02,521 --> 01:14:05,858
Ma'am, could I ask you a few questions?

1019
01:14:06,358 --> 01:14:08,360
Yes, that's him.

1020
01:14:08,444 --> 01:14:12,406
He used to come here often
and buy bread, milk, and even coffee.

1021
01:14:12,489 --> 01:14:13,949
-He came often?
-Yes.

1022
01:14:14,032 --> 01:14:16,034
But it's a 30-minute walk
from here to the school.

1023
01:14:16,118 --> 01:14:18,328
Gosh, you know there's nothing
in front of that school.

1024
01:14:18,912 --> 01:14:21,457
But he always came
in the middle of the night.

1025
01:14:22,291 --> 01:14:24,710
His face always looked just awful.

1026
01:14:25,627 --> 01:14:27,754
He had bruises everywhere, a busted lip,

1027
01:14:27,838 --> 01:14:29,756
and his arms and legs were
in bad shape too.

1028
01:14:30,716 --> 01:14:34,052
Goodness. I felt so bad for the poor kid

1029
01:14:34,219 --> 01:14:36,722
that I used to give him
an extra banana milk.

1030
01:14:38,223 --> 01:14:39,808
What was his name again?

1031
01:14:39,975 --> 01:14:42,686
-It's Geonwoo.
-No, not Geonwoo.

1032
01:14:43,353 --> 01:14:46,231
What's the name of that one newspaper?

1033
01:14:46,315 --> 01:14:50,068
The Hankyoreh.
That's what his name sounded like.

1034
01:14:51,069 --> 01:14:52,321
Not Geonwoo?

1035
01:14:54,907 --> 01:14:56,450
Hangyeol came here?

1036
01:14:56,992 --> 01:15:00,829
Hankyoreh. He was the pitiful boy.

1037
01:15:04,124 --> 01:15:05,667
-Hangyeol?
-Yes.

1038
01:15:09,463 --> 01:15:10,547
Hello.

1039
01:15:15,344 --> 01:15:17,012
-Hangyeol came here?
-Yes.

1040
01:15:17,804 --> 01:15:22,309
He would always buy ointment
and pain relief patches.

1041
01:15:28,106 --> 01:15:29,191
Hangyeol?

1042
01:16:02,891 --> 01:16:04,226
Are we a joke?

1043
01:16:10,774 --> 01:16:12,359
Tell us the truth.

1044
01:16:12,943 --> 01:16:13,860
Hey.

1045
01:16:14,778 --> 01:16:15,696
You bastard!

1046
01:16:16,738 --> 01:16:18,365
He's trying to hold out.

1047
01:16:19,491 --> 01:16:20,492
Hey.

1048
01:16:22,661 --> 01:16:24,705
You think we're a joke, don't you?

1049
01:16:25,998 --> 01:16:27,082
Damn it.

1050
01:16:33,338 --> 01:16:34,840
You ratted us out, you bastard!

1051
01:16:34,923 --> 01:16:36,758
It wasn't me!

1052
01:16:38,135 --> 01:16:41,179
Geonwoo… Geonwoo went to Ms. Song
and narked on you guys.

1053
01:16:43,056 --> 01:16:43,890
Do you want to die?

1054
01:16:46,059 --> 01:16:47,227
You want to live?

1055
01:16:55,027 --> 01:16:56,278
Want to trade places?

1056
01:16:59,197 --> 01:17:01,325
Hey, you'll catch a cold. Let's go.

1057
01:17:09,750 --> 01:17:11,168
Let's give Hangyeol a hand.

1058
01:17:13,503 --> 01:17:15,297
Nice shot, Hangyeol.

1059
01:17:15,797 --> 01:17:16,882
Nice!

1060
01:17:48,163 --> 01:17:50,540
SAEMGOL SPICY FRESHWATER FISH STEW

1061
01:17:50,624 --> 01:17:51,583
Ms. Song!

1062
01:17:53,710 --> 01:17:55,337
Ms. Song!

1063
01:18:02,010 --> 01:18:03,595
Hangyeol wasn't the instigator.

1064
01:18:03,929 --> 01:18:06,139
He was a victim, just like Geonwoo.

1065
01:18:06,556 --> 01:18:08,850
Geonwoo wrote Hangyeol's name

1066
01:18:08,934 --> 01:18:10,394
and held him accountable.

1067
01:18:10,977 --> 01:18:13,105
He put Hangyeol's name at the end.

1068
01:18:14,356 --> 01:18:16,233
That means he had room
in his heart to forgive him.

1069
01:18:17,984 --> 01:18:20,404
If it's true that Geonwoo would've
been willing to forgive him,

1070
01:18:22,072 --> 01:18:23,949
you took away any chance
he had to be forgiven.

1071
01:18:28,912 --> 01:18:31,540
Ms. Song!

1072
01:18:32,416 --> 01:18:34,000
Don't testify tomorrow!

1073
01:18:34,084 --> 01:18:37,170
Hangyeol is Geonwoo! Ms. Song!

1074
01:18:37,254 --> 01:18:39,673
I'll fight hard until the end
to bring the truth to light.

1075
01:18:39,923 --> 01:18:41,508
How does it feel to accuse your students?

1076
01:18:41,591 --> 01:18:43,385
Why did you reveal the names
of the students?

1077
01:18:43,468 --> 01:18:46,805
-Could you tell us how you feel?
-He's here!

1078
01:18:46,888 --> 01:18:48,890
How does it feel
to be defending your own son?

1079
01:18:48,974 --> 01:18:51,101
-Coming through.
-Move to the side, please.

1080
01:19:08,702 --> 01:19:10,203
Lift up your head.

1081
01:19:13,707 --> 01:19:15,417
Let me see my son's face.

1082
01:19:25,510 --> 01:19:27,721
Case number 7416, defendant Kang Hangyeol.

1083
01:19:36,396 --> 01:19:38,690
Case number 7416.

1084
01:19:39,983 --> 01:19:41,526
Defendant, Kang Hangyeol.

PROSECUTION

1086
01:19:57,250 --> 01:19:58,960
COUNSEL

1087
01:19:59,044 --> 01:20:00,295
Please be seated.

1088
01:20:05,967 --> 01:20:09,387
Prosecution, state your position.

1089
01:20:13,558 --> 01:20:15,435
""The defendant, Kang Hangyeol,

1090
01:20:15,519 --> 01:20:18,647
called the victim, Kim Geonwoo,
on March 3, 2017

1091
01:20:19,314 --> 01:20:22,484
to the Haneum International Middle School
swimming pool, where he assaulted him,

1092
01:20:22,859 --> 01:20:25,612
and for three months,
until May 18, when the victim

1093
01:20:25,695 --> 01:20:27,823
threw himself into a lake,

1094
01:20:27,906 --> 01:20:31,618
he humiliated, coerced, threatened,
and inflicted injury on the victim.""

1095
01:20:32,869 --> 01:20:35,163
Counselor. Does the defendant
admit the charges?

1096
01:20:40,794 --> 01:20:42,379
The defendant, Kang Hangyeol,

1097
01:20:43,004 --> 01:20:46,341
has never participated
in any criminal acts

1098
01:20:46,424 --> 01:20:48,426
that led to the death of Kim Geonwoo.

1099
01:20:49,135 --> 01:20:50,846
He denies the charges.

1100
01:20:53,807 --> 01:20:56,226
I call Song Jeonguk to the witness stand.

1101
01:20:56,309 --> 01:21:00,355
""I swear to tell the whole truth
without hiding or embellishing any facts,

1102
01:21:00,438 --> 01:21:03,692
and if there is any untruth,
I vow to accept the penalty for perjury.

1103
01:21:03,775 --> 01:21:05,652
Witness, Song Jeonguk.""

1104
01:21:05,735 --> 01:21:06,778
WITNESS

1105
01:21:07,821 --> 01:21:10,949
Witness, what did you write
under occupation?

1106
01:21:11,032 --> 01:21:13,451
Counselor. We're starting
with the prosecution.

1107
01:21:13,785 --> 01:21:15,787
The witness, Song Jeonguk,
is not a teacher.

1108
01:21:15,871 --> 01:21:18,623
For the testimony to have veracity,
every small detail must be truthful.

1109
01:21:21,585 --> 01:21:24,629
Witness. Are you currently a teacher?

1110
01:21:25,171 --> 01:21:28,174
I'm preparing for my appointment exam,
as my contract has ended.

1111
01:21:28,925 --> 01:21:31,177
I was a teacher
during the time of the incident.

1112
01:21:31,761 --> 01:21:34,848
Please revise the witness's occupation
to unemployed.

1113
01:21:35,432 --> 01:21:36,892
We'll be checking things thoroughly.

1114
01:21:38,059 --> 01:21:39,853
-You may question the witness.
-Witness.

1115
01:21:40,687 --> 01:21:44,107
Did the victim, Kim Geonwoo,
send you a suicide note?

1116
01:21:44,524 --> 01:21:45,901
Yes, he did.

1117
01:21:45,984 --> 01:21:48,445
He said he had been bullied
for a long time,

1118
01:21:48,528 --> 01:21:50,363
and because he was scared
they might retaliate,

1119
01:21:50,447 --> 01:21:52,449
he couldn't tell anyone about it.

1120
01:21:53,283 --> 01:21:54,117
Do Yoonjae.

1121
01:21:56,119 --> 01:21:57,495
Park Kyubeom.

1122
01:21:58,580 --> 01:21:59,414
Jeong Ideun.

1123
01:22:00,665 --> 01:22:02,042
Kang Hangyeol.

1124
01:22:03,126 --> 01:22:06,755
The names of the perpetrators
were listed in the suicide note.

1125
01:22:07,422 --> 01:22:09,799
Evidence cannot be accepted
without an original copy.

1126
01:22:09,883 --> 01:22:13,178
The principal and the parents
of the perpetrators

1127
01:22:13,261 --> 01:22:14,638
saw the note.

1128
01:22:15,680 --> 01:22:17,432
They requested
that we do not disclose the note,

1129
01:22:17,515 --> 01:22:19,768
which contained
the names of their children.

1130
01:22:20,268 --> 01:22:22,312
Nothing of the sort ever existed.

1131
01:22:22,395 --> 01:22:23,939
Song Jeonguk testified

1132
01:22:24,022 --> 01:22:26,608
that she gave you the suicide note.

1133
01:22:27,442 --> 01:22:31,029
She told me Geonwoo had sent her a letter,
so I asked her to bring it.

1134
01:22:31,613 --> 01:22:33,490
But instead of bringing the letter,

1135
01:22:33,573 --> 01:22:35,742
she only demanded to be hired
as a full-time teacher.

1136
01:22:36,785 --> 01:22:39,162
She said she would handle
the matter discreetly.

1137
01:22:40,372 --> 01:22:43,249
I refused her demand,
as it went against regulations.

1138
01:22:44,668 --> 01:22:47,837
Then, I guess it's possible
that Song Jeonguk could've had

1139
01:22:48,672 --> 01:22:50,924
a grudge against you
because of that incident?

1140
01:22:51,049 --> 01:22:52,634
She came and threatened me

1141
01:22:52,717 --> 01:22:55,053
and filed a malicious complaint
with the education office.

1142
01:22:55,345 --> 01:22:57,514
She also brought shame
to a prestigious school

1143
01:22:57,639 --> 01:22:59,683
by spreading false information.

1144
01:22:59,933 --> 01:23:01,267
I have no further questions.

1145
01:23:04,604 --> 01:23:05,689
Are you sure this path

1146
01:23:07,107 --> 01:23:08,066
is the right one?

1147
01:23:08,942 --> 01:23:10,652
If you trust and follow me,
you'll survive.

1148
01:23:20,829 --> 01:23:21,955
I quit.

1149
01:23:22,956 --> 01:23:24,374
Because I was so heartbroken.

1150
01:23:26,126 --> 01:23:29,879
""I swear to tell the whole truth
without hiding or embellishing any facts,

1151
01:23:30,463 --> 01:23:33,883
and if there is any untruth,
I vow to accept the penalty for perjury.

1152
01:23:34,676 --> 01:23:36,386
Witness, Do Yoonjae.""

1153
01:23:38,805 --> 01:23:40,098
Dad.

1154
01:23:41,224 --> 01:23:43,309
Why is Yoonjae in a school uniform?

1155
01:23:45,854 --> 01:23:47,313
He went back to school.

1156
01:23:47,814 --> 01:23:51,609
My friend, Kim Geonwoo, was popular
because he did well in school

1157
01:23:52,235 --> 01:23:54,112
and had a good personality.

1158
01:23:57,490 --> 01:23:59,284
It was Hangyeol's birthday that day.

1159
01:23:59,868 --> 01:24:02,203
Geonwoo said he'd throw him a party
and asked us to come.

1160
01:24:02,787 --> 01:24:05,707
I really didn't want to go,
but I went because of Geonwoo.

1161
01:24:06,291 --> 01:24:07,917
Hangyeol doesn't have any friends,

1162
01:24:09,878 --> 01:24:11,421
and he's really strange.

1163
01:24:12,005 --> 01:24:14,924
Geonwoo was passed out
on the floor of the pool.

1164
01:24:15,633 --> 01:24:17,469
We tried to call an ambulance,

1165
01:24:18,803 --> 01:24:21,890
but Hangyeol refused to let us.

1166
01:24:22,515 --> 01:24:24,601
-That's not true…
-I don't know the reason why.

1167
01:24:24,684 --> 01:24:27,437
That's not true… It's not true.

1168
01:24:28,063 --> 01:24:29,814
I performed CPR on him.

1169
01:24:32,984 --> 01:24:34,861
My dad taught me how to before.

1170
01:24:35,612 --> 01:24:37,363
Geonwoo, who was on the verge of death,

1171
01:24:40,116 --> 01:24:41,284
came back to life.

1172
01:24:42,994 --> 01:24:44,829
You made me do it.

1173
01:24:45,789 --> 01:24:48,041
-You made me do it!
-Hangyeol!

1174
01:24:48,792 --> 01:24:51,086
You're the ones who bullied him!

1175
01:24:51,586 --> 01:24:54,964
-No! I'll do the talking.
-You're the ones who killed him!

1176
01:24:55,048 --> 01:24:56,382
I'll do the talking.

1177
01:24:57,926 --> 01:25:00,345
-Hangyeol.
-You made me do it!

1178
01:25:00,428 --> 01:25:02,472
-Hangeyol.
-I didn't do it!

1179
01:25:03,848 --> 01:25:06,142
Hangyeol, let Dad do the talking.

1180
01:25:06,226 --> 01:25:09,020
-Counselor, don't do this. Move!
-But they keep lying!

1181
01:25:09,104 --> 01:25:12,273
-I didn't do it, Dad!
-Get out! Go on.

1182
01:25:12,357 --> 01:25:15,401
Dad!

1183
01:25:19,030 --> 01:25:23,076
Court is adjourned until 10 a.m. tomorrow.

1184
01:25:34,003 --> 01:25:37,006
HOSPITAL ENTRANCE

1185
01:26:15,837 --> 01:26:18,464
What is your relationship
with the victim, Kim Geonwoo?

1186
01:26:19,048 --> 01:26:21,176
-We went to elementary school together.
-Again.

1187
01:26:22,010 --> 01:26:24,012
-Do it properly.
-Geez.

1188
01:26:24,721 --> 01:26:26,764
You can tell he was a former general.

1189
01:26:26,848 --> 01:26:28,391
He has the eyes of a pro.

1190
01:26:28,975 --> 01:26:31,436
-We lived in the same apartment--
-Again.

1191
01:26:31,936 --> 01:26:33,521
Jiho, you need to do a good job.

1192
01:26:34,314 --> 01:26:36,274
-We went to elementary school together.
-Again!

1193
01:26:36,357 --> 01:26:39,319
The old lady knows how to handle people.

1194
01:26:39,402 --> 01:26:40,528
She's the pro.

1195
01:26:40,612 --> 01:26:43,031
-We went to elementary--
-Do it with sincerity!

1196
01:26:44,282 --> 01:26:46,367
I'm not doing it!

1197
01:26:46,451 --> 01:26:47,619
Let go of me!

1198
01:26:49,495 --> 01:26:50,705
You little punk!

1199
01:26:51,789 --> 01:26:52,999
This is tough.

1200
01:26:53,082 --> 01:26:54,834
That girl, I swear…

1201
01:27:09,682 --> 01:27:10,934
Excuse me.

1202
01:27:16,022 --> 01:27:18,358
Mrs. Park!

1203
01:27:19,442 --> 01:27:22,612
-Mrs. Park!
-Jiho!

1204
01:27:23,112 --> 01:27:25,323
Oh, no! Jiho!

1205
01:27:28,826 --> 01:27:29,869
Jiho.

1206
01:27:30,870 --> 01:27:32,205
I have a favor to ask.

1207
01:27:32,288 --> 01:27:33,498
Jiho!

1208
01:27:34,290 --> 01:27:37,377
Open the door! Open it!

1209
01:27:37,460 --> 01:27:38,378
Jiho!

1210
01:27:39,879 --> 01:27:41,172
Honey!

1211
01:27:43,258 --> 01:27:46,886
Jiho, I'm really sorry,

1212
01:27:47,845 --> 01:27:51,975
but could you be honest tomorrow
and tell everyone what you know?

1213
01:27:52,934 --> 01:27:54,644
You know Hangyeol wasn't there.

1214
01:27:55,979 --> 01:27:59,190
If I tell the truth,
what will you do for me?

1215
01:28:00,608 --> 01:28:03,611
I'll give you everything.
I can give you everything I own.

1216
01:28:06,197 --> 01:28:07,323
Please.

1217
01:28:08,950 --> 01:28:10,368
I beg you.

1218
01:28:16,207 --> 01:28:18,543
But you just have one kid, Hangyeol.

1219
01:28:18,626 --> 01:28:20,086
That side has three.

1220
01:28:20,878 --> 01:28:22,046
Do Yoonjae.

1221
01:28:22,755 --> 01:28:25,466
-Park Kyubeom. Jeong Ideun.
-Hey! Jiho!

1222
01:28:25,550 --> 01:28:27,969
Their dads already gave me
three times the money.

1223
01:28:28,052 --> 01:28:30,054
-Hey.
-Get out of there!

1224
01:28:30,138 --> 01:28:31,973
Hurry up and get out of there!

1225
01:28:32,056 --> 01:28:34,726
Nam Jiho! Get out of there right now!

1226
01:28:34,809 --> 01:28:36,019
I'm sorry,

1227
01:28:37,520 --> 01:28:38,896
but could you cut me some slack?

1228
01:28:39,272 --> 01:28:41,232
Jiho! Get out of the car!

1229
01:28:41,357 --> 01:28:43,067
-Come out!
-Open the door!

1230
01:28:51,034 --> 01:28:51,951
All right.

1231
01:28:53,619 --> 01:28:54,746
Get out of the car!

1232
01:28:55,038 --> 01:28:56,831
-Jiho!
-My gosh.

1233
01:28:56,914 --> 01:28:59,167
Stop the car!

1234
01:28:59,500 --> 01:29:00,793
My God! Jiho!

1235
01:29:15,558 --> 01:29:17,435
Are you okay? Come on.

1236
01:29:22,982 --> 01:29:24,942
Gosh, what a psycho.

1237
01:29:26,277 --> 01:29:27,904
All right, let's go, everyone.

1238
01:29:31,074 --> 01:29:35,161
""I swear to tell the whole truth
without hiding or embellishing any facts,

1239
01:29:35,244 --> 01:29:39,082
and if there is any untruth,
I vow to accept the penalty for perjury.

1240
01:29:39,540 --> 01:29:41,918
Witness, Nam Jiho.""

1241
01:29:42,877 --> 01:29:44,587
Prosecution, you may question the witness.

1242
01:29:45,755 --> 01:29:49,592
You witnessed Kim Geonwoo being assaulted.

1243
01:29:50,218 --> 01:29:51,177
Is that correct?

1244
01:29:54,722 --> 01:29:57,183
-Yes.
-Where did it take place?

1245
01:29:58,226 --> 01:30:00,103
At Kim Geonwoo's apartment.

1246
01:30:00,728 --> 01:30:02,814
Could you be more specific?

1247
01:30:03,648 --> 01:30:04,857
They tied

1248
01:30:05,775 --> 01:30:08,152
a leash to Geonwoo's neck
and dragged him around.

1249
01:30:08,861 --> 01:30:11,364
They made him lick food off the floor

1250
01:30:12,365 --> 01:30:14,283
and said he should die like his dad did.

1251
01:30:15,827 --> 01:30:17,537
They said they would help him do it.

1252
01:30:20,832 --> 01:30:21,999
What else?

1253
01:30:23,209 --> 01:30:24,585
Also,

1254
01:30:25,461 --> 01:30:27,296
they threatened him with a knife

1255
01:30:28,840 --> 01:30:31,092
and cut his wrists with it.

1256
01:30:36,681 --> 01:30:40,726
-You bastard!
-Bailiff! Take her outside!

1257
01:30:40,810 --> 01:30:43,813
-You bastard!
-Come here! Calm down!

1258
01:30:43,896 --> 01:30:46,649
I will kill you! You bastard!

1259
01:30:46,732 --> 01:30:49,318
-Bailiff, take her outside.
-I will kill you!

1260
01:30:49,402 --> 01:30:53,281
Get off me!
I'm going to kill that bastard!

1261
01:30:53,656 --> 01:30:58,286
Get off me.
Judge! Give him the death penalty!

1262
01:30:58,453 --> 01:31:01,456
Please give him the death penalty.
Geonwoo!

1263
01:31:01,539 --> 01:31:05,084
-Geonwoo! My baby…
-Calm down, ma'am.

1264
01:31:05,251 --> 01:31:09,505
-Calm down.
-Get off! Get off me!

1265
01:31:12,091 --> 01:31:14,844
Let go! Let go of me, you jerks!

1266
01:31:15,011 --> 01:31:18,639
-I'm going to kill him!
-Lift her up!

1267
01:31:20,016 --> 01:31:23,686
If you make a scene,
you will be removed from the courtroom.

1268
01:31:24,770 --> 01:31:26,230
Prosecution, please continue.

1269
01:31:29,609 --> 01:31:32,153
He unlawfully entered
the victim's residence

1270
01:31:32,236 --> 01:31:34,155
and threatened to kill him with a weapon.

1271
01:31:35,072 --> 01:31:37,617
He then attempted murder
by inflicting bodily injury.

1272
01:31:38,284 --> 01:31:41,704
As a parent myself,
I find these actions deplorable.

1273
01:31:42,330 --> 01:31:46,834
Witness, did you clearly see
the perpetrator's face on that day?

1274
01:31:48,085 --> 01:31:48,920
Yes.

1275
01:31:49,003 --> 01:31:51,964
Was it the defendant, Kang Hangyeol?

1276
01:31:59,722 --> 01:32:00,681
Yes, it was.

1277
01:32:01,265 --> 01:32:03,726
The defendant's father,
who is sitting at the counsel table,

1278
01:32:03,809 --> 01:32:05,394
came to see you once. Isn't that right?

1279
01:32:06,354 --> 01:32:07,438
He said

1280
01:32:08,898 --> 01:32:10,316
that he was Geonwoo's lawyer.

1281
01:32:12,485 --> 01:32:15,446
It's true. I went to see her.

1282
01:32:19,325 --> 01:32:20,910
When I visited you,

1283
01:32:21,744 --> 01:32:24,121
did I ever try to coax
or threaten you not to testify?

1284
01:32:25,706 --> 01:32:26,666
No.

1285
01:32:26,749 --> 01:32:31,128
You made the decision to not testify,

1286
01:32:31,212 --> 01:32:33,881
so why the sudden change of heart?

1287
01:32:46,602 --> 01:32:49,855
Because I thought I should tell the truth.

1288
01:32:55,820 --> 01:32:57,613
I have a question
for the truthful witness.

1289
01:32:59,865 --> 01:33:01,701
How many perpetrators were there?

1290
01:33:10,293 --> 01:33:13,754
The counselor is asking a repeat question
on a fact that was already testified to.

1291
01:33:15,506 --> 01:33:18,259
Witness, answer the question.

1292
01:33:24,640 --> 01:33:25,808
Kang Hangyeol was

1293
01:33:27,184 --> 01:33:28,185
the only perpetrator.

1294
01:33:29,395 --> 01:33:31,272
You're saying the defendant, Kang Hanyeol,

1295
01:33:31,856 --> 01:33:34,650
threatened and attempted to kill
the victim, by himself?

1296
01:33:35,860 --> 01:33:37,028
Are you sure?

1297
01:33:39,322 --> 01:33:40,489
I'm sure.

1298
01:33:55,046 --> 01:33:58,007
If I tell the truth,
what will you do for me?

1299
01:33:59,592 --> 01:34:01,636
You just have one kid, Hangyeol.

1300
01:34:02,970 --> 01:34:04,680
That side has three.

1301
01:34:05,556 --> 01:34:08,267
Their dads already gave me
three times the money.

1302
01:34:09,810 --> 01:34:10,978
Do Yoonjae.

1303
01:34:12,772 --> 01:34:14,982
Park Kyubeom. Jeong Ideun.

1304
01:34:17,318 --> 01:34:19,904
The defendant, Kang Hangyeol,
wasn't there.

1305
01:34:24,408 --> 01:34:26,869
There's a small store next to a lake

1306
01:34:28,162 --> 01:34:29,538
that's 4 km away from the school.

1307
01:34:31,582 --> 01:34:33,501
According to a statement
by the store's owner,

1308
01:34:35,002 --> 01:34:36,712
every night,

1309
01:34:36,796 --> 01:34:40,925
Kang Hangyeol ran errands for
Do Yoonjae, Park Kyubeom, and Jeong Ideun.

1310
01:34:42,176 --> 01:34:46,138
His face and body were covered
with the evidence of an assault.

1311
01:34:48,557 --> 01:34:50,935
He also bought medicine
to tend to his own wounds.

1312
01:34:51,727 --> 01:34:54,188
Though he'd have to walk for an hour
to get there and back

1313
01:34:54,397 --> 01:34:56,482
with an injured body and on little sleep,

1314
01:34:57,733 --> 01:35:00,861
he couldn't tell a soul, out of fear
that the other kids might retaliate.

1315
01:35:08,160 --> 01:35:09,745
To Kang Hangyeol,

1316
01:35:10,579 --> 01:35:13,082
for whom violence had become
a part of his daily life,

1317
01:35:14,458 --> 01:35:16,127
every day was a nightmare.

1318
01:35:21,882 --> 01:35:25,803
As a victim of school bullying himself,
I'm sure Kim Geonwoo…

1319
01:35:27,847 --> 01:35:29,765
felt the same way.

1320
01:35:48,492 --> 01:35:50,161
Honorable Judge.

1321
01:35:51,078 --> 01:35:51,996
I am…

1322
01:35:53,998 --> 01:35:55,750
an inmate consultation attorney

1323
01:35:57,084 --> 01:35:59,670
with very little experience
in defending someone…

1324
01:36:02,339 --> 01:36:04,258
in a court trial, such as this one.

1325
01:36:07,636 --> 01:36:11,724
However, this trial is one
in which I must defend my client

1326
01:36:13,100 --> 01:36:14,643
as if my life depended on it.

1327
01:36:17,730 --> 01:36:19,273
It is the trial of Kang Hangyeol,

1328
01:36:22,359 --> 01:36:23,944
my very own son.

1329
01:36:28,157 --> 01:36:31,535
My son, who was a victim
of heinous acts of school bullying,

1330
01:36:33,204 --> 01:36:36,665
was put into confinement due to
the false testimonies of the perpetrators.

1331
01:36:38,125 --> 01:36:39,668
For my failure to protect my son,

1332
01:36:41,003 --> 01:36:42,963
I feel an endless sense of incompetence

1333
01:36:44,757 --> 01:36:47,301
However, right here, right now,

1334
01:36:51,013 --> 01:36:52,681
I believe this is my last chance…

1335
01:36:54,683 --> 01:36:56,602
to protect my son.

1336
01:37:01,524 --> 01:37:03,192
Honorable Judge.

1337
01:37:05,152 --> 01:37:07,530
I sincerely hope…

1338
01:37:09,573 --> 01:37:11,617
you will make a wise judgment…

1339
01:37:16,747 --> 01:37:18,123
based on truth.

1340
01:37:44,400 --> 01:37:47,069
That can't be used as evidence.

1341
01:37:48,988 --> 01:37:50,823
Neither can false testimonies.

1342
01:38:02,126 --> 01:38:03,460
You scumbag.

1343
01:38:05,212 --> 01:38:07,089
Your son's the one who killed him!

1344
01:38:07,715 --> 01:38:10,009
He did it all by himself!

1345
01:38:10,259 --> 01:38:12,428
That's the truth, you bastard!

1346
01:38:21,729 --> 01:38:23,647
Any truths created by you

1347
01:38:24,523 --> 01:38:26,191
are all lies now.

1348
01:38:35,034 --> 01:38:37,077
Don't you feel guilty about
what happened to Geonwoo?

1349
01:38:51,050 --> 01:38:52,718
Are you certain the defendant is innocent?

1350
01:38:53,010 --> 01:38:55,679
How did you feel when you learned
that the defendant was a victim?

1351
01:38:55,763 --> 01:38:57,556
How does it feel to clear your son's name?

1352
01:38:57,640 --> 01:38:59,391
Do you have any words
for the victim's family?

1353
01:38:59,475 --> 01:39:01,936
Will you be taking legal action
against the other students?

1354
01:39:20,788 --> 01:39:23,123
In connection with the case
involving the suicide

1355
01:39:23,207 --> 01:39:25,584
of Haneum International student
Kim Geonwoo,

1356
01:39:25,668 --> 01:39:29,546
the Gyeonggi District Court has issued
arrest warrants for three students.

1357
01:39:29,880 --> 01:39:32,424
For three months, from March to May,

1358
01:39:32,508 --> 01:39:35,302
students D, P, and J assaulted the victim

1359
01:39:35,386 --> 01:39:39,014
dozens of times
around the vicinity of the school,

1360
01:39:39,098 --> 01:39:40,683
which led to the suicide of…

1361
01:40:09,795 --> 01:40:10,796
Son.

1362
01:40:55,966 --> 01:40:56,842
How have you been?

1363
01:40:56,925 --> 01:40:59,219
Goodness, welcome!

1364
01:41:00,220 --> 01:41:01,597
Thank you so much.

1365
01:41:01,680 --> 01:41:03,557
There's nothing more I could want now.

1366
01:41:04,058 --> 01:41:05,059
You shouldn't have.

1367
01:41:11,315 --> 01:41:13,025
They're gift certificates.

1368
01:41:13,609 --> 01:41:17,488
Honey, I signed a paper

1369
01:41:17,654 --> 01:41:19,156
and got these certificates.

1370
01:41:20,407 --> 01:41:24,036
I pulled the kid out of the water,
yet you're the one getting a present?

1371
01:41:28,248 --> 01:41:31,543
Did you pull out the student
who fell into the lake?

1372
01:41:31,627 --> 01:41:35,214
He forgets things all the time.

1373
01:41:35,798 --> 01:41:37,549
He's going to a care home in two days.

1374
01:41:38,592 --> 01:41:41,512
I didn't do it with my net.

1375
01:41:41,595 --> 01:41:43,889
I went out to him in my boat.

1376
01:41:43,972 --> 01:41:48,435
Goodness, there was
this peculiar-looking bird…

1377
01:41:48,519 --> 01:41:50,354
No, wait, what was it?

1378
01:41:50,437 --> 01:41:54,900
It was whizzing and flying
all around the cliff.

1379
01:41:55,943 --> 01:41:57,236
But then…

1380
01:41:58,695 --> 01:42:03,534
It started to attack
the person sitting on the cliff.

1381
01:42:04,118 --> 01:42:06,036
Then he fell into the water.

1382
01:42:06,495 --> 01:42:08,205
But then…

1383
01:42:08,288 --> 01:42:11,416
Behind him, there was this other guy.

1384
01:42:12,709 --> 01:42:16,505
The guy and the plane just
flew off somewhere after that.

1385
01:42:18,674 --> 01:42:19,842
Did you see

1386
01:42:20,884 --> 01:42:22,052
who it was?

1387
01:42:22,678 --> 01:42:25,347
It was too foggy to see anything.

1388
01:42:26,723 --> 01:42:29,184
Gosh, but that plane…

1389
01:42:30,185 --> 01:42:33,897
That tiny little thing was… Gosh.

1390
01:43:51,558 --> 01:43:53,727
Are you nuts? Why are you doing this?

1391
01:43:55,270 --> 01:43:57,773
Why would you kill yourself? Why!

1392
01:43:58,398 --> 01:44:01,068
You can't even take that much?
Are you a wimp?

1393
01:44:02,069 --> 01:44:03,320
You're a bigger wimp.

1394
01:44:06,448 --> 01:44:07,991
This is all your fault.

1395
01:44:08,617 --> 01:44:11,203
It's because you ratted them out
to the homeroom teacher.

1396
01:44:11,745 --> 01:44:13,497
It's all your fault!

1397
01:44:16,166 --> 01:44:17,251
You're…

1398
01:44:18,126 --> 01:44:19,628
worse than they are.

1399
01:44:19,878 --> 01:44:21,922
What? What did you say?

1400
01:44:23,215 --> 01:44:24,341
Just die.

1401
01:44:25,133 --> 01:44:27,844
Just die! Die!

1402
01:44:30,222 --> 01:44:33,100
Die! Die already!

1403
01:45:00,002 --> 01:45:04,131
MY SON

1404
01:45:07,926 --> 01:45:09,553
MY SON

1405
01:47:09,381 --> 01:47:16,388
I WANT TO KNOW YOUR PARENTS

1406

3
00:01:25,034 --> 00:01:26,620
Baby, are you awake?

4
00:01:29,620 --> 00:01:33,068
I'm awake now.

5
00:01:33,103 --> 00:01:36,448
So I was thinking we could
spend the day together.

6
00:01:38,068 --> 00:01:40,620
Maybe after a little morning
sex we could go jogging.

7
00:01:42,965 --> 00:01:43,793
I can't, babe.

8
00:01:45,172 --> 00:01:47,620
I gotta meet with Swiss
and I'm already late.

9
00:01:49,413 --> 00:01:52,724
Got some last minute repairs
before the city inspector show.

10
00:01:52,758 --> 00:01:54,965
I thought you were almost
done with everything.

11
00:01:56,448 --> 00:01:57,103
Well...

12
00:02:00,137 --> 00:02:03,793
Yeah, but still
gotta do some stuff.

13
00:02:03,827 --> 00:02:06,103
Need the deadline
for the grand opener.

14
00:02:06,137 --> 00:02:08,103
Okay. What else
do you have to do?

15
00:02:08,137 --> 00:02:09,068
Maybe I could help.

16
00:02:12,034 --> 00:02:13,034
It's alright, babe.

17
00:02:14,965 --> 00:02:17,551
Okay. Who is texting you
this early in the morning?

18
00:02:17,551 --> 00:02:19,000
It's not even eight o'clock.

19
00:02:21,896 --> 00:02:23,724
Hello?

20
00:02:23,758 --> 00:02:25,689
I know you can hear
me talking to you.

21
00:02:29,206 --> 00:02:30,862
Yeah, I'm sorry, babe.

22
00:02:31,931 --> 00:02:33,137
It's nobody special. Okay.

23
00:02:33,206 --> 00:02:35,068
I swear. It's just work.

24
00:02:35,068 --> 00:02:36,137
The vendor for the liquor
company that I'm working with,

25
00:02:36,206 --> 00:02:37,551
they coming through today.

26
00:02:37,586 --> 00:02:39,034
I'm just confirming the time.

27
00:02:39,034 --> 00:02:39,896
That's all.

28
00:02:40,793 --> 00:02:41,620
Okay.

29
00:02:45,206 --> 00:02:47,034
I gotta get dressed.

30
00:02:49,482 --> 00:02:52,137
And here I was thinking
we would be getting it in.

31
00:02:52,206 --> 00:02:53,068
Mm, mm, mm.

32
00:02:55,586 --> 00:02:56,689
Oh, that's okay, baby.

33
00:02:58,068 --> 00:03:00,965
I know your daddy
loves me and you.

34
00:03:03,620 --> 00:03:04,517
Woo. Geez.

35
00:03:12,620 --> 00:03:14,655
Ah, and just where do
you think you're going

36
00:03:14,689 --> 00:03:17,034
dressed like a male thottie?

37
00:03:17,103 --> 00:03:18,103
What?

38
00:03:18,103 --> 00:03:19,586
Male thottie?

39
00:03:19,586 --> 00:03:20,758
- Mm-hmm.
- What?

40
00:03:20,793 --> 00:03:22,655
You funny.

41
00:03:22,689 --> 00:03:25,758
I mean, don't get me wrong,
you looking fine as hell.

42
00:03:25,758 --> 00:03:27,206
Thank you.

43
00:03:27,275 --> 00:03:28,655
But isn't this a
little too casual

44
00:03:28,689 --> 00:03:30,137
for your daily meetings?

45
00:03:31,862 --> 00:03:33,275
Although I do have
a lot of meetings.

46
00:03:33,310 --> 00:03:35,689
I also gotta help
Swiss paint today.

47
00:03:35,758 --> 00:03:36,655
Oh yes.

48
00:03:36,689 --> 00:03:38,172
Okay. Okay.

49
00:03:38,206 --> 00:03:39,827
Just trying to make
sure you're not all cute

50
00:03:39,862 --> 00:03:41,655
for your little side
chick, that's all.

51
00:03:42,758 --> 00:03:44,586
Stop it. Come here.

52
00:03:46,275 --> 00:03:49,172
There's no other woman that
can compare to you, alright?

53
00:03:49,206 --> 00:03:52,068
My front, my back,

54
00:03:53,275 --> 00:03:56,586
side and only chick.

55
00:03:56,620 --> 00:03:58,103
Alright?

56
00:03:58,137 --> 00:03:59,000
Okay.

57
00:03:59,931 --> 00:04:02,655
But baby, do I look fat?

58
00:04:02,655 --> 00:04:03,827
What?

59
00:04:04,689 --> 00:04:05,827
Of course not.

60
00:04:05,827 --> 00:04:07,724
No. Be, be for real with me.

61
00:04:07,758 --> 00:04:11,103
I mean, I know I have a
belly, obviously a big belly.

62
00:04:11,172 --> 00:04:12,724
But what about the rest of me?

63
00:04:15,103 --> 00:04:16,862
Shayla, you are fine, right?

64
00:04:16,896 --> 00:04:18,034
You're just pregnant.

65
00:04:19,758 --> 00:04:22,689
So what's on your
schedule for today?

66
00:04:22,724 --> 00:04:25,000
Oh, you know, baby stuff.

67
00:04:25,034 --> 00:04:26,931
Doctor's appointments.

68
00:04:26,965 --> 00:04:29,275
I gotta get the rest of the
furniture for the nursery.

69
00:04:29,344 --> 00:04:31,068
And I need to track down Tamika

70
00:04:31,103 --> 00:04:33,655
so we can finish planning
this baby shower.

71
00:04:33,655 --> 00:04:35,000
A lot.

72
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:35,862
Sounds fun.

73
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,172
Don't overdo it. Alright?

74
00:04:38,206 --> 00:04:39,862
Make sure you get some rest.

75
00:04:39,896 --> 00:04:41,758
I will.

76
00:04:41,793 --> 00:04:43,689
Remember that is my baby
you carrying in there.

77
00:04:43,689 --> 00:04:46,655
So, when are
you getting in tonight?

78
00:04:48,724 --> 00:04:49,586
Not too late.

79
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,310
That's what you
said yesterday.

80
00:04:52,310 --> 00:04:54,172
I know.

81
00:04:54,206 --> 00:04:55,172
And you didn't get here
until after 1:00 a.m.

82
00:04:55,206 --> 00:04:57,103
I know. I know.

83
00:04:57,172 --> 00:04:58,793
Look, I just had a lot to
do for the grand opening.

84
00:04:58,862 --> 00:05:01,034
I promise, tonight
it'll be earlier.

85
00:05:02,275 --> 00:05:03,103
Promise?

86
00:05:03,137 --> 00:05:04,000
I promise.

87
00:05:05,827 --> 00:05:08,068
I just don't like being
here by myself late at night.

88
00:05:08,068 --> 00:05:09,068
That's all.

89
00:05:09,068 --> 00:05:10,655
I know. I got you.

90
00:05:10,689 --> 00:05:12,965
Look, I'll even
call you every hour.

91
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:13,827
Alright?

92
00:05:13,896 --> 00:05:14,724
Okay.

93
00:05:21,689 --> 00:05:23,068
Wait, you're not gonna
eat breakfast with me?

94
00:05:23,103 --> 00:05:25,103
I can't.
I'm running late.

95
00:05:25,137 --> 00:05:27,103
I love you though.

96
00:05:27,137 --> 00:05:28,206
I love you too.

97
00:05:43,137 --> 00:05:45,241
Wow. This is nice.

98
00:05:45,241 --> 00:05:46,827
This is all you got done?

99
00:05:46,896 --> 00:05:48,068
Thought you'd be finished.

100
00:05:50,103 --> 00:05:52,172
You're kidding me, right?

101
00:05:52,241 --> 00:05:55,275
Need I remind you that
I am a bartender, bro.

102
00:05:55,310 --> 00:05:56,896
And I've been working two jobs

103
00:05:56,931 --> 00:05:58,862
trying to finish up
all this painting.

104
00:05:58,931 --> 00:06:00,103
And I still made it in here
before you did this morning.

105
00:06:00,137 --> 00:06:01,862
So instead of critiquing,

106
00:06:01,896 --> 00:06:04,310
you need to be picking
up a paintbrush, bro.

107
00:06:04,310 --> 00:06:05,689
Point taken. You right.

108
00:06:07,310 --> 00:06:09,413
Man, but you know this pregnancy
got Shayla hella needy man.

109
00:06:09,482 --> 00:06:11,482
Don't even get me started
on how clingy she been

110
00:06:11,482 --> 00:06:13,137
for the past two weeks.

111
00:06:13,137 --> 00:06:15,000
It'll be over soon though.

112
00:06:15,034 --> 00:06:16,448
Y'all on the home stretch now.

113
00:06:17,448 --> 00:06:19,000
Oh facts.

114
00:06:19,034 --> 00:06:20,379
Can you believe
she's six months now?

115
00:06:20,413 --> 00:06:22,000
- Whew, six months.
- Six months.

116
00:06:22,034 --> 00:06:24,000
That's crazy.

117
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,310
That's why I'm working so
hard to get this damn place

118
00:06:25,344 --> 00:06:27,137
running like a
well oiled machine.

119
00:06:27,172 --> 00:06:28,793
I'm trying to spend at
least two weeks with Shayla

120
00:06:28,827 --> 00:06:29,965
and the new baby.

121
00:06:29,965 --> 00:06:31,344
You know what I'm saying?

122
00:06:31,379 --> 00:06:33,241
Well, I got your
back, partner.

123
00:06:33,310 --> 00:06:34,896
All this hard work we've
been doing gonna pay off.

124
00:06:34,965 --> 00:06:36,379
Oh, for sure. You
know we got it, man.

125
00:06:36,413 --> 00:06:38,275
So yeah, let's get to it.

126
00:06:40,827 --> 00:06:41,965
Marcus Sinclair?

127
00:06:43,896 --> 00:06:45,758
Hi, I'm, I'm, I'm Marcus.

128
00:06:45,827 --> 00:06:48,000
Hi, Rocki Robinson with
Premium Distributions.

129
00:06:49,137 --> 00:06:51,965
Hey, so you, you Rocki, huh?

130
00:06:51,965 --> 00:06:54,310
I was uh, I was,
I was expecting.

131
00:06:54,310 --> 00:06:55,793
I know, a guy, right?

132
00:06:55,827 --> 00:06:57,241
It happens all the time.

133
00:06:57,310 --> 00:06:59,310
Rocki's actually
short for Raquel.

134
00:06:59,310 --> 00:07:01,379
No, I was actually
expecting you a little later.

135
00:07:01,413 --> 00:07:02,275
That's all.

136
00:07:03,862 --> 00:07:05,793
But this is my business
partner Rob Swiss.

137
00:07:05,862 --> 00:07:06,931
You can call me Swiss.

138
00:07:06,965 --> 00:07:08,379
Nice to meet you. Oh okay.

139
00:07:08,413 --> 00:07:09,758
Nice to meet
you, Ms. Robinson.

140
00:07:09,793 --> 00:07:11,862
Okay, Rocki, please.

141
00:07:11,862 --> 00:07:13,379
So this is a very,
very nice spot

142
00:07:13,413 --> 00:07:14,758
that you gentlemen have here.

143
00:07:14,793 --> 00:07:17,000
Thank you. Thank you.

144
00:07:17,068 --> 00:07:19,275
Hey, you wanna take this to
my office so we can talk shop?

145
00:07:19,310 --> 00:07:20,413
Yep, sure. This way?

146
00:07:20,448 --> 00:07:21,758
Yeah, you just go this way.

147
00:07:33,965 --> 00:07:35,344
I'm sorry for the mess.

148
00:07:36,896 --> 00:07:39,000
Just get stuff together.

149
00:07:41,965 --> 00:07:42,862
Okay.

150
00:07:44,275 --> 00:07:47,344
Hmm. Your girlfriend?

151
00:07:48,448 --> 00:07:50,482
Uh no, my wife actually.

152
00:07:50,551 --> 00:07:53,206
Expecting our first
kid in a couple months.

153
00:07:53,241 --> 00:07:54,517
It's a boy.

154
00:07:54,517 --> 00:07:56,965
Oh! Congratulations.

155
00:07:57,034 --> 00:07:58,896
- Thank you.
- It's funny,

156
00:07:58,896 --> 00:07:59,862
'cause I don't think I
remember reading anything

157
00:07:59,862 --> 00:08:01,344
about you being married

158
00:08:01,379 --> 00:08:02,344
in the ""Chicago's
Nightlife Magazine"".

159
00:08:03,310 --> 00:08:04,172
Too bad.

160
00:08:05,344 --> 00:08:07,000
Uh yeah.

161
00:08:07,034 --> 00:08:09,931
Old interview and
before we got married.

162
00:08:11,620 --> 00:08:13,586
I think we've been married
what uh, seven months now?

163
00:08:13,620 --> 00:08:15,000
Hmm.

164
00:08:15,034 --> 00:08:17,482
You want? Have a seat please.

165
00:08:17,517 --> 00:08:18,482
Thank you.

166
00:08:21,103 --> 00:08:22,275
Can I be honest with you?

167
00:08:23,620 --> 00:08:27,000
I was, I was actually
expecting a guy.

168
00:08:27,034 --> 00:08:29,310
You know, like Rocki
from the movies?

169
00:08:29,344 --> 00:08:31,448
It's fine. I'm not surprised.

170
00:08:31,482 --> 00:08:33,344
Nobody expects a woman,

171
00:08:33,379 --> 00:08:35,137
especially a black woman
in this line of business.

172
00:08:36,482 --> 00:08:38,103
Hopefully that
won't be a problem.

173
00:08:38,103 --> 00:08:39,586
Oh no. No problem at all.

174
00:08:41,379 --> 00:08:44,413
Observation though, it
says a lot about you, huh?

175
00:08:46,379 --> 00:08:49,413
The alcohol beverage
industry is not for the weak.

176
00:08:49,448 --> 00:08:50,931
No, it's not.

177
00:08:50,965 --> 00:08:52,551
But let's be real.

178
00:08:52,620 --> 00:08:54,206
The only reason I'm assigned
to certain accounts,

179
00:08:54,275 --> 00:08:56,103
including yours, is
because nobody cares

180
00:08:56,103 --> 00:08:57,931
about a new black
business owner.

181
00:08:57,965 --> 00:08:59,379
But it's cool. I don't mind.

182
00:08:59,448 --> 00:09:01,000
Let them continue
to count us out

183
00:09:01,034 --> 00:09:02,586
while I continue to bring us in.

184
00:09:03,689 --> 00:09:06,000
Okay, I see you, Rocki.

185
00:09:06,655 --> 00:09:07,482
I hope so.

186
00:09:10,551 --> 00:09:12,344
Let's get down to business.

187
00:09:12,344 --> 00:09:15,413
So born and raised in Chicago,

188
00:09:15,448 --> 00:09:17,586
majored in hospitality
management,

189
00:09:17,620 --> 00:09:21,068
graduated summa
laude from an HBCU.

190
00:09:21,103 --> 00:09:22,517
Did the restaurant
thing for a while,

191
00:09:22,517 --> 00:09:24,344
dabbled in party promotions.

192
00:09:24,344 --> 00:09:26,517
Then you did the club
thing for a while.

193
00:09:26,517 --> 00:09:29,103
The last bar, you
managed it quite well.

194
00:09:29,172 --> 00:09:30,551
Glad to see you
finally ventured out

195
00:09:30,586 --> 00:09:32,172
and made something
happen for yourself.

196
00:09:34,517 --> 00:09:38,172
Wow. I can't believe
you know all of this.

197
00:09:38,172 --> 00:09:40,034
It's part of my job.

198
00:09:40,034 --> 00:09:42,413
I mean, our company just checks
for credit, but I like to,

199
00:09:42,448 --> 00:09:44,034
you know, dig a little deeper

200
00:09:44,068 --> 00:09:46,482
and see exactly who I'm
gonna be working with.

201
00:09:46,482 --> 00:09:47,344
Ah.

202
00:09:49,241 --> 00:09:53,206
I did my research
and I'm impressed.

203
00:09:54,344 --> 00:09:56,000
Okay.

204
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,413
Hopefully you impressed enough

205
00:09:57,448 --> 00:09:59,172
to give us a good
deal on that liquor.

206
00:10:00,586 --> 00:10:02,172
I'm willing to
do whatever I can

207
00:10:02,206 --> 00:10:04,000
to make Flirt one of the
best bars in Chicago.

208
00:10:08,172 --> 00:10:10,206
Here's what I can offer
you as a new account.

209
00:10:14,586 --> 00:10:17,655
Wow. These, these
numbers are incredible.

210
00:10:17,655 --> 00:10:19,241
Mm-hmm.

211
00:10:19,275 --> 00:10:20,379
I like to look
out for my people.

212
00:10:20,413 --> 00:10:22,034
We're all we got, you know?

213
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,241
Yeah, I do.

214
00:10:24,275 --> 00:10:25,551
And you have
definitely looked out.

215
00:10:27,448 --> 00:10:29,137
Makes me proud to
be a Black man.

216
00:10:31,517 --> 00:10:34,172
But you, you sure you
can offer me this?

217
00:10:34,206 --> 00:10:36,482
Seems a bit too good to be true.

218
00:10:38,448 --> 00:10:40,206
Let's just say
I have the power

219
00:10:40,241 --> 00:10:43,068
to create a premium
package for my new clients.

220
00:10:43,103 --> 00:10:45,206
Especially ones that
are as talented as you.

221
00:10:48,517 --> 00:10:51,689
Thank you? I mean, I, I
really wasn't expecting this.

222
00:10:51,724 --> 00:10:54,034
I told you it's part
of my job. It's fine.

223
00:10:57,275 --> 00:11:01,344
Oh, here is a list
of vendors as well.

224
00:11:01,413 --> 00:11:02,482
Make sure you contact them.

225
00:11:02,517 --> 00:11:04,103
Tell 'em Rocki sent you.

226
00:11:04,137 --> 00:11:05,241
That way they'll give
you a good discount.

227
00:11:07,275 --> 00:11:10,482
Do you go this hard
for all of your customers?

228
00:11:10,517 --> 00:11:11,724
Only the ones I like.

229
00:11:12,724 --> 00:11:14,103
And I like you, Marcus.

230
00:11:18,241 --> 00:11:22,000
Well, thank you. And I look
forward to working with you.

231
00:11:23,379 --> 00:11:24,551
Me too.

232
00:11:35,241 --> 00:11:36,379
It's this way.

233
00:11:40,310 --> 00:11:43,000
So I think you guys have
a great thing going here.

234
00:11:43,068 --> 00:11:44,000
- Thank you.
- This is gonna be

235
00:11:44,068 --> 00:11:45,000
pretty successful.

236
00:11:45,068 --> 00:11:45,448
Whatever I can do then.

237
00:11:46,482 --> 00:11:47,620
I appreciate that.

238
00:11:47,655 --> 00:11:50,000
I like this color. Very chic.

239
00:11:50,068 --> 00:11:52,137
Thank you. I picked it out.

240
00:11:53,758 --> 00:11:55,275
So when do you guys open?

241
00:11:55,310 --> 00:11:57,068
Uh, in three weeks.

242
00:11:58,172 --> 00:11:59,586
- Three weeks?
- Yeah.

243
00:11:59,620 --> 00:12:01,827
Just for like a
soft launch, right?

244
00:12:01,827 --> 00:12:03,724
Nope, that's,
that's opening night.

245
00:12:05,310 --> 00:12:06,724
And it's just the two of you?

246
00:12:06,793 --> 00:12:08,517
Where's your contractor?

247
00:12:08,551 --> 00:12:10,379
You know what we
thought about that.

248
00:12:10,413 --> 00:12:11,310
It's outta budget.

249
00:12:11,344 --> 00:12:13,034
- Hey!
- It is.

250
00:12:13,793 --> 00:12:15,241
Look, I know a guy.

251
00:12:15,310 --> 00:12:16,689
He's very reasonable.

252
00:12:16,724 --> 00:12:17,793
I'll have him give
you guys a call

253
00:12:17,827 --> 00:12:18,551
so he can come by and help out.

254
00:12:18,620 --> 00:12:19,620
Okay?

255
00:12:19,655 --> 00:12:21,551
Thanks Rocki.

256
00:12:21,586 --> 00:12:23,172
But you know, you don't,
you don't have to do that.

257
00:12:23,206 --> 00:12:24,689
What my partner
is trying to say

258
00:12:24,724 --> 00:12:27,172
is that we appreciate
anything you can do.

259
00:12:27,206 --> 00:12:29,310
It's no problem. His
name's George Matthews.

260
00:12:29,344 --> 00:12:30,758
He's a friend of mine.

261
00:12:30,827 --> 00:12:32,517
I'm always throwing
business his way, so.

262
00:12:32,551 --> 00:12:34,137
He owes me a favor.

263
00:12:34,172 --> 00:12:36,586
Here is his number.

264
00:12:36,655 --> 00:12:38,793
Make sure you give
him a call. Okay?

265
00:12:38,793 --> 00:12:39,655
Thanks.

266
00:12:39,689 --> 00:12:41,517
I will do that.

267
00:12:41,551 --> 00:12:43,310
Okay, well if you
gentlemen will excuse me,

268
00:12:43,344 --> 00:12:44,724
I have other clients
to attend to.

269
00:12:44,758 --> 00:12:47,310
So good luck and
yeah, I'll call you

270
00:12:47,310 --> 00:12:49,310
later this week to just make
sure everything's good to go.

271
00:12:49,310 --> 00:12:50,724
- Sounds good.
- Alright. Bye.

272
00:12:52,206 --> 00:12:53,379
This way right?

273
00:12:53,413 --> 00:12:54,275
- Uh, yeah.
- Thanks.

274
00:12:57,206 --> 00:12:59,137
I might have to marry her.

275
00:12:59,172 --> 00:13:01,275
Yeah, she is something else.

276
00:13:01,310 --> 00:13:02,862
What'd she say about
that liquor though?

277
00:13:02,896 --> 00:13:04,551
Did we get the account?

278
00:13:04,551 --> 00:13:06,275
Yeah, she gave us
like a major deal

279
00:13:06,310 --> 00:13:07,620
for the first six months too.

280
00:13:07,689 --> 00:13:09,310
And she threw in some vendors

281
00:13:09,379 --> 00:13:10,275
that's gonna keep
the bar stocked.

282
00:13:10,310 --> 00:13:12,103
So we good.

283
00:13:12,137 --> 00:13:14,103
A woman that's beautiful,
fine and resourceful?

284
00:13:15,206 --> 00:13:16,413
I'mma have to come after her.

285
00:13:16,448 --> 00:13:17,896
Bro, could you at least wait

286
00:13:17,896 --> 00:13:19,689
until after we get this
thing up and running?

287
00:13:21,827 --> 00:13:24,551
I don't know, bro. I'mma
have to say something.

288
00:13:26,413 --> 00:13:27,551
You know me.
I about to,

289
00:13:27,586 --> 00:13:28,379
I'm about to get a brush, bro.

290

Yes please.

291
00:13:29,517 --> 00:13:30,517

Mm. Okay so what
about this one?

325
00:14:41,931 --> 00:14:42,758
It's cute.

326
00:14:43,931 --> 00:14:46,551
- Girl, a jungle theme?
- Uh huh.

327
00:14:46,620 --> 00:14:48,758
I do not want my baby
associated with monkeys.

328
00:14:48,793 --> 00:14:50,655
- Oh!
- Hell no.

329
00:14:50,689 --> 00:14:53,482
Girl, you have not liked
anything that we've looked at.

330
00:14:53,517 --> 00:14:55,275
Now what do you want?

331
00:14:55,310 --> 00:14:57,413
Whew, a nap.

332
00:14:58,448 --> 00:14:59,689
That's what I want.

333
00:15:00,827 --> 00:15:02,931
Girl, I'm so tired all the time.

334
00:15:02,965 --> 00:15:05,413
I can barely even run
my usual route anymore.

335
00:15:05,448 --> 00:15:08,344
Well you know, most
pregnant women are tired, boo.

336
00:15:08,344 --> 00:15:10,241
It comes with the territory.

337
00:15:10,275 --> 00:15:12,655
That's what you get for
having unprotected sex.

338
00:15:14,275 --> 00:15:17,862
I'm fat, I'm slow,
I'm unattractive.

339
00:15:19,724 --> 00:15:21,689
Marcus doesn't even wanna
go running with me anymore.

340
00:15:21,724 --> 00:15:23,724
He's not turned on at all.

341
00:15:23,758 --> 00:15:25,379
Uh oh.

342
00:15:25,413 --> 00:15:27,379
All he cares about
is that damn bar.

343
00:15:27,413 --> 00:15:28,379
No, no, no, no.

344
00:15:28,413 --> 00:15:29,517
That is not true. Okay?

345
00:15:29,551 --> 00:15:30,551
You're overreacting, babe.

346
00:15:30,586 --> 00:15:32,724
And being hormonal.

347
00:15:32,758 --> 00:15:34,448
- No, I'm not.
- Yuh huh.

348
00:15:34,517 --> 00:15:37,689
He's always there. Always.

349
00:15:37,724 --> 00:15:40,896
Starting to feel like he just
wants to be away from me.

350
00:15:40,931 --> 00:15:42,551
Okay.

351
00:15:42,586 --> 00:15:44,413
Marcus is just trying
to get the bar open

352
00:15:44,448 --> 00:15:46,724
before the baby comes,
now you said so yourself.

353
00:15:46,758 --> 00:15:48,344
Look, you're bored as hell.

354
00:15:48,344 --> 00:15:49,758
That's all.

355
00:15:49,793 --> 00:15:51,896
Now. I told your ass not
to quit work so soon.

356
00:15:51,931 --> 00:15:53,517
Should have listened to me.

357
00:15:53,551 --> 00:15:55,000
Well Marcus didn't
want me working

358
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:58,034
past my second trimester.
Mm hmm.

359
00:15:58,068 --> 00:16:01,448
I can't help it if my husband
wants me to rest and relax

360
00:16:01,482 --> 00:16:02,965
while he takes care
of me and the baby.

361
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,724
Right.

362
00:16:04,758 --> 00:16:05,655
Be jealous.

363
00:16:07,482 --> 00:16:08,931
So now you bragging about
him taking care of you.

364
00:16:08,965 --> 00:16:12,758
Child, you really are
confused and hormonal.

365
00:16:14,896 --> 00:16:17,586
- It's a real thing.
- Mm-hmm.

366
00:16:17,586 --> 00:16:20,758
- I am.
- So are we going

367
00:16:20,793 --> 00:16:21,827
to the grand opening?

368
00:16:22,793 --> 00:16:25,482
Um...Probably not.

369
00:16:26,655 --> 00:16:28,482
- Oh?
- Yeah, I don't,

370
00:16:28,517 --> 00:16:31,310
I don't wanna wobble my pregnant
ass in there looking crazy

371
00:16:31,344 --> 00:16:33,965
when there's gonna be
pretty bitches everywhere.

372
00:16:35,413 --> 00:16:36,241
Nuh uh.

373
00:16:39,413 --> 00:16:41,551
Girl, get your ass up.

374
00:16:41,551 --> 00:16:43,068
Come on, let's go.

375
00:16:43,068 --> 00:16:45,310
Why? Where are we going?

376
00:16:45,344 --> 00:16:47,758
Shopping so we can
get your pretty ass

377
00:16:47,758 --> 00:16:50,068
an outfit for you to
wobble in at opening night.

378
00:16:50,103 --> 00:16:52,310
Come on girl. Come on.

379
00:16:52,344 --> 00:16:53,931
Get on up, get on up.

380
00:16:53,965 --> 00:16:55,310
Oh god.

381
00:16:55,344 --> 00:16:56,448
Oh my god.
That's right.

382
00:16:56,482 --> 00:16:58,310
Come on, Mom. You go girl.

383
00:16:58,379 --> 00:16:59,586
You go girl.

384
00:16:59,620 --> 00:17:00,620
♪ Are you sliding on 'em

385
00:17:09,862 --> 00:17:11,965

your hands in the air.

386
00:17:27,034 --> 00:17:27,896
Hey.

387

Right here.

388
00:17:39,655 --> 00:17:42,000
So I am glad you could make it.

389
00:17:42,034 --> 00:17:45,413
Now you know I wasn't
gonna miss the grand opening.

390
00:17:45,482 --> 00:17:46,896
Ladies, this is Marcus.

391
00:17:46,965 --> 00:17:48,965
He's one of the owners of Flirt.

392
00:17:48,965 --> 00:17:50,137
Nice to meet you, Marcus.

393
00:17:50,137 --> 00:17:52,551
We heard so much about you.

394
00:17:52,620 --> 00:17:54,034
Nice to meet you too.

395
00:17:54,068 --> 00:17:55,655
Appreciate y'all coming out.

396
00:17:55,689 --> 00:17:56,862
You know this would
not be possible

397
00:17:56,896 --> 00:17:58,517
without your friend here.

398
00:17:58,551 --> 00:17:59,689
Okay friend.

399
00:18:02,241 --> 00:18:04,793
Rocki! Here's a little
something to say thank you.

400
00:18:04,862 --> 00:18:05,758
Grab one of those.

401
00:18:06,931 --> 00:18:08,758
Ladies, y'all want one? Here.

402
00:18:08,793 --> 00:18:09,620
Got something for everybody.

403
00:18:09,689 --> 00:18:10,517
Let's go.

404
00:18:12,586 --> 00:18:13,689
Let's make a toast,

405
00:18:15,689 --> 00:18:17,655
to a beautiful evening

406
00:18:17,724 --> 00:18:20,689
filled with lots of
beautiful ladies.

407
00:18:20,724 --> 00:18:21,551
To Flirt.

408
00:18:21,586 --> 00:18:22,965
To Flirt.

409
00:18:23,034 --> 00:18:25,448
And, and a special
thanks to Rocki.

410
00:18:25,482 --> 00:18:27,931
'Cause once again, if
it was not for you,

411
00:18:27,965 --> 00:18:30,206
we could have not got
this finished in time.

412
00:18:30,241 --> 00:18:34,068
And the contractor you
sent through, clutch.

413
00:18:34,068 --> 00:18:36,793
Look, I'm just glad
everything worked out, okay?

414
00:18:36,862 --> 00:18:38,862
Congratulations again, Marcus.

415
00:18:38,896 --> 00:18:40,034
Thank you.

416
00:18:40,034 --> 00:18:41,172
- Flirt
- To Flirt!

417
00:18:52,482 --> 00:18:55,137
Okay, this place is rockin'!

418
00:18:55,206 --> 00:18:57,965
Alright. Well done, Marcus.

419
00:18:58,034 --> 00:19:00,517
Yeah. Rockin' with
all these thirsty women.

420
00:19:00,586 --> 00:19:01,241
Oh.

421
00:19:04,827 --> 00:19:06,275
Uh ho.

422
00:19:06,310 --> 00:19:07,586
Come on Shayla.

423
00:19:07,620 --> 00:19:08,793
Look, don't be ridiculous.

424
00:19:08,827 --> 00:19:10,241
Now this is your
man's big night.

425
00:19:12,137 --> 00:19:15,655
Be here so these chicks will
see that your man got a wife,

426
00:19:15,689 --> 00:19:17,793
and a beautiful one at that.

427
00:19:17,827 --> 00:19:19,793
So can we go to the bar?

428
00:19:19,827 --> 00:19:21,000
Please.
Okay.

429
00:19:21,034 --> 00:19:21,931
Okay.

430
00:19:23,275 --> 00:19:25,103
It's the grand
opening of Flirt.

431
00:19:25,103 --> 00:19:26,689
Make some noise...

432
00:19:27,689 --> 00:19:30,103
Hey Swiss.

433
00:19:30,103 --> 00:19:31,965
Hey ladies.

434
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,551
I didn't expect to see
y'all up in here tonight.

435
00:19:33,620 --> 00:19:35,206
Now why
would you think that?

436
00:19:35,275 --> 00:19:36,827
I mean, I am his wife.

437
00:19:38,827 --> 00:19:40,862
Because you're pregnant.

438
00:19:40,931 --> 00:19:43,034
That's, that's why
I thought that.

439
00:19:43,103 --> 00:19:44,620
Here. Come here, have a seat.

440
00:19:45,586 --> 00:19:46,241
Thanks.

441
00:19:48,206 --> 00:19:50,137
- And you too.
- Oh!

442
00:19:51,137 --> 00:19:53,172
Please, Tamika.

443
00:19:53,206 --> 00:19:54,758
Let your fine self sit down.

444
00:19:59,275 --> 00:20:00,551
Excuse me ladies.

445
00:20:00,620 --> 00:20:01,862
My special guests have arrived.

446
00:20:08,793 --> 00:20:09,689
Baby! Hey.
Hey baby.

447
00:20:11,931 --> 00:20:13,689
I didn't think you was coming.

448
00:20:13,758 --> 00:20:15,000
God girl, you look so good.

449
00:20:15,034 --> 00:20:16,620
Thank you.

450
00:20:16,620 --> 00:20:17,275
Thank you for
bringing her, Tamika.

451
00:20:17,275 --> 00:20:19,103
Of course.

452
00:20:19,137 --> 00:20:20,793
You know, I figured being
with the owner's wife

453
00:20:20,827 --> 00:20:21,965
means I get to drink
for free all night.

454
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:22,758
So, you know.

455
00:20:24,551 --> 00:20:25,931
Well with you
looking that good

456
00:20:25,965 --> 00:20:27,620
I'll probably let
you do that anyway.

457
00:20:27,655 --> 00:20:29,551
Whew, well in that case,

458
00:20:29,620 --> 00:20:31,827
let me get a shot of tequila
with a glass of rose all day.

459
00:20:31,862 --> 00:20:35,000
Okay? Thank you.

460
00:20:35,034 --> 00:20:37,758
Baby, I really hope that
you driving home tonight,

461
00:20:37,793 --> 00:20:39,206
because from the looks of it,

462
00:20:39,275 --> 00:20:40,931
it don't look like
Mika gonna make it.

463
00:20:40,965 --> 00:20:42,172
Right.

464
00:20:42,206 --> 00:20:43,620
Look at these two.

465
00:20:43,655 --> 00:20:45,931
You know, I could get a ride.

466
00:20:47,758 --> 00:20:49,827
Congratulations, Marcus.

467
00:20:49,862 --> 00:20:51,586
Thank you.

468
00:20:51,586 --> 00:20:53,551
Yeah, this place is lit.

469
00:20:53,620 --> 00:20:55,620
You boys was
definitely getting it.

470
00:20:55,620 --> 00:20:58,206
- Definitely did.
- I, I, I appreciate it.

471
00:20:58,275 --> 00:20:59,517
Enjoy yourselves.

472
00:20:59,551 --> 00:21:01,034
- We will.
- Yeah, you too.

473
00:21:07,275 --> 00:21:08,827
Baby, you okay?

474
00:21:09,862 --> 00:21:12,137
No. I'm not feeling well.

475
00:21:14,034 --> 00:21:15,931
Well, you know,
I, I can take you home.

476
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,724
No, no baby.

477
00:21:17,758 --> 00:21:18,896
It's your big night.

478
00:21:18,931 --> 00:21:19,931
You should stay.

479
00:21:20,862 --> 00:21:22,137
Mika can take me.

480
00:21:23,103 --> 00:21:25,172
Oh yeah. I can?

481
00:21:25,172 --> 00:21:26,827
Yes.

482
00:21:26,827 --> 00:21:28,758
Yeah, I can.

483
00:21:30,655 --> 00:21:31,517
Okay.

484
00:21:32,724 --> 00:21:33,931
I get you.

485
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:34,827
Just some sugar.

486
00:21:42,172 --> 00:21:43,551
You're too much, man.

487
00:22:02,896 --> 00:22:04,206
Oh shit. Sorry.

488
00:22:05,310 --> 00:22:07,172
You still here?

489
00:22:07,241 --> 00:22:08,310
Where your friends?

490
00:22:08,344 --> 00:22:09,758
Oh, they left a while ago.

491
00:22:10,896 --> 00:22:12,793
Your friends left you here?

492
00:22:12,827 --> 00:22:14,758
I, I know that's gotta
be against girl code

493
00:22:14,793 --> 00:22:15,793
or something, right?

494
00:22:16,896 --> 00:22:18,000
I told them they could go.

495
00:22:18,068 --> 00:22:19,758
I wanted to stay longer, plus,

496
00:22:19,758 --> 00:22:21,758
you know, they knew
I'd be in good hands.

497
00:22:23,068 --> 00:22:24,758
Well hey, we
definitely not gonna

498
00:22:24,758 --> 00:22:25,896
let anything happen to
you, that's for sure.

499
00:22:27,448 --> 00:22:31,413
Or we could let
something happen, Marcus,

500
00:22:31,413 --> 00:22:34,103
you know, just to
celebrate opening night.

501
00:22:35,310 --> 00:22:36,724
I'm good, Rocki.

502
00:22:36,724 --> 00:22:38,310
I'm good.

503
00:22:38,344 --> 00:22:40,068
That was celebration
enough out there, you know,

504
00:22:40,068 --> 00:22:41,241
the toast with your friends.

505
00:22:42,931 --> 00:22:45,000
Oh, well let me get
back out here to Rob.

506
00:22:45,068 --> 00:22:46,068
It's almost last call.

507
00:22:47,068 --> 00:22:47,896
Okay.

508
00:23:07,379 --> 00:23:09,137
- Hey baby.
- Hey!

509
00:23:09,172 --> 00:23:10,310
How was the rest
of your night?

510
00:23:10,310 --> 00:23:11,965
It was good. Go back to sleep.

511
00:23:13,310 --> 00:23:16,103
Oh, what time is it?

512
00:23:18,206 --> 00:23:19,034
4:00 a.m.!

513
00:23:20,344 --> 00:23:21,724
Marcus! Really?

514
00:23:23,379 --> 00:23:25,034
- I know.
- Come on.

515
00:23:25,068 --> 00:23:26,034
I know, I know, I know.

516
00:23:26,068 --> 00:23:27,482
Look, I'm sorry.

517
00:23:27,517 --> 00:23:30,482
I just, I had to check
the receipts, you know,

518
00:23:30,517 --> 00:23:33,137
make sure everything was
good for the next day.

519
00:23:33,172 --> 00:23:35,206
Okay. When are you
hiring a manager?

520
00:23:36,448 --> 00:23:37,862
I don't know.

521
00:23:37,896 --> 00:23:40,068
I guess sometime this week.

522
00:23:40,137 --> 00:23:41,068
I mean, I just was really
trying to get through

523
00:23:41,137 --> 00:23:43,241
this, this opening.

524
00:23:43,310 --> 00:23:46,241
Like what you need
to hire is a bodyguard

525
00:23:46,310 --> 00:23:48,862
to keep all these beautiful
women away from you.

526
00:23:50,310 --> 00:23:52,137
Come on now. You know
it ain't even like that.

527
00:23:52,172 --> 00:23:53,379
I can go to work and, and
I come right back here.

528
00:23:53,448 --> 00:23:54,413
Okay.

529
00:23:54,482 --> 00:23:56,827
Don't look at me and lie

530
00:23:56,862 --> 00:23:59,034
and act like I'm
the crazy one here.

531
00:23:59,068 --> 00:24:00,931
I saw you with my own eyes.

532
00:24:01,965 --> 00:24:03,000
You saw who?

533
00:24:04,103 --> 00:24:05,793
The chick in the green dress!

534
00:24:07,206 --> 00:24:10,034
Yeah, she was doing the
most all in your face,

535
00:24:10,034 --> 00:24:13,413
laughing and flirting
and I peeped all of that.

536
00:24:15,310 --> 00:24:17,827
Wait, you talking about Rocki?

537
00:24:17,896 --> 00:24:21,275
Baby, that's the sales rep
for the liquor company.

538
00:24:22,862 --> 00:24:23,965
She came through
to congratulate us

539
00:24:24,034 --> 00:24:26,137
on a, a successful opening.

540
00:24:26,206 --> 00:24:28,103
Hell, she hugs Swiss
too, as she should.

541
00:24:28,137 --> 00:24:29,758
We made her a ton of money.

542
00:24:30,896 --> 00:24:31,758
- Oh.
- Mm.

543
00:24:33,413 --> 00:24:34,862
Look, I'm sorry.

544
00:24:35,862 --> 00:24:37,551
I'm sorry, baby.

545
00:24:37,551 --> 00:24:39,862
I just, I think it's just
with me being pregnant

546
00:24:39,862 --> 00:24:42,379
and you not being here as much,

547
00:24:42,379 --> 00:24:45,379
I've been kind of crazy
the past couple of weeks.

548
00:24:45,379 --> 00:24:47,137
Yeah, a little bit.

549
00:24:47,206 --> 00:24:50,034
- Mm.
- But I understand.

550
00:24:50,034 --> 00:24:51,482
I promise it's gonna get easier.

551
00:24:51,551 --> 00:24:53,896
I'm not gonna have to
be there all the time.

552
00:24:53,931 --> 00:24:55,379
Okay.

553
00:24:55,413 --> 00:24:56,551
And the next time
one of the girls

554
00:24:56,551 --> 00:24:58,862
touch, hit they ass with a whoo!

555
00:25:00,448 --> 00:25:02,344
My wife is watching you.

556
00:25:02,379 --> 00:25:03,931
She probably watching
you and she crazy as hell

557
00:25:03,931 --> 00:25:05,275
and she don't want
nobody touching her man.

558
00:25:05,310 --> 00:25:07,241
Damn right.
Better let 'em know.

559
00:25:09,551 --> 00:25:11,551
Oh my God. Come
here, come here.

560
00:25:11,620 --> 00:25:13,137
Oh, he's doing something.

561
00:25:13,172 --> 00:25:14,931
Oh, he is doing,
he's moving, moving.

562
00:25:14,931 --> 00:25:18,206
Oh my gosh. Your son agrees.

563
00:25:18,275 --> 00:25:20,206
Hands off ladies.

564
00:25:20,275 --> 00:25:24,448
Hey son. This lady,
your mama, she is crazy.

565
00:25:24,482 --> 00:25:26,241
But I think we
gonna be all right.

566
00:25:31,586 --> 00:25:33,034
I love you.

567
00:25:33,103 --> 00:25:33,931
I love you.

568
00:25:39,551 --> 00:25:41,965
Well, since I ain't
gotta sneak in the bed,

569
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,068
I may go get on some
proper sleep clothes.

570
00:25:50,965 --> 00:25:52,172
So precious.

571
00:26:07,241 --> 00:26:08,655
Hey girl.

572
00:26:08,655 --> 00:26:10,275
What you doing?

573
00:26:10,344 --> 00:26:12,655
I've been trying to
call you all morning.

574
00:26:12,655 --> 00:26:14,517
I spent the morning in bed

575
00:26:14,551 --> 00:26:17,000
getting some vitamin
D from my husband.

576
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:20,689
Oh, about time.

577
00:26:20,689 --> 00:26:23,068
Now maybe you can act
right and chill out

578
00:26:23,103 --> 00:26:25,068
since Marcus gave you something.

579
00:26:25,103 --> 00:26:26,517
Because...

580
00:26:26,551 --> 00:26:29,137
I know, I know I
have been tripping,

581
00:26:29,206 --> 00:26:31,931
especially since I saw him
hugged up with that one girl.

582
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:33,344
But he explained
to me who she was.

583
00:26:33,379 --> 00:26:35,103
So everything's good.

584
00:26:35,172 --> 00:26:36,379
We're good.

585
00:26:40,482 --> 00:26:43,379
Shayla!

586
00:26:43,413 --> 00:26:45,275
What's happening?

587
00:26:45,344 --> 00:26:46,931
Answer me!

588
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:47,655
Oh my God.

589
00:26:49,551 --> 00:26:51,000
Hello? Hello?

590
00:26:51,034 --> 00:26:52,379
I need some help.

591
00:26:52,413 --> 00:26:53,517
I need some help. Yes.

592
00:26:53,551 --> 00:26:55,344
My neighbor's been hit by a car.

593
00:26:55,344 --> 00:26:56,344
Oh my God.
Okay.

594
00:26:56,344 --> 00:26:57,482
Shayla, you okay?

595
00:26:57,482 --> 00:26:58,551
You're okay? Good?

596
00:26:58,586 --> 00:26:59,551
You're doing fine.

597
00:26:59,586 --> 00:27:00,620
Your baby's fine.

598
00:27:00,655 --> 00:27:02,137
Hold on. Hold on.

599
00:27:02,172 --> 00:27:04,068
On the way.

600
00:27:08,172 --> 00:27:10,068
It's so dark in here.

601
00:27:11,310 --> 00:27:12,724
Let some light in.

602
00:27:14,655 --> 00:27:16,241
Close it.

603
00:27:16,275 --> 00:27:18,137
No, I'm not gonna do that.

604
00:27:18,172 --> 00:27:20,000
That's what you do every
day. All you do is sleep,

605
00:27:20,068 --> 00:27:22,137
get in the shower and
get back in the bed.

606
00:27:23,586 --> 00:27:25,620
Okay, I'm sorry if
I'm not bright-eyed

607
00:27:25,655 --> 00:27:28,000
and bushy-tailed enough for you.

608
00:27:28,034 --> 00:27:30,068
That's, that's not,
that's not what I'm saying.

609
00:27:30,103 --> 00:27:32,413
I'm just saying you
never go outside anymore.

610
00:27:32,413 --> 00:27:35,206
May, maybe you should
try running again.

611
00:27:36,551 --> 00:27:37,413
What?

612
00:27:38,413 --> 00:27:40,310
Running?

613
00:27:40,344 --> 00:27:43,034
You really think I feel like
running after losing my baby.

614
00:27:44,379 --> 00:27:46,000
Alright, baby.

615
00:27:46,068 --> 00:27:47,413
You're not the only one
that lost someone here.

616
00:27:47,413 --> 00:27:49,965
I'm the one who
carried him in my belly.

617
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:50,724
Not you.

618
00:27:52,275 --> 00:27:54,241
And while we're
talking about it,

619
00:27:54,241 --> 00:27:57,620
where the hell were you again
the day of the accident?

620
00:27:57,655 --> 00:27:59,689
Mika called you a hundred times

621
00:27:59,758 --> 00:28:02,241
and you took forever to
show up to the hospital.

622
00:28:02,310 --> 00:28:03,241
I told you where I was.

623
00:28:03,310 --> 00:28:04,379
I was at the bank.

624
00:28:04,413 --> 00:28:06,034
I was, I was at the bank.

625
00:28:06,068 --> 00:28:07,482
Right, yeah, you
keep saying that.

626
00:28:07,517 --> 00:28:09,827
And your phone
didn't ring, right?

627
00:28:09,827 --> 00:28:12,172
My phone didn't ring because
it was on silent, Shayla,

628
00:28:12,206 --> 00:28:13,482
I keep telling you
that, it was on silent.

629
00:28:13,482 --> 00:28:14,827
As soon as I took it off,

630
00:28:14,862 --> 00:28:16,172
I got the notification
of what happened

631
00:28:16,206 --> 00:28:17,689
and I rushed to you immediately.

632
00:28:17,724 --> 00:28:20,137
The fact of the
matter is, Marcus,

633
00:28:20,172 --> 00:28:21,793
you were not there with me.

634
00:28:23,206 --> 00:28:24,655
I was there all alone.

635
00:28:28,655 --> 00:28:29,655
I know, I know.

636
00:28:29,689 --> 00:28:31,551
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

637
00:28:31,620 --> 00:28:33,344
Don't touch me.

638
00:28:35,862 --> 00:28:39,655
I, I keep apologizing
over and over again

639
00:28:39,655 --> 00:28:43,068
for the hundred thousandth
time, I am sorry.

640
00:28:43,137 --> 00:28:44,379
Marcus, you don't get it.

641
00:28:46,206 --> 00:28:48,827
It doesn't matter how
many times you say sorry,

642
00:28:48,827 --> 00:28:53,034
that will never ever
bring my baby back.

643
00:28:54,310 --> 00:28:55,655
You act like it's my fault.

644
00:28:55,689 --> 00:28:57,310
You act like what
happened was my fault.

645
00:28:57,310 --> 00:28:58,482
Like I was, like I
was driving the car.

646
00:28:58,517 --> 00:28:59,620
Okay,
you think I care

647
00:28:59,620 --> 00:29:01,413
whose fault it was, Marcus?

648
00:29:02,862 --> 00:29:04,655
Just trying to,
just trying to help.

649
00:29:04,724 --> 00:29:08,034
Well, you're not,
you're not helping.

650
00:29:09,275 --> 00:29:11,724
Why don't you just, just leave.

651
00:29:13,517 --> 00:29:14,689
Leave me alone.

652
00:29:25,241 --> 00:29:29,034
Alright, I know that's
your pain speaking,

653
00:29:31,379 --> 00:29:32,827
but I've been trying to
give you time to think

654
00:29:32,896 --> 00:29:37,413
about all this and if
something don't change,

655
00:29:37,448 --> 00:29:40,448
things do not change, Shayla,

656
00:29:43,413 --> 00:29:44,517
Just not gonna make it.

657
00:30:10,724 --> 00:30:13,517
So ladies, we're
gonna start with Shayla.

658
00:30:14,896 --> 00:30:16,793
Shayla, can you tell
us what brings you

659
00:30:16,862 --> 00:30:19,344
comfort right now, if anything?

660
00:30:21,379 --> 00:30:25,344
Comfort? Nothing.

661
00:30:27,862 --> 00:30:29,206
How could I feel comfort?

662
00:30:31,206 --> 00:30:32,862
Two months ago I lost my baby.

663
00:30:34,724 --> 00:30:37,413
And now I'm pretty sure my
husband is cheating on me.

664
00:30:37,448 --> 00:30:39,034
Damn, girl, that's messed up.

665
00:30:40,206 --> 00:30:42,137
Do you have proof he's cheating?

666
00:30:42,172 --> 00:30:47,034
No, but he's surrounded by
beautiful woman all the time.

667
00:30:48,448 --> 00:30:51,137
And when he gets home,
he's frustrated with me.

668
00:30:51,206 --> 00:30:54,172
He says he's tired of me
acting like I can't move on.

669
00:30:55,620 --> 00:30:58,137
That doesn't mean
that he's cheating.

670
00:30:58,206 --> 00:31:00,689
Could it be that he's
tried to connect with you?

671
00:31:03,379 --> 00:31:04,620
All we do is argue.

672
00:31:06,448 --> 00:31:09,344
And I know he doesn't even
like being around me anymore.

673
00:31:10,482 --> 00:31:12,241
It's gotta be another woman.

674
00:31:13,827 --> 00:31:16,172
I've been cheated on before
and I know the signs.

675
00:31:16,206 --> 00:31:17,620
Me too, girl.

676
00:31:17,655 --> 00:31:19,689
Yeah, that's how my
boyfriend was acting

677
00:31:19,758 --> 00:31:21,275
when he was cheating.

678
00:31:21,310 --> 00:31:23,344
He stayed complaining about me.

679
00:31:23,379 --> 00:31:26,379
Look ladies, ladies,

680
00:31:26,448 --> 00:31:29,655
we are here to talk
about how we feel

681
00:31:29,689 --> 00:31:32,586
and what we need to
be in a happier place.

682
00:31:33,517 --> 00:31:36,275
So with that, Shayla,

683
00:31:36,310 --> 00:31:38,758
can you please tell
us how you're feeling?

684
00:31:44,206 --> 00:31:49,172
I feel...empty inside.

685
00:31:52,206 --> 00:31:55,655
Like I'm just wandering through
life with nowhere to go.

686
00:31:59,827 --> 00:32:01,310
My baby is gone

687
00:32:05,034 --> 00:32:10,206
and I spend most of
my days alone at home

688
00:32:12,586 --> 00:32:13,931
while Marcus is at work.

689
00:32:18,724 --> 00:32:21,275
And when he does try to
be affectionate with me,

690
00:32:21,344 --> 00:32:24,413
I, I don't want him to touch me.

691
00:32:24,448 --> 00:32:25,655
I resent him, honestly.

692
00:32:28,413 --> 00:32:29,931
And why is that?

693
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:32,517
Why are you rejecting him?

694
00:32:32,551 --> 00:32:35,241
Because he's doing it
out of obligation and pity.

695
00:32:36,517 --> 00:32:38,000
I don't feel attractive.

696
00:32:39,793 --> 00:32:43,241
I have all this baby
weight and no baby.

697
00:32:44,758 --> 00:32:47,655
My hair sheds because
of the hormones.

698
00:32:49,379 --> 00:32:51,689
I just, I don't even try
to fix myself up anymore

699
00:32:51,724 --> 00:32:54,655
because it's pointless.

700
00:32:56,551 --> 00:32:58,827
I don't, I don't think I'm
ever gonna feel better.

701
00:32:59,896 --> 00:33:02,724
You will, you will.

702
00:33:03,827 --> 00:33:05,724
It just takes time.

703
00:33:07,103 --> 00:33:10,793
Look, and guess what,
you comin' here today,

704
00:33:10,827 --> 00:33:13,034
it's the start of
you getting better.

705
00:33:16,551 --> 00:33:19,448
- Really?
- Yes!

706
00:33:19,482 --> 00:33:21,724
Now all you have to do
is take that first step.

707
00:33:23,482 --> 00:33:24,379
Which is?

708
00:33:25,931 --> 00:33:28,034
You have to talk
to your husband.

709
00:33:29,620 --> 00:33:30,758
You have to tell
him how you feel.

710
00:33:32,793 --> 00:33:36,034
Not the details of
what happened, but
how you're feeling.

711
00:33:37,862 --> 00:33:42,551
You talk first and you allow
him the opportunity to respond.

712
00:33:43,896 --> 00:33:47,379
Listen to how he's
feeling as well.

713
00:33:47,379 --> 00:33:48,379
Can you do that?

714
00:33:56,448 --> 00:33:57,310
Yes.

715
00:33:59,586 --> 00:34:00,482
Okay.

716
00:34:00,517 --> 00:34:01,724
Good. Good.

717
00:34:03,137 --> 00:34:05,827
Well ladies, that's our time.

718
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:20,896
So thank you so much
for coming with me today.

719
00:34:21,827 --> 00:34:23,482
I really appreciate you.

720
00:34:23,482 --> 00:34:25,793
Now you my girl
for life. I got you.

721
00:34:25,793 --> 00:34:27,379
Now you know that.

722
00:34:27,413 --> 00:34:29,000
And look, I am glad

723
00:34:29,034 --> 00:34:30,724
that you're working
through some of this stuff,

724
00:34:30,793 --> 00:34:33,000
'cause child, it's a lot.

725
00:34:34,137 --> 00:34:36,000
Yeah, it is.

726
00:34:37,413 --> 00:34:38,655
But today helped.

727
00:34:38,689 --> 00:34:40,137
Okay.

728
00:34:40,137 --> 00:34:44,551
It made me feel not
good, but a little okay.

729
00:34:48,655 --> 00:34:50,724
And guess what?

730
00:34:50,793 --> 00:34:52,655
What?

731
00:34:52,689 --> 00:34:54,965
You know, what else might
make you feel even more okay?

732
00:34:55,965 --> 00:34:56,965
What?

733
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:58,862
Child, getting some s-

734
00:34:58,896 --> 00:34:59,655
Okay. You better not say
what I think you about to say.

735
00:35:01,034 --> 00:35:03,068
Girl. I was gonna
say self-care.

736
00:35:04,793 --> 00:35:07,103
Yes. Look, let me
hook up your hair.

737
00:35:07,137 --> 00:35:08,758
Do a little, some, some.

738
00:35:08,793 --> 00:35:11,137
No Mika, I don't
wanna go to the salon.

739
00:35:11,206 --> 00:35:13,034
I'm not ready to be
around people yet.

740
00:35:13,034 --> 00:35:15,758
Okay, well no worries.

741
00:35:15,793 --> 00:35:17,724
Child, I can do it right here.

742
00:35:17,724 --> 00:35:20,586
Yes. Now look, I'll do
a little wash amd style,

744
00:35:22,965 --> 00:35:25,758
That's it. Yes.

was hit by her car.

00:40:24,137 --> 00:40:26,172
Oh my God. Marcus.

834
00:40:26,206 --> 00:40:27,793
I'm so sorry. I didn't know.

835
00:40:28,724 --> 00:40:30,137
Well, what happened?

836
00:40:30,172 --> 00:40:31,862
Did they find the
person that did it?

837
00:40:31,896 --> 00:40:35,275
Nope. Just kept
driving like nothing.

838
00:40:37,206 --> 00:40:39,034
You know, that's had
an effect on her.

839
00:40:40,137 --> 00:40:41,000

been there to protect her.

Marcus. It wasn't your fault.

846
00:41:00,137 --> 00:41:01,551
Okay?

847
00:41:01,551 --> 00:41:03,103
And your wife is
probably just distraught

848
00:41:03,137 --> 00:41:04,758
and needs time to
deal with everything.

849
00:41:04,793 --> 00:41:06,206
I've given her time.

850
00:41:06,241 --> 00:41:08,241
I, I've been, I've
given her time.

851
00:41:08,275 --> 00:41:10,758
But I, I I got needs too.

852
00:41:12,310 --> 00:41:13,241
Of course you do.

853
00:41:14,827 --> 00:41:18,275
So tell me, what
exactly do you need?

854
00:41:22,103 --> 00:41:24,034
♪ Alright, you trying
to be somebody ♪

855
00:41:24,068 --> 00:41:25,413
♪ Why you dressed in all white

856
00:41:25,448 --> 00:41:26,965
Will you dance with me?

857
00:41:27,034 --> 00:41:28,448
♪ Might be your lucky guy

858
00:41:28,482 --> 00:41:30,379
♪ Just one night,

859
00:41:30,413 --> 00:41:32,034

863
00:41:40,206 --> 00:41:42,206
Marcus?

864
00:41:42,241 --> 00:41:47,206
Baby, where are you?

865
00:41:53,862 --> 00:41:54,724
Marcus?

866
00:41:56,344 --> 00:41:57,931
Uh.

867
00:41:57,965 --> 00:41:59,103
So all these late
nights at the bar

868
00:42:00,931 --> 00:42:03,827
while I'm home waiting for
you, this is what you're doing?

869
00:42:03,862 --> 00:42:06,103
Baby, of, of course not, baby.

870
00:42:06,103 --> 00:42:07,931
Listen, I, I know it looks bad,

871
00:42:07,965 --> 00:42:09,275
but I swear nothing happened.

872
00:42:09,275 --> 00:42:10,965
Nothing happened?

873
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:14,068
You gonna stand here and
lie to me in my face.

874
00:42:14,137 --> 00:42:17,034
Like I didn't just see her
running outta here half naked.

875
00:42:17,103 --> 00:42:18,965
Baby. Listen,
I'm not gonna lie.

876
00:42:18,965 --> 00:42:21,517
Okay? We kissed, we kissed
and that, that's bad.

877
00:42:21,551 --> 00:42:22,862
Okay? But that's
all that happened.

878
00:42:22,931 --> 00:42:24,137
I swear we didn't have sex.

879
00:42:26,517 --> 00:42:28,965
You've been cheating
on me this whole time.

880
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:30,482
I knew it.

881
00:42:30,517 --> 00:42:32,137
I knew it.

882
00:42:32,172 --> 00:42:33,275
Baby, I swear to God
I haven't cheated on you

883
00:42:33,310 --> 00:42:35,620
since we've been married. Okay?

884
00:42:35,620 --> 00:42:37,620
Right, because when
we first got together

885
00:42:37,655 --> 00:42:39,137
you were cheating then too.

886
00:42:41,103 --> 00:42:44,344
Look, I, I, I swear,
you, please believe me.

887
00:42:44,379 --> 00:42:46,517
Before it went any further
I told her to leave.

888
00:42:46,586 --> 00:42:47,827
I promise.

889
00:43:03,689 --> 00:43:05,689
We got
three more. We're working.

890
00:43:05,689 --> 00:43:08,896
Activate the band.
Follow the steps.

891
00:43:08,931 --> 00:43:11,689
Ma'am, okay, I know
you on a mission.

892
00:43:11,689 --> 00:43:13,896
But damn, can you
take it down a notch?

893
00:43:13,931 --> 00:43:15,034
- Here we go.
- Look, I get it.

894
00:43:15,068 --> 00:43:17,379
Girl, you in revenge body mode.

895
00:43:17,413 --> 00:43:18,586
You're damn right I am.

896
00:43:20,448 --> 00:43:23,103
But it's not revenge that's
motivating me, it's anger.

897
00:43:23,172 --> 00:43:25,034
I still cannot believe
I caught Marcus

898
00:43:25,068 --> 00:43:26,448
and that girl in his office.

899
00:43:26,517 --> 00:43:29,482
And he's still lying about it.

900
00:43:29,482 --> 00:43:31,344
Typical.

901
00:43:31,344 --> 00:43:33,517
Caught red-handed and he
still won't admit to anything.

902
00:43:33,517 --> 00:43:36,689
Look girl, he taking
that shit to the grave.

903
00:43:36,689 --> 00:43:39,379
And he keeps insisting
that they didn't have sex.

904
00:43:39,413 --> 00:43:40,551
Ha!

905
00:43:40,586 --> 00:43:42,172
Like I'm boo boo the fool.

906
00:43:42,206 --> 00:43:43,586
Let's
talk golf and fitness.

907
00:43:43,620 --> 00:43:45,344
Well look, the way
you've been working out,

908
00:43:45,379 --> 00:43:49,034
girl, he better get his
shit together and quick.

909
00:43:49,068 --> 00:43:51,379
That body fixin' to
be right and tight.

910
00:43:51,413 --> 00:43:53,034
Girl, please.

911
00:43:53,068 --> 00:43:55,448
We don't even sleep in
the same bed anymore.

912
00:43:55,517 --> 00:43:57,206
Hell, we barely even talk.

913
00:43:57,241 --> 00:43:59,172
We just argue.

914
00:43:59,172 --> 00:44:00,275
Down around
the bottom of your ankles.

915
00:44:00,344 --> 00:44:01,310
Well word on the street,

916
00:44:02,413 --> 00:44:04,413
he booed up with some chick.

917
00:44:04,413 --> 00:44:05,655
Girl, he don't miss a beat.

918
00:44:07,172 --> 00:44:08,034
What chick?

919
00:44:09,241 --> 00:44:10,068
Who is she?

920
00:44:10,103 --> 00:44:10,965
I don't know.

921
00:44:12,068 --> 00:44:13,689
But I can find out though,

922
00:44:13,758 --> 00:44:16,482
It's probably that same girl
he was in his office with.

923
00:44:16,517 --> 00:44:18,137
How do
I get a better ability

924
00:44:18,172 --> 00:44:19,965
to feel transition?

925
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:21,655
You want me to spy on him?

926
00:44:21,724 --> 00:44:23,344
Because you know I will.

927
00:44:23,413 --> 00:44:26,275
Oh, just say the word
and I will get to it.

928
00:44:26,310 --> 00:44:28,620
Look, I'll find out who
she is, where she live,

929
00:44:28,655 --> 00:44:31,413
her social security number
and get her blood type.

930
00:44:31,448 --> 00:44:33,068
Girl you know how I do.

931
00:44:33,103 --> 00:44:35,103
No, no, I am good,

932
00:44:35,137 --> 00:44:37,103
'cause I remember what
happened last time

933
00:44:37,137 --> 00:44:38,724
you spied on somebody.

934
00:44:38,724 --> 00:44:39,965
Yeah.

935
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:43,275
That was an adventure, girl.

936
00:44:43,310 --> 00:44:45,068
Look, but I survived.

937
00:44:45,068 --> 00:44:47,413
I just can't believe I
was jumping over a gate

938
00:44:47,448 --> 00:44:49,103
and she sicked her dog on me.

939
00:44:49,137 --> 00:44:51,758
You did follow your
man to her house,

940
00:44:51,758 --> 00:44:54,172
tried to sneak in her
house and got caught.

941
00:44:54,241 --> 00:44:55,965
I woulda did the same thing.

942
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:57,724
That was not a game. Okay?

943
00:44:57,724 --> 00:44:59,655
I was fighting for my life.

944
00:44:59,689 --> 00:45:01,344
Then I slipped on some grass,

945
00:45:01,379 --> 00:45:03,724
the damn dog attacked
me, biting my shoe.

946
00:45:03,758 --> 00:45:06,103
Girl!
What kinda dog was it again?

947
00:45:08,310 --> 00:45:10,206
A Jack Russell
Terrier or some shit.

948
00:45:11,655 --> 00:45:13,689
Girl, but then the
damn dog peed on me

949
00:45:13,724 --> 00:45:17,137
and then old girl had the
nerve to call the police on me!

950
00:45:17,137 --> 00:45:19,172
Girl about to have me out
here with a criminal record.

951
00:45:19,206 --> 00:45:20,827
I ain't lying.

952
00:45:20,827 --> 00:45:24,275
And here you are
volunteering to spy again.

953
00:45:25,310 --> 00:45:27,000
Girl you are just nuts.

954
00:45:28,137 --> 00:45:29,379
Girl, for you.

955
00:45:30,517 --> 00:45:31,793
I'll get mauled by a dog.

956
00:45:33,344 --> 00:45:37,310
Aw, thank you for
the offer, but...

957
00:45:37,310 --> 00:45:38,689
I'm good. For real.

958
00:45:38,724 --> 00:45:40,620
I'm just, I'm just
really focused

959
00:45:40,620 --> 00:45:42,103
on getting myself together.

960
00:45:43,482 --> 00:45:45,310
And once
you've transitioned,

961
00:45:45,310 --> 00:45:50,034
literally rotate your body,
bring your arch into the ground.

962
00:45:50,068 --> 00:45:51,689
Every time for the last week,

963
00:45:51,724 --> 00:45:52,793
this guy's been out
here working out

964
00:45:52,827 --> 00:45:54,793
and at the same time as you?

965
00:45:54,793 --> 00:45:57,310
Girl, he must be
checking you out.

966
00:45:57,344 --> 00:45:58,620
Who?

967
00:45:58,655 --> 00:45:59,620
Cutie over there.

968
00:46:01,241 --> 00:46:04,068
Damn, he is fine.

969
00:46:05,448 --> 00:46:07,275
Go on, look. Smile back
at him, Shayla, go.

970
00:46:08,724 --> 00:46:10,241
Feel
the ground, rotate,

971
00:46:10,275 --> 00:46:12,275
transition and release.

972
00:46:12,344 --> 00:46:13,689
Damn.

973
00:46:13,689 --> 00:46:15,379
Girl, he is fine.

974
00:46:15,379 --> 00:46:17,206
Activate the band.

975
00:46:17,241 --> 00:46:18,206
Follow the steps.

976
00:46:18,241 --> 00:46:19,379
How you ladies doing?

977
00:46:19,413 --> 00:46:21,379
- Rotate.
- I'm Jamar.

978
00:46:21,413 --> 00:46:24,344
Hi, I'm Tamika and this
is my bestie, Shayla.

979
00:46:26,724 --> 00:46:28,206
Nice to meet you, Shayla.

980
00:46:28,241 --> 00:46:29,172
Likewise.

981
00:46:30,586 --> 00:46:32,758
I've never seen you
around here before.

982
00:46:32,793 --> 00:46:34,103
Do you live out here?

983
00:46:34,137 --> 00:46:35,862
Nah, I don't live in the area.

984
00:46:35,862 --> 00:46:37,551
I just like it here.

985
00:46:37,551 --> 00:46:39,379
You know, being that I
am a personal trainer,

986
00:46:39,413 --> 00:46:42,448
I like to work out where
it's peaceful and quiet.

987
00:46:42,482 --> 00:46:45,275
You know, now that I
know you work out here,

988
00:46:45,310 --> 00:46:47,793
I may have to make it a habit
to be here a bit more often.

989
00:46:47,862 --> 00:46:50,379
Hmm. Okay.

990
00:46:50,413 --> 00:46:52,586
So you said you're a trainer.

991
00:46:52,620 --> 00:46:54,793
I've been thinking about
getting myself a trainer.

992
00:46:54,827 --> 00:46:57,655
Help me, you know,
snap back, get fit.

993
00:46:57,724 --> 00:46:58,620
Okay, well look from
where I'm standing,

994
00:46:58,689 --> 00:47:00,793
you look good to me.

995
00:47:00,827 --> 00:47:04,379
Thank you, but I'm trying
to look better than good.

996
00:47:04,448 --> 00:47:05,827
I wanna look great.

997
00:47:05,862 --> 00:47:07,379
Okay, well look,

998
00:47:07,448 --> 00:47:08,793
you should definitely
take my number

999
00:47:08,827 --> 00:47:11,413
and uh, maybe I can help
you reach that goal.

1000
00:47:12,482 --> 00:47:13,344

Yep.

1011
00:47:41,862 --> 00:47:43,241
You headed to the gym?

1012
00:47:44,758 --> 00:47:45,586
I am.

1013
00:47:48,724 --> 00:47:50,482
It's good to see
you keeping busy

1014
00:47:51,758 --> 00:47:53,758
and you're looking, look good.

1015
00:47:53,758 --> 00:47:54,620
Toning up.

1016
00:47:55,793 --> 00:47:56,655
I see it.

1017
00:47:57,931 --> 00:47:58,793
Thanks.

1018
00:48:01,413 --> 00:48:02,310
Can we talk?

1019
00:48:03,413 --> 00:48:04,310
About what?

1020
00:48:05,689 --> 00:48:07,344
For starters,
the bar that night.

1021
00:48:07,344 --> 00:48:09,413
I mean, you gotta,
you gotta believe me

1022
00:48:09,448 --> 00:48:11,379
when I tell you
nothing happened.

1023
00:48:11,413 --> 00:48:14,000
I believe what I saw, Marcus.

1024
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:15,517
And until you stop
lying about it

1025
00:48:15,551 --> 00:48:17,344
and just tell me the truth,

1026
00:48:17,379 --> 00:48:18,344
I have nothing to say to you.

1027
00:48:18,379 --> 00:48:19,689
I'm not lying to you.

1028
00:48:19,724 --> 00:48:21,275
I'm telling you the truth.

1029
00:48:21,344 --> 00:48:22,413
You just don't
wanna listen to me.

1030
00:48:22,448 --> 00:48:23,551
Like what, you want me to lie

1031
00:48:23,586 --> 00:48:25,000
and say that I had sex with her?

1032
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:27,241
We have nothing at
all to talk about.

1033
00:48:27,275 --> 00:48:30,379
So you can just keep doing
whatever the fuck you wanna do

1034
00:48:30,413 --> 00:48:31,931
with whoever you wanna
do it with, okay?

1035
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:33,551
Wait, what are
you talking about?

1036
00:48:33,586 --> 00:48:34,655
I'm saying that I
know all about the chick

1037
00:48:34,689 --> 00:48:36,000
you've been running around with.

1038
00:48:36,034 --> 00:48:37,689
That's what I'm saying.

1039
00:48:37,689 --> 00:48:39,620
What the fuck are
you talking about now?

1040
00:48:39,689 --> 00:48:41,344
I literally haven't
been with anyone.

1041
00:48:41,379 --> 00:48:43,517
I go to work and I come
back here every day.

1042
00:48:43,517 --> 00:48:45,586
We all know what
you do at your office

1043
00:48:45,620 --> 00:48:47,655
in between that
time now, don't we?

1044
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:50,655
So why don't you
just leave me alone?

1045
00:48:52,034 --> 00:48:54,379
You keep saying that
shit to me, Shayla.

1046
00:48:54,413 --> 00:48:55,551
You want that to
happen because I swear

1047
00:48:55,586 --> 00:48:57,448
I can make it happen for you.

1048
00:48:57,517 --> 00:48:59,413
So do it.

1049
00:49:00,551 --> 00:49:02,068
I don't care.

1050
00:49:02,068 --> 00:49:03,620
Come on. No, I didn't.

1051
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:06,724
Look. I think we
need to calm down.

1052
00:49:08,103 --> 00:49:10,965
Alright, maybe, maybe
I should find somewhere

1053
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:13,724
to sleep for the next few days.

1054
00:49:13,758 --> 00:49:14,896
Give us some space.

1055
00:49:15,931 --> 00:49:17,448
Yeah.

1056
00:49:17,482 --> 00:49:18,620
Great idea.

1057
00:49:46,724 --> 00:49:47,965
Hey, chill.

1058
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:50,344
Watch out.

1059
00:49:50,413 --> 00:49:51,034
What's wrong?

1060
00:49:52,896 --> 00:49:54,344
Shit, I don't know.

1061
00:49:54,413 --> 00:49:56,379
Fucking head and I can't sleep.

1062
00:49:57,758 --> 00:49:59,413
My fucking mind
all over the place.

1063
00:50:01,448 --> 00:50:03,551
I hate seeing you
stressed out like this.

1064
00:50:05,448 --> 00:50:06,931
Here's an idea.

1065
00:50:06,965 --> 00:50:08,896
I have a work trip next
week in California,

1066
00:50:08,896 --> 00:50:12,000
so why don't you come with me?

1067
00:50:12,068 --> 00:50:13,862
It'll be a nice getaway
for the both of us

1068
00:50:13,931 --> 00:50:16,551
and we can spend some quality
time together, finally.

1069
00:50:18,068 --> 00:50:20,758
Thanks but, no thanks.

1070
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:24,793
I mean, I know you
mean well, I do.

1071
00:50:26,068 --> 00:50:27,689
And thank you.

1072
00:50:27,758 --> 00:50:30,482
I appreciate you for
letting me stay here,

1073
00:50:30,517 --> 00:50:33,896
but this shit is moving
a little too fast for me.

1074
00:50:35,448 --> 00:50:37,103
You know, as we
speaking right now,

1075
00:50:37,137 --> 00:50:39,758
I'm sitting here thinking
about my feelings for Shayla,

1076
00:50:39,793 --> 00:50:42,586
so I cannot go
anywhere right now,

1077
00:50:42,586 --> 00:50:45,586
especially on a out
of town trip with you.

1078
00:50:45,586 --> 00:50:46,724
I thought you
said she told you

1079
00:50:46,724 --> 00:50:48,724
to leave her the hell alone?

1080
00:50:48,724 --> 00:50:49,586
Yeah.

1081
00:50:50,724 --> 00:50:52,034
Yep, that's what she said.

1082
00:50:53,620 --> 00:50:55,724
But we both said a
lot of fucked up shit.

1083
00:50:55,724 --> 00:50:56,586
We're hurt.

1084
00:50:57,724 --> 00:50:59,482
It's hard losing a baby.

1085
00:51:03,517 --> 00:51:07,517
Sometimes, sometimes I
think both of us don't know

1086
00:51:07,551 --> 00:51:11,965
whether it's the pain
speaking or, or honesty.

1087
00:51:16,172 --> 00:51:18,827
Look Rocki, I like you.

1088
00:51:20,517 --> 00:51:21,379
I swear I do.

1089
00:51:23,724 --> 00:51:28,482
But I just need some time
to think about all this shit

1090
00:51:28,482 --> 00:51:30,965
before I just jump
into something else.

1091
00:51:35,793 --> 00:51:36,689
I understand.

1092
00:51:37,793 --> 00:51:38,827
I was just tryin' to help.

1093
00:51:38,862 --> 00:51:39,689
No, no, no, no.

1094
00:51:39,724 --> 00:51:40,620
Come here.

1095
00:51:41,827 --> 00:51:43,379
I'm sorry. You have, a lot.

1096
00:51:43,413 --> 00:51:45,000
I'm, I'm grateful.

1097
00:51:46,137 --> 00:51:48,000
Hell, if it wasn't for you,

1098
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:50,482
I'd literally be camped out
in my office on my sofa.

1099
00:51:53,482 --> 00:51:58,448
But, I think I, I need to
find somewhere else to stay

1100
00:51:59,517 --> 00:52:01,206
until I get my head right.

1101
00:52:01,241 --> 00:52:02,827
No, please, look, you
don't have to do that, okay?

1102
00:52:02,896 --> 00:52:04,689
Just, you can stay here
as long as you want.

1103
00:52:04,689 --> 00:52:06,586
It's plenty of space.

1104
00:52:06,620 --> 00:52:09,724
And I will respect whatever
boundaries that you have.

1105
00:52:12,724 --> 00:52:15,862
Raquel, I don't want any
mixed signals between us.

1106
00:52:15,896 --> 00:52:17,206
We're both grown ass people.

1107
00:52:17,206 --> 00:52:18,758
There's no mixed signals.

1108
00:52:18,793 --> 00:52:20,758
Okay. Okay.

1109
00:52:20,793 --> 00:52:22,586
Don't act like you don't
know what I'm talking about.

1110
00:52:22,620 --> 00:52:25,000
You know, we have crossed
boundaries since I've been here.

1111
00:52:26,827 --> 00:52:29,862
We have, but don't act
like I'm the only one

1112
00:52:29,862 --> 00:52:31,034
who liked it when we did.

1113
00:52:34,551 --> 00:52:35,793
That's my point exactly.

1114
00:52:37,241 --> 00:52:39,413
I have too, but...

1115
00:52:40,586 --> 00:52:42,068
But what?

1116
00:52:42,103 --> 00:52:44,551
Oh come on, Marcus.

1117
00:52:44,551 --> 00:52:46,724
You know we vibe and I'm
not just talking about

1118
00:52:46,758 --> 00:52:48,551
on a sexual level either.

1119
00:52:48,551 --> 00:52:50,034
We make a hell of
a business team.

1120
00:52:52,896 --> 00:52:55,724
Yeah, that's right.

1121
00:52:55,724 --> 00:52:58,068
Look, I've come up with new
ideas for marketing and PR

1122
00:52:58,103 --> 00:53:01,000
to make Flirt even more
successful than it's been.

1123
00:53:01,068 --> 00:53:04,206
It's lit now, but once
you put my plan into play,

1124
00:53:04,275 --> 00:53:06,241
you'll be able to
expand if you want to.

1125
00:53:07,103 --> 00:53:08,103
For real?

1126
00:53:08,137 --> 00:53:09,965
Hell yeah.

1127
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:11,827
And maybe focusing on
business instead of a woman

1128
00:53:11,862 --> 00:53:13,137
who doesn't even
want to talk to you

1129
00:53:13,172 --> 00:53:14,586
will help clear your head.

1130
00:53:16,275 --> 00:53:17,137
Yeah.

1131
00:53:19,310 --> 00:53:20,448
Yeah, you're right.

1132
00:53:22,793 --> 00:53:24,862
But I still think I need
to get my own space.

1133
00:53:28,965 --> 00:53:32,068
Yeah. Like I gotta, I
gotta get to the bar.

1134
00:53:36,931 --> 00:53:38,241
Thank you for understanding.

1135
00:54:01,344 --> 00:54:02,827
Hey, I'm just checking in

1136
00:54:02,862 --> 00:54:04,172
and seeing how
everything's going.

1137
00:54:07,068 --> 00:54:09,034
Oh okay, good.

1138
00:54:09,034 --> 00:54:12,758
I um, I'm gonna need for you
to step it up a little bit.

1139
00:54:29,344 --> 00:54:30,827
- Hi.
- Okay.

1140
00:54:32,689 --> 00:54:35,551
Damn, those extra sessions
are definitely playing off.

1141
00:54:37,206 --> 00:54:38,655
Thank you.

1142
00:54:38,689 --> 00:54:40,241
It's my trainer.

1143
00:54:40,275 --> 00:54:41,310
He's the best.

1144
00:54:41,310 --> 00:54:42,172
Mm-hmm.

1145
00:54:44,206 --> 00:54:45,827
These are for you.

1146
00:54:45,862 --> 00:54:48,172
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

1147
00:54:50,827 --> 00:54:52,758
- I appreciate you.
- No problem.

1148
00:55:04,896 --> 00:55:06,896
Why don't we go upstairs,

1149
00:55:06,931 --> 00:55:08,965
make ourselves a little
more comfortable.

1150
00:55:09,931 --> 00:55:11,413
I'd like that.

1151
00:55:11,448 --> 00:55:13,793
♪ I'm so lost in this moment

I thought you left.

00:55:34,896 --> 00:55:36,827
Without saying goodbye?

1161
00:55:36,896 --> 00:55:38,758
Hell no.

1162
00:55:38,793 --> 00:55:41,931
Look, I could never do that to
someone as beautiful as you.

1163
00:55:41,965 --> 00:55:44,931
Oh, you really
think I'm beautiful?

1164
00:55:44,965 --> 00:55:45,827
Damn right.

1165
00:55:47,448 --> 00:55:49,413
Listen, I know you've
been through a lot of shit

1166
00:55:49,413 --> 00:55:51,413
of these past few months.

1167
00:55:51,413 --> 00:55:54,172
What your ex did had nothing
to do with your looks.

1168
00:55:54,241 --> 00:55:56,103
You are gorgeous.

1169
00:55:56,137 --> 00:55:58,000
And that's the first thing I
noticed about you at the park.

1170
00:55:59,241 --> 00:56:00,137
Aw.

1171
00:56:06,793 --> 00:56:08,793
I'll see you later?

1172
00:56:08,793 --> 00:56:09,862
Definitely.

1173
00:56:45,379 --> 00:56:47,413
You're looking lovely today.

1174
00:56:47,482 --> 00:56:49,241
Things must have gotten better.

1175
00:56:49,310 --> 00:56:50,413
Thank you.

1176
00:56:50,482 --> 00:56:52,793
And yes, they have.

1177
00:56:52,793 --> 00:56:53,862
I met someone new.

1178
00:56:55,448 --> 00:56:58,137
He is so amazing.

1179
00:56:58,172 --> 00:57:00,379
He makes me feel beautiful.

1180
00:57:00,413 --> 00:57:02,551
He compliments me all the time.

1181
00:57:02,551 --> 00:57:04,137
But it's not that he says it,

1182
00:57:04,206 --> 00:57:08,000
it's the way he looks
at me and he smiles.

1183
00:57:09,241 --> 00:57:11,103
I know he thinks I'm beautiful.

1184
00:57:11,137 --> 00:57:13,206
Yes. I'm so happy for you.

1185
00:57:13,206 --> 00:57:14,517
That must be the best
feeling in the world, girl.

1186
00:57:14,517 --> 00:57:15,862
Mm-hmm.

1187
00:57:15,862 --> 00:57:16,965
Girl, I know that's right.

1188
00:57:17,034 --> 00:57:18,206
You better hold onto him.

1189
00:57:18,241 --> 00:57:19,448
Oh, I am.

1190
00:57:19,482 --> 00:57:22,827
Plus he is so fine.

1191
00:57:22,896 --> 00:57:26,172
What she didn't tell
y'all was he is super fine.

1192
00:57:27,310 --> 00:57:30,758
Okay?

1193
00:57:30,793 --> 00:57:34,275
Shayla, let me ask you this.

1194
00:57:34,310 --> 00:57:37,000
Are you using this new
man as a distraction

1195
00:57:37,068 --> 00:57:39,827
from the unresolved issues
you have with your husband?

1196
00:57:39,896 --> 00:57:42,068
Well, what does one
have to do with the other?

1197
00:57:42,103 --> 00:57:43,551
Everything.

1198
00:57:43,586 --> 00:57:46,137
Now it's fine if
you wanna move on,

1199
00:57:46,206 --> 00:57:47,517
if that's what you wanna do,

1200
00:57:49,034 --> 00:57:51,758
but you can't
ignore the feelings

1201
00:57:51,793 --> 00:57:53,344
you still have for your husband.

1202
00:57:56,931 --> 00:57:58,862
You're still wearing
your wedding ring.

1203
00:58:00,137 --> 00:58:01,862
You have to be
honest with yourself.

1204
00:58:03,275 --> 00:58:06,068
Are you still in
love with Marcus?

1205
00:58:10,137 --> 00:58:15,103
Shayla, you've benefited
from the group therapy,

1206
00:58:16,931 --> 00:58:21,000
but maybe, maybe it's
time for you and Marcus

1207
00:58:21,034 --> 00:58:22,793
to come in for a
private session.

1208
00:58:24,931 --> 00:58:26,344
Maybe.

1209
00:58:26,379 --> 00:58:28,448
Um, why would she
have to do that?

1210
00:58:28,482 --> 00:58:30,275
Why can't she just
take the ring off?

1211
00:58:30,310 --> 00:58:32,275
I mean, it's over, right?

1212
00:58:32,310 --> 00:58:34,344
Shayla, don't listen to her.

1213
00:58:34,379 --> 00:58:36,103
She just said she moved on.

1214
00:58:36,103 --> 00:58:37,551
Okay and maybe she hasn't.

1215
00:58:37,620 --> 00:58:40,448
Okay, look ladies, please.

1216
00:58:41,344 --> 00:58:42,241
Shayla,

1217
00:58:44,965 --> 00:58:48,275
you must end your
current relationship

1218
00:58:48,275 --> 00:58:50,103
before moving forward
with a new one.

1219
00:58:51,137 --> 00:58:52,241
Do you understand that?

1220
00:58:55,172 --> 00:58:57,517
Yes, doc. I understand.

1221
00:58:59,275 --> 00:59:00,275
Okay. I'm sorry.

1222
00:59:00,275 --> 00:59:02,206
I don't understand it.

1223
00:59:02,241 --> 00:59:04,620
Why would you go after a man
that clearly has moved on too.

1224
00:59:04,689 --> 00:59:07,448
But you know what?
That's just my opinion.

1225
00:59:07,517 --> 00:59:10,344
Good luck with your
broken ass relationship.

1226
00:59:20,068 --> 00:59:21,344
There you go, huh?

1227
00:59:26,206 --> 00:59:28,517
Now back to what
you were saying.

1228
00:59:28,551 --> 00:59:30,586
I was saying this
whole thing with Rocki

1229
00:59:30,620 --> 00:59:34,931
is just getting outta hand, man.

1230
00:59:36,586 --> 00:59:39,689
I, it's like I don't even
know if, if what she wants,

1231
00:59:39,724 --> 00:59:42,448
if I'm willing to do it
or if I'm even capable

1232
00:59:42,517 --> 00:59:44,689
of giving it to her right now.

1233
00:59:44,724 --> 00:59:46,517
Look, you should have never
stayed over at her crib.

1234
00:59:46,551 --> 00:59:48,310
I told you that
was the wrong move.

1235
00:59:49,379 --> 00:59:51,206
I know, man.

1236
00:59:51,241 --> 00:59:53,275
But she said she got a five
bedroom, five bedrooms.

1237
00:59:53,344 --> 00:59:55,517
I get my own personal
space. No pressure.

1238
00:59:55,517 --> 00:59:57,310
I mean, it sounded
like a good idea.

1239
00:59:59,172 --> 01:00:00,586
I guess I didn't think it
all the way through though.

1240
01:00:02,517 --> 01:00:04,310
Which bedroom was
you sleeping in?

1241
01:00:06,206 --> 01:00:10,275
And let me ask you this, are
you still in love with Shayla?

1242
01:00:10,344 --> 01:00:11,137
Come on. Of course I am.

1243
01:00:12,206 --> 01:00:13,034
Of course.

1244
01:00:14,172 --> 01:00:15,206
I'm crazy about her, man.

1245
01:00:16,689 --> 01:00:18,241
I ain't trying to
lose my marriage.

1246
01:00:18,275 --> 01:00:20,551
That's why I gotta get
outta Rocki house ASAP.

1247
01:00:22,172 --> 01:00:23,586
Well, I ain't
got five bedrooms,

1248
01:00:23,620 --> 01:00:25,379
but, I got a couch
you can sleep on.

1249
01:00:25,413 --> 01:00:28,000
It's better than the one
you got in the office.

1250
01:00:28,034 --> 01:00:29,034
You can come anytime.

1251
01:00:30,689 --> 01:00:33,068
Know what bro? I just might
take you up on that offer.

1252
01:00:34,103 --> 01:00:35,689
Hey.

1253
01:00:35,724 --> 01:00:38,172
I got this one. I
already know what she like.

1254
01:00:40,034 --> 01:00:42,000
- Hey stranger.
- Hey you.

1255
01:00:44,517 --> 01:00:46,068
Wow. You look good.

1256
01:00:46,103 --> 01:00:47,275
Well thank ya.

1257
01:00:47,344 --> 01:00:49,103
You do too.
Thank you.

1258
01:00:49,172 --> 01:00:50,000
Hmm.

1259
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:50,931
Oh! For me?

1260
01:00:52,482 --> 01:00:53,551
The usual, ma'am.

1261
01:00:56,241 --> 01:01:01,275
Okay.

1262
01:01:02,206 --> 01:01:03,620
Oo!

1263
01:01:03,655 --> 01:01:06,620
Okay, now Marcus, your
friend keep giving me

1264
01:01:06,655 --> 01:01:08,241
top-notch service like this

1265
01:01:08,275 --> 01:01:10,310
he might end up
with me on his arm.

1266
01:01:10,344 --> 01:01:13,137
Well, why you think I'm
trying to be so damn impressive?

1267
01:01:13,172 --> 01:01:14,137
Hmm?
Is that all

1268
01:01:14,172 --> 01:01:16,068
you trying to do?

1269
01:01:16,068 --> 01:01:18,000
Nah. I'm trying to put
a ring on that finger too.

1270
01:01:18,724 --> 01:01:20,379
Don't play with me.

1271
01:01:21,793 --> 01:01:23,413
That
is something else.

1272
01:01:23,448 --> 01:01:26,758
Look, Marcus, um, I'm
concerned about Shayla.

1273
01:01:26,793 --> 01:01:28,724
Now look, I know that she's
still in love with you,

1274
01:01:28,758 --> 01:01:30,586
but she keeps denying it.

1275
01:01:30,620 --> 01:01:32,551
That's the thing I'm
still in love with her too.

1276
01:01:32,586 --> 01:01:33,551
I, I, I'm sure-

1277
01:01:33,586 --> 01:01:35,413
Uh, hey Marcus.

1278
01:01:35,413 --> 01:01:37,206
So why you up in
this bitch's face?

1279
01:01:38,586 --> 01:01:40,137
What she just say?
What did you just say?

1280
01:01:40,172 --> 01:01:41,275
No, no, no, no. Hell no.

1281
01:01:41,310 --> 01:01:43,413
Tamika, I got it. I got it.

1282
01:01:43,448 --> 01:01:45,275
Hey, what the hell
are you doing here?

1283
01:01:45,310 --> 01:01:46,482
Do I need a reason?

1284
01:01:46,517 --> 01:01:48,068
I asked you a question.

1285
01:01:48,103 --> 01:01:49,137
Why are you in
this bitch's face?

1286
01:01:49,172 --> 01:01:50,586
Nuh uh, girl.

1287
01:01:50,586 --> 01:01:52,551
Who the hell are
you calling a bitch?

1288
01:01:52,551 --> 01:01:54,172
If the shoe fits.

1289
01:01:54,241 --> 01:01:56,068
Girl.

1290
01:01:56,068 --> 01:01:57,310
I got it.

1291
01:01:57,379 --> 01:01:58,206
Let's go.

1292
01:01:59,241 --> 01:02:00,103
Let's go!

1293
01:02:01,655 --> 01:02:03,206
What the hell is wrong with you?

1294
01:02:08,620 --> 01:02:13,620
Bartender!

1295
01:02:16,068 --> 01:02:17,482
What the hell
is wrong with you?

1296
01:02:17,482 --> 01:02:19,344
Hmm? You know who you are?

1297
01:02:19,379 --> 01:02:21,482
I'm gonna tell you, you're
in my place of business.

1298
01:02:21,482 --> 01:02:23,827
Now, I don't know why
you tripping, and I
really don't care.

1299
01:02:23,862 --> 01:02:25,724
But I'm gonna tell
you something else.

1300
01:02:25,758 --> 01:02:28,137
That shit ain't gonna gonna
happen here or anywhere else.

1301
01:02:29,137 --> 01:02:30,551
I know who that was.

1302
01:02:30,586 --> 01:02:33,137
That was Shayla's
best friend, right?

1303
01:02:33,137 --> 01:02:35,655
She here trying to get
y'all back together?

1304
01:02:35,689 --> 01:02:38,034
Wait, how you, how do
you know who that is?

1305
01:02:39,551 --> 01:02:41,034
Do you still love Shayla?

1306
01:02:42,758 --> 01:02:44,034
Is that why you don't wanna
take things further with me?

1307
01:02:45,620 --> 01:02:46,448
You tripping?

1308
01:02:47,517 --> 01:02:49,034
You're really tripping.

1309
01:02:53,241 --> 01:02:54,620
Baby. I'm sorry.

1310
01:03:30,517 --> 01:03:32,413
Damn, Mika left?

1311
01:03:32,448 --> 01:03:34,379
Yeah, she gone.

1312
01:03:34,413 --> 01:03:35,551
Yo, I, I gotta get outta here.

1313
01:03:35,551 --> 01:03:37,689
You, you gonna lock up for me?

1314
01:03:37,689 --> 01:03:38,689
I got you.

1315
01:03:55,344 --> 01:03:56,206
Marcus!

1316
01:04:06,827 --> 01:04:08,241
Right back at her.

1317
01:04:09,620 --> 01:04:11,103
Girl and I'm meaning
that she crazy.

1318
01:04:12,620 --> 01:04:13,827
Now is...

1319
01:04:13,862 --> 01:04:15,586
Oh hell no. Marcus.

1320
01:04:15,620 --> 01:04:16,758
- Listen to me.
- Get out.

1321
01:04:16,758 --> 01:04:17,862
Please listen. Please listen.

1322
01:04:17,931 --> 01:04:19,517
Okay. I made a mistake, okay?

1323
01:04:19,551 --> 01:04:20,689
I cannot do this without you.

1324
01:04:20,758 --> 01:04:22,310
I, I need you.

1325
01:04:22,344 --> 01:04:24,275
Tamika told me what
happened tonight.

1326
01:04:24,965 --> 01:04:25,827
Really?

1327
01:04:27,655 --> 01:04:29,551
Do you know what?

1328
01:04:29,620 --> 01:04:30,586
It, it doesn't even matter
because I moved on too.

1329
01:04:32,241 --> 01:04:33,689
Yeah.

1330
01:04:33,758 --> 01:04:35,137
Marcus, I'm, I'm done.

1331
01:04:36,310 --> 01:04:36,965
It's over.

1332
01:04:38,310 --> 01:04:39,448
- No, it's not.
- Please leave.

1333
01:04:39,448 --> 01:04:42,275
Uh, Marcus, you need to leave.

1334
01:04:44,965 --> 01:04:45,827
Shay.

1335
01:04:50,344 --> 01:04:51,551
Girl.

1336
01:04:51,620 --> 01:04:52,758
- Thank you.
- Of course.

1337
01:04:54,551 --> 01:04:56,413
No one should have
to go through that.

1338
01:05:14,827 --> 01:05:15,931
Hey, it's me.

1339
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:17,655
Can you meet me outside?

1340
01:05:17,655 --> 01:05:18,482
I'm on my way.

1341
01:05:31,862 --> 01:05:33,482
What's the word, big head.

1342
01:05:33,482 --> 01:05:34,344
- Hi.
- Hi.

1343
01:05:35,275 --> 01:05:36,724
You okay?

1344
01:05:36,758 --> 01:05:37,586
Yeah. I just came to
see my little brother.

1345
01:05:37,655 --> 01:05:38,586
Okay. Okay.

1346
01:05:40,344 --> 01:05:42,000
What's really going on?

1347
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:43,586
I'm just going
through some stuff.

1348
01:05:43,655 --> 01:05:45,344
Yeah.

1349
01:05:45,344 --> 01:05:46,724
Why can't men ever do right?

1350
01:05:48,344 --> 01:05:50,034
This is
about some dude?

1351
01:05:50,068 --> 01:05:53,344
Yeah, it's about some dude
that I actually care about.

1352
01:05:53,379 --> 01:05:54,793
Oh. Sis don't worry about it.

1353
01:05:54,862 --> 01:05:56,758
You're gonna meet
the right one. Okay?

1354
01:05:56,827 --> 01:05:58,931
Oh, he is the
right one, Jamar.

1355
01:05:59,000 --> 01:06:00,275
What don't you understand?

1356
01:06:00,344 --> 01:06:01,482
He's the right one right now.

1357
01:06:01,517 --> 01:06:02,965
Okay! Look, whatever you say.

1358
01:06:05,413 --> 01:06:08,413
Anyway,
how's things going

1359
01:06:08,448 --> 01:06:10,827
with you and Shayla
from the gym?

1360
01:06:10,896 --> 01:06:11,827
It's alright.

1361
01:06:11,896 --> 01:06:14,827
You know, she cool.

1362
01:06:14,862 --> 01:06:17,862
We, you know, we
been vibing.

1363
01:06:17,931 --> 01:06:19,931
The fuck does that
even mean, y'all vibing?

1364
01:06:19,965 --> 01:06:24,517
Yeah. Like I said, we been
vibing, you know, chilling.

1365
01:06:24,586 --> 01:06:26,517
Wait, so how do
you know her again?

1366
01:06:26,586 --> 01:06:28,620
Through one of my clients.

1367
01:06:28,655 --> 01:06:30,965
I saw her picture and I
thought she was somebody

1368
01:06:31,000 --> 01:06:32,931
you might be interested in.

1369
01:06:32,931 --> 01:06:33,896
You know, I'm gonna look
out for my little bro bro.

1370
01:06:33,896 --> 01:06:36,068
And I appreciate that.

1371
01:06:36,103 --> 01:06:38,862
But look, Raquel, you
need to chill out.

1372
01:06:38,931 --> 01:06:41,482
That last relationship
really put you over the top.

1373
01:06:42,758 --> 01:06:44,620
Look, I'm good.

1374
01:06:44,655 --> 01:06:47,551
Okay? You just focus on you
and making Shayla happy.

1375
01:06:49,068 --> 01:06:50,931
Look, I gotta go.

1376
01:06:50,931 --> 01:06:52,586
I got a early day tomorrow,
so thanks for the chat.

1377
01:06:52,620 --> 01:06:53,965
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Whatever.

1378
01:06:54,000 --> 01:06:54,965
Look, you just make
sure you text me

1379
01:06:55,000 --> 01:06:56,413
when you get home, okay?

1380
01:06:56,413 --> 01:06:57,551
- Uh huh.
- Alright.

1381
01:07:07,517 --> 01:07:10,000
Please leave
your message after the tone.

1382
01:07:10,034 --> 01:07:11,896
Marcus, where are you?

1383
01:07:11,931 --> 01:07:14,000
I saw you took some of
your things from my house.

1384
01:07:15,137 --> 01:07:16,896
I'm sorry, sweetie.

1385
01:07:16,931 --> 01:07:18,896
I, look, I just wanna
talk to you, okay?

1386
01:07:18,965 --> 01:07:20,689
And make sure that you're good.

1387
01:07:20,724 --> 01:07:21,689
That we're good.

1388
01:07:22,793 --> 01:07:24,655
Look okay, enough is enough.

1389
01:07:24,689 --> 01:07:27,000
Just can you call me and
tell me where you are?

1390
01:07:28,965 --> 01:07:30,517
Please Marcus, I love you

1391
01:07:30,551 --> 01:07:32,000
and I promise it won't
ever happen again.

1392
01:07:33,517 --> 01:07:34,965
Your
message after the tone.

1393
01:07:34,965 --> 01:07:36,689
Where the fuck
are you, Marcus?

1394
01:07:38,000 --> 01:07:39,137
Okay, you think
you're gonna get away

1395
01:07:39,137 --> 01:07:40,862
with treating me like this?

1396
01:07:40,896 --> 01:07:43,000
Well, I promise you're not.

1397
01:07:43,034 --> 01:07:44,655
I don't think you understand

1398
01:07:44,655 --> 01:07:47,482
really what you're doing
to me at this point.

1399
01:07:47,482 --> 01:07:52,000
Okay? I, I love you and
I need to be with you.

1400
01:07:55,172 --> 01:07:58,793
I've never loved anybody as
much as I love you, Marcus.

1401
01:08:02,689 --> 01:08:03,965
Please call me.

1402
01:09:14,000 --> 01:09:16,793

was gonna be parents.

Marcus, who would
send a gift like this?

1410
01:11:52,862 --> 01:11:55,000
There's no name on the box.

I did. I didn't want

For all the shit
I put you through.

1438
01:13:17,482 --> 01:13:19,206
I should have been
more attentive to you

1439
01:13:19,241 --> 01:13:22,172
during the pregnancy
instead of at that damn bar.

1440
01:13:24,206 --> 01:13:25,034
It's okay.

1441
01:13:26,241 --> 01:13:27,310
I'm sorry too.

1442
01:13:28,482 --> 01:13:30,310

No, not, I'm not
laughing at you.

1446
01:13:43,310 --> 01:13:45,793
I mean it's just the
perfect way to describe us,

a shit show.

1448
01:13:49,896 --> 01:13:51,965
I mean, but hey,
we still married.

1449
01:13:55,344 --> 01:13:56,827
I want to keep it that way.

Like, what's going on with you?

1466
01:14:54,793 --> 01:14:56,068
Marcus is cheating on me.

1467
01:14:56,965 --> 01:14:59,241
Who is Marcus?

1468
01:14:59,275 --> 01:15:01,172
You talking about the guy that
you had running up outta here

1469
01:15:01,206 --> 01:15:02,551
the other day?

1470
01:15:02,620 --> 01:15:04,000
His bitch ass is
playing me the same way

1471
01:15:04,034 --> 01:15:05,000
that he played her.

1472
01:15:07,379 --> 01:15:08,931
I need you to step it
up and distract her

1473
01:15:08,931 --> 01:15:10,310
so he'll come back to me, okay?

1474
01:15:10,344 --> 01:15:12,137
Hey, wait, what are
you talking about?

1475
01:15:12,172 --> 01:15:13,344
And why would you
even want a guy

1476
01:15:13,379 --> 01:15:14,482
that you know is
cheating on you?

1477
01:15:14,517 --> 01:15:16,379
Like that makes no sense.

1478
01:15:16,448 --> 01:15:18,379
Oh, don't fucking tell me
what makes sense, Jamar!

1479
01:15:18,448 --> 01:15:20,000
I love him. That's why.

1480
01:15:21,448 --> 01:15:22,379
And he was falling
in love with me too

1481
01:15:22,448 --> 01:15:24,586
until that baby drama.

1482
01:15:26,275 --> 01:15:28,103
Now all he can think
about is Shayla.

1483
01:15:29,551 --> 01:15:31,793
What does Shayla have
to do with any of this?

1484
01:15:32,862 --> 01:15:34,482
Oh my God, she's Marcus' ex.

1485
01:15:34,517 --> 01:15:36,379
Damn, are you stupid?

1486
01:15:36,448 --> 01:15:38,379
You were a distraction
so I could get to Marcus.

1487
01:15:38,448 --> 01:15:39,827
That's the only reason why
I wanted you to get with her

1488
01:15:39,862 --> 01:15:40,965
in the first place.

1489
01:15:44,448 --> 01:15:48,413
Damn, Raquel, you
are one sick bitch.

1490
01:15:51,965 --> 01:15:53,344
He's calling.

1491
01:15:59,931 --> 01:16:01,620
Hey you.

1492
01:16:01,689 --> 01:16:03,034
I've been calling you.
I've been really worried.

1493
01:16:03,068 --> 01:16:04,448
I'm coming through

1494
01:16:04,517 --> 01:16:05,655
to pick up the
rest of my things.

1495
01:16:05,655 --> 01:16:07,310
Wait. What?

1496
01:16:07,310 --> 01:16:08,172
Why?

1497
01:16:10,103 --> 01:16:12,206
I'm gonna keep
it above with you, Rocki.

1498
01:16:12,241 --> 01:16:16,172
I'm moving back home
to be with my wife.

1499
01:16:16,206 --> 01:16:17,344
No, no.

1500
01:16:17,344 --> 01:16:18,517
Marcus, you can't do that.

1501
01:16:18,517 --> 01:16:19,517
Okay? You're making a mistake.

1502
01:16:19,551 --> 01:16:21,206
I'm sorry.

1503
01:16:21,241 --> 01:16:22,482
I know this ain't what
you're trying to hear,

1504
01:16:22,517 --> 01:16:24,172
but I love my wife.

1505
01:16:26,517 --> 01:16:28,896
Look, you don't
want her, okay?

1506
01:16:30,034 --> 01:16:31,517
I wasn't gonna say anything,

1507
01:16:31,517 --> 01:16:32,655
but she's having sex
with somebody else.

1508
01:16:32,689 --> 01:16:34,551
Hell no.

1509
01:16:34,586 --> 01:16:36,000
I'm not concerned
with anything she's done

1510
01:16:36,034 --> 01:16:37,413
while I wasn't here.
No.

1511
01:16:37,448 --> 01:16:39,172
No, you can't do
this to me, Marcus.

1512
01:16:39,206 --> 01:16:41,103
Okay, I won't let you.

1513
01:16:41,172 --> 01:16:42,241
I'm sorry.

1514
01:16:42,275 --> 01:16:44,068
Rocki, please just understand.

1515
01:16:50,551 --> 01:16:52,586
This is
all your fault!

1516
01:16:52,620 --> 01:16:53,896
You were supposed to
keep his wife away

1517
01:16:53,931 --> 01:16:55,275
and you couldn't even do that.

1518
01:16:55,344 --> 01:16:56,482
You need to chill out.

1519
01:16:58,034 --> 01:16:58,896
Okay.

1520
01:17:02,793 --> 01:17:04,551
I'm gonna handle
this shit myself.

1521
01:17:04,551 --> 01:17:06,068
Look, Raquel!

1522
01:17:06,068 --> 01:17:06,724
- Move.
- Come on, Raquel.

1523
01:17:06,724 --> 01:17:08,344
Move, Jamar.

1524
01:17:08,413 --> 01:17:09,448
- No, stop.
- Move.

1525
01:17:09,482 --> 01:17:10,586
Stop.

1526
01:17:10,620 --> 01:17:15,620
Move, move.

1527
01:17:42,068 --> 01:17:43,551
Where's Marcus?

1528
01:17:45,241 --> 01:17:49,344
Oh.

1529
01:17:49,413 --> 01:17:51,275
Who, who are you?

1530
01:17:51,310 --> 01:17:53,586
You know exactly who
I am. Don't play stupid.

1531
01:17:58,103 --> 01:18:01,137
You, you, you're the girl
that's slept with Marcus.

1532
01:18:03,241 --> 01:18:04,103
Let's go.

1533
01:18:05,344 --> 01:18:06,448
Turn around. Let's go.

1534
01:18:13,551 --> 01:18:15,517
Why are you doing this?

1535
01:18:15,551 --> 01:18:17,482
You need to listen to me.

1536
01:18:17,482 --> 01:18:21,068
Stop interfering in me
and Marcus' relationship.

1537
01:18:21,137 --> 01:18:22,689
You put him through
some serious changes

1538
01:18:22,724 --> 01:18:25,310
and he absolutely
deserves better than that.

1539
01:18:25,344 --> 01:18:27,758
And then you claim
you love him so much,

1540
01:18:27,827 --> 01:18:29,724
yet you're having
sex with another man.

1541
01:18:29,793 --> 01:18:31,310
Like, make it make sense.

1542
01:18:32,482 --> 01:18:34,344
He deserves to be with me,

1543
01:18:34,379 --> 01:18:36,793
a woman who can actually
help build his empire.

1544
01:18:36,827 --> 01:18:39,448
Not a depressed ass housewife.

1545
01:18:41,517 --> 01:18:44,034
You need to go.
No, please, please.

1546
01:18:44,068 --> 01:18:46,137
You don't wanna do this.

1547
01:18:46,137 --> 01:18:48,482
Don't tell me what
the fuck I wanna do.

1548
01:18:48,482 --> 01:18:50,068
Damn, I wish your whiny ass

1549
01:18:50,137 --> 01:18:51,448
would've died with your
baby a few months ago.

1550
01:18:54,551 --> 01:18:56,482
What did you just say?

1551
01:18:56,482 --> 01:18:59,310
Yeah, I'm the one
who hit you with my car

1552
01:18:59,344 --> 01:19:00,620
when you were out jogging.

1553
01:19:02,206 --> 01:19:03,896
Did you get my gift?

1554
01:19:03,896 --> 01:19:06,172
I had a lot of fun picking
out the baby clothes.

1555
01:19:07,896 --> 01:19:10,241
What the hell
is wrong with you?

1556
01:19:10,275 --> 01:19:12,206
What kind of monster are you?

1557
01:19:12,206 --> 01:19:14,551
Me? What about you?

1558
01:19:14,586 --> 01:19:16,206
You don't one that
left Marcus out to dry

1559
01:19:16,241 --> 01:19:17,862
when he needed you the most.

1560
01:19:17,896 --> 01:19:20,103
I was there for him
when you weren't.

1561
01:19:20,137 --> 01:19:22,103
And who's he with now?

1562
01:19:22,137 --> 01:19:22,793
Hmm?

1563
01:19:34,310 --> 01:19:35,241
What the
hell is going on?

1564
01:19:35,275 --> 01:19:37,275
Hey, yo, my man.

1565
01:19:37,310 --> 01:19:38,724
You all right?

1566
01:19:38,758 --> 01:19:39,862
You good?

1567
01:19:39,896 --> 01:19:41,137
We gotta stop her.

1568
01:19:41,206 --> 01:19:42,275
Stop who?

1569
01:19:42,310 --> 01:19:44,448
Raquel man, she my sister.

1570
01:19:44,482 --> 01:19:45,620
Look, you must be Marcus, man.

1571
01:19:45,689 --> 01:19:46,758
She going after Shayla.

1572
01:19:46,793 --> 01:19:48,551
What, you mean Rocki?

1573
01:19:48,586 --> 01:19:50,517
Yes. And she got a gun.

1574
01:19:50,551 --> 01:19:51,862
Come on, man.

1575
01:20:10,689 --> 01:20:11,586
Hey Shayla.

1576
01:20:12,517 --> 01:20:13,862
Hey. Hold on, hold up.

1577
01:20:13,896 --> 01:20:15,620
Just stay right here.
Wait right here.

1578
01:20:23,620 --> 01:20:24,517
Hey, baby.

1579
01:20:26,482 --> 01:20:28,103
Look who it is, Shayla.

1580
01:20:28,137 --> 01:20:29,551
Hey baby.

1581
01:20:29,551 --> 01:20:30,517
Why don't you go sit
down next to your wife?

1582
01:20:30,517 --> 01:20:31,517
Rocki, you gotta-

1583
01:20:31,551 --> 01:20:33,034
Just sit down, Marcus.

1584
01:20:40,379 --> 01:20:42,206
You know, all of you
men are the same.

1585
01:20:42,241 --> 01:20:45,689
You never appreciate a good
woman, just like my ex.

1586
01:20:47,793 --> 01:20:49,310
All I wanted to do was love you

1587
01:20:49,379 --> 01:20:51,482
and help you build an empire.

1588
01:20:51,551 --> 01:20:53,379
But you can't even see that.

1589
01:20:53,379 --> 01:20:55,275
No, Raquel,

1590
01:20:55,310 --> 01:20:57,206
he appreciates everything
that you've done for him.

1591
01:20:57,241 --> 01:20:58,689
He's told me.

1592
01:20:58,689 --> 01:21:00,551
No, he doesn't.

1593
01:21:00,551 --> 01:21:02,172
He doesn't appreciate anything
that I've done for him.

1594
01:21:02,206 --> 01:21:03,862
He does. I swear.

1595
01:21:05,482 --> 01:21:06,827
He, he told me that
it's because of you

1596
01:21:06,862 --> 01:21:09,344
that Flirt is doing so well.

1597
01:21:09,379 --> 01:21:11,172
It's all because of you.

1598
01:21:11,206 --> 01:21:13,482
It is. It really,
it really is, Rocki.

1599
01:21:16,827 --> 01:21:18,413
Then why don't you want me?

1600
01:21:20,275 --> 01:21:22,241
Because he's married.

1601
01:21:23,793 --> 01:21:25,482
He deserves me, not you.

1602
01:21:25,517 --> 01:21:27,551
Hey, Rocki, look, stop.

1603
01:21:27,620 --> 01:21:29,206
This has nothing
to do with Shayla.

1604
01:21:29,275 --> 01:21:29,931
This is between me and you.

1605
01:21:29,931 --> 01:21:31,344
Just let her go.

1606
01:21:31,413 --> 01:21:32,241
Let her go.

1607
01:21:34,931 --> 01:21:35,793
No.

1608
01:21:38,620 --> 01:21:41,931
Jamar?

1609
01:21:47,862 --> 01:21:48,793
You psycho!

1610
01:21:50,379 --> 01:21:51,586
You hit me and you
killed my baby.

1611
01:21:52,517 --> 01:21:53,620
Wait What?

1612
01:21:53,655 --> 01:21:54,482
Wait, you killed our baby.

1613
01:21:56,965 --> 01:21:59,241
It was the perfect
opportunity when I saw her.

1614
01:22:00,517 --> 01:22:02,862
She doesn't deserve you, Marcus.

1615
01:22:02,862 --> 01:22:05,310
She's depressed. She
doesn't have a job.

1616
01:22:06,379 --> 01:22:07,689
Babe, you deserve a go-getter.

1617
01:22:09,689 --> 01:22:13,448
You need to be with me.

1618
01:22:13,517 --> 01:22:15,379
She kicked you out.
Don't you remember?

1619
01:22:15,413 --> 01:22:17,275
No, don't, don't do it baby.

1620
01:22:17,344 --> 01:22:19,517
Don't do it. She's not worth it.

1621
01:22:19,551 --> 01:22:22,310
She's already going to
jail for shooting Jamar.

1622
01:22:22,344 --> 01:22:23,206
Please.

1623
01:22:27,344 --> 01:22:29,413
I knew your ass was soft.

1624
01:22:29,448 --> 01:22:31,241
A real woman woulda
let him kill me.

1625
01:22:36,344 --> 01:22:38,241
Jamar, Jamar.

1626
01:22:38,275 --> 01:22:42,517
You okay?

1627
01:22:42,551 --> 01:22:44,413
911,
what is your emergency?

1628
01:22:44,448 --> 01:22:45,551
Yes, ya'll
need to send someone

1629
01:22:45,586 --> 01:22:48,034
to 219 South Butterfield Street.

1630
01:22:48,068 --> 01:22:50,793
- Someone's hurt?
- Yeah, someone has been shot.

1631
01:22:50,862 --> 01:22:51,896
We're getting
help started that way, okay?

1632
01:22:51,931 --> 01:22:53,586
Alright, thank you.

1633
01:22:53,655 --> 01:22:54,758
Just, hold on, hold on.

1634
01:23:21,724 --> 01:23:23,655
Hey, you know I'm actually,

1635
01:23:23,689 --> 01:23:26,310
I'm glad we went to
go see Dr. Brown.

1636
01:23:26,344 --> 01:23:28,103
She's cool.

1637
01:23:28,103 --> 01:23:30,448
Made me wish she would've went
to a couple's therapy sooner.

1638
01:23:30,482 --> 01:23:32,344
Yeah.

1639
01:23:32,413 --> 01:23:34,551
We really should have went
after losing the baby.

1640
01:23:34,551 --> 01:23:35,931
Yeah.

1641
01:23:35,965 --> 01:23:37,896
But the important
thing is we're going now

1642
01:23:37,896 --> 01:23:40,413
and our marriage is
stronger than ever.

1643
01:23:40,448 --> 01:23:41,827
It is.

1644
01:23:41,896 --> 01:23:43,965
I told you I was
gonna fight for us.

1645
01:23:44,000 --> 01:23:45,965
You believe me now, baby?

1646
01:23:46,000 --> 01:23:47,793
Yes, Marcus.

1647
01:23:47,827 --> 01:23:48,724
I believe you.

1648
01:23:54,517 --> 01:23:56,068
I'm gonna go get
something to drink.

1649
01:23:56,103 --> 01:23:57,793
No, no. You chill out.

1650
01:23:57,827 --> 01:23:59,931
For as much I put you through,

1651
01:23:59,965 --> 01:24:04,793
I will wait on
you hand and feet.

1652
01:24:04,793 --> 01:24:07,482
Boy, stop playing fool.

1653
01:24:07,482 --> 01:24:08,793
I'm a fool for you.

1654
01:24:10,551 --> 01:24:12,103
I'm gonna go get you
something to drink though.

1655
01:24:14,896 --> 01:24:16,413
Okay.

1656
01:24:16,482 --> 01:24:18,137
It's my turn to pick the movie.

1657
01:24:18,137 --> 01:24:19,896
Hey, don't pick
no corny ass movie.

1658
01:24:24,068 --> 01:24:27,034
Uh Marcus, your
phone is ringing.

1659
01:24:27,068 --> 01:24:28,827
Answer
it for me please.

1660
01:24:28,862 --> 01:24:31,137
It's probably Swiss.

1661
01:24:31,137 --> 01:24:34,413
Are you sure you want
me to answer your phone?

1662
01:24:34,482 --> 01:24:36,689
No more secrets, remember.

1663
01:24:41,896 --> 01:24:43,000
Hello.

1664
01:24:43,034 --> 01:24:44,862
This is a prepaid call

1665
01:24:44,896 --> 01:24:46,758
from an inmate at the County
Correctional Facility.

1666
01:24:46,827 --> 01:24:48,862

Hello?

1670
01:24:56,034 --> 01:24:57,758
Who is this?

1671
01:24:57,827 --> 01:24:59,379
Put
Marcus on the phone.

1672
01:25:00,482 --> 01:25:02,517
Raquel, what do you want?

1673
01:25:03,896 --> 01:25:05,965
I wanna
share the good news.

1674
01:25:06,034 --> 01:25:07,896
What good news?

1675
01:25:07,896 --> 01:25:10,724
Well, I wanted him to
be the first to know,

1676
01:25:10,724 --> 01:25:13,862
but since you asked,
I beat you to it.

1677
01:25:14,896 --> 01:25:19,689
I'm having his baby.

1678
01:25:20,620 --> 01:25:21,448

00:00:47,380 --> 00:00:53,353
INSPIRED BY THE LIFE AND
WORKS OF NELLY ARCAN

2
00:01:34,694 --> 00:01:38,972
<i>Once upon a time there was a tavern</i>

3
00:01:39,933 --> 00:01:43,710
<i>Where we used to raise a glass or two</i>

4
00:01:45,205 --> 00:01:49,950
<i>Remember how we laughed away the hours</i>

5
00:01:50,577 --> 00:01:54,491
<i>And dreamed of all
the great things we would do</i>

6
00:01:56,950 --> 00:02:01,490
<i>Those were the days, my friend</i>

7
00:02:01,621 --> 00:02:04,295
<i>We though! They'd never end</i>

8
00:02:04,424 --> 00:02:09,271
<i>We'd sing and dance, forever and a day</i>

9
00:02:09,896 --> 00:02:12,399
<i>We'd live the life we choose</i>

10
00:02:12,499 --> 00:02:15,241
<i>We'd fight and never lose</i>

11
00:02:15,335 --> 00:02:20,751
<i>For we were young and sure to have our way</i>

12
00:03:03,316 --> 00:03:05,057
Come in.
Hi.

13
00:03:08,154 --> 00:03:10,395
Pierre, right?
Yeah.

14
00:03:10,957 --> 00:03:14,131
I'm Cynthia. I'm happy to meet you.

15
00:03:14,227 --> 00:03:15,467
Me, too.

16
00:03:26,172 --> 00:03:27,480
Have a seat.

17
00:03:37,984 --> 00:03:39,895
This is my first time.

18
00:03:44,691 --> 00:03:46,500
Do you think I'm attractive?

19
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:48,060
Yes.

20
00:03:49,162 --> 00:03:51,733
Do you want me?
Yes.

21
00:03:53,166 --> 00:03:54,736
I want you too.

22
00:03:56,703 --> 00:04:01,083
Some johns only want to talk,
and that's perfect too.

23
00:04:04,777 --> 00:04:06,120
But you...

24
00:04:12,552 --> 00:04:14,862
I'm glad you want to fuck me.

25
00:04:18,858 --> 00:04:20,394
You turn me on.

26
00:04:23,596 --> 00:04:26,236
I don't know why, but you turn me on.

27
00:04:27,367 --> 00:04:28,539
You too.

28
00:04:32,972 --> 00:04:34,315
Will you suck me?

29
00:04:39,045 --> 00:04:41,047
It'll be my pleasure.

30
00:06:02,995 --> 00:06:06,204
<i>Yes, life has pierced me through.</i>

31
00:06:13,673 --> 00:06:18,816
<i>I didn't dream up those men,
the thousands in my bed, in my mouth.</i>

32
00:06:19,379 --> 00:06:24,658
<i>I invented nothing of their sperm
on me, in my face, in my eyes.</i>

33
00:06:25,752 --> 00:06:27,163
<i>I saw it all,</i>

34
00:06:27,653 --> 00:06:29,530
<i>and it still goes on,</i>

35
00:06:30,022 --> 00:06:31,865
<i>every day, or almost.</i>

36
00:08:38,784 --> 00:08:40,855
<i>You owned everything already.</i>

37
00:10:36,302 --> 00:10:39,943
<i>We were helpless against
the outcome of our encounter.</i>

38
00:11:02,762 --> 00:11:04,139
<i>With you</i>

39
00:11:04,764 --> 00:11:09,543
<i>I experienced the moments of languor
known to those who feel death approaching.</i>

40
00:12:51,036 --> 00:12:52,640
I'm sorry, Suzanne.

41
00:12:53,305 --> 00:12:54,545
I look horrible.

42
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:57,052
No, you're sublime, as always.

43
00:12:57,743 --> 00:12:59,814
Thanks.
Come, we're late.

44
00:13:01,447 --> 00:13:03,552
Are you OK? Ready for this?

45
00:13:04,049 --> 00:13:05,460
Always.

46
00:13:32,111 --> 00:13:33,920
I'm sorry for being late.

47
00:13:34,246 --> 00:13:36,852
I'm systematically late, without fail.

48
00:13:37,917 --> 00:13:39,419
It's like champagne...

49
00:13:39,518 --> 00:13:42,931
<i>Beauty is a weapon that subjugates.</i>

50
00:13:46,425 --> 00:13:51,499
<i>Beauty is an order that commands
immobility and contemplation by all.</i>

51
00:13:52,865 --> 00:13:57,939
<i>One must compel others to stop living,
for the time they look,</i>

52
00:13:58,804 --> 00:14:01,307
<i>force them to become an audience,</i>

53
00:14:02,208 --> 00:14:06,054
<i>arrange them around you,
up in the bleachers.</i>

54
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:30,146
Here you have the Emperor.

55
00:14:30,803 --> 00:14:33,682
That, with the Chariot...

56
00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:38,147
A major professional success may await you.

57
00:14:38,911 --> 00:14:41,414
But you have to be careful, go slow.

58
00:14:41,747 --> 00:14:43,920
I won't bank on it.

59
00:14:44,049 --> 00:14:47,155
Pack your bags, Isa. We're going on a trip!

60
00:14:48,220 --> 00:14:51,565
My turn now!
Mom's sleeping, sweetie.

61
00:14:54,493 --> 00:14:56,063
Move over, big girl.

62
00:14:58,397 --> 00:15:00,172
Do you have a question?

63
00:15:10,342 --> 00:15:14,620
The reversed Female Pope, the Hermit...

64
00:15:15,214 --> 00:15:16,386
What?

65
00:15:18,117 --> 00:15:19,289
Nothing.

66
00:15:20,352 --> 00:15:22,229
Pick a different card.

67
00:15:28,627 --> 00:15:32,074
<i>Something in me was always lacking.</i>

68
00:15:51,317 --> 00:15:52,455
Yes?

69
00:15:54,253 --> 00:15:55,425
Yes, speaking.

70
00:15:57,623 --> 00:15:58,966
I was sleeping, yes.

71
00:16:00,292 --> 00:16:01,669
It's 5:30.

72
00:16:04,229 --> 00:16:05,640
No, that's alright.

73
00:16:09,635 --> 00:16:11,114
Which publisher?

74
00:16:15,007 --> 00:16:16,350
In Paris?

75
00:16:21,313 --> 00:16:23,190
Yes, that's my manuscript.

76
00:16:30,289 --> 00:16:31,529
Really?

77
00:16:35,828 --> 00:16:38,001
Yes, it's very good news.

78
00:16:53,112 --> 00:16:54,523
Mathieu?

79
00:16:54,646 --> 00:16:56,057
Yes, that's me.

80
00:16:56,615 --> 00:16:57,615
Hello.

81
00:16:57,683 --> 00:17:00,289
I'm very pleased to meet you.
Me too.

82
00:17:06,558 --> 00:17:08,333
It's an honor, miss.

83
00:17:08,727 --> 00:17:12,903
It's not every day we travel to Canada
to meet a new author.

84
00:17:13,866 --> 00:17:15,903
Your writing is magnificent.

85
00:17:17,503 --> 00:17:18,709
Thank you.

86
00:17:19,705 --> 00:17:24,154
Your text sent... a shock wave
through the editorial committee.

87
00:17:26,912 --> 00:17:28,186
Whiskey.

88
00:17:30,482 --> 00:17:33,486
I guess I'll have the same. Whiskey.

89
00:17:36,922 --> 00:17:38,765
Is it your first novel?

90
00:17:39,558 --> 00:17:40,730
Yes.

91
00:17:41,393 --> 00:17:43,737
Have you been working on it long?

92
00:17:44,930 --> 00:17:46,341
For a few months.

93
00:17:47,733 --> 00:17:49,178
How old are you?

94
00:17:51,336 --> 00:17:53,179
I'm 26.

95
00:17:53,505 --> 00:17:58,511
You're very young.
I mean, for that style, that...

96
00:17:59,878 --> 00:18:01,289
that density.

97
00:18:02,514 --> 00:18:03,686
Thank you.

98
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:11,367
Is it based on your life?
Is it your own story?

99
00:18:12,925 --> 00:18:14,370
Is that important?

100
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:18,102
No, it doesn't alter the book's quality.

101
00:18:18,263 --> 00:18:21,972
We read you and want to know
everything about you.

102
00:18:22,634 --> 00:18:27,947
Or to avoid you, perhaps.
But no one can remain indifferent.

103
00:18:29,775 --> 00:18:32,619
Some things are true, others not.

104
00:18:34,913 --> 00:18:36,756
Will you go on writing?

105
00:18:40,319 --> 00:18:42,731
Apart from my writing,
I'm nothing.

106
00:18:49,895 --> 00:18:51,568
Oh my god, your hair!

107
00:18:52,164 --> 00:18:53,507
It's so awesome.

108
00:18:54,766 --> 00:18:56,302
Girls' night out!

109
00:18:56,735 --> 00:18:58,612
What smells? Did you cook?

110
00:19:00,506 --> 00:19:03,248
It's gonna be awful.
No way.

111
00:19:03,342 --> 00:19:04,980
It's gonna be amazing!

112
00:19:05,144 --> 00:19:07,420
Hey, babe! Your top is way cool!

113
00:19:07,513 --> 00:19:08,583
Thanks.

114
00:19:10,482 --> 00:19:11,961
Nice shoes!
Thanks.

115
00:19:12,084 --> 00:19:14,792
Time to drink!
Wanna do some shots?

116
00:19:18,657 --> 00:19:21,797
I swear, she comes out
and says, all proud,

117
00:19:21,927 --> 00:19:24,669
""The last john tipped me $200.""

118
00:19:26,198 --> 00:19:28,439
You just fucked him bareback.

119
00:19:32,604 --> 00:19:34,550
How's it look?
Fuckin' A!

120
00:19:34,673 --> 00:19:36,516
Did you buy it with him'?
No.

121
00:19:36,642 --> 00:19:39,885
He brought a Holt's bag
and had me try it on.

122
00:19:40,012 --> 00:19:42,014
He has taste.
Seriously.

123
00:19:42,147 --> 00:19:44,184
No john ever gave me a dress.

124
00:19:44,316 --> 00:19:47,195
But you're a great whore.
For sure.

125
00:19:47,352 --> 00:19:49,559
Wanna check our reviews?
Yes!

126
00:19:50,856 --> 00:19:52,164
No, not again!

127
00:19:55,060 --> 00:19:56,300
Here we go.

128
00:19:57,896 --> 00:20:01,070
There.
I'm ready to be humiliated.

129
00:20:02,501 --> 00:20:04,412
Bad start, sweetie.

130
00:20:06,905 --> 00:20:10,216
Must be the guy this aft.
What does the pig say'?

131
00:20:16,181 --> 00:20:18,821
You're a fucking beauty!
Go on.

132
00:20:23,522 --> 00:20:24,660
Asshole!

133
00:20:30,529 --> 00:20:32,008
OK, fine, stop.

134
00:20:32,364 --> 00:20:33,536
I have my fans.

135
00:20:37,169 --> 00:20:39,115
What about the Goddess?

136
00:20:39,271 --> 00:20:41,774
Come on, who cares?
No, keep going!

137
00:20:41,907 --> 00:20:44,581
OK, the lovely Cynthia. 8:56 pm.

138
00:20:46,578 --> 00:20:49,957
Warning, you'll be addicted
to Cynthia in no time.

139
00:20:50,082 --> 00:20:51,959
Bitch! What's your secret?

140
00:20:52,251 --> 00:20:54,788
Go on!
Cynthia is a beautiful young girl.

141
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:57,366
A magnificent body, gorgeous ass,

142
00:20:57,456 --> 00:20:59,800
and breasts close to perfection.

143
00:20:59,925 --> 00:21:03,236
She has soft skin and she smells divine.

144
00:21:03,362 --> 00:21:05,865
I got a very sweet welcome.

145
00:21:06,031 --> 00:21:08,807
Her photos are accurate, no bad surprises.

146
00:21:08,934 --> 00:21:11,073
She's a natural, loves her work

147
00:21:11,203 --> 00:21:13,945
as much as you do. She gets wet, moans...

148
00:21:14,106 --> 00:21:16,382
She gave one of the best BJs ever.

149
00:21:16,475 --> 00:21:20,252
Deep throat. Sucks like
she hasn't had cock in months.

150
00:21:20,779 --> 00:21:22,656
She's ravenous, loves it.

151
00:21:22,781 --> 00:21:25,261
No DATY, I don't know why.

152
00:21:25,384 --> 00:21:27,557
She has the prettiest pussy.

153
00:21:27,653 --> 00:21:28,825
Clean, shaven.

154
00:21:28,954 --> 00:21:32,094
She said she never accepts being eaten.

155
00:21:32,224 --> 00:21:36,104
You should see her ass doing doggy.
Anal costs more.

156
00:21:36,228 --> 00:21:38,936
Cumshot, she swallowed every drop.

157
00:21:39,064 --> 00:21:41,510
Beautiful eyes you can get lost in.

158
00:21:41,633 --> 00:21:43,476
Guys, treat her well.

159
00:22:21,540 --> 00:22:23,611
I like making love with you.

160
00:22:25,644 --> 00:22:26,987
So do I.

161
00:22:30,048 --> 00:22:31,891
I'm glad I found you.

162
00:22:37,155 --> 00:22:38,327
Do you love me?

163
00:22:42,027 --> 00:22:43,199
Yes.

164
00:22:44,730 --> 00:22:45,902
You?

165
00:22:48,066 --> 00:22:49,238
Yes.

166
00:22:51,903 --> 00:22:54,179
I'm not a good girl, but I love you.

167
00:22:57,542 --> 00:22:59,988
I'm not a good boy, but I love you.

168
00:23:28,073 --> 00:23:29,518
We're in love!

169
00:23:30,108 --> 00:23:31,587
We're in love!

170
00:24:07,546 --> 00:24:08,889
<i>During this stage,</i>

171
00:24:09,581 --> 00:24:14,496
<i>we lived the exaltation of our highs
and the crash of early mornings.</i>

172
00:24:21,726 --> 00:24:26,573
<i>Your hand, bigger than god,
knew how to hit without hurting me.</i>

173
00:24:59,764 --> 00:25:01,175
No!

174
00:25:01,700 --> 00:25:05,773
Not the sun, Frankie! The sun's rising.
Come, vampire!

175
00:25:12,711 --> 00:25:13,985
What's the plan?

176
00:25:15,146 --> 00:25:16,386
Go to sleep?

177
00:25:17,649 --> 00:25:19,026
Fuck sleep.

178
00:25:20,685 --> 00:25:23,791
What time does Fred's dealer quit?
6 am.

179
00:25:24,322 --> 00:25:26,563
It's 5:47.
Let's call him!

180
00:25:28,126 --> 00:25:29,901
Take me away, my steed!

181
00:26:46,605 --> 00:26:48,209
Suzanne!

182
00:26:50,308 --> 00:26:52,811
Everything's good?
Marvelous.

183
00:26:52,944 --> 00:26:54,321
How many drinks?

184
00:26:54,879 --> 00:26:56,119
Just enough.

185
00:27:00,885 --> 00:27:02,387
Guillaume Rival's here.

186
00:27:02,487 --> 00:27:05,730
A rising star.
A genius, pure and simple.

187
00:27:05,924 --> 00:27:08,461
The genius of the century, I'd say.

188
00:27:13,565 --> 00:27:16,808
Where you going?
To meet this genius.

189
00:27:16,935 --> 00:27:18,175
Are you sure?

190
00:27:20,739 --> 00:27:23,481
The sky's the limit, little Suzie!

191
00:29:06,878 --> 00:29:09,620
<i>It all happens to someone else.</i>

192
00:29:15,253 --> 00:29:16,425
I'm there,

193
00:29:17,188 --> 00:29:18,861
just next to myself.

194
00:29:22,894 --> 00:29:24,931
I'm there watching,

195
00:29:27,298 --> 00:29:29,403
but it's not really me.

196
00:29:33,438 --> 00:29:34,883
I watch her.

197
00:29:36,875 --> 00:29:39,913
I see her talking, drinking,

198
00:29:40,779 --> 00:29:42,816
dancing, fucking,

199
00:29:43,381 --> 00:29:44,451
laughing,

200
00:29:45,750 --> 00:29:47,127
crying-

201
00:29:51,489 --> 00:29:57,462
I see this blonde woman,
lying on the couch facing her analyst.

202
00:30:00,899 --> 00:30:03,004
But I'm not that woman.

203
00:30:07,639 --> 00:30:10,176
Though I play that woman well.

204
00:30:19,017 --> 00:30:20,928
I need to be seen,

205
00:30:22,487 --> 00:30:24,467
but it's not me I reveal.

206
00:30:26,991 --> 00:30:28,937
So I disappear a bit.

207
00:30:31,930 --> 00:30:33,807
Do you understand?

208
00:30:39,370 --> 00:30:42,112
I appear to disappear.

209
00:30:47,612 --> 00:30:50,957
Felix, from math class.

210
00:30:51,049 --> 00:30:53,859
So you two are dating?
Yes.

211
00:30:53,985 --> 00:30:55,987
Since when?
Monday.

212
00:30:56,120 --> 00:30:58,726
He left me a letter in my locker.

213
00:30:58,857 --> 00:31:00,165
He did'?
He said

214
00:31:00,358 --> 00:31:02,463
I'm the prettiest girl in class.

215
00:31:03,328 --> 00:31:06,537
That's so random!
No, it isn't.

216
00:31:06,664 --> 00:31:11,977
Anyway, Tuesday after school
we went to the handball court.

217
00:31:12,537 --> 00:31:13,982
By yourselves?
Yeah.

218
00:31:14,739 --> 00:31:16,343
Did you french?

219
00:31:16,808 --> 00:31:17,843
Yes.

220
00:31:17,976 --> 00:31:21,150
That, and lots of other stuff.

221
00:31:26,150 --> 00:31:28,221
Come on. What?

222
00:31:30,889 --> 00:31:32,163
Well...

223
00:31:33,191 --> 00:31:34,568
He touched me.

224
00:31:38,997 --> 00:31:40,567
Over your shirt?

225
00:31:41,399 --> 00:31:42,399
No!

226
00:31:43,067 --> 00:31:44,067
Under it.

227
00:31:45,904 --> 00:31:47,781
And what else?

228
00:31:48,406 --> 00:31:50,044
It's personal.

229
00:31:50,575 --> 00:31:51,610
Come on!

230
00:31:52,377 --> 00:31:53,447
What?

231
00:31:55,013 --> 00:31:56,583
He fingered me.

232
00:31:58,783 --> 00:32:01,389
You wanted him to?
Sure.

233
00:32:03,187 --> 00:32:04,894
Did it hurt?

234
00:32:05,023 --> 00:32:09,972
No. It was just... really nice. Really fun.

235
00:32:10,728 --> 00:32:12,469
<i>When I watched her,</i>

236
00:32:12,630 --> 00:32:15,236
<i>the burning spread from the plexus.</i>

237
00:32:15,867 --> 00:32:19,474
<i>The burning burnt.
The sensation of traumatic.</i>

238
00:32:19,938 --> 00:32:21,246
<i>It flashed on me</i>

239
00:32:22,040 --> 00:32:27,615
<i>in bursts of clarity that it wasn't
her fault if she was she and I just me.</i>

240
00:32:28,112 --> 00:32:32,390
<i>As those glimpses of truth hit me
like a thunderbolt,</i>

241
00:32:33,418 --> 00:32:35,261
<i>I! Was myself I cursed.</i>

242
00:32:36,054 --> 00:32:38,261
<i>And life became even harder.</i>

243
00:32:40,258 --> 00:32:43,102
A literary revelation, here and in France,

244
00:32:43,227 --> 00:32:47,175
the wildly talented young Quebecois
spews her loathing...

245
00:32:47,298 --> 00:32:49,107
Stop!
Wait, wait!

246
00:32:49,634 --> 00:32:53,673
Her novel is a litany
strewn with rhetorical flourishes.

247
00:32:53,805 --> 00:32:55,842
Stop, it's unbearable!

248
00:32:56,975 --> 00:32:59,751
Why does it say you're 26 on the cover?

249
00:33:01,612 --> 00:33:02,852
I'm ashamed.

250
00:33:04,449 --> 00:33:07,453
I wanted to be published
before I turned 30.

251
00:33:07,986 --> 00:33:11,160
You lied about your age?
I'm so ashamed.

252
00:33:11,289 --> 00:33:12,768
You're amazing.

253
00:33:14,325 --> 00:33:15,497
Your book's great.

254
00:33:17,095 --> 00:33:18,335
Thanks.

255
00:33:27,638 --> 00:33:29,515
You? You're not drinking?

256
00:33:33,978 --> 00:33:35,286
I'm pregnant.

257
00:33:42,687 --> 00:33:43,995
Bravo.

258
00:33:44,122 --> 00:33:45,123
Thanks.

259
00:34:28,933 --> 00:34:32,176
Yes?
Mathieu? It's me.

260
00:34:33,004 --> 00:34:35,416
<i>Hi, what time is it in Montréal?</i>

261
00:34:36,874 --> 00:34:38,080
Late.

262
00:34:38,776 --> 00:34:40,187
Early, actually.

263
00:34:41,612 --> 00:34:42,750
I can't sleep.

264
00:34:44,348 --> 00:34:45,588
<i>What's going on?</i>

265
00:34:47,051 --> 00:34:48,359
Nothing.

266
00:34:56,227 --> 00:34:58,207
<i>I'm happy to hear your voice.</i>

267
00:34:58,963 --> 00:35:00,101
Memo.

268
00:35:02,867 --> 00:35:04,642
How's the book doing?

269
00:35:05,736 --> 00:35:07,909
<i>Incredibly well, as you know.</i>

270
00:35:08,773 --> 00:35:10,218
How well?

271
00:35:12,076 --> 00:35:13,487
Let me repeat it:

272
00:35:13,911 --> 00:35:17,290
<i>We 're atop the fists in Quebec and France.</i>

273
00:35:18,416 --> 00:35:20,327
<i>We've sold 30,000 copies.</i>

274
00:35:21,385 --> 00:35:23,160
<i>We'll print a second run.</i>

275
00:35:25,790 --> 00:35:27,269
Is that good?

276
00:35:27,391 --> 00:35:32,500
<i>5,000</i> copies is a bestseller,
so <i>30,000</i> is better than good.

277
00:35:34,298 --> 00:35:38,246
You're sure?
Yes, it's a hit.

278
00:35:42,840 --> 00:35:44,683
I find it hard to believe.

279
00:35:53,985 --> 00:35:56,022
We make a beautiful duo, babe!

280
00:35:59,023 --> 00:36:03,096
He was happy?
Disgustingly happy!

281
00:36:03,361 --> 00:36:08,003
That fat filthy rich
fucking shithole bastard.

282
00:36:08,166 --> 00:36:10,339
One where's good, two's better!

283
00:36:12,003 --> 00:36:14,506
Has fatso put on even more weight?

284
00:36:14,639 --> 00:36:18,781
Probably. I try not
to look at those pigs.

285
00:36:19,877 --> 00:36:21,288
Hand me my cash.

286
00:36:25,116 --> 00:36:27,153
He always has you finish him.

287
00:36:27,285 --> 00:36:31,290
No idea why. Count yourself lucky.
At least he's fast.

288
00:36:31,455 --> 00:36:33,867
Exactly. You came, now beat it, man!

289
00:36:33,991 --> 00:36:36,198
He insists on his full hour.

290
00:36:36,327 --> 00:36:38,000
He's a businessman.

291
00:36:38,296 --> 00:36:41,470
We put on a great show.
He keeps coming back.

292
00:36:42,967 --> 00:36:44,378
You lick really well.

293
00:36:44,735 --> 00:36:47,215
Yeah? I'm never sure what to do.

294
00:36:47,338 --> 00:36:51,912
No, you're good. Your fingers, tongue.
Really not bad, no joke.

295
00:36:52,577 --> 00:36:55,683
When I moaned it wasn't all an act.
Really?

296
00:36:55,813 --> 00:36:59,488
If fatso wasn't there,
I think I'd come for real.

297
00:37:00,885 --> 00:37:02,558
How 'bout another try?

298
00:37:03,487 --> 00:37:04,522
Please, sweetie!

299
00:37:04,655 --> 00:37:06,657
- Silly!
- C'mon, I'll pay you!

300
00:38:36,113 --> 00:38:38,753
<i>It was a new world. I was captivated.</i>

301
00:38:39,917 --> 00:38:41,419
<i>In my captivity,</i>

302
00:38:41,986 --> 00:38:43,829
<i>I suffered like a martyr.</i>

303
00:38:46,290 --> 00:38:48,600
<i>Something inside me broke.</i>

304
00:38:49,593 --> 00:38:54,338
<i>Something ripped in two
like a tree trunk split by lightning.</i>

305
00:38:54,999 --> 00:38:57,104
<i>I swear that at that moment,</i>

306
00:38:57,935 --> 00:39:00,313
<i>I heard it crack in pain.</i>

307
00:40:12,343 --> 00:40:16,189
<i>After our session last week</i> I <i>walked home.
It was dusk.</i>

308
00:40:20,885 --> 00:40:24,298
A few streets from home
I saw a man laying bricks.

309
00:40:26,257 --> 00:40:29,295
He was wearing a tank-top and work boots.

310
00:40:33,297 --> 00:40:34,571
He was sweating.

311
00:40:35,800 --> 00:40:37,404
His hair was filthy.

312
00:40:38,536 --> 00:40:42,916
In fact, every inch of him was filthy.

313
00:40:46,110 --> 00:40:47,885
I stopped beside him

314
00:40:49,647 --> 00:40:53,322
and asked if he could take a short break

315
00:40:54,785 --> 00:40:56,992
to fuck me in the alleyway

316
00:40:57,988 --> 00:40:59,558
right there.

317
00:41:01,792 --> 00:41:03,794
He looked a bit surprised

318
00:41:04,328 --> 00:41:06,569
but did what I wanted.

319
00:41:09,266 --> 00:41:10,802
Exactly.

320
00:41:19,477 --> 00:41:21,252
He followed me to the alley.

321
00:41:21,579 --> 00:41:23,286
He hardly spoke.

322
00:41:24,248 --> 00:41:25,625
Neither did I.

323
00:41:27,585 --> 00:41:29,360
He took me by the neck

324
00:41:31,255 --> 00:41:34,429
and pressed my face
against the damp bricks.

325
00:41:37,027 --> 00:41:39,166
He reached under my skin

326
00:41:41,632 --> 00:41:44,169
and stuck his fingers in my pussy.

327
00:41:54,445 --> 00:41:55,981
I was dripping wet.

328
00:41:58,649 --> 00:42:00,788
His whole hand was wet.

329
00:42:06,657 --> 00:42:08,398
He was rough.

330
00:42:09,793 --> 00:42:12,399
He never let go of my neck.

331
00:42:14,198 --> 00:42:16,041
He pinned me there.

332
00:42:18,802 --> 00:42:21,408
But I wanted to be pinned down.

333
00:42:25,509 --> 00:42:27,887
He took his cock out of his jeans.

334
00:42:28,212 --> 00:42:30,658
I felt it hard against my ass.

335
00:42:31,315 --> 00:42:32,817
He fucked me,

336
00:42:33,817 --> 00:42:35,421
fast and hard.

337
00:42:36,654 --> 00:42:39,100
He smelled of sweat and wet cement,

338
00:42:40,257 --> 00:42:41,998
a mixture of the two.

339
00:42:52,937 --> 00:42:55,440
I could hear the sounds of the city.

340
00:42:56,507 --> 00:42:58,077
Passers-by,

341
00:42:59,376 --> 00:43:01,356
their banal conversation.

342
00:43:09,453 --> 00:43:12,229
His cock pounded my pussy.

343
00:43:14,091 --> 00:43:16,071
He moaned softly in my ear.

344
00:43:19,563 --> 00:43:22,703
He came fast, on my thigh.

345
00:43:25,302 --> 00:43:27,282
I felt perfect,

346
00:43:28,939 --> 00:43:30,577
like in a daze.

347
00:43:33,110 --> 00:43:35,613
I pulled up my panties and left.

348
00:43:39,617 --> 00:43:41,893
I couldn't describe his face.

349
00:43:50,594 --> 00:43:52,801
And what...

350
00:43:56,166 --> 00:43:58,305
How do you feel about it?

351
00:44:01,639 --> 00:44:03,949
I needed to belong to someone.

352
00:44:06,944 --> 00:44:09,117
I belong to those who take me.

353
00:44:20,691 --> 00:44:22,329
What are you doing?

354
00:44:22,660 --> 00:44:24,537
I don't want to talk anymore.

355
00:44:32,670 --> 00:44:35,514
Let's be reasonable, OK?

356
00:44:44,982 --> 00:44:46,791
I want you so badly.

357
00:44:54,224 --> 00:44:57,501
And so do you.
My wife's right outside.

358
00:44:58,562 --> 00:44:59,870
I know.

359
00:45:04,134 --> 00:45:06,478
No, stop it! Stop.

360
00:45:36,233 --> 00:45:37,837
Pretty good waist.

361
00:45:41,538 --> 00:45:43,415
Nice line of the hips.

362
00:45:46,777 --> 00:45:49,223
<i>Your ass is just as</i> it <i>should be.</i>

363
00:45:50,447 --> 00:45:52,791
The finest of the finest.

364
00:46:03,193 --> 00:46:05,799
Your breasts are starting to sag a bit.

365
00:46:11,535 --> 00:46:14,243
Legs, knees, belly...

366
00:46:15,706 --> 00:46:17,049
No complaints.

367
00:46:20,944 --> 00:46:24,255
You have everything you need
where you need it.

368
00:46:47,771 --> 00:46:50,684
How have you been since last time?
Fine.

369
00:46:52,009 --> 00:46:54,489
You haven't changed jobs?
No.

370
00:46:58,615 --> 00:47:00,617
How many clients do you see?

371
00:47:01,919 --> 00:47:03,489
10 or 20 a week.

372
00:47:06,356 --> 00:47:09,860
You always use protection, no matter what?

373
00:47:12,029 --> 00:47:14,441
Yes.
For oral sex too?

374
00:47:16,166 --> 00:47:17,372
Yes?

375
00:47:17,801 --> 00:47:19,109
Not always.

376
00:47:20,838 --> 00:47:23,114
You've never been treated
for an STD?

377
00:47:28,145 --> 00:47:29,317
Are you pregnant?

378
00:47:34,218 --> 00:47:37,563
Noticed any changes in
your health recently?

379
00:47:44,194 --> 00:47:46,196
Alright, let's examine you.

380
00:47:47,297 --> 00:47:49,334
Put this on, I'll be back.

381
00:47:54,071 --> 00:47:56,142
<i>I prefer the biggest number.</i>

382
00:47:57,374 --> 00:47:59,376
<i>The accumulation of clients,</i>

383
00:47:59,509 --> 00:48:01,147
<i>professors,</i>

384
00:48:01,245 --> 00:48:03,521
<i>doctors, psychoanalysis.</i>

385
00:48:03,647 --> 00:48:05,684
<i>Each one has a specialty,</i>

386
00:48:06,250 --> 00:48:09,925
<i>busying himself
with one part of me or another,</i>

387
00:48:10,053 --> 00:48:12,829
<i>for the healthy development of the whole.</i>

388
00:48:14,558 --> 00:48:17,164
<i>One man in my life would be dangerous;</i>

389
00:48:18,328 --> 00:48:21,070
<i>Too much hatred in me for one head.</i>

390
00:48:22,232 --> 00:48:24,337
<i>I need the planet,</i>

391
00:48:25,435 --> 00:48:27,745
<i>the full range of humankind.</i>

392
00:51:07,697 --> 00:51:09,540
<i>Since you didn't look a! Me,</i>

393
00:51:10,400 --> 00:51:13,040
<i>I placed myself in your gaze.</i>

394
00:51:53,410 --> 00:51:54,616
Hello.

395
00:51:57,581 --> 00:52:01,051
Thanks for agreeing to meet me.
My pleasure.

396
00:52:01,952 --> 00:52:03,954
I'm a huge admirer.

397
00:52:04,287 --> 00:52:08,258
Everyone at the magazine is.
Thank you.

398
00:52:09,392 --> 00:52:12,601
A new novel,
you must be feeling the pressure.

399
00:52:13,563 --> 00:52:15,099
Why'?

400
00:52:15,232 --> 00:52:20,443
Sales, reviews, nominations for Europe's
most prestigious literary awards...

401
00:52:20,837 --> 00:52:23,249
You must dream of repeating that.

402
00:52:24,808 --> 00:52:27,152
I'd prefer to have won the awards.

403
00:52:31,248 --> 00:52:34,923
People buy my novel for my face
on the front cover.

404
00:52:35,418 --> 00:52:37,022
But do they read it?

405
00:52:38,021 --> 00:52:39,261
I don't know.

406
00:52:40,357 --> 00:52:41,836
That's rather dark.

407
00:52:44,261 --> 00:52:48,505
I feel like it's son of a mess.

408
00:52:49,933 --> 00:52:53,039
The mess is pan of my vision of the world.

409
00:52:54,004 --> 00:52:55,483
What do you mean?

410
00:53:00,377 --> 00:53:01,856
There are too many watching.

411
00:53:03,680 --> 00:53:06,661
Reflecting back my beauty or my ugliness,

412
00:53:06,783 --> 00:53:08,854
my talent or my stupidity.

413
00:53:10,287 --> 00:53:11,561
I am lost,

414
00:53:14,124 --> 00:53:18,664
knowing people think things about me
over which I have no control...

415
00:53:18,795 --> 00:53:20,297
It's very upsetting.

416
00:53:22,165 --> 00:53:24,543
It's pan of the mess.

417
00:53:24,901 --> 00:53:26,574
And what do they think?

418
00:53:28,338 --> 00:53:29,681
I don't know.

419
00:53:30,974 --> 00:53:32,681
I don't want to know.

420
00:53:36,713 --> 00:53:39,489
Maybe I shouldn't have exposed myself.

421
00:53:42,586 --> 00:53:45,692
I think I don't like
being exposed, in fact.

422
00:53:48,825 --> 00:53:50,827
Now I keep a low profile.

423
00:53:52,062 --> 00:53:54,508
Success must have calmed you down?

424
00:53:56,866 --> 00:53:59,574
I lost something with that book.

425
00:54:01,938 --> 00:54:03,508
I have the impression

426
00:54:04,574 --> 00:54:06,747
somethings been soiled.

427
00:54:08,945 --> 00:54:11,221
I think it's starting to kick in.

428
00:54:15,085 --> 00:54:16,530
I'm sorry.

429
00:54:20,090 --> 00:54:21,535
Do you want to go on'?

430
00:54:25,028 --> 00:54:27,133
What is your next novel about?

431
00:54:36,306 --> 00:54:37,546
Mathieu?

432
00:54:40,310 --> 00:54:42,756
What if my new book doesn't sell?

433
00:54:43,813 --> 00:54:46,384
<i>Don't worry, it'll all go fine.</i>

434
00:54:47,417 --> 00:54:49,897
But if it doesn't, what'll we do?

435
00:54:51,454 --> 00:54:54,958
<i>Well, nothing. What can we do?</i>

436
00:54:56,293 --> 00:54:58,569
But if no one likes what I wrote?

437
00:55:01,631 --> 00:55:04,441
<i>I like it. I'm here.</i>

438
00:55:04,567 --> 00:55:06,979
<i>I'll be there, I always will.</i>

439
00:55:09,506 --> 00:55:11,179
You won't abandon me?

440
00:55:11,975 --> 00:55:13,249
<i>Never.</i>

441
00:55:15,145 --> 00:55:17,182
And if the critics demolish me?

442
00:55:17,781 --> 00:55:22,594
<i>First, critics demolish books,
they don't demolish you.</i>

443
00:55:24,454 --> 00:55:26,764
You know it's the same thing.

444
00:55:26,856 --> 00:55:28,597
<i>It won'! Happen.</i>

445
00:55:34,798 --> 00:55:36,800
I can't breathe, Mathieu.

446
00:55:38,768 --> 00:55:40,611
It's absolutely suffocating.

447
00:55:49,846 --> 00:55:52,019
I missed you, Cynthia.

448
00:55:53,116 --> 00:55:54,322
Memo.

449
00:55:56,186 --> 00:55:57,790
You're really beautiful.

450
00:55:59,389 --> 00:56:00,663
Thanks.

451
00:56:03,626 --> 00:56:05,503
Am I your favorite john?

452
00:56:08,865 --> 00:56:12,039
I think so. You're one of my best, yes.

453
00:56:15,205 --> 00:56:18,675
Turn over, I want to take you from behind.

454
00:56:20,377 --> 00:56:21,583
OK.

455
00:56:35,492 --> 00:56:36,732
You're beautiful.

456
00:56:37,327 --> 00:56:38,738
You're so beautiful!

457
00:56:42,165 --> 00:56:44,509
I'll fuck you in the ass, OK?
No.

458
00:56:45,068 --> 00:56:46,604
Come on, Cynthia.

459
00:56:48,738 --> 00:56:50,547
I'll pay you extra.

460
00:56:50,673 --> 00:56:51,879
I don't want to.

461
00:56:53,410 --> 00:56:55,219
I'll give you $100 more.

462
00:56:58,348 --> 00:56:59,691
200.

463
00:57:03,219 --> 00:57:04,527
OK.

464
00:57:07,023 --> 00:57:08,263
Thank you.

465
00:57:12,695 --> 00:57:13,969
I won't hurt you.

466
00:57:22,972 --> 00:57:24,246
It's so good.

467
00:57:26,276 --> 00:57:27,653
Tell me you like it.

468
00:57:30,780 --> 00:57:32,054
Say it.

469
00:57:49,966 --> 00:57:52,344
<i>Hello?
Where are you?</i>

470
00:57:53,736 --> 00:57:55,010
At home.

471
00:57:55,138 --> 00:57:58,915
<i>What the fuck? Your first client
was at 8. He's mad.</i>

472
00:58:01,411 --> 00:58:02,754
I'm sorry.

473
00:58:10,920 --> 00:58:12,763
I think I want out.

474
00:58:18,595 --> 00:58:19,869
<i>Ge! Some rest.</i>

475
00:58:21,197 --> 00:58:23,803
<i>I'M find a replacement
for you today.</i>

476
00:58:29,038 --> 00:58:30,540
OK, no. I'll come.

477
00:58:30,707 --> 00:58:31,947
<i>You sure?</i>

478
00:58:33,343 --> 00:58:34,788
Yeah.

479
00:58:40,783 --> 00:58:44,731
<i>I'd describe the beauty of the world
if! Could see it.</i>

480
00:58:45,622 --> 00:58:50,196
<i>Write how faith and courage can overcome
the worst misfortunes.</i>

481
00:58:51,794 --> 00:58:54,206
<i>Bu! I'm too busy dying.</i>

482
00:58:55,698 --> 00:58:57,837
<i>We have to cut to the chase,</i>

483
00:58:58,635 --> 00:59:00,308
<i>to what's killing me.</i>

484
00:59:08,344 --> 00:59:11,052
Good, it'll be simple. Come with me.

485
00:59:12,015 --> 00:59:14,518
Maybe my mouth too.

486
00:59:15,652 --> 00:59:18,155
I'd like a mouth with more punch.

487
00:59:19,689 --> 00:59:21,498
It's really not necessary.

488
00:59:22,091 --> 00:59:23,331
That's kind.

489
00:59:24,160 --> 00:59:25,833
But just a bit, OK?

490
00:59:26,563 --> 00:59:27,837
Come.

491
00:59:34,938 --> 00:59:36,884
It'll heal fast.

492
00:59:48,351 --> 00:59:51,298
Can you stay with me tonight?

493
00:59:53,389 --> 00:59:54,459
Yes.

494
01:00:17,580 --> 01:00:18,650
Suzanne?

495
01:00:19,616 --> 01:00:20,617
Yes?

496
01:00:24,887 --> 01:00:27,299
The tragedy, when people love you,

497
01:00:28,458 --> 01:00:30,495
is they can stop loving you

498
01:00:33,596 --> 01:00:34,939
at any moment.

499
01:02:05,421 --> 01:02:06,661
Hi, Patrick.

500
01:02:07,590 --> 01:02:08,694
Hi.

501
01:02:08,825 --> 01:02:11,396
I'm happy to meet you.
Me too.

502
01:02:49,132 --> 01:02:50,702
OK, you like it rough.

503
01:02:57,039 --> 01:02:58,313
So do I.

504
01:03:05,615 --> 01:03:07,117
Not too rough, OK?

505
01:03:09,152 --> 01:03:11,496
Don't speak. Don't speak.

506
01:03:34,610 --> 01:03:35,918
That's so good.

507
01:03:59,202 --> 01:04:00,772
What are you doing?

508
01:04:00,870 --> 01:04:02,178
Stop!

509
01:04:02,305 --> 01:04:03,682
Stop!

510
01:04:06,709 --> 01:04:08,120
Don't scream.

511
01:04:30,333 --> 01:04:32,506
Hello.
Hello.

512
01:04:32,635 --> 01:04:35,639
I have a delivery for you.
Sign here please.

513
01:04:41,377 --> 01:04:42,583
Thank you.

514
01:04:45,982 --> 01:04:48,428
Are you alright, madame?
Sure.

515
01:04:50,152 --> 01:04:53,156
I really like your work.
I'm a big admirer.

516
01:04:53,990 --> 01:04:55,333
Thanks very much.

517
01:04:55,424 --> 01:04:59,998
Your first novel's still my favorite,
but I like all your books.

518
01:05:01,063 --> 01:05:02,337
Thank you.

519
01:05:02,598 --> 01:05:04,373
Are you working on something?

520
01:05:05,701 --> 01:05:07,009
Yeah.

521
01:05:08,037 --> 01:05:09,539
Can't wait to read it.

522
01:05:12,174 --> 01:05:14,017
I have to find the ending.

523
01:05:15,411 --> 01:05:16,685
OK.

524
01:05:17,580 --> 01:05:18,786
Thank you.

525
01:05:20,583 --> 01:05:21,789
Thanks.

526
01:05:49,412 --> 01:05:51,221
Aren't you coming?

527
01:05:54,317 --> 01:05:56,058
Who's that bitch?

528
01:05:59,655 --> 01:06:00,895
What?

529
01:06:04,493 --> 01:06:06,973
Leave with that slut if you want.

530
01:06:10,466 --> 01:06:11,945
What's going on?

531
01:06:13,903 --> 01:06:15,439
We're waiting for you.

532
01:06:17,139 --> 01:06:19,244
We're all having fun.

533
01:06:24,180 --> 01:06:25,659
Don't touch me!

534
01:06:28,851 --> 01:06:30,831
OK, I don't get it.

535
01:06:31,020 --> 01:06:33,694
I saw you with that fat cow!

536
01:06:35,791 --> 01:06:37,464
I saw you!

537
01:06:41,464 --> 01:06:42,966
You're fucking nuts.

538
01:06:43,199 --> 01:06:44,872
I saw you!

539
01:06:48,938 --> 01:06:51,976
I saw you, shit!
How much have you drunk?

540
01:07:02,785 --> 01:07:04,787
It's time to end it for real.

541
01:07:06,689 --> 01:07:08,225
This isn't fun anymore.

542
01:07:50,099 --> 01:07:51,874
What'll I do with her?

543
01:07:57,740 --> 01:07:59,879
I don't know what to do with her.

544
01:08:02,745 --> 01:08:04,725
I haven't found the ending.

545
01:08:06,882 --> 01:08:08,759
Will I have to kill her?

546
01:08:10,586 --> 01:08:12,862
I can't really have to kill her.

547
01:08:14,957 --> 01:08:16,561
I'll have to kill them.

548
01:08:20,196 --> 01:08:24,269
<i>I'll make my death a poster
that will multiply on walls.</i>

549
01:08:25,768 --> 01:08:28,248
<i>I'll die like you die on stage,</i>

550
01:08:29,238 --> 01:08:31,548
<i>in a storm of emotion.</i>

551
01:08:50,793 --> 01:08:54,741
<i>I expected that you'd still love me
or that you'd kill me.</i>

552
01:08:56,732 --> 01:08:58,473
<i>Because you are so great,</i>

553
01:08:59,235 --> 01:09:01,738
<i>I expected something grandiose.</i>

554
01:09:27,163 --> 01:09:28,767
<i>When death comes,</i>

555
01:09:29,165 --> 01:09:31,042
<i>I don'! Wan! To be there.</i>

556
01:09:46,015 --> 01:09:47,289
If you move,

557
01:09:49,151 --> 01:09:50,459
you're dead.

558
01:10:13,976 --> 01:10:16,582
What are you doing? I'm not finished.

559
01:10:23,752 --> 01:10:25,095
Crazy bitch!

560
01:10:52,915 --> 01:10:55,623
<i>In the end what counts is the crash,</i>

561
01:10:56,252 --> 01:10:57,925
<i>the place of my defeat,</i>

562
01:10:59,021 --> 01:11:02,696
<i>when chance gives way,
and the actions embodying me</i>

563
01:11:02,858 --> 01:11:05,134
<i>finally have me on a leash,</i>

564
01:11:05,694 --> 01:11:07,970
<i>forcing me toward my end.</i>

565
01:11:09,398 --> 01:11:12,470
<i>I will lower my body into death,</i>

566
01:11:13,535 --> 01:11:15,947
<i>where my soul already lies.</i>

567
01:12:34,616 --> 01:12:36,789
You have to eat, miss.

568
01:12:36,885 --> 01:12:38,887
You're thin as a coffin nail.

569
01:12:39,355 --> 01:12:40,629
Go on!

570
01:12:58,307 --> 01:12:59,980
Mathieu...

571
01:13:15,491 --> 01:13:16,868
Let's walk a bit.

572
01:13:30,572 --> 01:13:32,074
Get me out of here.

573
01:13:32,741 --> 01:13:34,049
Do you dislike it?

574
01:13:35,711 --> 01:13:38,521
Only the insane like being in an asylum.

575
01:13:40,215 --> 01:13:41,853
It's not an asylum,

576
01:13:42,451 --> 01:13:44,089
it's a rest home.

577
01:13:44,887 --> 01:13:46,525
I've rested enough.

578
01:13:48,524 --> 01:13:49,764
I feel better.

579
01:13:51,093 --> 01:13:53,767
I'm happy to hear it. Really.

580
01:13:55,230 --> 01:13:56,766
I'm not like them.

581
01:13:58,300 --> 01:14:00,541
I'll truly go crazy if I stay.

582
01:14:02,871 --> 01:14:04,544
Get me out of here.

583
01:16:08,864 --> 01:16:10,207
What are you doing?

584
01:16:13,869 --> 01:16:15,712
You saved my life.

585
01:16:30,752 --> 01:16:32,390
What are you doing?

586
01:17:02,117 --> 01:17:03,994
You saved my life.

587
01:17:53,802 --> 01:17:55,179
I missed you.

588
01:17:58,674 --> 01:17:59,948
Memo.

589
01:18:04,646 --> 01:18:06,626
We'll be good to each other.

590
01:18:09,785 --> 01:18:11,025
Yes.

591
01:18:15,524 --> 01:18:17,162
I can't live without you.

592
01:18:21,029 --> 01:18:22,667
Neither can I.

593
01:18:27,035 --> 01:18:28,309
OK.

594
01:18:30,005 --> 01:18:32,576
Now don't freak out.

595
01:18:36,411 --> 01:18:37,719
What is it?

596
01:18:41,149 --> 01:18:43,356
I want us to stay together.

597
01:18:45,087 --> 01:18:46,498
OK...

598
01:18:54,730 --> 01:18:56,175
Will you marry me?

599
01:18:58,767 --> 01:18:59,871
What?

600
01:19:00,001 --> 01:19:05,110
We can get engaged,
and get married next year and have kids.

601
01:19:06,208 --> 01:19:09,712
Ideally you'd be this pregnant
at the altar.

602
01:19:11,546 --> 01:19:13,253
You want to marry me?

603
01:19:14,049 --> 01:19:18,020
You're crazy!
I know. I don't understand.

604
01:19:19,354 --> 01:19:20,958
I want us to be together.

605
01:19:22,691 --> 01:19:25,228
Come on, we've dicked around enough.

606
01:19:26,228 --> 01:19:27,571
Will you say yes?

607
01:19:29,898 --> 01:19:30,898
Yes.

608
01:19:31,099 --> 01:19:32,099
Yes?

609
01:20:09,237 --> 01:20:12,946
<i>Mathieu? It's me.
I'm happy to hear your voice.</i>

610
01:20:13,074 --> 01:20:15,076
<i>You got home alright?
Yes.</i>

611
01:20:16,077 --> 01:20:17,283
<i>I'm writing.</i>

612
01:20:18,079 --> 01:20:21,788
<i>That's great. Are you happy?
Yes.</i>

613
01:20:21,917 --> 01:20:24,796
<i>I'm writing as I, with strong emotions.</i>

614
01:20:24,920 --> 01:20:26,695
<i>I'm on track, I feel ii.</i>

615
01:20:27,322 --> 01:20:28,824
<i>I'm working fast.</i>

616
01:20:29,124 --> 01:20:30,467
<i>That's extraordinary.</i>

617
01:20:30,826 --> 01:20:33,204
<i>I'm so happy.
When can I read it?</i>

618
01:20:33,361 --> 01:20:36,103
<i>I should have a first draft
in 6 months.</i>

619
01:20:42,003 --> 01:20:45,109
As soon as we're married, we'll stop. OK?
Yeah.

620
01:20:52,013 --> 01:20:53,549
You have some there.

621
01:20:59,688 --> 01:21:01,326
Come, come, come.

622
01:21:11,333 --> 01:21:12,812
We'll be OK, right?

623
01:21:14,236 --> 01:21:16,307
Yeah.
OK.

624
01:21:18,974 --> 01:21:21,750
Should we invite some people over?
Sure.

625
01:21:22,744 --> 01:21:24,087
Is that all we have?

626
01:21:25,680 --> 01:21:27,023
Fuck, did you sneak some?

627
01:21:27,682 --> 01:21:28,682
Course not.

628
01:21:28,750 --> 01:21:32,027
I'm sure you had more than me.
It's almost gone.

629
01:21:34,155 --> 01:21:36,999
Like when you shared our coke
with that slut.

630
01:21:37,092 --> 01:21:38,662
Fred's new girlfriend.

631
01:21:38,760 --> 01:21:41,434
It was a party. Everybody shares.

632
01:21:41,563 --> 01:21:43,042
What are you doing?

633
01:21:43,865 --> 01:21:47,438
We can order more or go out for some.
Chill!

634
01:21:47,569 --> 01:21:49,014
What's your problem?

635
01:21:50,438 --> 01:21:51,940
Why'd you take it all?

636
01:21:52,607 --> 01:21:54,712
There are two of us, we share.

637
01:21:56,011 --> 01:21:57,011
Fucking junkie!

638
01:21:58,847 --> 01:22:00,520
You're the fucking junkie.

639
01:22:00,615 --> 01:22:03,425
The fucking whore and the fucking junkie.

640
01:22:07,889 --> 01:22:10,392
Don't you ever push me again.

641
01:22:12,761 --> 01:22:14,365
Christ, you're a cunt!

642
01:22:16,731 --> 01:22:18,267
Christ, you're a dick!

643
01:23:05,947 --> 01:23:07,756
Hello.
Hi.

644
01:23:08,149 --> 01:23:09,651
Am I too early?

645
01:23:10,652 --> 01:23:13,132
No, I was expecting you. Come in.

646
01:23:13,254 --> 01:23:14,460
Thanks.

647
01:23:15,357 --> 01:23:18,270
Thanks for seeing me.
You're welcome.

648
01:23:18,660 --> 01:23:20,833
We're eager to read your novel.

649
01:23:22,364 --> 01:23:24,105
Can you describe it?

650
01:23:28,803 --> 01:23:31,283
I can say that I write with passion.

651
01:23:33,108 --> 01:23:34,314
Good.

652
01:23:35,210 --> 01:23:39,716
You've never matched your early success.
How do you live with that?

653
01:23:41,683 --> 01:23:43,060
What?

654
01:23:44,452 --> 01:23:46,955
Maybe I'm wrong, but I read that

655
01:23:47,055 --> 01:23:51,470
your latest novels sold a tenth
as many copies as the first one

656
01:23:52,327 --> 01:23:53,965
in France and Quebec.

657
01:23:56,831 --> 01:23:58,640
Yes, that's possible.

658
01:24:09,878 --> 01:24:13,189
Are you alright? Should we postpone this?

659
01:24:15,417 --> 01:24:16,760
No, that's fine.

660
01:24:24,059 --> 01:24:28,508
From day one, people wanted to know
if what you write is true,

661
01:24:29,731 --> 01:24:32,211
if your books are autobiographical.

662
01:24:34,335 --> 01:24:36,372
People lack imagination.

663
01:24:38,373 --> 01:24:39,579
That's true.

664
01:24:43,378 --> 01:24:46,188
Like in that magnificent passage...

665
01:24:46,514 --> 01:24:50,087
A prostitute jumps from the 20th floor

666
01:24:50,185 --> 01:24:52,563
to escape a dangerous client.

667
01:24:55,957 --> 01:24:57,561
Did I write that?

668
01:25:00,361 --> 01:25:01,567
Yes.

669
01:27:33,448 --> 01:27:37,260
<i>Once upon a time there was a tavern</i>

670
01:27:39,954 --> 01:27:43,766
<i>Where we used to raise a glass or two</i>

671
01:27:47,629 --> 01:27:53,307
<i>Remember how we laughed away the hours</i>

672
01:27:54,636 --> 01:27:59,642
<i>And dreamed of all the
great things we would do</i>

673
01:28:03,544 --> 01:28:10,826
<i>Those were the days, my friend</i>

674
01:28:10,952 --> 01:28:14,126
<i>We though! They'd never end</i>

675
01:28:14,489 --> 01:28:20,064
<i>We'd sing and dance, forever and a day</i>

676
01:28:22,430 --> 01:28:25,570
<i>We'd live the life we choose</i>

677
01:28:25,933 --> 01:28:28,812
<i>We'd fight and never lose</i>

678
01:28:29,237 --> 01:28:31,183
For we were young

679
01:28:33,474 --> 01:28:36,148
<i>and sure to have our way</i>

680
01:30:35,396 --> 01:30:38,070
<i>I haven'! Confessed for many years.</i>

681
01:30:40,468 --> 01:30:43,108
<i>I'm no! Exactly sure what to do.</i>

682
01:30:46,107 --> 01:30:48,417
I've done many stupid things.

683
01:30:50,211 --> 01:30:53,124
I'm too ashamed to tell you the details.

684
01:31:00,321 --> 01:31:01,823
I have the feeling...

685
01:31:04,425 --> 01:31:06,427
that everything is killing me.

686
01:31:09,597 --> 01:31:11,338
Words kill me.

687
01:31:15,236 --> 01:31:18,445
For a while I thought writing would save me

688
01:31:20,475 --> 01:31:23,354
but writing took chunks out of me.

689
01:31:27,315 --> 01:31:30,489
Writing brings you too close to death.

690
01:31:36,023 --> 01:31:38,936
I invented Nelly to protect Isabelle,

691
01:31:41,762 --> 01:31:44,333
but I think the opposite happened.

692
01:31:48,803 --> 01:31:51,374
I did things to write about them.

693
01:31:54,775 --> 01:31:56,482
I shouldn't have.

694
01:32:03,818 --> 01:32:06,196
<i>Love kills me too.</i>

695
01:32:09,457 --> 01:32:11,232
<i>Sex kills me.</i>

696
01:32:13,060 --> 01:32:15,404
<i>Beauty, ugliness,</i>

697
01:32:16,831 --> 01:32:18,174
<i>success,</i>

698
01:32:19,333 --> 01:32:20,812
<i>failure...</i>

699
01:32:24,739 --> 01:32:27,652
<i>I feel myself dying in everything I do.</i>

700
01:32:44,992 --> 01:32:47,836
<i>Bu! Now I'd like to move on.</i>

701
01:32:58,506 --> 01:33:00,713
I'd <i>like</i> to feel better.

702
01:34:09,810 --> 01:34:15,317
Isabelle Fortier ended her life
on 24 September 2009 at the age of 36.

703
01:34:15,416 --> 01:34:17,828
She published four novels,
