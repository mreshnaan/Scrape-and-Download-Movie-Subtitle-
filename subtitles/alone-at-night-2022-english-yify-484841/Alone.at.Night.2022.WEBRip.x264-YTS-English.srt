12 strangers chasing fame

61
00:03:08,927 --> 00:03:11,234
quarantine together
during a pandemic?

62
00:03:12,453 --> 00:03:15,238
I'm your host, Paris Hilton,
and I'm so excited to present

63
00:03:15,369 --> 00:03:18,633
"Trap Stars," the hottest
new show on television.

64
00:03:18,763 --> 00:03:19,982
What's up, Trap Stars?

65
00:03:22,114 --> 00:03:23,464
Welcome to the Trap House.

66
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:27,816
There's only one rule
at the Trap House,

67
00:03:27,946 --> 00:03:31,950
Trap Stars must isolate and
can't leave the mansion.

68
00:03:32,081 --> 00:03:33,909
Sounds simple enough, right?

69
00:03:34,039 --> 00:03:35,476
I mean, there's worse places

70
00:03:35,606 --> 00:03:37,086
to be quarantining, you know?

71
00:03:37,217 --> 00:03:40,611
I'm used to going
out and partying and doing

72
00:03:40,742 --> 00:03:42,918
all that fun shit, and
I just really hate being

73
00:03:43,048 --> 00:03:44,093
stuck in the house.

74
00:03:45,790 --> 00:03:47,750
I'm just having fun,
I'm here to do my...

75
00:04:01,937 --> 00:04:03,199
Fuck you.

76
00:04:07,551 --> 00:04:08,639
Bitch.

77
00:04:45,154 --> 00:04:46,547
Hey, I'm Lauren.

78
00:04:46,677 --> 00:04:47,983
Mind if I take this off?

79
00:04:49,898 --> 00:04:51,508
Yeah, you're good.

80
00:04:52,988 --> 00:04:54,555
Come on inside.

81
00:05:02,214 --> 00:05:04,149
You know, I don't
usually do this dating app

82
00:05:04,173 --> 00:05:07,002
thing and go over to
random guys' houses.

83
00:05:07,132 --> 00:05:08,786
You're not nervous, are you?

84
00:05:08,917 --> 00:05:10,179
Nervous?

85
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:11,310
Nervous, yes.

86
00:05:16,838 --> 00:05:22,147

87
00:05:22,278 --> 00:05:27,805

It's nice to meet you, Tom.

90
00:05:36,597 --> 00:05:37,835
And it's nice to
meet you too, Lauren.

91
00:05:37,859 --> 00:05:39,121
Mm-hmm.

92
00:05:47,216 --> 00:05:48,304
Wait.

93
00:05:49,610 --> 00:05:50,804
But I don't like to wait.

94
00:05:50,828 --> 00:05:52,308
Mm-hmm.

95
00:05:52,439 --> 00:05:54,179
But get comfortable.

96
00:05:54,310 --> 00:05:55,311
Yes, ma'am.

97
00:05:55,442 --> 00:05:56,530
I'll be back.

98
00:05:57,966 --> 00:06:00,360
Okay, I'll, I'll do just that.

99
00:06:29,867 --> 00:06:30,867
Hello.

100
00:06:32,479 --> 00:06:33,479
Hello?

101
00:06:35,264 --> 00:06:36,264
Yo, who is this?

102
00:06:37,353 --> 00:06:38,353
Hello!

103
00:06:42,576 --> 00:06:43,577
Hello?

104
00:06:46,449 --> 00:06:47,449
Is somebody here?

105
00:06:50,540 --> 00:06:52,890
Yo, Lauren, you all right
in there?

106
00:06:53,021 --> 00:06:54,501
Yeah, I'll be out in a minute!

107
00:06:59,027 --> 00:07:00,027
Hello?

108
00:07:09,646 --> 00:07:11,387
Lauren, lock the fucking door!

109
00:07:20,875 --> 00:07:22,311
Come out, you pussy!

110
00:07:22,442 --> 00:07:23,921
God, dude!

111
00:07:53,821 --> 00:07:55,344
Tom?

112
00:07:55,475 --> 00:07:57,041
Tom, stop fucking around.

113
00:08:05,049 --> 00:08:06,442
What the fuck?

114
00:08:30,901 --> 00:08:32,163
Yo, dude!

115
00:08:38,126 --> 00:08:39,910
What's up, dude?

116
00:08:40,041 --> 00:08:41,825
You have to drive,
I'm too hung over.

117
00:08:41,956 --> 00:08:42,739
Are you fucking serious?

118
00:08:42,870 --> 00:08:43,740
Yeah, man.

119
00:08:43,871 --> 00:08:44,959
Oh my God.

120
00:08:50,355 --> 00:08:51,922
I'm so fucking nauseous.

121
00:08:53,358 --> 00:08:54,882
And I'm sorry for
making you isolate.

122
00:08:55,012 --> 00:08:56,927
My roommates are mad
paranoid about COVID.

123
00:08:57,058 --> 00:08:58,581
It's only a week, though.

124
00:08:58,712 --> 00:08:59,993
No, I get it, I mean,
I just came from New York.

125
00:09:00,017 --> 00:09:01,889
It's like fucking
Chernobyl over there.

126
00:09:02,019 --> 00:09:04,195
Hey, let's just get
this out of the way.

127
00:09:04,326 --> 00:09:06,241
I feel really responsible
for your break-up.

128
00:09:06,371 --> 00:09:07,982
No, babe, please don't.

129
00:09:08,112 --> 00:09:09,786
No, honestly, I mean,
if I had known your boyfriend

130
00:09:09,810 --> 00:09:12,029
would just break up with
you and throw you out for

131
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:14,399
webcamming, I mean, I would
have never told you about it.

132
00:09:14,423 --> 00:09:16,294
No, babe, honestly,
it's not your fault.

133
00:09:16,425 --> 00:09:18,079
He's literally trash.

134
00:09:18,209 --> 00:09:20,100
Look, I was broke and you gave
me a solution, so I'm over it.

135
00:09:20,124 --> 00:09:21,124
You know what?

136
00:09:21,212 --> 00:09:22,692
That's the right mindset, babe.

137
00:09:22,823 --> 00:09:24,191
Plus it was kind of
fun, fulfilling fantasies.

138
00:09:24,215 --> 00:09:26,478
You remember my
roommate Desi, you know,

139
00:09:26,609 --> 00:09:27,689
the one from freshman year?

140
00:09:27,784 --> 00:09:29,046
Uh-huh.

141
00:09:29,177 --> 00:09:30,894
Okay, I heard
that she's on 18 &amp; Over.

142
00:09:30,918 --> 00:09:31,918
She's webcamming?

143
00:09:31,962 --> 00:09:33,137
Yeah, man.

144
00:09:33,268 --> 00:09:35,313
She was on that shit
fingering herself,

145
00:09:35,444 --> 00:09:37,378
making out with her roommate,
taking naked showers,

146
00:09:37,402 --> 00:09:39,100
doing tons of crazy shit.

147
00:09:39,230 --> 00:09:41,624
Anyways, that bitch is making
$40K a month doing that shit.

148
00:09:41,755 --> 00:09:43,365
$40K?

149
00:09:43,495 --> 00:09:45,299
Dude, I can't just go on there
and do crazy shit like that,

150
00:09:45,323 --> 00:09:46,803
do you know what I mean?

151
00:09:46,934 --> 00:09:48,934
Like, I usually just fucking
lay around in lingerie

152
00:09:48,979 --> 00:09:50,198
and try and look sexy.

153
00:09:50,328 --> 00:09:51,479
Just get a little naked,

154
00:09:51,503 --> 00:09:52,635
show a little bit of ass.

155
00:09:52,766 --> 00:09:53,941
I mean, you have nice tits.

156
00:09:54,071 --> 00:09:55,116
It's a no-brainer.

157
00:09:56,465 --> 00:09:57,901
You know what?

158
00:09:58,032 --> 00:09:59,966
You're right, I'm just going
to spend the next week

159
00:09:59,990 --> 00:10:02,210
webcamming and making some
money so I don't have

160
00:10:02,340 --> 00:10:03,690
to keep couch surfing.

161
00:10:05,474 --> 00:10:07,476
Aw, he's so cute.

162
00:10:07,607 --> 00:10:09,696
That's the neighbors' kids.

163
00:10:09,826 --> 00:10:12,046
You're definitely not
in New York anymore.

164
00:10:31,065 --> 00:10:32,608
My grandfather was
really into hunting,

165
00:10:32,632 --> 00:10:33,720
in case you can't tell.

166
00:10:36,940 --> 00:10:39,290
It's definitely a vibe.

167
00:10:39,421 --> 00:10:41,741
All right, here's some
numbers you're going to need.

168
00:10:44,078 --> 00:10:46,428
Sheriff Rodgers,
she's really nice.

169
00:10:46,558 --> 00:10:48,449
She's actually really cool,
I hope you get to meet her.

170
00:10:48,473 --> 00:10:50,258
But I hope you never
have to meet her,

171
00:10:50,388 --> 00:10:51,388
you know what I mean?

172
00:10:52,826 --> 00:10:54,325
Okay, you're a
fucking idiot, continue.

173
00:10:54,349 --> 00:10:57,308
Okay, all right,
second, Kim and Max Daniels.

174
00:10:57,439 --> 00:10:58,721
They live next door,
they're really cool,

175
00:10:58,745 --> 00:11:01,225
young couple, whatever.

176
00:11:01,356 --> 00:11:02,966
You saw their kids earlier.

177
00:11:03,097 --> 00:11:05,055
And like I said, they're
your only neighbors

178
00:11:05,186 --> 00:11:07,144
for like 17 miles,
there's nobody here.

179
00:11:08,972 --> 00:11:10,191
Call me if you need anything.

180
00:11:10,321 --> 00:11:11,321
I will.

181
00:11:11,409 --> 00:11:12,193
See you in a week.

182
00:11:12,323 --> 00:11:13,323
Bye, dude.

183
00:11:50,013 --> 00:11:51,817
Meanwhile, on the other
side of the mansion...

184
00:11:51,841 --> 00:11:54,037
But yeah, he just did not
want to fucking commit to me.

185
00:11:54,061 --> 00:11:56,101
Like, I'm like, yo, I love
you, do you love me back?

186
00:11:56,150 --> 00:11:58,239
The fight over the
video games was crazy.

187
00:11:58,369 --> 00:12:01,155
We're all just
partying, having fun.

188
00:12:01,285 --> 00:12:04,201
Spence walks in trying to,
like, get her attention.

189
00:12:04,332 --> 00:12:05,768
It's, it's between us.

190
00:12:05,899 --> 00:12:06,682
Come take a shot,
come do a shot!

191
00:12:06,813 --> 00:12:07,901
It's just...

192
00:12:08,031 --> 00:12:09,052
This, like, pissy fucking mood.

193
00:12:09,076 --> 00:12:10,076
Really?

194
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:13,099
What! What the
fuck is wrong with you?

195
00:12:13,123 --> 00:12:14,448
You turned off my
PlayStation, didn't you?

196
00:12:14,472 --> 00:12:15,038
Hitting me in front of everyone?

197
00:12:15,169 --> 00:12:15,996
Are you serious?

198
00:12:16,126 --> 00:12:17,824
That was so beyond!

199
00:12:17,954 --> 00:12:19,477
Just go, just go!

200
00:12:19,608 --> 00:12:20,783
I'm out of here!

201
00:12:20,914 --> 00:12:21,914
The fuck!

202
00:12:21,958 --> 00:12:23,438
Oh my God.

203
00:12:23,568 --> 00:12:24,308
Did you really turn his
PlayStation off, though?

204
00:12:24,439 --> 00:12:25,701
Is that the point?

205
00:12:25,832 --> 00:12:26,939
No, I'm just saying,
I'm just saying!

206
00:12:26,963 --> 00:12:28,243
Is that literally the point?

207
00:12:28,312 --> 00:12:29,507
Why don't you go
fucking join him?

208
00:12:29,531 --> 00:12:30,750
Just join him.

209
00:12:35,406 --> 00:12:37,234
What a fucking moron.

210
00:12:37,365 --> 00:12:39,497
Oh my gosh, what is
wrong with these men!

211
00:12:39,628 --> 00:12:41,282
Are you kidding me?

212
00:12:44,415 --> 00:12:45,677
Shit!

213
00:12:57,167 --> 00:12:58,473
Fuck me.

214
00:13:56,009 --> 00:13:57,271
So, I love Lindsey.

215
00:14:00,230 --> 00:14:01,797
Right now...

216
00:14:01,928 --> 00:14:04,191
I would say Shannon.

217
00:14:04,321 --> 00:14:05,453
I...

218
00:14:16,768 --> 00:14:18,596
Hey, what's your name?

219
00:14:21,643 --> 00:14:22,905
Take your top off.

220
00:14:25,690 --> 00:14:26,691
You're so beautiful.

221
00:14:30,391 --> 00:14:33,481
Oh my God, you are worth
every fucking dollar.

222
00:14:36,397 --> 00:14:37,833
I, I love you in that wig.

223
00:14:40,662 --> 00:14:42,582
I want to get to know you,
like, in a real way.

224
00:14:45,754 --> 00:14:47,016
How did you get that body?

225
00:14:49,801 --> 00:14:51,107
You're so special.

226
00:14:54,981 --> 00:14:58,462
Babe, I want to see your tits
so fucking bad, please.

227
00:15:17,612 --> 00:15:19,005
Hello?

228
00:15:19,135 --> 00:15:21,137
So, you survived
your first night?

229
00:15:21,268 --> 00:15:22,660
Ugh, barely.

230
00:15:22,791 --> 00:15:24,401
I literally feel like
I'm losing my mind.

231
00:15:24,532 --> 00:15:26,316
And you just got there, relax.

232
00:15:26,447 --> 00:15:27,839
So, what are you up to?

233
00:15:27,970 --> 00:15:29,972
Oh, you know,
just been webcamming.

234
00:15:31,843 --> 00:15:32,843
I just got another one.

235
00:15:33,845 --> 00:15:35,673
Ugh, God, it's that tape guy.

236
00:15:35,804 --> 00:15:37,477
Do you remember I was
telling you about him?

237
00:15:37,501 --> 00:15:39,523
Yeah, that weirdo who
puts tape before his camera?

238
00:15:39,547 --> 00:15:41,201
Freak.

239
00:15:41,331 --> 00:15:43,005
God, I don't know if I
can deal with him right now.

240
00:15:43,029 --> 00:15:44,429
Isn't he your biggest client?

241
00:15:44,465 --> 00:15:45,814
Suck it up.

242
00:15:45,945 --> 00:15:47,816
He kind of went
crazy on me last time.

243
00:15:47,947 --> 00:15:50,297
He takes this role playing
shit way too serious.

244
00:15:50,427 --> 00:15:52,212
Whatever, who gives a shit.

245
00:15:52,342 --> 00:15:54,342
It's not like you're going
to ever meet him anyway.

246
00:16:05,442 --> 00:16:07,749
Baby, I thought I'd
never see you again.

247
00:16:07,879 --> 00:16:10,273
Sorry about last time.

248
00:16:10,404 --> 00:16:13,059
I g-got a little carried away.

249
00:16:13,189 --> 00:16:15,409
You just felt so distant.

250
00:16:15,539 --> 00:16:17,367
I'm sorry, daddy.

251
00:16:17,498 --> 00:16:20,370
I need to be able to trust you.

252
00:16:20,501 --> 00:16:22,024
How can I make it up to you?

253
00:16:23,199 --> 00:16:24,374
Tell wifey.

254
00:16:36,169 --> 00:16:38,084
Oh my God.

255
00:16:39,520 --> 00:16:40,782
I got you a ring.

256
00:16:40,912 --> 00:16:43,002
I want you all to myself.

257
00:16:43,132 --> 00:16:44,772
Put your money
where your mouth is.

258
00:16:45,917 --> 00:16:48,398
I love pleasuring my husband.

259
00:16:50,487 --> 00:16:52,968
I love it when
you call me your husband,

260
00:16:53,099 --> 00:16:55,014
but now I need you to prove it.

261
00:16:55,144 --> 00:16:57,929
Make me a video, just for me.

262
00:16:58,060 --> 00:16:59,060
I'd love to.

263
00:17:19,603 --> 00:17:21,214
Follow me, I love my followers.

264
00:17:21,344 --> 00:17:23,433
Make sure you follow me
on social media @ben.

265
00:17:23,564 --> 00:17:24,695
Let's go!

266
00:17:24,826 --> 00:17:25,914
Don't vote me out.

267
00:17:27,916 --> 00:17:29,309
America, what's good?

268
00:17:33,052 --> 00:17:35,663
I take this quarantine
really, really seriously,

269
00:17:35,793 --> 00:17:38,840
so I'm just trying to set
the tone and, you know,

270
00:17:38,970 --> 00:17:40,755
be a good example.

271
00:17:44,759 --> 00:17:45,847

Or don't, whatever.

276
00:19:09,844 --> 00:19:11,038
Are you ignoring
me because you're having

277
00:19:11,062 --> 00:19:12,716
mind-blowing sex
with your boyfriend?

278
00:19:12,847 --> 00:19:14,979
You lucky bitch.

279
00:19:15,110 --> 00:19:18,331
I'm here all alone without
any Wi-Fi and I'm starting

280
00:19:18,461 --> 00:19:19,984
to get really fucking horny.

281
00:19:29,777 --> 00:19:31,217

Hey, do you want
some coffee or anything?

285
00:20:12,602 --> 00:20:14,482
Oh, I'm all right,
sweetie, thank you.

286
00:20:15,431 --> 00:20:16,431
Appreciate it, though.

287
00:20:20,001 --> 00:20:22,786
Are you, you all alone up here?

288
00:20:22,917 --> 00:20:25,528
Yeah, unfortunately.

289
00:20:29,837 --> 00:20:31,230
Must get lonely, huh?

290
00:20:34,668 --> 00:20:35,843
So, where are you from?

291
00:20:35,973 --> 00:20:37,323
Near here.

292
00:20:37,453 --> 00:20:38,628
Really?

293
00:20:38,759 --> 00:20:40,500
You don't look like
you're from here.

294
00:20:40,630 --> 00:20:42,217
Well, I mean, I've
been living in New York

295
00:20:42,241 --> 00:20:43,111
the last couple of years.

296
00:20:43,242 --> 00:20:44,504
Oh, cool.

297
00:20:44,634 --> 00:20:46,593
So, it looks like your
cable got cut here.

298
00:20:46,723 --> 00:20:48,440
I'm going to have to come back
in a couple of days,

299
00:20:48,464 --> 00:20:49,770
run some wire.

300
00:20:49,900 --> 00:20:51,641
I put these temporary
guys in here,

301
00:20:51,772 --> 00:20:53,339
it should help with
your Wi-Fi for now.

302
00:20:53,469 --> 00:20:55,079
Wait, okay,
so, the line got cut.

303
00:20:55,210 --> 00:20:56,994
Does that mean that
someone did that or...

304
00:20:57,125 --> 00:20:58,431
Around here?

305
00:20:58,561 --> 00:21:01,999
No, no, it was probably
just some curious animal

306
00:21:02,130 --> 00:21:03,262
or something, you know?

307
00:21:06,656 --> 00:21:08,310
Lot of creatures around here.

308
00:21:10,443 --> 00:21:12,203
Anyway, we'll get you
set up, you'll be fine.

309
00:21:12,227 --> 00:21:13,227
Okay.

310
00:21:30,332 --> 00:21:32,203
So, uh...

311
00:21:32,334 --> 00:21:33,814
you want anything else?

312
00:21:35,424 --> 00:21:37,731
No, just want to get that fixed.

313
00:21:41,648 --> 00:21:42,968
Well, I'll see you soon.

314
00:21:48,872 --> 00:21:50,613
I think Lucas is cute.

315
00:21:50,744 --> 00:21:53,224
A slick back, and he can dress!

316
00:21:53,355 --> 00:21:54,898
If I had to guess
who has a crush on me,

317
00:21:54,922 --> 00:21:57,054
maybe it might be Deadass?

318
00:21:57,185 --> 00:21:59,230
I feel like
making my move on Lindsey.

319
00:21:59,361 --> 00:22:02,408
He does look
over at me pretty often,

320
00:22:02,538 --> 00:22:04,255
and every time I go to the
bathroom he's kind of,

321
00:22:04,279 --> 00:22:05,715
like, within 20 feet.

322
00:22:05,846 --> 00:22:07,126
I think he likes to hear me pee.

323
00:22:10,633 --> 00:22:12,896
I've been working
on a piece all day.

324
00:22:13,027 --> 00:22:14,985
Oh yeah, anything good?

325
00:22:15,116 --> 00:22:17,292
Yeah, um...

326
00:22:18,902 --> 00:22:21,122
actually, I've been
making stuff about you.

327
00:22:21,252 --> 00:22:23,298
How, how old are you, anyway?

328
00:22:23,429 --> 00:22:25,779
I look older without
my glasses on, but, you know,

329
00:22:25,909 --> 00:22:27,520
I kind of look young right now.

330
00:22:27,650 --> 00:22:28,970
Oh really?
Yeah.

331
00:22:29,086 --> 00:22:30,629
You look older
without your glasses on.

332
00:22:30,653 --> 00:22:32,525
I'll take them off.

333
00:22:32,655 --> 00:22:34,483
I kind of want
to kiss you right now.

334
00:22:47,888 --> 00:22:49,411
I just made out with Deadass,

335
00:22:49,542 --> 00:22:53,197
and it wasn't as bad as
I thought it would be.

336
00:22:53,328 --> 00:22:56,375
He was a little smaller
and I wasn't used to it,

337
00:22:56,505 --> 00:22:58,028
but he wasn't bad.

338
00:22:58,159 --> 00:22:59,571
I know she's in love with me.

339
00:22:59,595 --> 00:23:01,115
Wait, you forgot your glasses.

340
00:23:14,131 --> 00:23:17,396
Vicky, Vicky, my love!

341
00:23:17,526 --> 00:23:18,658
Jazzy!

342
00:23:19,963 --> 00:23:21,203
Oh, thank you for the donation.

343
00:23:21,269 --> 00:23:22,836
So, how are you?
How's the wife?

344
00:23:22,966 --> 00:23:24,944
Well, I got to tell
you, be honest with you,

345
00:23:24,968 --> 00:23:26,608
I mean, this whole
isolation trip, I mean,

346
00:23:26,666 --> 00:23:28,798
we've been fighting
all the time, man.

347
00:23:28,929 --> 00:23:31,192
I mean, I don't even
know what to do anymore.

348
00:23:31,322 --> 00:23:33,281
I mean, I feel invisible here.

349
00:23:33,412 --> 00:23:34,717
It's going to work out.

350
00:23:34,848 --> 00:23:36,478
People are going crazy
in quarantine right now.

351
00:23:36,502 --> 00:23:38,025
And you know why
she'll come around?

352
00:23:38,155 --> 00:23:42,116
Because look at you, you
are one handsome man.

353
00:23:42,246 --> 00:23:45,336
Oh, come on, you
didn't have to say that.

354
00:23:45,467 --> 00:23:48,775
But enough about me, I want to
know what's going on with you.

355
00:23:48,905 --> 00:23:52,909
I'm fine, just want
this year to be over.

356
00:23:53,040 --> 00:23:54,440
So, so, did you move out?

357
00:23:54,563 --> 00:23:55,869
Yeah, I moved home.

358
00:23:55,999 --> 00:23:57,479
Well, I'm really sorry.

359
00:23:57,610 --> 00:23:59,220
It hurts me to see you sad.

360
00:23:59,350 --> 00:24:01,222
You know I'm a fan, right?

361
00:24:01,352 --> 00:24:02,615
Or a friend.

362
00:24:04,530 --> 00:24:06,850
Listen, I got to start dinner
because my wife doesn't cook.

363
00:24:06,923 --> 00:24:08,490
I'll see you later.

364
00:24:50,010 --> 00:24:51,315
I want you so bad.

365
00:25:32,356 --> 00:25:33,356
Yo.

366
00:25:34,184 --> 00:25:35,446
Sorry about that.

367
00:25:35,577 --> 00:25:36,902
Oh, Jesus fucking Christ,

368
00:25:36,926 --> 00:25:38,537
you scared the shit out of me.

369
00:25:38,667 --> 00:25:39,929
Sorry.

370
00:25:40,060 --> 00:25:42,105
It's, it's
going to be $21.50.

371
00:25:42,236 --> 00:25:43,280
All right.

372
00:25:44,847 --> 00:25:46,172
You know what, just,
here, keep the change.

373
00:25:46,196 --> 00:25:47,716
Thanks for coming
all the way out here.

374
00:25:48,242 --> 00:25:50,157
Say, I kind
of got to take a leak,

375
00:25:50,287 --> 00:25:51,375
you know what I mean?

376
00:25:51,506 --> 00:25:53,290
You mind if I use your bathroom?

377
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:56,859
Dude, come on, can't
you just piss in the woods?

378
00:25:58,034 --> 00:25:59,601
Can I piss in the woods?

379
00:25:59,732 --> 00:26:02,169
Do I look like an animal to you?

380
00:26:04,084 --> 00:26:05,724
You know what,
fine, just hurry up.

381
00:26:19,273 --> 00:26:20,337
Hey, you know,
I think I've heard

382
00:26:20,361 --> 00:26:22,015
about this place before.

383
00:26:22,145 --> 00:26:23,843
What?

384
00:26:29,109 --> 00:26:32,112
Yeah, this is
definitely the place.

385
00:26:34,810 --> 00:26:36,420
Okay, what are
you talking about?

386
00:26:43,123 --> 00:26:44,472
Do you mind?

387
00:26:50,217 --> 00:26:52,567
Mm, you don't
have COVID, do you?

388
00:26:52,698 --> 00:26:53,873
Dude, no.

389
00:27:00,096 --> 00:27:02,316
Oh, yeah.

390
00:27:02,446 --> 00:27:03,622
Oh yeah.

391
00:27:05,188 --> 00:27:09,149
Rumor has it, about 20 years
ago a guy marches into town,

392
00:27:09,279 --> 00:27:12,152
breaks into this very
house and tortures

393
00:27:12,282 --> 00:27:15,416
this fucking family
for about two weeks.

394
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:19,594
He was playing mind games,
tormenting them.

395
00:27:19,725 --> 00:27:21,640
Real sick individual, you know?

396
00:27:21,770 --> 00:27:24,773
Finally, once he gets
his rocks off,

397
00:27:24,904 --> 00:27:27,733
he sits the parents down
and forces them to watch

398
00:27:27,863 --> 00:27:32,041
as he chops up the little
kids into bits and pieces.

399
00:27:32,172 --> 00:27:35,262
I mean, some real fucking
Buffalo Bill shit.

400
00:27:35,392 --> 00:27:38,395
I mean, I'm surprised you
haven't heard about it.

401
00:27:38,526 --> 00:27:40,571
Are you sure it was this house?

402
00:27:40,702 --> 00:27:42,530
My friend's family
has had this place...

403
00:27:48,318 --> 00:27:50,843
Hello, Sorriso's Pizza.

404
00:27:50,973 --> 00:27:52,975
Oh yeah, Mr. Burns,
I'm already in the car.

405
00:27:53,106 --> 00:27:54,455
I'll see you soon.

406
00:27:54,585 --> 00:27:57,371
I got to split, but thanks
for the hospitality.

407
00:27:59,025 --> 00:28:00,655
Hey, are you
sure it was this house

408
00:28:00,679 --> 00:28:01,680
the family was killed in?

409
00:28:04,639 --> 00:28:07,773
Hmm, it might
have been a few towns over.

410
00:28:07,903 --> 00:28:08,991
Thanks for the tip.

411
00:28:17,086 --> 00:28:18,827
Yeah, I'm on the way, man.

412
00:28:18,958 --> 00:28:21,351
I told you, 30 minutes
or less, I promise.

413
00:28:21,482 --> 00:28:23,005
Bye-bye.

414
00:28:23,136 --> 00:28:24,703
This fucking guy.

415
00:28:30,796 --> 00:28:32,623
What the fuck is that?

416
00:29:24,458 --> 00:29:25,807
Whoa!

417
00:29:25,938 --> 00:29:27,940
What the hell, dude,
what are you doing?

418
00:29:28,070 --> 00:29:32,379
Sorry, didn't mean to scare you.

419
00:29:32,509 --> 00:29:35,034
I was calling after you and
you had that shit in your ears,

420
00:29:35,164 --> 00:29:36,209
you couldn't hear me.

421
00:29:36,339 --> 00:29:37,471
Jesus Christ.

422
00:29:39,081 --> 00:29:42,824
I'm Sheriff Rodgers and this
is my nephew, Deputy Wayne.

423
00:29:42,955 --> 00:29:43,999
Ma'am.

424
00:29:44,130 --> 00:29:45,392
He's a rookie cookie.

425
00:29:45,522 --> 00:29:46,915
He's just in training.

426
00:29:47,046 --> 00:29:49,483
So, what are you doing
up here in these parts?

427
00:29:49,613 --> 00:29:51,006
Do you know the Stewarts?

428
00:29:51,137 --> 00:29:52,878
Yeah, I'm staying
there for the week.

429
00:29:53,008 --> 00:29:55,228
What are you guys
doing out here?

430
00:29:55,358 --> 00:29:56,988
Well, we were heading
over to the neighbors

431
00:29:57,012 --> 00:30:01,321
and saw you running like
a God damn gazelle.

432
00:30:01,451 --> 00:30:03,771
Just wanted to make sure you're
not running from something.

433
00:30:05,151 --> 00:30:06,591
Getting eaten alive out here.

434
00:30:06,674 --> 00:30:08,241
Is, are the neighbors okay?

435
00:30:08,371 --> 00:30:10,175
You know, we're going
to check on the neighbors

436
00:30:10,199 --> 00:30:11,766
because their relatives
were calling us

437
00:30:11,897 --> 00:30:13,457
saying they couldn't
get a hold of them.

438
00:30:13,550 --> 00:30:15,552
So, just checking in.

439
00:30:15,683 --> 00:30:17,641
All right, well,
I hope everyone's okay.

440
00:30:17,772 --> 00:30:19,228
You know, we should
probably get you back.

441
00:30:19,252 --> 00:30:20,340
We'll drive you.

442
00:30:21,254 --> 00:30:22,254
Getting dark.

443
00:30:30,741 --> 00:30:32,371
You know, they recently
found a young girl's body

444
00:30:32,395 --> 00:30:34,180
not too far from here.

445
00:30:34,310 --> 00:30:38,358
They found a dozen other bodies
killed the same exact way

446
00:30:38,488 --> 00:30:40,012
all across the country.

447
00:30:41,752 --> 00:30:43,580
Real gruesome.

448
00:30:43,711 --> 00:30:46,192
They're calling him
the Crowbar Killer.

449
00:30:46,322 --> 00:30:49,021
And all his victims were young
females around your age.

450
00:30:49,151 --> 00:30:50,849
First he kills
everyone around her,

451
00:30:50,979 --> 00:30:53,112
then he saves her for last.

452
00:30:53,242 --> 00:30:54,698
Well, actually, I think
we're dealing with

453
00:30:54,722 --> 00:30:56,245
a classic serial killer.

454
00:30:56,376 --> 00:30:57,616
Would you cut that out?

455
00:30:57,681 --> 00:30:59,814
You're scaring the
bejesus out of her!

456
00:30:59,945 --> 00:31:02,208
Wait, wait, wait,
why is my door open?

457
00:31:03,992 --> 00:31:05,272
You two stay in the car.

458
00:31:39,593 --> 00:31:41,508
Wait, did you hear that?

459
00:31:41,638 --> 00:31:43,466
Whatever,
she said stay in the car.

460
00:31:48,863 --> 00:31:50,821
Hey, where the fuck
are you going?

461
00:31:50,952 --> 00:31:52,669
Dude, if she's in
trouble, we have to help her.

462
00:31:52,693 --> 00:31:53,694
Come on!

463
00:31:59,482 --> 00:32:00,875
Do you have a gun?

464
00:32:01,006 --> 00:32:02,592
Fuck no, they
don't give me that shit.

465
00:32:02,616 --> 00:32:03,617
Fuck!

466
00:32:18,110 --> 00:32:19,720
Come on.

467
00:32:28,990 --> 00:32:30,209
Sheriff?

468
00:32:46,703 --> 00:32:48,116
Fuck this shit,
I'm getting out of here.

469
00:32:48,140 --> 00:32:49,576
Oh!

470
00:32:49,706 --> 00:32:51,186
Oh shit!

471
00:32:52,405 --> 00:32:53,710
Relax, it's me!

472
00:32:53,841 --> 00:32:55,190
That is so not funny.

473
00:32:55,321 --> 00:32:57,121
Oh, come on,
come on, that was funny.

474
00:32:57,192 --> 00:32:59,629
Jesus Christ, you
nearly scared my sac off!

475
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:01,042
Yeah, I should
have listened to your mom,

476
00:33:01,066 --> 00:33:02,226
you are not cut out for this.

477
00:33:02,328 --> 00:33:03,416
Okay, stop!

478
00:33:03,546 --> 00:33:05,287
Who was in my house?

479
00:33:05,418 --> 00:33:07,378
I checked the house,
the house is secure.

480
00:33:08,725 --> 00:33:10,805
I think your door just blew
open from a gust of wind.

481
00:33:10,858 --> 00:33:12,773
Oh, that's real comforting.

482
00:33:12,903 --> 00:33:14,446
I mean, your lock's pretty old.

483
00:33:14,470 --> 00:33:15,776
Let's go.

484
00:33:18,909 --> 00:33:20,781
Happy Halloween.

485
00:33:20,911 --> 00:33:22,609
Make sure you
get that door fixed.

486
00:33:31,574 --> 00:33:32,880
Here we go!

487
00:33:33,011 --> 00:33:34,379
Do I just start
going back and forth?

488
00:33:34,403 --> 00:33:36,014
Jazzy: You go
back a little bit,

489
00:33:36,144 --> 00:33:37,406
you go forward a little bit.

490
00:33:37,537 --> 00:33:38,538
Like this?

491
00:33:38,668 --> 00:33:39,868
Turn to your right.

492
00:33:39,930 --> 00:33:41,541
Beautiful!

493
00:33:41,671 --> 00:33:42,671
Is that it?

494
00:33:42,716 --> 00:33:43,916
Now you're talking.

495
00:33:44,892 --> 00:33:46,502
You're really good!

496
00:33:46,633 --> 00:33:48,089
And now get ready,
make believe you're holding

497
00:33:48,113 --> 00:33:49,375
my hand right here.

498
00:33:49,505 --> 00:33:50,917
Okay, but don't
drop me, all right?

499
00:33:50,941 --> 00:33:52,006
Turn to your right!

500
00:33:52,030 --> 00:33:53,901
Yes.

501
00:33:54,032 --> 00:33:56,469
It's all hips, all
hips, all hips.

502
00:33:58,210 --> 00:33:59,820
There you go.

503
00:33:59,950 --> 00:34:03,911
Um, hey, Lou, I had a
blast, but I have to go, okay?

504
00:34:04,042 --> 00:34:05,541
Okay, but I'm
going to keep dancing,

505
00:34:05,565 --> 00:34:09,569
because once Jazzy is
lit, I'm good to go.

506
00:34:09,699 --> 00:34:11,266
All right, bye.

507
00:34:11,397 --> 00:34:12,441
Peace!

508
00:34:18,143 --> 00:34:19,796
Hey, baby.

509
00:34:19,927 --> 00:34:23,626
Just give me two seconds, I'm
going to go get ready for you.

510
00:34:23,757 --> 00:34:28,327
Hurry up, your
husband's in a spending mood.

511
00:34:47,085 --> 00:34:49,739
Oh my God.

512
00:34:54,135 --> 00:34:55,832
You're so beautiful.

513
00:34:59,445 --> 00:35:02,230
I n-n-need you to
make me another video.

514
00:35:02,361 --> 00:35:04,102
Did you like my last video?

515
00:35:04,232 --> 00:35:05,712
Or was the mask too much?

516
00:35:05,842 --> 00:35:09,585
I n-need you to
do it again, without the mask.

517
00:35:09,716 --> 00:35:13,415
I need to see your eyes when
you tell me you love me.

518
00:35:13,546 --> 00:35:15,113
But you already know that.

519
00:35:15,243 --> 00:35:17,550
I love my future husband.

520
00:35:17,680 --> 00:35:18,986
Show me.

521
00:35:20,379 --> 00:35:22,207
Put your money
where your mouth is.

522
00:35:22,337 --> 00:35:25,514
How much will
it take to make you mine?

523
00:35:25,645 --> 00:35:26,950
Mm...

524
00:35:28,822 --> 00:35:30,171
This much?

525
00:35:30,302 --> 00:35:31,782
I can't wait
to put this ring on yo...

526
00:35:32,652 --> 00:35:33,914
Fuck!

527
00:36:06,381 --> 00:36:07,469
Fuck!

528
00:36:13,083 --> 00:36:14,998
Sheriff, it's me, Vicky.

529
00:36:15,129 --> 00:36:16,391
You were in my cabin earlier?

530
00:36:16,522 --> 00:36:18,132
There's someone
outside of my house.

531
00:36:18,263 --> 00:36:19,960
Okay, go hide somewhere safe.

532
00:36:20,090 --> 00:36:21,483
I'm headed over.

533
00:36:21,614 --> 00:36:22,852
Okay, but how long
is this going to take?

534
00:36:22,876 --> 00:36:24,399
About 30 minutes, go hide.

535
00:36:24,530 --> 00:36:25,930
Please, please, please hurry!

536
00:36:27,924 --> 00:36:28,969
Hey.

537
00:36:30,231 --> 00:36:31,319
Fuck, what the fuck!

538
00:36:31,450 --> 00:36:32,538
Who are you?

539
00:36:32,668 --> 00:36:33,906
I could ask you the same thing!

540
00:36:33,930 --> 00:36:35,802
I said, who the fuck are you!

541
00:36:35,932 --> 00:36:38,457
I'm their neighbor,
okay, Max Daniels.

542
00:36:43,375 --> 00:36:45,899
Oh my God, you're the neighbor.

543
00:36:46,029 --> 00:36:47,509
Max...

544
00:36:47,640 --> 00:36:48,945
I am so sorry.

545
00:36:49,076 --> 00:36:50,425
You were in the house...

546
00:36:50,556 --> 00:36:51,663
I'm sorry, the door was open,

547
00:36:51,687 --> 00:36:52,775
I thought they were here.

548
00:36:52,906 --> 00:36:53,994
I...

549
00:36:54,124 --> 00:36:55,691
oh my God.

550
00:36:55,822 --> 00:36:58,346
I was hunting yesterday,
I heard music coming

551
00:36:58,477 --> 00:36:59,739
from the cabin.

552
00:36:59,869 --> 00:37:02,698
I just figured that
Stacy was in town and...

553
00:37:02,829 --> 00:37:07,137
Actually, that's why I came.

554
00:37:09,357 --> 00:37:10,706
We like to smoke together.

555
00:37:11,664 --> 00:37:12,664
Don't judge.

556
00:37:14,362 --> 00:37:16,522
Well, I could definitely
use a joint after that.

557
00:37:19,759 --> 00:37:22,892
Oh my God, oh my God,
I am so sorry.

558
00:37:23,023 --> 00:37:26,635
I'll, I'll r-roll one up
while you get changed.

559
00:37:26,766 --> 00:37:27,810
Okay.

560
00:37:29,116 --> 00:37:31,031
Really sorry about that, Max.

561
00:37:31,161 --> 00:37:32,772
I'll get something for that cut.

562
00:37:32,902 --> 00:37:33,947
Shit!

563
00:37:47,352 --> 00:37:48,352
Hey.

564
00:37:50,485 --> 00:37:51,485
All right.

565
00:37:54,141 --> 00:37:55,882
Let's get that cleaned up.

566
00:38:04,325 --> 00:38:05,544
I know, I know, I know.

567
00:38:05,674 --> 00:38:07,110
It's almost over, I'm sorry!

568
00:38:14,074 --> 00:38:15,423
There, is that better?

569
00:38:16,772 --> 00:38:17,860
Yeah.

570
00:38:19,122 --> 00:38:20,448
I'm sorry for
slashing your face.

571
00:38:20,472 --> 00:38:21,603
It's okay.

572
00:38:21,734 --> 00:38:23,257
Ugh, I've just been paranoid.

573
00:38:23,388 --> 00:38:24,930
I mean, I met these cops
earlier today and they were

574
00:38:24,954 --> 00:38:26,913
telling me about that
girl who got killed

575
00:38:27,043 --> 00:38:28,262
not too far from here.

576
00:38:28,393 --> 00:38:30,743
You know, the Crowbar Killer?

577
00:38:30,873 --> 00:38:33,615
Oh yeah, is that what
they're calling him now?

578
00:38:33,746 --> 00:38:35,095
Yeah, I guess.

579
00:38:35,225 --> 00:38:36,357
I hope they find him.

580
00:38:36,488 --> 00:38:39,186
This year can't get any crazier.

581
00:38:41,188 --> 00:38:42,188
I hear that.

582
00:38:55,768 --> 00:38:57,160
Because they're out of control.

583
00:39:00,338 --> 00:39:01,948
The pool guy has drowned!

584
00:39:02,078 --> 00:39:03,645
Oh my gosh, oh my
gosh, oh my gosh.

585
00:39:03,776 --> 00:39:05,865
I couldn't give him CPR.

586
00:39:05,995 --> 00:39:07,635
He goes to a lot of pools,
I don't know if

587
00:39:07,736 --> 00:39:08,607
he has COVID or not.

588
00:39:08,737 --> 00:39:10,130
Is this real?

589
00:39:10,260 --> 00:39:13,046
Yes, and I'm, like,
the biggest fan of it.

590
00:39:14,961 --> 00:39:17,180
Hey, I saw your kids
the other day.

591
00:39:17,311 --> 00:39:19,202
They were really cute in their
little Halloween costumes.

592
00:39:19,226 --> 00:39:20,662
Yeah.

593
00:39:20,793 --> 00:39:22,621
Unfortunately, they're gone.

594
00:39:22,751 --> 00:39:24,144
Gone?

595
00:39:24,274 --> 00:39:26,451
Yeah, my ex has them
for the next two weeks.

596
00:39:26,581 --> 00:39:28,975
Oh, right.

597
00:39:29,105 --> 00:39:33,893
We split up
about six months ago.

598
00:39:34,023 --> 00:39:35,590
I'm sorry.

599
00:39:37,070 --> 00:39:39,855
Oh God, I'm killing the mood.

600
00:39:41,770 --> 00:39:43,337
Oh, fuck.

601
00:39:44,599 --> 00:39:45,600
I have to handle that.

602
00:39:53,521 --> 00:39:55,262
Everything okay, ma'am?

603
00:39:55,393 --> 00:39:57,046
Yeah, yeah, everything is fine.

604
00:39:57,177 --> 00:39:58,657
Sorry for the false alarm.

605
00:39:58,787 --> 00:40:00,286
You sounded pretty
scared on the phone.

606
00:40:00,310 --> 00:40:03,139
No, no, no,
I know, umm, I'm fine.

607
00:40:03,270 --> 00:40:05,098
Mind if we take a look around?

608
00:40:05,228 --> 00:40:06,668
I've actually, I have company.

609
00:40:06,795 --> 00:40:08,144
You have company.

610
00:40:08,275 --> 00:40:10,843
I don't see any cars out here.

611
00:40:14,063 --> 00:40:16,370
Wait, are you
fucking the neighbor?

612
00:40:18,154 --> 00:40:19,654
Look, you guys, I,
I'm really sorry for making

613
00:40:19,678 --> 00:40:21,288
you come all the way up here.

614
00:40:21,419 --> 00:40:23,725
Well, you tell your
friend to call his family.

615
00:40:23,856 --> 00:40:25,205
They're worried about him.

616
00:40:25,335 --> 00:40:26,641
Yeah, of course.

617
00:40:26,772 --> 00:40:27,773
Bye.

618
00:40:27,903 --> 00:40:28,904
Home wrecker.

619
00:40:33,169 --> 00:40:34,432
Everything okay?

620
00:40:34,562 --> 00:40:36,346
Yeah, yeah, everything's fine.

621
00:40:36,477 --> 00:40:39,437
I just panicked earlier
and called the cops.

622
00:40:39,567 --> 00:40:41,787
But they're gone now, so.

623
00:40:41,917 --> 00:40:43,832
Well, it's getting late,

624
00:40:43,963 --> 00:40:45,617
I should probably
be heading back.

625
00:40:45,747 --> 00:40:47,009
Got to feed the doggo.

626
00:40:47,140 --> 00:40:48,620
Oh.

627
00:40:48,750 --> 00:40:50,535
Okay.

628
00:40:54,408 --> 00:40:55,453
Thanks for the hang.

629
00:40:57,629 --> 00:40:58,629
Have a good night.

630
00:41:05,811 --> 00:41:07,136
I was so nervous
when Paris called

631
00:41:07,160 --> 00:41:08,770
the meeting for the house.

632
00:41:08,901 --> 00:41:09,554
Hey, guys.

633
00:41:09,684 --> 00:41:11,164
All: Hi!

634
00:41:11,469 --> 00:41:13,403
I bet you guys are
wondering what I'm doing here.

635
00:41:13,427 --> 00:41:14,820
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

636
00:41:14,950 --> 00:41:16,667
Lindsey's boyfriend
just got released early

637
00:41:16,691 --> 00:41:20,478
from prison because of COVID and
he will be joining our cast.

638
00:41:20,608 --> 00:41:21,957
Lindsey has a boyfriend?

Lindsey has a boyfriend?

00:41:25,483 --> 00:41:26,895
Why is he smashing
that ass, then?

641
00:41:26,919 --> 00:41:28,050
Baby!

642
00:41:28,181 --> 00:41:30,879
Oh, I'm so happy
you're out of prison!

643
00:41:31,010 --> 00:41:33,012
I'm a little bit worried
about what might happen

644
00:41:33,142 --> 00:41:35,493
between Deadass
and my boyfriend.

645
00:41:35,623 --> 00:41:37,669

646
00:41:39,540 --> 00:41:40,820

681
00:43:42,750 --> 00:43:44,709
No, I'm good.

682
00:43:44,839 --> 00:43:47,233
You know, I feel like
such a bad influence,

683
00:43:47,363 --> 00:43:50,584
first with the weed,
now with the booze.

684
00:43:52,978 --> 00:43:54,675

Wow, this is delicious,
what is this?

687
00:44:03,902 --> 00:44:07,296
Well, since the split,
I've really got into

688
00:44:07,427 --> 00:44:09,821
different craft drinks.

689
00:44:09,951 --> 00:44:14,260
I'm no mixologist, but thanks
for being my test dummy.

690
00:44:15,783 --> 00:44:17,002
It's called a Downhill Daring.

691
00:44:19,395 --> 00:44:22,442
Hey, think fast.

692
00:44:27,012 --> 00:44:29,144
Buddy, I thought that
you played football.

693
00:44:29,275 --> 00:44:31,669
I did, I was the kicker.

694
00:44:31,799 --> 00:44:34,106
Ah, got it.

695
00:44:36,195 --> 00:44:37,457
Feeling tense, huh?

696
00:44:39,372 --> 00:44:41,591
I honestly can't believe
that you watch this.

697
00:44:41,722 --> 00:44:43,855
Ever since you showed me,
I've been hooked.

698
00:44:43,985 --> 00:44:45,552
I mean, these people
are so insane.

699
00:44:45,683 --> 00:44:46,803
I know, I'm addicted.

700
00:44:47,597 --> 00:44:48,337
Hey.

701
00:44:48,468 --> 00:44:49,774
That's a good boy.

702
00:44:49,904 --> 00:44:50,688
Come on, get out of
here, leave her alone.

703
00:44:50,818 --> 00:44:51,645
Go, go, go.

704
00:44:51,776 --> 00:44:52,776
Aw, he's so sweet.

705
00:44:52,820 --> 00:44:53,952
He is.

706
00:45:05,877 --> 00:45:07,748
Wait, who is
this with your kids?

707
00:45:10,925 --> 00:45:15,451
That is my ex and the man
who is now sleeping with her.

708
00:45:15,582 --> 00:45:18,672
I'm sorry, I'm being nosy.

709
00:45:18,803 --> 00:45:20,500
No, no, it's okay.

710
00:45:20,630 --> 00:45:22,850
I leave it out for when
the kids come to visit.

711
00:45:22,981 --> 00:45:27,246
You know, I want them to think
that we're all okay, you know,

712
00:45:27,376 --> 00:45:30,597
that I'm happy for their
mom and her new boyfriend,

713
00:45:30,728 --> 00:45:32,251
when I'm really not.

714
00:45:34,427 --> 00:45:36,472
Son of a bitch took
my wife, my kids.

715
00:45:36,603 --> 00:45:40,172
That's why I got Jason,
so I wouldn't be alone.

716
00:45:40,302 --> 00:45:43,828
And I'm not trying to
be insensitive by any means,

717
00:45:43,958 --> 00:45:47,962
but just, six months to already
have a new boyfriend, it's...

718
00:45:48,093 --> 00:45:51,096
Well, she signed
the papers six months ago.

719
00:45:51,226 --> 00:45:53,446
This nightmare has been
going on much, much longer.

720
00:45:53,576 --> 00:45:56,405
Can we not talk about my ex?

721
00:45:56,536 --> 00:45:59,365
I'm sorry, I'm being
totally fucking annoying.

722
00:45:59,495 --> 00:46:00,670
It's okay.

723
00:46:00,801 --> 00:46:01,976
I'm a little drunk.

724
00:46:02,107 --> 00:46:06,415
I just want to say
that I hear you.

725
00:46:08,417 --> 00:46:11,638
My ex and I, we recently
split, as well.

726
00:46:11,769 --> 00:46:17,035
And on top of all of that, he
kicked me out of our place, so.

727
00:46:17,165 --> 00:46:18,297
Wow.

728
00:46:20,081 --> 00:46:21,169
You want to talk about it?

729
00:46:23,737 --> 00:46:24,956
No, definitely not.

730
00:46:25,086 --> 00:46:26,174
Okay.

731
00:46:28,220 --> 00:46:30,744
So...

732
00:46:30,875 --> 00:46:32,311
what do you want
to talk about then?

733
00:46:37,359 --> 00:46:40,536
It's just been so weird
with Corona and quarantine

734
00:46:40,667 --> 00:46:43,931
and moving from New York,
going through a break-up.

735
00:46:44,062 --> 00:46:47,805
I just feel like my
life is falling apart.

736
00:46:53,332 --> 00:46:56,030
But now I'm finally starting
to feel like myself again.

737
00:46:58,641 --> 00:46:59,686
Amen to that.

738
00:47:11,785 --> 00:47:14,222
I can't.

739
00:47:14,353 --> 00:47:15,789
It's too soon.

740
00:47:26,713 --> 00:47:28,280
Sorry if I made it
awkward back there.

741
00:47:31,152 --> 00:47:32,501
I think you're really beautiful.

742
00:47:35,200 --> 00:47:36,680
I think you're really handsome.

743
00:47:42,729 --> 00:47:43,904
That was fun.

744
00:47:44,035 --> 00:47:45,340
Yeah.

745
00:47:45,471 --> 00:47:46,646
It was.

746
00:47:50,693 --> 00:47:51,693
Good night.

747
00:47:51,781 --> 00:47:52,870
Bye, good night.

748
00:48:36,348 --> 00:48:38,437
Ahh! Ahh!

749
00:48:39,438 --> 00:48:40,918
Hey, hey, whoa, hey!

750
00:48:41,048 --> 00:48:41,614
Don't come any closer,
I'll fucking kill you!

751
00:48:41,744 --> 00:48:42,615
Chill!

752
00:48:42,745 --> 00:48:44,051
I said, step back!

753
00:48:44,399 --> 00:48:45,855
I think there's been
a little misunderstanding.

754
00:48:45,879 --> 00:48:47,272
Why are you at my cabin?

755
00:48:48,099 --> 00:48:49,709
It's my uncle's
fucking cabin, man.

756
00:48:49,839 --> 00:48:51,450
What fucking uncle?

757
00:48:51,580 --> 00:48:53,940
Look, you must be friends
with my cousin Stacy, right.

758
00:48:53,974 --> 00:48:55,778
You can't fucking
prove that, do better!

759
00:48:55,802 --> 00:48:56,802
Oh, come on!

760
00:48:56,846 --> 00:48:58,152
Do better!

761
00:48:58,283 --> 00:49:00,043
When we were 12, I
accidentally pushed her

762
00:49:00,067 --> 00:49:02,548
off the porch steps, that's why
she has that scar on her nose.

763
00:49:02,678 --> 00:49:07,292
Look, I'm a truck driver, I work
for a fucking carrier service.

764
00:49:07,422 --> 00:49:09,270
Been on the road for the past
three days, I got tired.

765
00:49:09,294 --> 00:49:11,252
I usually crash here if
I'm working the coast.

766
00:49:11,383 --> 00:49:13,187
If you're a truck
driver, where's your truck?

767
00:49:13,211 --> 00:49:15,058
It doesn't make it up
these roads, it's too muddy.

768
00:49:15,082 --> 00:49:17,041
It's down the road.

769
00:49:21,784 --> 00:49:23,351
Fucking-a.

770
00:49:23,482 --> 00:49:24,787
You scared the shit out of me!

771
00:49:26,224 --> 00:49:28,313
I fucking pissed myself.

772
00:49:28,443 --> 00:49:30,924
Fuck it, whatever, I'm
going back to the cabin.

773
00:49:50,944 --> 00:49:52,144
I'm sorry about earlier.

774
00:49:53,860 --> 00:49:55,253
No, I'm sorry.

775
00:49:55,383 --> 00:49:57,603
I almost took your fucking
head off with that bat.

776
00:50:01,041 --> 00:50:02,651
It's my bad.

777
00:50:02,782 --> 00:50:05,263
You don't have COVID or
anything like that, do you?

778
00:50:05,393 --> 00:50:09,484
No, I got tested before
I hit the road, so.

779
00:50:09,615 --> 00:50:12,055
You're kind of the first person
I've talked to in like a week.

780
00:50:14,707 --> 00:50:17,275
Cool.

781
00:50:20,365 --> 00:50:21,845
How did you walk all
the way out here?

782
00:50:21,888 --> 00:50:24,064
I mean, it's kind of far
from the main road.

783
00:50:24,195 --> 00:50:25,674
I hiked in.

784
00:50:25,805 --> 00:50:27,937
I know these woods like
the back of my hand.

785
00:50:28,068 --> 00:50:30,288
Been coming here since
I was a little kid.

786
00:50:30,418 --> 00:50:32,899
So, you just truck
up and down the coast?

787
00:50:33,030 --> 00:50:34,770
You have, like, no
family or anything?

788
00:50:35,902 --> 00:50:38,296
I'm a little bit of a loner.

789
00:50:38,426 --> 00:50:41,212
I got something for you.

790
00:50:49,916 --> 00:50:51,483
Sorry.

791
00:50:51,918 --> 00:50:53,920
Sorry, I didn't mean
to scare you, I just...

792
00:50:56,183 --> 00:51:00,318
See, that's me and that's
Stacy when we were kids.

793
00:51:00,448 --> 00:51:01,710
All right?

794
00:51:03,321 --> 00:51:05,975
I'm not some fucking lunatic
that's going to kill you

795
00:51:06,106 --> 00:51:07,325
while you're sleeping.

796
00:51:09,022 --> 00:51:10,067
Yeah.

797
00:51:12,243 --> 00:51:13,655
If you don't mind me,
I think I'm just going

798
00:51:13,679 --> 00:51:19,076
to crawl back into my
little imagination here.

799
00:51:40,749 --> 00:51:42,055
What do you got here?

800
00:51:42,186 --> 00:51:43,752
DMT and salvia.

801
00:51:43,883 --> 00:51:46,451
Stacy, like, scored it off
some Silicon Valley dude.

802
00:51:46,581 --> 00:51:48,105
Hmm.

803
00:51:48,235 --> 00:51:50,716
Fuck it, let's smoke them
both at the same time.

804
00:51:53,806 --> 00:51:55,000
Okay, so, what's
the difference between

805
00:51:55,024 --> 00:51:56,548
DMT and salvia?

806
00:51:56,678 --> 00:51:58,352
You've never smoked
this shit before?

807
00:51:58,376 --> 00:51:59,376
No.

808
00:52:00,856 --> 00:52:01,988
All right.

809
00:52:04,033 --> 00:52:07,298
So, both, you know, they're
both pretty fucking awesome.

810
00:52:07,428 --> 00:52:12,303
But with salvia, you can
experience cartoon-like visuals,

811
00:52:12,433 --> 00:52:15,523
uncontrollable laughter,
feeling of being stretched

812
00:52:15,654 --> 00:52:19,048
or twisted and, my personal
favorite, believing that

813
00:52:19,179 --> 00:52:21,442
you're in more than once
place at the same time.

814
00:52:21,573 --> 00:52:23,096
Holy shit.

815
00:52:23,227 --> 00:52:24,706
Yeah.

816
00:52:24,837 --> 00:52:26,665
Okay, what about DMT?

817
00:52:26,795 --> 00:52:27,796
Okay.

818
00:52:29,233 --> 00:52:30,756
Now, with DMT, the
hallucinations are

819
00:52:30,886 --> 00:52:32,236
a little more visual.

820
00:52:32,366 --> 00:52:35,064
So, objects can sometimes
turn into animals.

821
00:52:35,195 --> 00:52:37,545
And...

822
00:52:37,676 --> 00:52:41,158
the trip is really short, but
sometimes it can feel like it

823
00:52:41,288 --> 00:52:44,161
lasts forever, even longer.

824
00:52:45,684 --> 00:52:46,772
Well, fuck.

825
00:52:46,902 --> 00:52:48,687
Um...

826
00:52:48,817 --> 00:52:51,820
all right, let's
flip a coin for it.

827
00:52:53,518 --> 00:52:54,954
Good song.

828
00:52:55,084 --> 00:53:00,438
Heads I do DMT, tails
salvia, vice versa.

829
00:53:00,568 --> 00:53:01,569
Okay.

830
00:53:03,397 --> 00:53:05,791
Fuck, I'm doing DMT.

831
00:53:05,921 --> 00:53:07,445
All right.

832
00:53:07,575 --> 00:53:08,837
I'm scared!

833
00:53:08,968 --> 00:53:10,448
Why, come on, don't be scared.

834
00:53:10,578 --> 00:53:13,320
Come on, we'll do them at
the same time, all right?

835
00:53:16,149 --> 00:53:21,023
So, you really don't
need too much.

836
00:53:22,982 --> 00:53:24,940
Go on, get in there.

837
00:53:25,071 --> 00:53:26,638
Oh my God.

838
00:53:26,768 --> 00:53:27,987
All right.

839
00:53:28,117 --> 00:53:29,117
On the count of three.

840
00:53:29,206 --> 00:53:29,989
Okay.

841
00:53:30,119 --> 00:53:31,382
One...

842
00:53:33,340 --> 00:53:34,340
two...

843
00:53:36,082 --> 00:53:37,083
three.

844
00:53:43,089 --> 00:53:44,351
Hold it in.

845
00:53:44,482 --> 00:53:45,961
Hold that shit in.

846
00:53:53,273 --> 00:53:57,538

Oh, could COVID
just be over already?

867
00:55:32,459 --> 00:55:35,810
Us being restricted in this
house and not being able

868
00:55:35,941 --> 00:55:38,770
to go out and do anything, I
feel like it's so ridiculous.

869
00:55:38,900 --> 00:55:40,946
If I had anything to say
to America right now,

870
00:55:41,076 --> 00:55:43,340
I would just say, like,
you don't even understand

871
00:55:43,470 --> 00:55:45,037
how hard this has been for us.

872
00:55:45,167 --> 00:55:46,386
Like, you don't understand.

873
00:55:47,909 --> 00:55:49,302
Yo, Lindsey.

874
00:55:50,434 --> 00:55:51,609
Where you going, man?

875
00:55:51,739 --> 00:55:52,803
I'm just going to go to bed.

876
00:55:52,827 --> 00:55:53,891
Why don't you sleep down here?

877
00:55:53,915 --> 00:55:55,264
Sleep down here?

878
00:55:55,395 --> 00:55:56,851
Yeah, why don't
you sleep down here,

879
00:55:56,875 --> 00:55:58,311
there's another room for you.

880
00:55:58,790 --> 00:56:02,446
To America, I just want
to say wear your masks,

881
00:56:02,576 --> 00:56:07,407
stay home, stay safe, and
just do your part, okay?

882
00:56:08,800 --> 00:56:10,279
Woo!

883
00:56:12,064 --> 00:56:14,109
I cannot believe
that she just did that.

884
00:56:55,629 --> 00:56:56,761
Jake?

885
00:57:12,864 --> 00:57:13,908
Oof.

886
00:57:14,039 --> 00:57:15,388
What the fuck?

887
00:57:15,519 --> 00:57:17,319
Sorry, I didn't
mean to startle you.

888
00:57:19,174 --> 00:57:22,830
I just, I got an early start,
so I didn't want to wake you up.

889
00:57:22,961 --> 00:57:28,575
But, oh yeah, sorry about
the blood on the porch.

890
00:57:28,706 --> 00:57:31,448
There was a deer in the middle
of the road this morning,

891
00:57:31,578 --> 00:57:34,059
so I had to pull the fella off.

892
00:57:34,189 --> 00:57:37,323
Anyway, I changed
out the old wires,

893
00:57:37,454 --> 00:57:40,369
and your Wi-Fi
should be good to go.

894
00:57:40,500 --> 00:57:42,807
So, all I need is
your Hancock here.

895
00:57:44,330 --> 00:57:45,829
Did you just see
a guy here earlier?

896
00:57:45,853 --> 00:57:46,985
He has long hair.

897
00:57:49,814 --> 00:57:51,555
No, no, it's just you and me.

898
00:57:57,082 --> 00:57:58,562
All right.

899
00:57:58,692 --> 00:57:59,867
You have a good one.

900
00:57:59,998 --> 00:58:00,998
Yeah.

901
00:58:17,494 --> 00:58:18,495
Shit.

902
00:58:46,131 --> 00:58:47,524
You're not Sheriff Rodgers.

903
00:59:12,723 --> 00:59:17,162
Oh my God, you look
so pretty, look at you!

904
00:59:18,903 --> 00:59:20,513
Do you really think so?

905
00:59:20,644 --> 00:59:22,491
I mean, I can put this wig
on if you want me to.

906
00:59:22,515 --> 00:59:25,823
No, no, no, I love
you just the way you are.

907
00:59:25,953 --> 00:59:28,652
Hey, you never going to
believe what happened

908
00:59:28,782 --> 00:59:31,350
after the night that
we were dancing.

909
00:59:31,480 --> 00:59:34,179
My wife, she heard the music,
she came upstairs,

910
00:59:34,309 --> 00:59:36,311
we danced all night!

911
00:59:36,442 --> 00:59:38,966
I didn't know my girl was
so much into Marc Anthony.

912
00:59:39,097 --> 00:59:40,925
See, what did I tell you?

913
00:59:41,055 --> 00:59:42,883
I'm happy for you guys.

914
00:59:43,014 --> 00:59:44,102
All night.

915
00:59:44,232 --> 00:59:46,844
Oh yeah, I think we in love.

916
00:59:52,458 --> 00:59:53,633
Uh-oh.

917
00:59:55,156 --> 00:59:56,375
What happened?

918
01:00:06,037 --> 01:00:08,779
I'm sorry, I'm
just, I'm really tired.

919
01:00:08,909 --> 01:00:10,998
But I'm happy for you.

920
01:00:11,129 --> 01:00:12,565
You deserve something real.

921
01:00:26,361 --> 01:00:27,711
Hi, hubby.

922
01:00:27,841 --> 01:00:30,191
You lying, cheating little slut.

923
01:00:30,322 --> 01:00:31,922
Please don't
talk to me like that.

924
01:00:32,019 --> 01:00:33,717
I can't believe
I've been saving myself

925
01:00:33,847 --> 01:00:35,240
for a whore!

926
01:00:35,370 --> 01:00:37,010
I said, don't talk
to me like that!

927
01:00:38,547 --> 01:00:39,940
Okay, wifey!

928
01:01:31,557 --> 01:01:32,906
Is someone there?

929
01:01:51,795 --> 01:01:52,795
Hey.

930
01:01:53,710 --> 01:01:55,363
What are you doing?

931
01:01:56,625 --> 01:01:57,733
Why are you chasing me?

932
01:01:57,757 --> 01:01:58,627
Chasing you?

933
01:01:58,758 --> 01:02:00,020
Why are you running from me?

934
01:02:01,282 --> 01:02:02,501
Have you seen Jake?

935
01:02:02,631 --> 01:02:03,632
Who?

936
01:02:03,763 --> 01:02:04,895
Stacy's cousin.

937
01:02:05,025 --> 01:02:06,070
No.

938
01:02:06,200 --> 01:02:07,245
Are you sure you're okay?

939
01:02:08,855 --> 01:02:10,117
What were you digging?

940
01:02:11,466 --> 01:02:12,598
A grave.

941
01:02:12,729 --> 01:02:14,339
What?

942
01:02:14,469 --> 01:02:16,428
I found a deer on
the side of the road.

943
01:02:16,558 --> 01:02:21,476
The odor of a decomposing
carcass tends to attract bears.

944
01:02:21,607 --> 01:02:23,696
Poor thing.

945
01:02:23,827 --> 01:02:25,132
Mind helping?

946
01:02:36,404 --> 01:02:38,624
So, how was the
rest of your night?

947
01:02:41,496 --> 01:02:43,716
I was with you last night.

948
01:02:43,847 --> 01:02:47,198
No, I mean after
I dropped you off.

949
01:02:50,027 --> 01:02:52,769
After you left,
Stacy's cousin came over

950
01:02:52,899 --> 01:02:56,294
and we just hung out.

951
01:02:58,557 --> 01:03:00,080
Oh.

952
01:03:00,211 --> 01:03:01,473
Fun.

953
01:03:10,656 --> 01:03:12,571
It's a sin to leave the
dead without a grave.

954
01:03:19,970 --> 01:03:21,580
Hey, would you grab my smokes?

955
01:03:23,451 --> 01:03:24,626
Yeah, sure.

956
01:03:26,019 --> 01:03:27,194
Where are they?

957
01:03:27,325 --> 01:03:28,848
On the bag.

958
01:03:29,544 --> 01:03:32,199
Right next to you.

959
01:03:41,774 --> 01:03:43,863
Oh my God, are you okay?

960
01:03:43,994 --> 01:03:45,952
My ankle!

961
01:03:54,874 --> 01:03:56,223
Would you give me a hand?

962
01:04:01,794 --> 01:04:02,839
Please?

963
01:04:21,031 --> 01:04:22,293
Thanks.

964
01:04:22,423 --> 01:04:23,555
Here you go.

965
01:04:33,565 --> 01:04:36,873
I don't know about you,
but I'm starving.

966
01:04:39,440 --> 01:04:40,746
How about I cook us dinner?

967
01:04:43,227 --> 01:04:45,185
Come on, you're, you're hurt.

968
01:04:47,753 --> 01:04:49,537
I'm used to being hurt.

969
01:04:54,673 --> 01:05:00,157
Is there a sweater or a
blanket that I could borrow?

970
01:05:00,287 --> 01:05:02,028
Sorry, I'm just freezing.

971
01:05:02,159 --> 01:05:03,812
Yeah, go upstairs.

972
01:05:03,943 --> 01:05:05,423
A bunch of my ex's
stuff in the room.

973
01:05:05,553 --> 01:05:07,773
I'll fire up the stove.

974
01:05:10,341 --> 01:05:11,341
Okay.

975
01:05:13,300 --> 01:05:14,300
Sorry.

976
01:05:14,345 --> 01:05:15,476
Sorry!

977
01:05:50,207 --> 01:05:51,904
Fuck!

978
01:07:06,326 --> 01:07:08,285
I think you're really beautiful.

979
01:07:10,374 --> 01:07:11,462
Mmm.

980
01:07:19,122 --> 01:07:21,080
Kim and Max Daniels.

981
01:07:21,211 --> 01:07:24,388
They live next door, they're
really cool, young couple.

982
01:07:24,518 --> 01:07:26,738
Unfortunately, they're gone.

983
01:07:26,868 --> 01:07:28,044
Gone?

984
01:07:40,752 --> 01:07:42,493
Dinner's ready.

985
01:07:58,378 --> 01:08:02,078
So, tell me more
about you, Vicky.

986
01:08:04,993 --> 01:08:07,953
Not to pry, but when I was at
your place the other night

987
01:08:08,084 --> 01:08:11,435
I noticed you had a
webcam site open.

988
01:08:13,350 --> 01:08:17,223
If you don't mind me asking,
what do you do on there?

989
01:08:20,531 --> 01:08:22,446
It's not a big deal.

990
01:08:22,576 --> 01:08:24,143
It's like, umm...

991
01:08:26,667 --> 01:08:27,886
Sharing content.

992
01:08:33,326 --> 01:08:34,501
Stuff like that.

993
01:08:36,024 --> 01:08:37,113
Uh-huh.

994
01:08:39,767 --> 01:08:40,899
Hmm.

995
01:08:43,467 --> 01:08:46,557
18 &amp; Over, that's
what you're on, right?

996
01:08:46,687 --> 01:08:48,950
Mm-hmm.

997
01:08:49,081 --> 01:08:52,389
I've heard that site's
become such a popular hub

998
01:08:52,519 --> 01:08:56,306
for sex workers that it's
saturated the market.

999
01:08:56,436 --> 01:08:59,483
I didn't even know
that was possible,

1000
01:08:59,613 --> 01:09:01,615
oversaturating the
world sex market.

1001
01:09:07,360 --> 01:09:10,233
What a world we live in!

1002
01:09:10,363 --> 01:09:12,060
Those poor suckers.

1003
01:09:19,938 --> 01:09:25,770
Can you believe there's
whores tricking men into

1004
01:09:25,900 --> 01:09:28,425
falling in love with
them for money!

1005
01:09:36,476 --> 01:09:38,522
What did you put in my drink?

1006
01:09:38,652 --> 01:09:41,133
Promises, promises.

1007
01:09:41,264 --> 01:09:45,137
All I hear is false promises.

1008
01:09:45,268 --> 01:09:48,401
But you're all the
f-f-fucking same.

1009
01:09:50,273 --> 01:09:52,362
Every...

1010
01:09:52,492 --> 01:09:54,581
last...

1011
01:09:54,712 --> 01:09:55,930
one of you.

1012
01:10:02,546 --> 01:10:05,418
Guys, I have some bad news.

1013
01:10:05,549 --> 01:10:08,204
One of you will be going home.

1014
01:10:09,901 --> 01:10:12,469
One of you was beyond
and put us all at risk.

1015
01:10:16,342 --> 01:10:19,215
Kim, you're going home.

1016
01:10:19,345 --> 01:10:21,521
Really, after all that?

1017
01:10:21,652 --> 01:10:23,741
I was at a protest!

1018
01:10:23,871 --> 01:10:26,309
No, bitch, you were at a party.

1019
01:10:26,439 --> 01:10:28,789
The fuck was she
thinking, going to a party?

1020
01:10:28,920 --> 01:10:30,593
She's literally
the one that always has

1021
01:10:30,617 --> 01:10:32,532
a visor on her face!

1022
01:10:32,663 --> 01:10:33,863
It's just not fair, okay!

1023
01:10:33,968 --> 01:10:35,274
Bye.

1024
01:10:35,405 --> 01:10:36,860
It's okay, it's all right,
it's all right.

1025
01:10:36,884 --> 01:10:38,364
Come on, then, it's fine.

1026
01:10:38,495 --> 01:10:39,757
It's so sad.

1027
01:10:41,237 --> 01:10:43,021
Oh my God, get away!
Get out!

1028
01:10:43,151 --> 01:10:44,311
I don't think it's fair.

1029
01:10:44,370 --> 01:10:45,545
Like, give me a warning.

1030
01:10:45,676 --> 01:10:47,504
I'll take another COVID test!

1031
01:10:47,634 --> 01:10:49,046
So, that's what happens when you

1032
01:10:49,070 --> 01:10:50,594
don't follow the rules.

1033
01:10:50,724 --> 01:10:52,813
Actually, it was just one rule.

1034
01:10:52,944 --> 01:10:56,077
All you guys had to do
is stay in this mansion.

1035
01:10:56,208 --> 01:10:59,298
Believe me, life could be worse.

1036
01:10:59,429 --> 01:11:02,301
Everyone in America is doing
the same thing right now.

1037
01:11:02,432 --> 01:11:06,523
You're all very lucky to
be here, so act like it.

1038
01:11:15,575 --> 01:11:17,360
Hi, sleeping beauty.

1039
01:11:21,407 --> 01:11:22,800
What did you do to me?

1040
01:11:25,411 --> 01:11:26,693
Please, please, get me
out of this.

1041
01:11:26,717 --> 01:11:27,848
Why would you do this?

1042
01:11:27,979 --> 01:11:30,460
Are you really asking me why?

1043
01:11:30,590 --> 01:11:36,727
Do you have any idea what
I've d-done to be with you?

1044
01:11:36,857 --> 01:11:39,207
Please, please, you
don't have to do this!

1045
01:11:39,338 --> 01:11:43,211
You said you wanted to marry me.

1046
01:11:43,690 --> 01:11:46,824
You said you wanted a ring.

1047
01:11:46,954 --> 01:11:48,565
I got you a ring.

1048
01:11:53,744 --> 01:11:59,880
I want you to put your money
where your mouth is...

1049
01:12:02,666 --> 01:12:03,797
wifey.

1050
01:12:19,596 --> 01:12:21,859
Baby, did you really
do this all for me?

1051
01:12:25,166 --> 01:12:27,125
Why don't you uncuff me first?

1052
01:12:29,780 --> 01:12:32,478
If you want to propose to me...

1053
01:12:32,609 --> 01:12:34,872
I want you to do it right.

1054
01:12:40,356 --> 01:12:42,445
How can you love me
if you don't trust me?

1055
01:12:44,838 --> 01:12:46,144
Trust is important.

1056
01:13:02,421 --> 01:13:05,424
This was my grandmother's.

1057
01:13:05,555 --> 01:13:11,822
I told my mom all about you,
and she gave it to me for you.

1058
01:13:14,477 --> 01:13:16,261
It's beautiful.

1059
01:13:16,392 --> 01:13:20,439
Vicky, will you m-m...

1060
01:13:20,570 --> 01:13:22,441
marry me?

1061
01:13:22,572 --> 01:13:24,051
Yes.

1062
01:13:31,972 --> 01:13:32,972
Holy shit.

1063
01:13:36,847 --> 01:13:38,718
She, she said yes.

1064
01:13:38,849 --> 01:13:41,547
She said yes.

1065
01:13:41,678 --> 01:13:42,983
She said yes.

1066
01:13:59,522 --> 01:14:00,827
You're a fucking liar.

1067
01:14:03,700 --> 01:14:05,049
You're just trying to use me.

1068
01:14:13,013 --> 01:14:14,754
Am I?

1069
01:14:14,885 --> 01:14:16,364
Oh my God.

1070
01:14:35,166 --> 01:14:37,734
I've always wanted
you to be my husband.

1071
01:14:45,132 --> 01:14:47,265
Baby, close your eyes.

1072
01:14:50,355 --> 01:14:53,532
Because I'm going to blow
your fucking mind.

1073
01:14:59,756 --> 01:15:00,756
Fuck you!

1074
01:16:24,188 --> 01:16:25,406
Ahh!

1075
01:16:26,669 --> 01:16:27,757
No, no, no!

1076
01:16:27,887 --> 01:16:28,714
Hey, hey, hey! Vicky!

1077
01:16:28,845 --> 01:16:29,933
No!

1078
01:16:30,063 --> 01:16:31,084
Vicky, Vicky, hey, hey, hey!

1079
01:16:31,108 --> 01:16:32,108
It's me, it's me.

1080
01:16:32,196 --> 01:16:33,240
Jake, Jake!

1081
01:16:33,371 --> 01:16:34,391
Come here, come here.

1082
01:16:34,415 --> 01:16:35,547
Jake!

1083
01:16:35,678 --> 01:16:36,829
What happened, are you okay?

1084
01:16:36,853 --> 01:16:38,506
No, he's going to kill me!

1085
01:16:38,637 --> 01:16:39,507
Who's going to kill you?
No, we don't have time!

1086
01:16:39,638 --> 01:16:41,031
Who's going to kill you?

1087
01:16:41,161 --> 01:16:42,356
Jake, please,
listen to me, he's not Max.

1088
01:16:42,380 --> 01:16:43,749
He killed the whole
family, come on!

1089
01:16:43,773 --> 01:16:44,904
Come here, talk to me!

1090
01:16:45,035 --> 01:16:46,514
Stop, shh!

1091
01:16:48,125 --> 01:16:49,213
He's here.

1092
01:16:52,042 --> 01:16:53,086
Come on, Jake.

1093
01:16:53,217 --> 01:16:54,348
Who is that?

1094
01:16:54,479 --> 01:16:55,349
Please, trust me, we have to go!

1095
01:16:55,480 --> 01:16:56,786
Jake!

1096
01:16:56,916 --> 01:16:59,005
Go, go, go, now,
go, get out of here, go!

1097
01:17:12,453 --> 01:17:14,673
Who's there?

1098
01:17:20,026 --> 01:17:21,985
Where the fuck are you?

1099
01:17:22,115 --> 01:17:24,204
Where the fuck are you?

1100
01:17:24,988 --> 01:17:26,293
Come on!

1101
01:17:26,424 --> 01:17:28,426
Let's fucking go, huh!

1102
01:17:31,516 --> 01:17:34,650
Where the fuck are you,
you fucking... Ah, fuck!

1103
01:17:42,570 --> 01:17:44,181
Ahh, fuck!

1104
01:17:45,573 --> 01:17:46,618
Hiya, Jake.

1105
01:17:46,749 --> 01:17:47,750
What the fuck!

1106
01:17:52,319 --> 01:17:53,514
Sheriff, it's me, Vicky.

1107
01:17:53,538 --> 01:17:55,061
The Crowbar Killer, he's here!

1108
01:17:55,192 --> 01:17:56,832
Please, please, you have
to come here now!

1109
01:17:56,889 --> 01:17:59,544
Please help me, please!

1110
01:17:59,675 --> 01:18:00,806
Can you hear me?

1111
01:18:00,937 --> 01:18:02,155
Help, please!

1112
01:18:04,897 --> 01:18:05,985
Lou.

1113
01:18:06,116 --> 01:18:07,552
Hey, Vi...

1114
01:18:07,683 --> 01:18:09,356
I'm at 56 Woodland Drive
in Weed, California.

1115
01:18:09,380 --> 01:18:11,314
There's someone trying to
kill me, please, please,

1116
01:18:11,338 --> 01:18:12,905
call for help!

1117
01:18:13,036 --> 01:18:15,156
I'm calling them
now, I'm calling them now.

1118
01:18:25,091 --> 01:18:26,919
Honey...

1119
01:18:27,050 --> 01:18:28,312
I'm home.

1120
01:18:36,712 --> 01:18:39,671
I know I'm not the most...

1121
01:18:39,802 --> 01:18:41,238
traditional guy.

1122
01:18:42,674 --> 01:18:43,980
But I...

1123
01:18:47,157 --> 01:18:51,988
do expect to be with my future
wife the night we got engaged.

1124
01:18:55,643 --> 01:18:57,907
Can we just talk about it?

1125
01:19:04,870 --> 01:19:06,089
What the fuck!

1126
01:19:06,219 --> 01:19:07,394
You fucking touch her!

1127
01:19:07,525 --> 01:19:09,005
I'll come find you!

1128
01:19:09,135 --> 01:19:11,485
I just called the cops,
you crazy son of a bitch!

1129
01:19:11,616 --> 01:19:12,616
Ahh!

1130
01:19:23,671 --> 01:19:26,805
I killed that ungrateful
boyfriend of yours.

1131
01:19:26,936 --> 01:19:29,373
You know he wasn't
right for you.

1132
01:19:29,503 --> 01:19:31,462
You should be thanking me,
you know.

1133
01:19:33,899 --> 01:19:37,903
What else do I have to do
to prove my love to you?

1134
01:19:38,034 --> 01:19:39,209
Tell me!

1135
01:19:53,049 --> 01:19:54,615
That wasn't very nice.

1136
01:20:07,498 --> 01:20:10,414
Got to tell you, honey,
you have been just as

1137
01:20:10,544 --> 01:20:14,244
disappointing as the rest
of those lying bitches.

1138
01:20:26,952 --> 01:20:28,084
Vicky!

1139
01:20:30,347 --> 01:20:32,175
Are you fucking
kidding me right now?

1140
01:20:32,915 --> 01:20:34,220
Let's go, mother fucker.

1141
01:20:35,918 --> 01:20:36,962
Come on.

1142
01:20:41,097 --> 01:20:43,099
God damn it!

1143
01:21:09,516 --> 01:21:11,170
Sorry, buddy...

1144
01:21:11,301 --> 01:21:13,738
nobody likes a third wheel.

1145
01:21:24,923 --> 01:21:27,273
No!

1146
01:21:59,653 --> 01:22:03,353
I always knew you'd stab me
in the back, you b-b-bitch.

1147
01:22:06,486 --> 01:22:07,748
Fuck you!

1148
01:22:34,427 --> 01:22:35,994
It's over.

1149
01:22:53,316 --> 01:22:55,100
I can't watch, I can't...

1150
01:23:09,027 --> 01:23:10,027
Oh my God, girl, just...

1151
01:23:10,115 --> 01:23:11,377
Yeah, right?

1152
01:23:11,508 --> 01:23:12,659
I knew it was
him the whole time.

1153
01:23:12,683 --> 01:23:13,703
I knew it was him
the whole time!

1154
01:23:13,727 --> 01:23:14,772
You did not, you did not!

1155
01:23:14,902 --> 01:23:16,426
Listen to what he's saying!

1156
01:23:16,556 --> 01:23:17,794
Max, Max, Max, I knew
it was him the whole time.

1157
01:23:17,818 --> 01:23:19,178
Why did, how did you know?

1158
01:23:19,255 --> 01:23:20,082
Literally why are
you throwing popcorn?

1159
01:23:20,212 --> 01:23:21,518
It's already a mess in here.

1160
01:23:21,648 --> 01:23:23,408
Hey, yo, who
was the Crowbar Killer?

1161
01:23:24,347 --> 01:23:25,587
Max, you fucking idiot.

1162
01:23:27,219 --> 01:23:28,916
But I thought for sure
it was Jake.

1163
01:23:29,047 --> 01:23:31,832
Like, literally, he was too good
to be true, too nice, too much.

1164
01:23:31,963 --> 01:23:34,096
Have you ever
webcammed, yes or no?

1165
01:23:34,618 --> 01:23:38,361
Of course, of course,
newsflash, look it, look it.

1166
01:23:38,491 --> 01:23:39,840
Of course.

1167
01:23:39,971 --> 01:23:41,340
Nobody asked you,
you analytical asshole.

1168
01:23:41,364 --> 01:23:43,204
I can't believe
that we're in a movie.

1169
01:23:43,235 --> 01:23:44,584
A freaking movie!

1170
01:23:44,715 --> 01:23:46,195
Seriously, though?

1171
01:23:46,325 --> 01:23:47,433
Aren't you guys seeing
what I'm seeing here.

1172
01:23:47,457 --> 01:23:49,285
They're exploiting all of us.

1173
01:23:49,415 --> 01:23:50,982
They're exploiting us!

1174
01:23:51,113 --> 01:23:52,220
I think you're
being overdramatic.

1175
01:23:52,244 --> 01:23:53,289
Uh-uh...

1176
01:23:53,419 --> 01:23:54,419
You're so loud!

1177
01:23:54,507 --> 01:23:55,291
Your face is loud!

1178
01:23:55,421 --> 01:23:56,553
Oh!

1179
01:23:56,683 --> 01:23:58,043
That's right, you heard me.

1180
01:23:59,556 --> 01:24:00,576
And, girl, you're laughing!

1181
01:24:00,600 --> 01:24:01,862
You're laughing!

1182
01:24:01,993 --> 01:24:03,473
And you better shut up.

1183
01:24:03,603 --> 01:24:05,214
Eat your cereal.

1184
01:24:05,344 --> 01:24:07,346
Eat your cereal and shut
up, please, thank you.

1185
01:24:07,477 --> 01:24:08,695
Thank you!

1186
01:24:08,826 --> 01:24:10,567
You know what, fuck
you guys, I'm done.

1187
01:24:10,697 --> 01:24:11,481
Do it again!

1188
01:24:11,611 --> 01:24:12,699
Bye!

1189
01:24:12,830 --> 01:24:13,981
This is why nobody likes you!

1190
01:24:14,005 --> 01:24:14,745
All right, you know what...

1191
01:24:14,875 --> 01:24:15,876
Fuck you!

1192
01:24:16,007 --> 01:24:16,834
It's just a stupid movie.

1193
01:24:16,964 --> 01:24:18,531
Let's just get a drink...

1194
01:24:18,662 --> 01:24:20,118
And this movie is the exact
reason why I'm not joining

1195
01:24:20,142 --> 01:24:21,186
18 &amp; Over.

1196
01:24:35,896 --> 01:24:37,898
I wonder if they do a sequel

1197
01:24:38,029 --> 01:24:39,900
if they'll bring us back.

1198
01:24:53,827 --> 01:24:54,872
Yo!

1199
01:24:56,265 --> 01:24:57,309
Yo!

1200
01:24:58,397 --> 01:24:59,418
