1
00:00:00,291 --> 00:00:07,041
…Queen Beatrix reached the deck of the
ship with her mother Juliana, and from…

2
00:00:07,125 --> 00:00:11,625
…tonight on Vijzelstraat and Leidsestraat,

3
00:00:11,708 --> 00:00:15,541
with Leidseplein and Koningsplein
on either side.

4
00:00:15,625 --> 00:00:20,666
There has been as much damage
as was paid for the festivities.

5
00:00:20,750 --> 00:00:23,375
…pure vandalism.

6
00:00:23,458 --> 00:00:26,750
"Horrible, awful
and an unbelievable shame,"

7
00:00:26,833 --> 00:00:30,041
were the socialist politician's words.

8
00:00:30,125 --> 00:00:34,791
He felt these actions
were an attempt to cause mayhem.

9
00:00:34,875 --> 00:00:38,958
There have also been reactions
to unrest elsewhere in the country.

10
00:00:39,041 --> 00:00:44,666
NOS management believes the reports
on the event have been responsible.

11
00:00:45,833 --> 00:00:49,541
We will conclude
with the weather until tomorrow evening.

12
00:02:02,291 --> 00:02:04,958
- Yeah?
- Good afternoon.

13
00:02:05,041 --> 00:02:09,333
The owner of this building kindly
requests you to vacate the premises.

14
00:02:09,416 --> 00:02:10,416
Oh yeah?

15
00:02:12,958 --> 00:02:14,750
Where's the owner then?

16
00:02:14,833 --> 00:02:18,375
What he does with his house
is none of our business. So…

17
00:02:18,458 --> 00:02:19,833
Listen, idiot.

18
00:02:19,916 --> 00:02:23,583
If the owner wants us to leave,
he can come here and tell us himself.

19
00:02:49,708 --> 00:02:51,250
No.

20
00:03:53,958 --> 00:03:57,666
The rest of the royal family
boarded the S.S. Beatrix…

21
00:03:57,750 --> 00:03:59,416
7 DAYS UNTIL THE CORONATION

22
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:01,125
…to watch the fireworks.

23
00:04:01,208 --> 00:04:05,333
At the same time fighting and looting
took place in Amsterdam's city center

24
00:04:05,416 --> 00:04:09,041
as a result of the violent turmoil
earlier this afternoon.

25
00:04:09,125 --> 00:04:12,250
In backroom talks it was decided…

26
00:04:27,250 --> 00:04:31,541
The guy in two is barfing the whole day.
I've had it. Somebody take care of him.

27
00:04:31,625 --> 00:04:36,500
George, put Shayla in five,
and release the Chinaman in four.

28
00:04:36,583 --> 00:04:42,708
This fucking mess is driving me crazy,
people. A tidy house is a tidy mind.

29
00:04:44,250 --> 00:04:47,500
- Talk to me, honey.
- Good day. I have an appointment.

30
00:04:49,875 --> 00:04:51,333
Jurriaan DeKok.

31
00:04:52,416 --> 00:04:54,333
Keep your fucking hands to yourself.

32
00:04:54,416 --> 00:05:01,208
- It's K-O-K.
- Congratulations. With capital letters?

33
00:05:01,291 --> 00:05:03,791
For a tenner you can blow me.

34
00:05:03,875 --> 00:05:05,416
- Freek.
- Virginia.

35
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:08,458
Virginia, sit down
or I'm going to call your mother.

36
00:05:10,208 --> 00:05:13,416
He'll also do it for a fiver.
Who do you need?

37
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:15,291
Mr Montijn.

38
00:05:16,125 --> 00:05:20,000
Tonnie Montijn.
The meeting was for half past nine.

39
00:05:23,250 --> 00:05:25,750
- With Tonnie?
- That's right.

40
00:05:25,833 --> 00:05:27,791
Around the corner.

41
00:05:27,875 --> 00:05:30,500
- This way?
- He's at Lowietje.

42
00:05:34,708 --> 00:05:36,000
Nice shoes.

43
00:05:36,083 --> 00:05:39,708
The riots in the capital
lasted until the evening.

44
00:05:39,791 --> 00:05:41,333
We're closed.

45
00:05:42,625 --> 00:05:44,458
Hey idiot, you deaf?

46
00:05:45,666 --> 00:05:49,916
No, I have an appointment
with a Mr Montijn.

47
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,208
Tscheu La Ling.

48
00:05:52,291 --> 00:05:54,708
I just don't get it.

49
00:05:54,791 --> 00:05:56,916
Fucking unbelievable.

50
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:00,333
Boy oh boy.
Tscheu La fucking Ling.

51
00:06:00,416 --> 00:06:03,958
Why do we need this half ass Chinaman
when we got Vanenburg.

52
00:06:04,041 --> 00:06:07,291
- Have they lost their minds?
- You know what Ajax should do?

53
00:06:07,375 --> 00:06:09,125
- Well?
- Get Cruijff back.

54
00:06:09,208 --> 00:06:10,375
In your dreams.

55
00:06:11,875 --> 00:06:13,041
Soccer?

56
00:06:14,416 --> 00:06:16,916
- You must be with the police.
- Uh, yes.

57
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:21,958
- Lowie. Get Sherlock some coffee.
- Oh no, thank you, I'm okay.

58
00:06:22,041 --> 00:06:23,750
Did you just come from the gym?

59
00:06:28,750 --> 00:06:33,750
I just wanted to say that I'm glad
to receive this opportunity.

60
00:06:35,541 --> 00:06:40,041
- What opportunity?
- To work together.

61
00:06:40,125 --> 00:06:42,583
- Work together?
- Correct.

62
00:06:42,666 --> 00:06:47,125
I got a letter from the commissioner,
De Woerd.

63
00:06:47,208 --> 00:06:50,708
A response to my application.
He said that I am to work with you.

64
00:06:50,791 --> 00:06:51,875
Urk.

65
00:06:52,708 --> 00:06:55,666
Yes. Born and raised.

66
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,708
Do you have cash on you?

67
00:07:01,625 --> 00:07:02,958
No.

68
00:07:06,875 --> 00:07:12,125
Lesson one:
Always have money on you around here.

69
00:07:16,208 --> 00:07:18,875
- Well, I'll see you later then.
- Sorry?

70
00:07:18,958 --> 00:07:22,166
Half past nine, right?

71
00:07:22,250 --> 00:07:26,125
Half past nine in the evening, mate.
Night shift.

72
00:07:30,791 --> 00:07:32,791
You done, honey?

73
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:36,625
- You were terrific.
- Bye, darling.

74
00:07:37,916 --> 00:07:42,500
- Well, what can I do for you?
- I'm just waiting.

75
00:07:42,583 --> 00:07:47,541
What for? The tram? The only line
that runs around here is line 69.

76
00:07:48,708 --> 00:07:51,958
- Hey, early bird.
- Tonnie, you owe me a tenner.

77
00:07:52,041 --> 00:07:54,833
Get rid of your crotch crickets yet,
Rebecca?

78
00:07:54,916 --> 00:07:58,458
Screw you, limp dick.
Fuck off, asshole.

79
00:07:58,541 --> 00:08:00,750
Leave that at home.
For your own safety.

80
00:08:00,833 --> 00:08:03,541
This week two cops
have been sent to the hospital.

81
00:08:03,625 --> 00:08:07,458
And if you're with me,
everyone will know who you are.

82
00:08:07,541 --> 00:08:10,958
Hey Richard, take it easy.
I know where to find you.

83
00:08:11,041 --> 00:08:16,041
The lingo is different too. Lesson two:
A fiver is different than the Five-O.

84
00:08:16,125 --> 00:08:20,500
And a buck is different than a fuck.
You'll get the hang of it.

85
00:08:20,583 --> 00:08:22,375
- Hey, doll.
- Hot stuff.

86
00:08:22,458 --> 00:08:25,583
- By the way, do you have a house?
- Yes, I found a place.

87
00:08:25,666 --> 00:08:28,291
Great.
That seems to be a problem nowadays.

88
00:08:28,375 --> 00:08:30,875
- Whereabouts?
- On Zeedijk.

89
00:08:30,958 --> 00:08:34,333
Nice. If you want your mail
to smell like piss.

90
00:08:34,416 --> 00:08:37,333
- Wife? Girlfriend? Kids?
- Uh, no.

91
00:08:37,416 --> 00:08:39,916
- Boyfriend?
- No, nothing.

92
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:43,083
It doesn't matter to me.
Everything goes in Amsterdam.

93
00:08:43,166 --> 00:08:44,375
I am single.

94
00:08:44,458 --> 00:08:48,958
That'll save you a lot of trouble when
you get shot in the face. Here we are.

95
00:08:49,041 --> 00:08:50,250
Nell?

96
00:08:51,625 --> 00:08:53,708
Nellie?

97
00:08:53,791 --> 00:08:55,625
Nell?

98
00:08:55,708 --> 00:08:57,500
- Nellie?
- Hey, cutie.

99
00:08:57,583 --> 00:08:59,166
Hey, Tonnie.

100
00:08:59,250 --> 00:09:02,250
I'm looking for Ron.
You know where he is?

101
00:09:02,333 --> 00:09:04,875
Who's Ron?

102
00:09:04,958 --> 00:09:06,583
Really?

103
00:09:07,708 --> 00:09:10,958
Are you serious? Have it your way.

104
00:09:11,041 --> 00:09:12,583
Ron?

105
00:09:13,833 --> 00:09:15,708
Ronny?

106
00:09:19,583 --> 00:09:22,750
- Fuck off, man. I'm busy.
- Hi, Tonnie.

107
00:09:22,833 --> 00:09:24,416
- Asshole.
- Sorry.

108
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:29,291
Ton, quit it. He's upstairs.

109
00:09:29,375 --> 00:09:31,833
Now, was that so difficult?

110
00:09:35,083 --> 00:09:38,833
Urk is new, and he's happily single.

111
00:09:39,666 --> 00:09:43,083
For another one of these
you'll get a half hour with me.

112
00:09:43,166 --> 00:09:46,958
What kind of tourist rates are those?
How long have we known each other?

113
00:09:47,041 --> 00:09:50,250
- Block is my friend.
- It's DeKok.

114
00:09:52,041 --> 00:09:54,083
Often misspelled as C-O-C-K.

115
00:10:01,791 --> 00:10:03,416
Ronny?

116
00:10:10,166 --> 00:10:11,791
Ronny?

117
00:10:13,125 --> 00:10:14,416
Ron?

118
00:10:17,791 --> 00:10:19,458
Ronny?

119
00:10:22,625 --> 00:10:26,166
I've had it with this bullshit.
How am I supposed to get it up?

120
00:10:28,541 --> 00:10:30,541
Urk, give me a hand.

121
00:10:31,541 --> 00:10:32,625
Urk?

122
00:10:37,208 --> 00:10:40,291
- Don't point your gun at me, man.
- Leave me alone, faggot.

123
00:10:40,375 --> 00:10:43,416
Talk to me with some respect,
you filthy junk.

124
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:48,208
- I've already said, if he calls me…
- Shut up, Ron. I'm busy.

125
00:10:48,291 --> 00:10:50,166
Not like this.

126
00:10:50,250 --> 00:10:53,625
A drug-related crime, Urk.
Fished it right out of his pocket.

127
00:10:53,708 --> 00:10:58,666
- You planted that there.
- Get up. On your knees. Sit down.

128
00:10:58,750 --> 00:11:01,500
Keep an eye on David Bowie here,
will you.

129
00:11:02,875 --> 00:11:05,083
Let's see what he brought along.

130
00:11:09,541 --> 00:11:13,833
Look what I found here.
That's so generous. Thanks, buddy.

131
00:11:14,541 --> 00:11:17,416
Those pills are for my heart.

132
00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:21,541
- Maybe I should…
- Keep an eye on your suspect, detective.

133
00:11:28,583 --> 00:11:30,750
Goddammit.

134
00:11:36,583 --> 00:11:39,041
Hell of a first day, DeKok.

135
00:12:27,208 --> 00:12:30,250
- Sorry. Sorry.
- Go away.

136
00:12:57,583 --> 00:12:59,208
Thanks, asshole.

137
00:13:30,916 --> 00:13:33,125
You got some speed, DeKok.

138
00:13:33,208 --> 00:13:36,083
Lesson three:
Never chase trams, junkies or women.

139
00:13:36,166 --> 00:13:38,250
There'll always be a next one. Hey, Ron.

140
00:13:40,416 --> 00:13:41,958
What?

141
00:13:50,375 --> 00:13:53,250
- Let's go. Give me the keys.
- What?

142
00:13:53,333 --> 00:13:55,500
Come on, Urk, move it.
Go, go, go.

143
00:13:55,583 --> 00:13:58,958
Let's go. Let precinct Rapenburg
pull it out of the canal.

144
00:13:59,041 --> 00:14:02,541
- But I already had it called in.
- What?

145
00:14:04,125 --> 00:14:05,875
Seriously?

146
00:14:18,083 --> 00:14:24,291
- So, Tonnie. You pulled out a drunkard?
- And a squatter to boot.

147
00:14:25,041 --> 00:14:27,250
That's going to be a week of paperwork.

148
00:14:27,333 --> 00:14:32,208
- Why didn't you call precinct Rapenburg?
- That's what we would've done.

149
00:14:38,666 --> 00:14:42,291
- I didn't know you…
- It's best if you stay away from me.

150
00:14:46,125 --> 00:14:48,416
6 DAYS UNTIL THE CORONATION

151
00:14:48,500 --> 00:14:53,125
Can someone tell me why our sweet
Lord and Savior hates my fucking guts?

152
00:14:53,208 --> 00:14:58,583
I see you thinking:
"But, Chief, you're a man who has it all.

153
00:14:58,666 --> 00:15:05,125
You have a pretty face,
you're a natural leader…"

154
00:15:05,208 --> 00:15:07,041
- Humble.
- Yes, humble.

155
00:15:07,125 --> 00:15:12,541
Thanks, Van Kemenade.
So why the long face?

156
00:15:14,208 --> 00:15:18,625
Jesse Schippers. Thierry Lejeune.
Maxine de Waard.

157
00:15:18,708 --> 00:15:20,958
We know who they are.
We know where they live.

158
00:15:21,041 --> 00:15:25,041
And we know they've got something
planned on Coronation Day.

159
00:15:25,125 --> 00:15:29,583
It's our job to make sure
it doesn't turn into a goddamn disaster.

160
00:15:29,666 --> 00:15:35,916
However, I just received a call
from our wonderful mayor himself

161
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:41,458
saying we should keep our hands off
of them if we don't have any proof.

162
00:15:41,541 --> 00:15:44,083
- Ridiculous.
- Something about the constitution.

163
00:15:44,166 --> 00:15:47,208
- Oh, that old thing.
- So we're going to be busy this week.

164
00:15:47,291 --> 00:15:52,625
- I have 35 full-timers in the hospital.
- Look, the canal cops.

165
00:15:52,708 --> 00:15:57,375
And to make matters worse,
my star detective decided

166
00:15:57,458 --> 00:16:02,208
that it was a good idea
to fish a drunk pisser from the canal.

167
00:16:02,291 --> 00:16:03,791
Montijn, my office.

168
00:16:03,875 --> 00:16:07,416
Glad someone here
is still doing the hard work.

169
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:11,541
District South called saying there's
a cat in a tree, maybe you can help?

170
00:16:12,625 --> 00:16:15,791
Maybe you should go.
You haven't had pussy in while.

171
00:16:17,208 --> 00:16:19,375
He's allergic.

172
00:16:19,458 --> 00:16:21,958
No, he means pussy.

173
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:25,958
Good one.

174
00:16:29,083 --> 00:16:35,958
Fingers off of my blinds, Tonnie.
Only I can touch my blinds. Got it?

175
00:16:36,041 --> 00:16:40,166
Half my squad is in the hospital
and you pull a drunkard out of the canal.

176
00:16:40,250 --> 00:16:44,625
- We have uniformed officers for that.
- Sorry, sir, it's my fault.

177
00:16:44,708 --> 00:16:48,958
I thought "Vigilance while they rest"
was our motto. I didn't know…

178
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,333
- Tonnie?
- Chief.

179
00:16:52,416 --> 00:16:54,375
Who is this?

180
00:16:54,458 --> 00:16:55,833
Jurriaan DeKok, sir.

181
00:16:55,916 --> 00:16:58,500
We spoke on the phone.
It's my first day.

182
00:16:58,583 --> 00:17:03,416
Well, you're off to a great start, DeKok.
How long is your trial period?

183
00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:08,500
We'll stop by the morgue, pull down
his fly, take a photo, and we're done.

184
00:17:08,583 --> 00:17:14,541
I want a short report. Don't piss away
time with the coronation coming up.

185
00:17:14,625 --> 00:17:15,750
Yes, Chief.

186
00:17:15,833 --> 00:17:19,583
What were you doing there anyway?
Don't you have anything better to do?

187
00:17:19,666 --> 00:17:23,750
We were making the rounds
when Jurre here saw him floating. Right?

188
00:17:24,708 --> 00:17:27,000
- Uh, yeah.
- You have two days.

189
00:17:27,083 --> 00:17:28,541
Understood, Chief.

190
00:17:34,208 --> 00:17:37,291
- Sorry.
- Sorry for what?

191
00:17:37,375 --> 00:17:40,333
Sorry I didn't know
we weren't supposed to…

192
00:17:40,416 --> 00:17:45,000
If it gets me away from the coronation
for two days, I'm happy.

193
00:17:46,041 --> 00:17:47,875
I almost forgot.

194
00:17:48,791 --> 00:17:55,416
- Your cut from Ron.
- Oh no, that's alright.

195
00:17:55,500 --> 00:18:00,708
- Sure? Have you seen your pay check?
- Yeah, it's fine. Really.

196
00:18:00,791 --> 00:18:04,416
Ron would've used this
to buy smack, heroin.

197
00:18:06,541 --> 00:18:10,041
You'll learn soon enough
that it's not all black and white.

198
00:18:10,125 --> 00:18:12,000
I'm hungry. Let's go.

199
00:18:14,125 --> 00:18:16,083
Or did you have other plans?

200
00:18:16,166 --> 00:18:17,791
- Ma?
- Hey, Tonnie.

201
00:18:17,875 --> 00:18:21,708
We're getting a bite to eat.
This is Jurre, my new partner.

202
00:18:23,333 --> 00:18:27,375
- Hello, ma'am. Jurre DeKok.
- Nice to meet you. Louise Montijn.

203
00:18:27,458 --> 00:18:31,750
Nice you finally brought someone along.
If it's not a good time…

204
00:18:31,833 --> 00:18:34,625
No problem.
I'll peel some extra potatoes.

205
00:18:34,708 --> 00:18:36,916
- Where's fatty?
- At school.

206
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,666
My daughter, Pien, goes to university.

207
00:18:40,416 --> 00:18:43,791
Jurre's from Urk. They only have
an elementary school over there.

208
00:18:43,875 --> 00:18:47,208
Nothing wrong with that.
I also only went to elementary school.

209
00:18:47,291 --> 00:18:50,041
Oh no, I finished college.

210
00:18:50,125 --> 00:18:53,125
He fished a corpse
out of the canal last night.

211
00:18:53,208 --> 00:18:57,000
Christ's sake. I don't want
to hear about that before dinner.

212
00:18:57,083 --> 00:19:01,208
- Hang up his jacket, will you.
- This will be the first and last time.

213
00:19:01,750 --> 00:19:04,250
- Ma?
- That's Pien.

214
00:19:05,375 --> 00:19:08,166
Good to see you, fatty.

215
00:19:09,208 --> 00:19:11,666
- Have you been smoking again?
- No, my friends.

216
00:19:11,750 --> 00:19:15,208
- I have friends, unlike you.
- Very funny. This is Jurre.

217
00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:19,500
- Hi.
- Hi.

218
00:19:20,708 --> 00:19:22,458
Jurre DeKok.

219
00:19:25,291 --> 00:19:29,708
I see this was a mistake, Ma.
We're kicking him out after dinner.

220
00:19:29,791 --> 00:19:32,541
- Here you go.
- Tonnie. Jacket.

221
00:19:35,541 --> 00:19:38,375
- Want me to hang yours up too, fatty?
- Yes.

222
00:19:38,458 --> 00:19:39,833
Cheers.

223
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:47,666
The tanks were followed by hundreds
of police and gendarmerie officers.

224
00:19:47,750 --> 00:19:48,875
Some youngsters…

225
00:19:48,958 --> 00:19:52,708
Can you please turn that off?
We have a guest.

226
00:19:52,791 --> 00:19:56,791
Tanks. Unbelievable.
It's as if the goddamn krauts are back.

227
00:19:56,875 --> 00:20:00,666
- But they are.
- I think Claus is a really nice man.

228
00:20:00,750 --> 00:20:03,583
And he seems perfect for Beatrix.

229
00:20:04,916 --> 00:20:08,166
At the university
they don't really like the royal family.

230
00:20:08,250 --> 00:20:12,458
We don't like their money, which could
be used to solve the housing shortage.

231
00:20:12,541 --> 00:20:15,041
You have a house. You live here.

232
00:20:15,125 --> 00:20:17,000
- Please.
- Yeah, we do.

233
00:20:17,083 --> 00:20:20,791
If that scum wants to live somewhere,
they should get a job.

234
00:20:20,875 --> 00:20:26,791
- What job? There are no jobs.
- Jurre has a job. And he also has a house.

235
00:20:26,875 --> 00:20:31,500
- This is lovely. Really lovely.
- Yes? Great.

236
00:20:31,583 --> 00:20:34,958
They're a bunch of filthy freeloaders.
They're fucking lazy.

237
00:20:35,041 --> 00:20:38,125
- You sound just like Dad.
- That's enough!

238
00:20:43,125 --> 00:20:45,958
Jurre, would you like some coffee?

239
00:20:46,916 --> 00:20:49,666
Oh no, let me help.

240
00:20:50,250 --> 00:20:54,083
You see. That's what they learn in Urk.
Work.

241
00:20:54,166 --> 00:20:55,958
Work.

242
00:21:00,250 --> 00:21:03,708
Jurre has a very refreshing appearance.

243
00:21:08,625 --> 00:21:11,083
- What?
- Nothing.

244
00:21:18,750 --> 00:21:20,458
I saw you.

245
00:21:21,958 --> 00:21:23,291
Good for you.

246
00:21:24,375 --> 00:21:27,833
- In the squat.
- The squat?

247
00:21:29,666 --> 00:21:32,416
Why would I be in a squat?
I have a home.

248
00:21:33,208 --> 00:21:38,000
And you? Do you have a home
with its own kitchen?

249
00:21:38,083 --> 00:21:41,125
Or do you eat with someone else
every evening?

250
00:21:43,583 --> 00:21:45,875
I'm certain it was you.

251
00:21:46,625 --> 00:21:49,208
Maybe in your dreams.

252
00:21:51,083 --> 00:21:56,458
Listen, I understand you have sympathy
for the squatters and want to help them.

253
00:21:58,583 --> 00:22:01,583
Their hard core isn't playing games.

254
00:22:01,666 --> 00:22:05,958
Thank you for your concern, officer.
I'll take it into consideration.

255
00:22:10,708 --> 00:22:13,708
Now you'll probably tell Tonnie
everything, right?

256
00:22:19,833 --> 00:22:21,416
This one's still dirty.

257
00:22:30,750 --> 00:22:32,916
5 DAYS UNTIL THE CORONATION

258
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:36,708
This guy drank a little more
than just canal water.

259
00:22:40,958 --> 00:22:45,708
Anyway, forehead wound
inflicted by a blunt object.

260
00:22:45,791 --> 00:22:50,666
Maybe a pole, or something
at the bottom of the canal.

261
00:22:50,750 --> 00:22:54,000
- That was the cause of death?
- No. He drowned.

262
00:22:54,083 --> 00:22:57,208
- Tumbled in while pissing?
- Well…

263
00:22:57,291 --> 00:22:59,416
Don't say "well."
Why did you say "well"?

264
00:22:59,500 --> 00:23:02,250
With the amount of alcohol
and heroin in his system

265
00:23:02,333 --> 00:23:06,166
I doubt he could even stand upright,
let alone open his fly.

266
00:23:07,083 --> 00:23:12,333
- Maybe he had help.
- My first guess, but I'm not sure,

267
00:23:12,416 --> 00:23:15,666
is that his unconscious body
was dumped into the canal.

268
00:23:15,750 --> 00:23:19,416
- So it's murder.
- The rookie is eager.

269
00:23:19,500 --> 00:23:23,375
Listen, he fell asleep on the ledge
and rolled into the canal.

270
00:23:23,458 --> 00:23:26,708
- Happens all the time.
- Yes, but then there's also this.

271
00:23:33,541 --> 00:23:38,208
- You could've just started with this.
- Yeah, but I like to keep it exciting.

272
00:23:38,291 --> 00:23:43,500
- Rat. Maybe he was an informant.
- Not one of mine in any case.

273
00:23:43,583 --> 00:23:48,375
Since I like you guys so much,
there is also some good news.

274
00:23:48,458 --> 00:23:53,583
His pockets were empty, of course,
but they forgot to check his boots.

275
00:23:53,666 --> 00:23:58,500
Take a look at that. Thank you.
Here you go, DeKok.

276
00:23:59,625 --> 00:24:03,166
Let's roll. I can't stand the stench here.
Later, babe.

277
00:24:07,250 --> 00:24:08,666
Bye?

278
00:24:14,375 --> 00:24:19,166
"John Doe drowned in his own
state of mind." How does that sound?

279
00:24:28,916 --> 00:24:31,000
- Tonnie?
- Yeah?

280
00:24:32,208 --> 00:24:33,708
Duivendrecht.

281
00:24:41,375 --> 00:24:43,708
Number three is ours.

282
00:25:04,291 --> 00:25:06,250
Just great.

283
00:25:07,083 --> 00:25:08,583
Christ.

284
00:25:11,625 --> 00:25:13,125
Lesson seven:

285
00:25:13,208 --> 00:25:17,208
A search warrant is only needed
when someone sees you entering.

286
00:25:17,291 --> 00:25:21,458
That's not the case now.
Can you shine the light over here?

287
00:25:26,750 --> 00:25:28,208
Here you go.

288
00:25:43,708 --> 00:25:45,583
- Jurre?
- Yeah?

289
00:25:47,583 --> 00:25:50,250
- Do me a favor.
- Sure.

290
00:25:51,875 --> 00:25:55,166
The next time you see a body
floating in the canal…

291
00:25:55,250 --> 00:25:59,041
- I'll just leave him there.
- That would be great.

292
00:26:11,250 --> 00:26:14,208
4 DAYS UNTIL THE CORONATION

293
00:26:14,291 --> 00:26:19,125
We found a floor plan of the New Church
where the coronation will take place.

294
00:26:19,208 --> 00:26:21,458
- Maybe it's fake.
- It's not.

295
00:26:21,541 --> 00:26:24,375
- I don't mean the floor plan, but…
- Wait.

296
00:26:29,541 --> 00:26:33,750
It's the same floor plan.
Upper House, Lower House,

297
00:26:33,833 --> 00:26:36,500
the president of France,
the crown prince of England.

298
00:26:36,583 --> 00:26:40,750
There are maybe a hundred people
who've been given a floor plan like this.

299
00:26:40,833 --> 00:26:44,875
- A hundred and one, apparently.
- Show me that photo again.

300
00:26:48,416 --> 00:26:50,916
- You sure you don't know him?
- No, Chief.

301
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:56,166
Goddammit. I told them to do the ceremony
at Soestdijk or in The Hague,

302
00:26:56,250 --> 00:27:00,791
but no, no, no, it has to be here,
in our neck of the woods.

303
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:05,333
- What are we going to do?
- We have four days.

304
00:27:07,458 --> 00:27:13,333
Take a forensic team with you.
If there's even one fingerprint pointing

305
00:27:13,416 --> 00:27:18,458
towards one of the squatters in charge,
I can finally lock them all up.

306
00:27:18,541 --> 00:27:21,625
Tonnie. Only the two of you.

307
00:27:22,958 --> 00:27:25,500
Gentlemen, knock yourself out.

308
00:27:44,875 --> 00:27:49,000
- You got to explain me one thing, DeKok.
- What?

309
00:27:49,083 --> 00:27:51,875
Why here? Why the Red Light District?

310
00:27:54,041 --> 00:28:00,291
I mean, you were the top of your class.
You're a good-looking guy.

311
00:28:00,375 --> 00:28:06,375
Very righteous. Maybe a bit too much.
So why did you ask to work with me?

312
00:28:06,458 --> 00:28:09,000
Oh, that.

313
00:28:09,083 --> 00:28:15,041
I wanted a challenge.
I knew that this station was the most…

314
00:28:15,125 --> 00:28:18,125
The biggest piss bucket
in the Netherlands.

315
00:28:18,208 --> 00:28:22,500
- This is two kilometers of misery.
- Something like that.

316
00:28:22,583 --> 00:28:24,791
And I…

317
00:28:24,875 --> 00:28:28,208
I really want to make a change.

318
00:28:28,291 --> 00:28:31,583
Oh God, you're one of those.

319
00:28:32,625 --> 00:28:34,958
- You know what's come to my attention?
- Well?

320
00:28:35,041 --> 00:28:38,708
Since you entered my life,
shit just keeps hitting the fan.

321
00:28:40,916 --> 00:28:42,583
Just kidding.

322
00:28:44,875 --> 00:28:47,500
Goddammit, it's a quarter past ten.

323
00:28:47,583 --> 00:28:49,083
- What?
- We're drinking.

324
00:28:49,166 --> 00:28:51,541
- Drinking?
- Yes, we're getting a drink.

325
00:28:55,291 --> 00:28:59,333
- He'll take one too.
- He still needs to pay for the last one.

326
00:28:59,416 --> 00:29:04,458
Don't be a dick. He's with me.
Just put it on my tab.

327
00:29:04,541 --> 00:29:06,208
- Your tab?
- My tab.

328
00:29:06,291 --> 00:29:09,000
You better have a good story, pal.

329
00:29:11,458 --> 00:29:16,541
We found a floor plan of the New Church
with stuff even we know nothing about.

330
00:29:16,625 --> 00:29:18,375
Who is this?

331
00:29:18,458 --> 00:29:21,583
He's one of ours.
Mees from Groningen. Okay?

332
00:29:23,916 --> 00:29:26,416
Nice to meet you. Jurre DeKok.

333
00:29:26,500 --> 00:29:29,916
It must be linked to the coronation.

334
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:34,041
And we've found a body in the canal.
Most likely a squatter.

335
00:29:34,125 --> 00:29:37,166
He had the word "rat"
carved into his abdomen.

336
00:29:41,625 --> 00:29:45,291
- And?
- I don't know him. So he's not a squatter.

337
00:29:46,250 --> 00:29:49,208
And I also don't think
he's an undercover cop.

338
00:29:49,291 --> 00:29:51,958
Can you ask around
if they're missing anyone?

339
00:29:53,333 --> 00:29:56,750
- Sounds like a fucking shit show to me.
- Pardon me?

340
00:29:56,833 --> 00:29:59,541
I'm not asking around.
They're all paranoid.

341
00:29:59,625 --> 00:30:03,833
If I do, I'll be lying there next to him.
I don't ask. I listen.

342
00:30:03,916 --> 00:30:07,166
I'm not listening, I'm asking.

343
00:30:07,250 --> 00:30:09,458
Come on, Mees. I need info.

344
00:30:12,958 --> 00:30:15,041
Okay, listen.

345
00:30:16,500 --> 00:30:21,333
There's a meeting tonight
at Fort Keizer with the hard core.

346
00:30:21,416 --> 00:30:24,500
- Attend that meeting and we're set.
- No, I'm bartending.

347
00:30:24,583 --> 00:30:28,416
If I change my routines now,
it's going to stand out.

348
00:30:28,500 --> 00:30:32,000
- I can get someone in, though.
- Fine, I'll go.

349
00:30:32,083 --> 00:30:35,458
No. Man, even my mother knows
who you are.

350
00:30:38,708 --> 00:30:40,666
I'll take this shithead.

351
00:30:46,083 --> 00:30:48,083
I don't know if this is a good idea.

352
00:30:48,166 --> 00:30:52,000
It's best if you just get a drink
and stay at the bar.

353
00:30:52,083 --> 00:30:56,083
Most of them will drink so much
they'll spill their guts anyway.

354
00:30:56,166 --> 00:30:59,916
- And if they ask where I'm from?
- Then you're the first squatter of Urk.

355
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:03,333
- From Urk.
- Like this?

356
00:31:06,583 --> 00:31:09,625
- Yes?
- Almost there.

357
00:31:12,291 --> 00:31:15,958
- Shame on you.
- Why did you do that?

358
00:31:16,041 --> 00:31:19,333
Now you really look like a squatter.

359
00:31:19,416 --> 00:31:21,083
INOCCUPANCY
A TRAVESTY

360
00:31:33,333 --> 00:31:34,708
You'll be all right.

361
00:32:11,458 --> 00:32:13,708
- A beer.
- Coming up.

362
00:32:25,625 --> 00:32:28,125
What are you looking at?

363
00:32:30,708 --> 00:32:32,916
What the fuck are you looking at?

364
00:32:34,583 --> 00:32:36,041
I'm…

365
00:32:38,916 --> 00:32:45,041
I'm looking for a friend of mine.
Tall guy, mohawk, brown eyes.

366
00:32:46,541 --> 00:32:48,291
How did you get in here?

367
00:32:54,125 --> 00:32:58,333
Through the front door, idiot.
How about you?

368
00:32:58,416 --> 00:33:00,875
Fucking wankers.

369
00:33:08,416 --> 00:33:11,750
Is everyone having a good time?

370
00:33:12,791 --> 00:33:14,750
Thank you. Good evening.

371
00:33:14,833 --> 00:33:19,416
Also a warm welcome
to all the police who are here tonight.

372
00:33:19,500 --> 00:33:23,500
Fuck you all.

373
00:33:23,583 --> 00:33:25,333
And now some good news.

374
00:33:25,416 --> 00:33:30,375
Our radio station, the megaphone
for all squatters, has a new DJ.

375
00:33:30,458 --> 00:33:37,458
Hot of the press. She has a heart of gold,
an iron will, and an acid tongue.

376
00:33:38,500 --> 00:33:40,625
The Pien Machine.

377
00:33:45,958 --> 00:33:49,041
Hello, everyone.
Live from the Fort Keizer.

378
00:33:49,125 --> 00:33:52,708
Squatnet Radio, 95.6 FM.
Can you hear me?

379
00:33:55,000 --> 00:34:00,166
And at home, fellow comrades, who are
exploited and eaten away by the man.

380
00:34:00,250 --> 00:34:03,166
People all over the world
who are done with the scum

381
00:34:03,250 --> 00:34:08,375
who spit us and our friends out
onto the street: Can you hear me?

382
00:34:18,250 --> 00:34:22,458
And how about you,
you dirty filthy capitalist?

383
00:34:22,541 --> 00:34:28,291
You and all your friends, bankers
and politicians who think they're safe

384
00:34:28,375 --> 00:34:33,541
from a small innocent girl like me
and the fucking bricks I carry with me.

385
00:34:33,625 --> 00:34:35,583
Can you hear me?

386
00:34:37,208 --> 00:34:39,375
I hope so, for your sake.

387
00:34:39,458 --> 00:34:46,583
If not today, then tomorrow or the day
after. You shall certainly hear us roar.

388
00:34:46,666 --> 00:34:51,875
- No habitation.
- No coronation.

389
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:29,125
It has come to my attention that you're
in the market for two kilos of uncut coke.

390
00:35:29,208 --> 00:35:31,958
- Where's Marcel?
- That's right. Where's Marcel?

391
00:35:33,083 --> 00:35:36,041
- I don't know a Marcel.
- Marcel the Belgian.

392
00:35:36,125 --> 00:35:41,625
- We're supposed to do business with him.
- Oh, that Marcel. He's unable to attend.

393
00:35:41,708 --> 00:35:44,583
Fucking bullshit.
Who let this fascist pig in?

394
00:35:44,666 --> 00:35:47,166
Maybe your friend should shut it, Jesse.

395
00:35:47,250 --> 00:35:50,708
- Shut the fuck up.
- Listen, I'm just here to do business.

396
00:35:50,791 --> 00:35:54,375
You can't fight the riot police
doped up on heroin.

397
00:35:54,458 --> 00:36:00,125
You have a war to win. And I happen
to have the magic potion to do just that.

398
00:36:00,208 --> 00:36:02,291
- Do you want it or not?
- No, Jesse.

399
00:36:02,375 --> 00:36:04,375
You won't get it from Marcel.

400
00:36:07,291 --> 00:36:10,250
Finally, at least someone
is using their brains.

401
00:36:13,250 --> 00:36:17,583
Do you think I'll stand out carrying
all that cash in public like that?

402
00:36:18,583 --> 00:36:20,333
Maybe you should fetch me a bag.

403
00:36:21,666 --> 00:36:23,416
Do we have a bag?

404
00:36:28,750 --> 00:36:31,708
- Oh, hey.
- Don't "hey" me.

405
00:36:31,791 --> 00:36:33,791
Did Tonnie send you?

406
00:36:37,375 --> 00:36:40,791
- Pien. What the fuck is this?
- Nothing.

407
00:36:40,875 --> 00:36:44,875
- Who's that?
- This is Jurre, a friend of mine.

408
00:36:46,458 --> 00:36:49,041
- How'd you get inside?
- I let him in.

409
00:36:49,125 --> 00:36:51,625
Do I need permission for that as well?

410
00:36:55,375 --> 00:36:58,833
Can you leave us alone?
We were in the middle of something.

411
00:37:05,541 --> 00:37:09,041
Leave me alone, okay?
We don't like your kind around here.

412
00:37:14,708 --> 00:37:16,125
- Drugs?
- Coke.

413
00:37:16,208 --> 00:37:17,666
3 DAYS UNTIL THE CORONATION

414
00:37:17,750 --> 00:37:20,583
And how much coke
are we talking about?

415
00:37:20,666 --> 00:37:23,166
- Two kilos.
- Two kilos?

416
00:37:23,250 --> 00:37:26,625
And how did these squatters
get all that cash, Jurre?

417
00:37:27,708 --> 00:37:30,166
- There's a lot of them.
- Look out the window.

418
00:37:30,250 --> 00:37:33,958
This is Amsterdam.
Everyone's doing heroin.

419
00:37:34,041 --> 00:37:38,583
The only coke here are a few packages
that come in by truck from Antwerp.

420
00:37:38,666 --> 00:37:40,791
Maybe the Belgian police can help us.

421
00:37:40,875 --> 00:37:45,458
- They spoke about a Belgian, Marcel.
- I think we have better things to do.

422
00:37:45,541 --> 00:37:49,583
Jurre, feel free to contact the Belgians,
but do it fast.

423
00:37:49,666 --> 00:37:52,666
Drugs are the least of our problems.

424
00:37:52,750 --> 00:37:58,375
We have a coronation in three days
and an unidentified dead informant

425
00:37:58,458 --> 00:38:01,916
with serious indications
there's going to be an attack.

426
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:04,791
Perhaps we should focus more on that.

427
00:38:05,625 --> 00:38:10,250
- Why don't we arrest the squatters?
- Drugs are a daily problem in Amsterdam.

428
00:38:10,333 --> 00:38:13,041
In three days someone might
blow up the New Church.

429
00:38:13,125 --> 00:38:14,958
But I saw them with the coke.

430
00:38:15,041 --> 00:38:18,791
Three more days. We'll go
on your drug hunt after that, okay?

431
00:38:21,666 --> 00:38:23,750
Man, oh man.

432
00:38:27,666 --> 00:38:30,166
- You missed a spot.
- Excuse me?

433
00:38:30,250 --> 00:38:35,250
- It's still black.
- I must've washed my hair five times.

434
00:38:35,333 --> 00:38:39,458
It's crap dye. Once it's fully dried,
it'll takes weeks to wash out.

435
00:38:39,541 --> 00:38:42,375
- I think it suits him.
- He looks like a guinea pig.

436
00:38:57,375 --> 00:38:59,458
He's right, though.

437
00:38:59,541 --> 00:39:02,541
- Shame I didn't see it immediately.
- What?

438
00:39:05,291 --> 00:39:09,875
The dye is partially washed away.
Wounds on the scalp.

439
00:39:12,583 --> 00:39:15,375
The mohawk was made posthumously.

440
00:39:16,375 --> 00:39:21,333
- Who's trying to mislead us?
- Oh yeah, and who the fuck is this then?

441
00:39:25,250 --> 00:39:26,833
Marcel.

442
00:39:26,916 --> 00:39:28,916
The Belgian.

443
00:39:32,083 --> 00:39:34,083
I'm starting to like the new guy.

444
00:39:34,166 --> 00:39:37,708
If he keeps this up, I think
he'll end up on your table soon.

445
00:39:39,125 --> 00:39:41,541
Can you tell us who this is?

446
00:40:09,250 --> 00:40:11,500
And? Is it true?

447
00:40:13,083 --> 00:40:14,375
What?

448
00:40:14,458 --> 00:40:18,500
That within an hour you can get
that photo anywhere in the world.

449
00:40:20,083 --> 00:40:23,708
- Within a half an hour even.
- No way.

450
00:40:23,791 --> 00:40:28,583
- I can't bring it to Antwerp that quickly.
- Antwerp. Never been there.

451
00:40:28,666 --> 00:40:30,291
Me neither.

452
00:40:30,375 --> 00:40:32,708
Hey, Colombo. Hey, honey.

453
00:40:34,125 --> 00:40:37,375
- Explain it to me sometime.
- Sure.

454
00:40:39,541 --> 00:40:41,750
Listen, lesson eight:

455
00:40:41,833 --> 00:40:45,833
Don't dip your pen in company ink.
It never ends well. Trust me.

456
00:40:45,916 --> 00:40:50,875
Say what you like about those squatters,
but they can take a beating.

457
00:40:51,833 --> 00:40:53,750
Fucking annoying.

458
00:40:55,708 --> 00:40:59,000
You're going to put
that shirt on expenses.

459
00:40:59,083 --> 00:41:01,375
Baks. It's for you guys.

460
00:41:04,083 --> 00:41:05,708
Baks speaking.

461
00:41:07,041 --> 00:41:10,208
Thanks. Anonymous tip.

462
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:27,166
Baks.

463
00:41:29,125 --> 00:41:30,958
Well, fuck me sideways.

464
00:41:32,125 --> 00:41:36,666
- I really had to beat it out of them.
- Oh, I thought it was an anonymous tip.

465
00:41:36,750 --> 00:41:42,083
- No, it was good detective work.
- What the hell are you doing?

466
00:41:43,583 --> 00:41:46,583
- Just look at all that. Crazy.
- Fucking nut jobs.

467
00:41:54,250 --> 00:41:57,541
- Hello?
- Mertens, Antwerp Police. Jurre DeKok?

468
00:41:57,625 --> 00:41:59,666
- Speaking.
- I received your fax,

469
00:41:59,750 --> 00:42:02,666
but it's just one big blur.

470
00:42:02,750 --> 00:42:06,791
- You can't be serious.
- I can't make head or tail of it.

471
00:42:06,875 --> 00:42:09,416
- Okay, we'll come over in person.
- Today?

472
00:42:09,500 --> 00:42:10,750
- Yes.
- I'll see you.

473
00:42:10,833 --> 00:42:12,625
Bye.

474
00:42:14,708 --> 00:42:19,416
What a fucking long drive.
I hate Belgium, you know that?

475
00:42:20,958 --> 00:42:25,708
- You hate everything outside Amsterdam.
- Me? Not true.

476
00:42:25,791 --> 00:42:29,291
Anything beyond Marnixkade
feels like a day trip for me.

477
00:42:31,458 --> 00:42:34,500
- What's Pien studying anyway?
- Who, my Pien?

478
00:42:34,583 --> 00:42:36,500
- Yes.
- No idea.

479
00:42:38,333 --> 00:42:40,958
Politics or something. Why?

480
00:42:42,541 --> 00:42:43,916
No reason.

481
00:42:45,708 --> 00:42:48,291
Jurre, Pien's not for you. Understood?

482
00:42:48,375 --> 00:42:52,125
I know. Of course.
I didn't mean it like that.

483
00:42:53,041 --> 00:42:56,000
I was just curious.

484
00:42:56,083 --> 00:42:59,041
Be curious about some other girl,
but not Pien.

485
00:42:59,125 --> 00:43:02,458
We need to find you a chick,
that's what it is.

486
00:43:02,541 --> 00:43:05,375
- No, I've had enough of women lately.
- Really?

487
00:43:05,458 --> 00:43:08,291
Then we definitely
need to find you a chick.

488
00:43:09,250 --> 00:43:10,750
Nice one.

489
00:43:15,750 --> 00:43:18,666
Corneel? The Dutchies.

490
00:43:20,625 --> 00:43:22,958
- Tonnie Montijn.
- Corneel Mertens.

491
00:43:23,041 --> 00:43:26,458
- Jurre DeKok.
- Ah, yes. Well…

492
00:43:26,541 --> 00:43:29,708
Sorry we had to meet here.

493
00:43:29,791 --> 00:43:34,291
Probably the handy work of Flanders'
biggest criminal, Seppe Brunae.

494
00:43:34,375 --> 00:43:37,166
Absolutely ruthless.

495
00:43:37,250 --> 00:43:41,333
A total lack of respect or morals.

496
00:43:42,166 --> 00:43:43,791
Cocaine.

497
00:43:43,875 --> 00:43:46,666
Be warned. It's coming your way, too.

498
00:43:46,750 --> 00:43:49,833
Anyway, the reason we're here is this.

499
00:43:49,916 --> 00:43:52,625
Maybe imagine him without the mohawk.

500
00:43:52,708 --> 00:43:56,458
I don't need to. That is Marcel Pittoors.

501
00:43:57,375 --> 00:44:00,125
Married to Seppe Brunae's niece.

502
00:44:04,291 --> 00:44:06,083
And where can we find her?

503
00:44:14,541 --> 00:44:16,541
Good night.

504
00:44:16,625 --> 00:44:17,875
Evening.

505
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:21,083
Good evening.

506
00:44:22,291 --> 00:44:24,125
Two jars, please.

507
00:44:24,208 --> 00:44:26,041
Two what?

508
00:44:26,833 --> 00:44:28,041
Two beers.

509
00:44:32,125 --> 00:44:35,333
- They says "pints" here.
- Pints… Fuck off.

510
00:44:36,250 --> 00:44:38,625
I prefer Café Lowietje, right?

511
00:44:40,125 --> 00:44:41,791
Thank you kindly.

512
00:44:50,208 --> 00:44:52,041
Excuse me.

513
00:44:53,250 --> 00:44:56,291
We're looking for Marcel Pittoors.

514
00:44:57,791 --> 00:44:59,500
Don't know him.

515
00:45:01,250 --> 00:45:04,666
We understood he was a friend of yours.

516
00:45:07,791 --> 00:45:09,958
I don't know any Marcel.

517
00:45:12,208 --> 00:45:15,125
And we're about to close.
That's 40 francs, please.

518
00:45:15,208 --> 00:45:16,958
- Sorry?
- Can't we finish our…

519
00:45:17,041 --> 00:45:19,625
I'm not asking again.

520
00:45:19,708 --> 00:45:21,250
Why are we leaving?

521
00:45:23,708 --> 00:45:25,625
How do you think it went?

522
00:45:29,541 --> 00:45:31,250
Marcel is dead.

523
00:45:32,708 --> 00:45:34,250
What?

524
00:45:35,333 --> 00:45:39,083
They found his body in a canal,
all blue and bloated.

525
00:45:39,166 --> 00:45:41,666
- He's lying.
- Unfortunately not.

526
00:45:41,750 --> 00:45:45,166
He'd been in the water for a week
so the rats got to him, too.

527
00:45:45,250 --> 00:45:48,375
Right, DeKok?
His dick was hanging by a tiny thread.

528
00:45:48,458 --> 00:45:51,000
Fortunately you didn't know him.

529
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:53,666
Is this really necessary?

530
00:45:53,750 --> 00:45:56,750
- Let's go inside.
- Sometimes you have to push a little.

531
00:45:58,833 --> 00:46:03,416
He was sent ahead to Amsterdam.

532
00:46:05,875 --> 00:46:10,666
Normally he would sell
half a kilo a week,

533
00:46:10,750 --> 00:46:16,250
but Seppe wanted to find a new buyer.
For two kilos.

534
00:46:17,333 --> 00:46:20,375
- And then another 50.
- 50 kilos?

535
00:46:21,833 --> 00:46:24,750
- To whom?
- Those squatters.

536
00:46:27,125 --> 00:46:29,166
Do you have any names for us?

537
00:46:31,291 --> 00:46:35,500
- I'm really sorry. Thanks anyway.
- Wait a moment.

538
00:46:36,916 --> 00:46:39,416
Who was the previous buyer?

539
00:46:40,458 --> 00:46:42,375
Bob.

540
00:46:42,458 --> 00:46:47,750
- Bob who?
- Bob… I don't know. Oh, Seppe.

541
00:46:50,416 --> 00:46:52,833
Good evening.

542
00:46:52,916 --> 00:46:57,000
- Good evening.
- And who are the pretty ladies?

543
00:46:57,083 --> 00:46:59,958
- None of your fucking business.
- Ay.

544
00:47:04,333 --> 00:47:07,333
I only hope you weren't sent here
by Bob Donkers.

545
00:47:21,833 --> 00:47:23,708
And what if we were?

546
00:47:30,625 --> 00:47:32,833
What if we were?

547
00:47:37,583 --> 00:47:41,166
Wow.
You're a long way from home, aren't you?

548
00:47:45,291 --> 00:47:48,708
Kitty, my guys are thirsty.

549
00:47:53,041 --> 00:47:54,791
Let's go.

550
00:48:06,666 --> 00:48:09,541
- Who were those guys?
- Marcel is dead.

551
00:48:09,625 --> 00:48:13,666
- Come again?
- Marcel is dead.

552
00:48:15,166 --> 00:48:17,416
Who's Bob Donkers?

553
00:48:18,375 --> 00:48:22,875
What is it you want to hear?
What is it you want to hear, Jurre?

554
00:48:22,958 --> 00:48:28,500
That you were right about Marcel
and the drugs? Well done, well done.

555
00:48:28,583 --> 00:48:32,166
You did a great job, alright?
Now we know who the guy is.

556
00:48:32,250 --> 00:48:36,333
Our two days are up. Done. Finished.

557
00:48:36,416 --> 00:48:40,000
- Then what do you suggest?
- I suggest we warn the chief.

558
00:48:41,250 --> 00:48:42,708
Okay.

559
00:48:46,458 --> 00:48:48,416
Who is Bob Donkers?

560
00:48:50,333 --> 00:48:53,291
2 DAYS UNTIL THE CORONATION

561
00:48:59,125 --> 00:49:02,541
Hi, Barrie.
Still paying off your debts?

562
00:49:02,625 --> 00:49:04,208
Old habits, you know?

563
00:49:04,291 --> 00:49:07,291
- I need new shoes.
- Sure, for your new boyfriend?

564
00:49:07,375 --> 00:49:10,166
No, for your mother. Alright?

565
00:49:10,250 --> 00:49:12,958
Barrie, don't be a dick.
Let the boys in.

566
00:49:13,666 --> 00:49:16,333
Heavy security. For a shoe store.

567
00:49:18,291 --> 00:49:19,541
Hello.

568
00:49:19,625 --> 00:49:22,708
He needs to live up to his name,
Barrie Kade.

569
00:49:22,791 --> 00:49:25,333
- Take a seat, madam.
- Thank you.

570
00:49:25,416 --> 00:49:28,750
I don't know you.
I'm Bob Donkers, nice to meet you.

571
00:49:29,541 --> 00:49:31,125
Jurre DeKok.

572
00:49:31,208 --> 00:49:34,458
Support soles
for the friendly neighborhood cop?

573
00:49:34,541 --> 00:49:36,208
Funny.

574
00:49:37,250 --> 00:49:41,958
- What do you think, Mrs Van Dijk?
- I think they're quite handsome.

575
00:49:42,041 --> 00:49:45,708
I couldn't agree more.
Put your foot up here.

576
00:49:50,458 --> 00:49:52,083
Lift it up a little bit.

577
00:49:55,500 --> 00:49:57,125
Well…

578
00:49:59,708 --> 00:50:01,583
Go ahead.

579
00:50:01,666 --> 00:50:05,750
We're here to ask some questions
about Marcel Pittoors.

580
00:50:06,833 --> 00:50:09,666
Did you hear that Fat Nelis died?

581
00:50:10,500 --> 00:50:13,000
The guy with no teeth? That's rough.

582
00:50:13,083 --> 00:50:16,250
He was a moonlighter on Kinkerstraat.
Toothless Fat Nelis.

583
00:50:16,333 --> 00:50:19,166
- Ton and I grew up together.
- Do you have to tell this story?

584
00:50:19,250 --> 00:50:24,250
It's a good story. I used to fuck around
with my mates on Kinkerstraat.

585
00:50:24,333 --> 00:50:27,708
Nasty little fuckers, we were.
Not Ton, though.

586
00:50:27,791 --> 00:50:31,625
Ton's dad used to smack him about
and he wanted to join the police.

587
00:50:31,708 --> 00:50:35,666
Right, Ton?
But anyway, Fat Nelis approaches us

588
00:50:35,750 --> 00:50:38,708
and he says to us:

589
00:50:43,125 --> 00:50:45,916
"What?" He had no teeth,
so I couldn't understand him.

590
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:49,791
He says: "I'll pay you 12 grand
if you kill my wife."

591
00:50:49,875 --> 00:50:54,708
But what does this fucking idiot do?
He gives us the money up front.

592
00:50:54,791 --> 00:50:57,833
All of it. In one go.

593
00:50:57,916 --> 00:51:00,541
Now, you guess what we did next.

594
00:51:01,208 --> 00:51:04,833
- You kept the money.
- No, of course not!

595
00:51:04,916 --> 00:51:08,041
What kind of cop are you?
We called the police.

596
00:51:08,125 --> 00:51:10,416
Who is Marcel Pittoors?

597
00:51:14,666 --> 00:51:18,500
We found him dead in a canal last week.

598
00:51:20,416 --> 00:51:25,083
He was on his way here
to deliver two kilos of coke.

599
00:51:25,166 --> 00:51:28,166
Put your foot on here, madam.

600
00:51:28,250 --> 00:51:30,375
Okay, well…

601
00:51:30,458 --> 00:51:32,791
Ask your question.

602
00:51:32,875 --> 00:51:36,333
We want to know if the Belgians
tried to cut you out.

603
00:51:38,750 --> 00:51:41,125
It's Jurre, right?

604
00:51:42,083 --> 00:51:43,250
Yes.

605
00:51:43,333 --> 00:51:48,583
I'm sorry, Jurre, I have absolutely
no idea what you're talking about.

606
00:51:48,666 --> 00:51:51,083
I'm an orthopedist.
I own a few buildings.

607
00:51:51,166 --> 00:51:54,750
Which is tough nowadays because
you guys can't control the squatters.

608
00:51:54,833 --> 00:51:58,000
But, hey, who am I to tell you
how to do your job?

609
00:51:58,083 --> 00:52:01,625
I'm sure you have the situation
under control. Right, Ton?

610
00:52:01,708 --> 00:52:04,458
- Absolutely, Bob.
- Yeah.

611
00:52:05,916 --> 00:52:11,291
The other foot please, Mrs Van Dijk.
That's right, very good.

612
00:52:11,375 --> 00:52:14,208
Come on. Let's go.

613
00:52:18,166 --> 00:52:22,000
- What happened to the woman?
- Fat Nelis' old lady?

614
00:52:22,083 --> 00:52:23,541
Yes.

615
00:52:24,458 --> 00:52:27,166
They found her in the bathtub,
cut to pieces.

616
00:52:27,250 --> 00:52:29,375
Let's go, we're done here.

617
00:52:29,458 --> 00:52:31,708
Could you stand up for a moment?

618
00:52:32,958 --> 00:52:35,500
Yes, I'm not quite sure.

619
00:52:37,333 --> 00:52:40,000
- Sorry, guys. Hey, Barrie.
- Hey, sport.

620
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:45,666
Hey, where were you? You can't
keep the chief waiting like that.

621
00:52:45,750 --> 00:52:47,750
Calm down, darling.

622
00:52:47,833 --> 00:52:49,833
Look, unbelievable.

623
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:53,583
Boys, come in. Sit down.

624
00:52:53,666 --> 00:53:00,166
So, Tonnie. The squatter in the canal.
Any progress?

625
00:53:00,250 --> 00:53:04,625
Unfortunately not, Chief. We don't know
jack about the New Church, either.

626
00:53:04,708 --> 00:53:08,041
- We hit a dead end in Belgium, too.
- Excuse me, Chief.

627
00:53:08,125 --> 00:53:11,250
I think we found
some major leads in Belgium.

628
00:53:11,333 --> 00:53:16,000
Plus, we just spoke to Bob Donkers.
And I strongly feel we're being misled.

629
00:53:16,083 --> 00:53:19,208
- I would…
- Sure, but I need to prioritize things.

630
00:53:19,291 --> 00:53:24,875
Is Belgium a threat to the coronation?
No. Belgium is all about drugs.

631
00:53:24,958 --> 00:53:30,833
That Semtex that was found in the squat
clearly indicates that there are plans

632
00:53:30,916 --> 00:53:34,541
to blow up our royal family.

633
00:53:40,208 --> 00:53:42,875
I spoke to the mayor.

634
00:53:42,958 --> 00:53:46,666
He's very sensitive about Amsterdam's
reputation as a tolerant city.

635
00:53:46,750 --> 00:53:49,750
Where everyone has a right
to demonstrate.

636
00:53:50,500 --> 00:53:54,708
But if you think
the coronation is in danger,

637
00:53:54,791 --> 00:53:59,125
then we can talk
about additional, temporary…

638
00:54:00,250 --> 00:54:01,875
measures.

639
00:54:05,416 --> 00:54:08,250
- Do we have a problem, Jurre?
- What are you doing?

640
00:54:08,333 --> 00:54:12,541
Me? Listen, I know it's all new
and exciting in the big city for you,

641
00:54:12,625 --> 00:54:16,666
but the coronation is in two days.
Do you have any idea what's going down?

642
00:54:16,750 --> 00:54:18,333
- No.
- That's what I mean.

643
00:54:18,416 --> 00:54:22,041
It's not our job. This shit is above us.
Above our pay grades.

644
00:54:22,125 --> 00:54:26,083
- "Vigilance while they rest."
- Let it go, will you?

645
00:54:26,166 --> 00:54:29,916
- Are you even paying attention?
- What do you mean?

646
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:33,958
Let's get one thing straight. If all hell
breaks loose with those squatters,

647
00:54:34,041 --> 00:54:36,500
I rely on you to have my back.

648
00:54:39,333 --> 00:54:42,125
Children, can I have your attention?

649
00:54:42,208 --> 00:54:48,208
The mayor has given us a green light
to handle things a little differently.

650
00:54:48,291 --> 00:54:52,333
It's time to tighten the thumb screws.

651
00:54:53,333 --> 00:55:00,041
So if one out of every four squatters
accidentally walks into a baton,

652
00:55:00,125 --> 00:55:03,291
you won't hear any complaints from me.

653
00:55:03,375 --> 00:55:08,041
We will surely get in trouble for that,
but that will be after the coronation.

654
00:55:08,125 --> 00:55:13,041
The plan is to raid all the smaller squats
simultaneously today.

655
00:55:13,125 --> 00:55:18,916
And early tomorrow morning
we will storm the squatters' HQ,

656
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:23,416
culminating in a raid on Fort Keizer.
Thank you.

657
00:55:26,333 --> 00:55:28,083
Montijn speaking.
It's Jurre.

658
00:55:28,166 --> 00:55:31,125
Oh, hi, Jurre. How nice.
But Tonnie's not in.

659
00:55:31,208 --> 00:55:34,083
I'm not calling for Tonnie,
I'm calling for Pien.

660
00:55:34,166 --> 00:55:35,916
- Pien?
- Yes.

661
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:41,458
She's at the university. No wait, she said
she was going to sleep over somewhere.

662
00:55:41,541 --> 00:55:46,500
- What's wrong?
- No, it's nothing. Bye.

663
00:55:46,583 --> 00:55:48,625
Oh, okay. Bye.

664
00:55:58,458 --> 00:56:01,750
- Pien. Where's Pien?
- Over there.

665
00:56:04,791 --> 00:56:06,250
Hold this.

666
00:56:07,041 --> 00:56:09,083
- I need bandages!
- Pien.

667
00:56:10,166 --> 00:56:13,666
- What the fuck are you doing here?
- I've come to warn you.

668
00:56:13,750 --> 00:56:17,125
- They'll kill you if they see you.
- You have to get out.

669
00:56:17,208 --> 00:56:18,791
Pien.

670
00:56:18,875 --> 00:56:20,500
Go home.

671
00:56:21,291 --> 00:56:25,250
- What happened?
- The police are going nuts.

672
00:56:25,333 --> 00:56:27,583
Thierry! He's not responding.

673
00:56:29,250 --> 00:56:32,125
- Fuck!
- He's bleeding too heavily.

674
00:56:32,208 --> 00:56:33,541
Move aside!

675
00:56:34,958 --> 00:56:37,750
- He's losing too much blood.
- Has anyone got any coins?

676
00:56:37,833 --> 00:56:39,875
He's not responding. Thierry!

677
00:56:48,250 --> 00:56:50,666
- Coins.
- Jesse.

678
00:56:50,750 --> 00:56:53,291
- Coins.
- Yes, here.

679
00:56:56,125 --> 00:56:59,208
Hold his chin up. At right-angles.

680
00:56:59,291 --> 00:57:01,666
- Thierry!
- Mouth-to-mouth.

681
00:57:01,750 --> 00:57:03,333
Pinch his nose.

682
00:57:04,583 --> 00:57:06,583
Okay, out of the way, move!

683
00:57:09,375 --> 00:57:11,208
Do it again.

684
00:57:11,291 --> 00:57:14,208
I can't feel a thing. No pulse, nothing.

685
00:57:14,291 --> 00:57:16,666
Call an ambulance! Move!

686
00:57:24,416 --> 00:57:28,708
Get off him. Breathe.
Keep his mouth open. Head straight.

687
00:57:46,208 --> 00:57:53,125
Amsterdam is preparing for
Queen Beatrix's inauguration ceremony.

688
00:57:53,208 --> 00:57:59,041
The first guests arrived yesterday.
Today, the royal guests will arrive.

689
00:58:00,333 --> 00:58:05,500
Prince Charles, the British crown prince
and most important guest arrived…

690
00:58:05,583 --> 00:58:06,958
Jesse?

691
00:58:07,750 --> 00:58:10,291
- Is Thierry okay?
- Thierry is alive.

692
00:58:10,375 --> 00:58:11,833
- And you?
- Me too.

693
00:58:16,958 --> 00:58:21,750
- What the fuck is that pig doing here?
- He saved Thierry's life.

694
00:58:21,833 --> 00:58:25,500
- I don't give a shit. Fuck off, you pig.
- Calm down.

695
00:58:25,583 --> 00:58:27,333
Knock it off.

696
00:58:35,583 --> 00:58:39,541
Right now there are riots
between protesters and the police.

697
00:58:39,625 --> 00:58:42,375
- You need to get out of here.
- No, I'm not leaving.

698
00:58:42,458 --> 00:58:47,250
It'll only get worse. Tomorrow, there
will be 1,000 riot police on the doorstep.

699
00:58:48,291 --> 00:58:51,250
And what about these people
and the children?

700
00:58:51,333 --> 00:58:54,583
- I don't know.
- Where will they all live?

701
00:58:54,666 --> 00:58:58,083
I don't know.
Somewhere where there are homes.

702
00:58:58,166 --> 00:59:02,291
Outside the city?
Tucked away in the Bijlmer somewhere?

703
00:59:02,375 --> 00:59:07,083
- Is the city only for the rich?
- No. Well…

704
00:59:09,083 --> 00:59:10,291
No.

705
00:59:10,375 --> 00:59:15,375
If all these people decided
to move to Urk tomorrow,

706
00:59:15,458 --> 00:59:18,833
and the rent goes up by 500 per cent,
overnight,

707
00:59:18,916 --> 00:59:22,041
- will you all leave?
- I understand it's hard.

708
00:59:22,125 --> 00:59:25,333
But I just don't believe
violence is the solution.

709
00:59:26,291 --> 00:59:30,333
Tell your boss that. You were saying
something about 1,000 riot police.

710
00:59:30,416 --> 00:59:33,375
The police are only trying
to keep it livable.

711
00:59:33,458 --> 00:59:37,333
- Livable? Don't you have eyes?
- Don't you?

712
00:59:40,708 --> 00:59:44,458
Why are you being so difficult?
I'm just trying to help.

713
00:59:44,541 --> 00:59:46,083
I know.

714
00:59:47,125 --> 00:59:48,583
Honestly, Jurre.

715
00:59:49,875 --> 00:59:51,250
Thank you.

716
00:59:52,166 --> 00:59:55,083
Is there anyone more noble
in this world than you?

717
00:59:56,916 --> 01:00:01,083
- Is that how you want to play it?
- Yes, or else?

718
01:00:01,166 --> 01:00:02,666
You're off again?

719
01:00:05,125 --> 01:00:09,333
Fine. I'll see you
and your 1,000 friends tomorrow.

720
01:00:47,833 --> 01:00:49,416
Where did you learn that?

721
01:00:51,208 --> 01:00:52,291
What?

722
01:00:54,166 --> 01:00:55,916
How to do CPR.

723
01:00:58,833 --> 01:01:00,083
At sea.

724
01:01:03,708 --> 01:01:07,041
And now the Red Light District?

725
01:01:14,250 --> 01:01:17,250
I wanted to work somewhere
where I could really help people.

726
01:01:20,500 --> 01:01:24,375
Oh, Lord. You're one of those.

727
01:01:27,041 --> 01:01:31,208
- Your brother said exactly the same.
- Tonnie is a relic.

728
01:01:32,708 --> 01:01:38,000
He still thinks this is the sixties
and they're all petty criminals.

729
01:01:39,583 --> 01:01:45,125
If my mother hadn't made him go to school,
he'd have ended up just like his friends.

730
01:01:47,500 --> 01:01:49,250
What friends?

731
01:01:50,958 --> 01:01:55,541
People like Buffoon,
Shoeshine Bob, Steel Jan.

732
01:01:57,875 --> 01:01:59,666
Bob Donkers?

733
01:02:04,333 --> 01:02:05,916
Were they friends?

734
01:02:06,833 --> 01:02:09,458
Yes, very close.

735
01:02:10,708 --> 01:02:12,500
They still are.

736
01:02:31,333 --> 01:02:34,958
Please make sure
you're out of here on time tomorrow.

737
01:02:36,583 --> 01:02:38,125
Fine, Jurre.

738
01:02:39,916 --> 01:02:43,500
AMSTERDAM, 29 APRIL 1980
ONE DAY UNTIL THE CORONATION

739
01:02:48,916 --> 01:02:52,916
Alright, the plan is clear.
The batons go in first, then you.

740
01:02:53,000 --> 01:02:56,458
We arrest all of them,
but we want those three in particular.

741
01:02:56,541 --> 01:02:58,333
This is the police.

742
01:02:58,416 --> 01:03:03,833
Please come outside
or we will resort to action.

743
01:03:29,875 --> 01:03:31,666
No, no, no.

744
01:03:33,083 --> 01:03:34,250
Pien?

745
01:03:41,500 --> 01:03:42,875
Hello?

746
01:03:53,625 --> 01:03:54,833
No.

747
01:03:56,500 --> 01:03:58,791
Stop.

748
01:04:00,125 --> 01:04:01,291
Stop.

749
01:04:03,750 --> 01:04:05,916
Let me through.

750
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:08,208
Let him through, leave him alone.

751
01:04:10,416 --> 01:04:14,416
They've all left, there is nobody there.
They have all jumped ship.

752
01:04:14,500 --> 01:04:18,416
- What?
- Somebody ratted. There's no one inside.

753
01:04:37,750 --> 01:04:39,291
Oh, my God.

754
01:04:50,958 --> 01:04:55,500
- How the fuck did they know?
- They left last night. I don't know.

755
01:04:58,000 --> 01:05:00,166
- Where were you?
- Nice timing, Jurre.

756
01:05:00,250 --> 01:05:03,458
- We waited for you.
- Is there something I should know?

757
01:05:08,791 --> 01:05:11,291
Shut the fuck up, all of you.

758
01:05:11,375 --> 01:05:14,958
- Repeat. Over.
- Back-up needed on Rapenburg.

759
01:05:15,041 --> 01:05:17,916
To Rapenburg. Move it.

760
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:19,791
Oh, fuck off.

761
01:05:29,833 --> 01:05:32,208
How did you get that blood
on your shirt?

762
01:05:36,083 --> 01:05:37,666
Bob is quite something.

763
01:05:38,500 --> 01:05:40,708
I didn't know you were such good friends.

764
01:05:51,083 --> 01:05:54,958
Don't get in the way out there
or you might get hit with a nightstick.

765
01:06:13,416 --> 01:06:14,791
Stand your ground.

766
01:06:16,083 --> 01:06:17,916
Don't break formation.

767
01:06:26,708 --> 01:06:28,333
Molotov.

768
01:06:31,375 --> 01:06:32,875
Stay close together.

769
01:06:34,041 --> 01:06:36,000
Maintain formation.

770
01:06:36,083 --> 01:06:37,833
Keep walking.

771
01:06:39,166 --> 01:06:41,416
There's still someone in the van.

772
01:06:49,833 --> 01:06:52,291
- We have to.
- Let's go.

773
01:06:56,916 --> 01:06:59,375
Move it!
There's somebody in here.

774
01:07:10,291 --> 01:07:13,208
- Open it, goddammit.
- It's jammed.

775
01:07:16,541 --> 01:07:18,625
The side door.

776
01:07:20,208 --> 01:07:22,000
Here, man.

777
01:07:22,083 --> 01:07:23,291
You okay?

778
01:07:46,250 --> 01:07:47,250
You okay?

779
01:07:59,041 --> 01:08:00,208
We have to get out.

780
01:08:00,291 --> 01:08:04,416
We have to get out.
Can you hear me?

781
01:08:04,500 --> 01:08:06,291
- Help me.
- Again.

782
01:08:19,000 --> 01:08:20,500
Hold it open.

783
01:08:27,541 --> 01:08:28,833
Pien.

784
01:08:34,833 --> 01:08:37,416
I saw Pien. I saw my sister.

785
01:08:37,500 --> 01:08:39,000
Quick, get out of here.

786
01:08:40,416 --> 01:08:41,833
Hold this.

787
01:08:43,500 --> 01:08:44,833
Pien!

788
01:08:54,750 --> 01:08:56,708
Wait.

789
01:08:59,458 --> 01:09:01,041
Come here.

790
01:09:03,083 --> 01:09:04,666
This way.

791
01:09:13,041 --> 01:09:14,750
Fucking traitor.

792
01:09:20,125 --> 01:09:23,666
Pien! No!

793
01:10:02,875 --> 01:10:06,583
No, stay with me. Ambulance!

794
01:10:08,583 --> 01:10:11,416
Ambulance!

795
01:10:29,125 --> 01:10:33,708
That's enough, sit down.
Go and argue somewhere else. Sit down.

796
01:10:33,791 --> 01:10:35,583
- Listen to me.
- Jurre, please.

797
01:10:35,666 --> 01:10:36,791
Tonnie.

798
01:10:40,291 --> 01:10:43,583
- I have to…
- This is about my sister.

799
01:10:46,208 --> 01:10:48,958
- Can you hold on to this for me?
- Sure.

800
01:10:51,791 --> 01:10:53,708
Well, look who's here.

801
01:11:06,583 --> 01:11:10,500
Every hand you lay on me
means a day less in jail for me.

802
01:11:19,041 --> 01:11:23,000
- What was she doing there?
- Who are you talking about?

803
01:11:24,708 --> 01:11:29,625
- You know exactly who I mean.
- Oh, Pien?

804
01:11:29,708 --> 01:11:33,375
Our warrior in fishnet tights.

805
01:11:33,458 --> 01:11:36,875
- She couldn't stay away.
- A dirty whore is who you are.

806
01:11:38,208 --> 01:11:39,291
How is she?

807
01:11:42,875 --> 01:11:46,625
- He's going to beat her to death.
- I hope he does.

808
01:11:50,125 --> 01:11:52,000
Take it easy, cowboy.

809
01:11:53,625 --> 01:11:56,000
Do you always treat the ladies
like this?

810
01:11:58,708 --> 01:12:00,333
Does it give you a boner?

811
01:12:14,583 --> 01:12:18,000
I'm sorry we had to hurt her a bit.

812
01:12:19,416 --> 01:12:20,958
What did you say?

813
01:12:22,541 --> 01:12:27,416
Oh, man.
You wouldn't accept it if one…

814
01:12:28,958 --> 01:12:32,541
if one of my men was fucking your wife.

815
01:12:38,125 --> 01:12:41,000
That kind of behavior
gets in the way of the cause.

816
01:12:44,208 --> 01:12:50,416
No matter how well she conveyed
her idealism, she was fucking the enemy.

817
01:12:50,500 --> 01:12:54,041
And that makes her a dirty kraut whore.

818
01:13:06,708 --> 01:13:08,208
I was actually impressed…

819
01:13:10,250 --> 01:13:12,041
by your tolerance.

820
01:13:13,500 --> 01:13:16,791
- What's that?
- That you let him have his way with her.

821
01:13:16,875 --> 01:13:19,875
- With your little sister.
- Sorry?

822
01:13:22,083 --> 01:13:28,041
We could evacuate the Keizer squat on time
and leave you a beautiful surprise behind

823
01:13:28,125 --> 01:13:33,000
because he had to follow his dick
and stick it into your sister.

824
01:13:33,083 --> 01:13:36,833
- What did you say?
- Then again, with a name like that.

825
01:13:38,000 --> 01:13:40,791
A name like that says it all, really.

826
01:13:41,416 --> 01:13:44,875
Man, what is his name again?

827
01:13:45,541 --> 01:13:47,958
What's his name again?

828
01:13:49,791 --> 01:13:52,041
- Goddam…
- DeKok.

829
01:13:54,958 --> 01:13:56,500
- Tonnie…
- Fuck off.

830
01:14:34,625 --> 01:14:36,333
Thank you, Baks.

831
01:14:43,083 --> 01:14:44,458
Chief.

832
01:14:52,583 --> 01:14:55,958
I wanted to warn Pien, that's all.

833
01:14:56,041 --> 01:14:59,125
And she immediately told her friends.

834
01:14:59,208 --> 01:15:03,708
- I don't believe that.
- What you believe doesn't matter, DeKok.

835
01:15:03,791 --> 01:15:07,125
Six of my men are hospitalized
thanks to your actions.

836
01:15:07,208 --> 01:15:11,416
You've only been here a week.
I doubt you'll last another.

837
01:15:15,083 --> 01:15:19,666
Chief, Tonnie and Bob Donkers
are childhood friends.

838
01:15:20,708 --> 01:15:25,333
I'm convinced that Bob Donkers
had a Flemish drug dealer killed

839
01:15:25,416 --> 01:15:28,625
and dumped as a squatter in a canal.

840
01:15:28,708 --> 01:15:30,958
And the evidence for this is what?

841
01:15:33,625 --> 01:15:35,291
There is no evidence.

842
01:15:39,458 --> 01:15:41,791
- We found something in the Vondel Church.
- What?

843
01:15:41,875 --> 01:15:46,083
- Three empty sniper rifle cases.
- Look, DeKok, hard evidence.

844
01:15:46,166 --> 01:15:48,750
You're lucky I need everyone I can get.

845
01:15:48,833 --> 01:15:52,125
You'll be providing security tomorrow
at the coronation.

846
01:15:52,208 --> 01:15:56,708
Every police officer will be
within a 200-meter radius

847
01:15:56,791 --> 01:15:58,750
to protect our new queen.

848
01:15:59,708 --> 01:16:04,875
And if Bob Donkers or whoever
wants to sell a kilo of coke tomorrow,

849
01:16:04,958 --> 01:16:07,958
we will deal with it
the day after tomorrow.

850
01:16:08,041 --> 01:16:10,458
Is that clear, DeKok?

851
01:16:10,541 --> 01:16:11,916
Unacceptable.

852
01:16:12,000 --> 01:16:17,041
Mayor Polak said that a major police
intervention at the squat

853
01:16:17,125 --> 01:16:21,833
can be avoided if the squatters
are prepared to negotiate.

854
01:16:21,916 --> 01:16:24,375
But the chances of that are small.

855
01:16:25,875 --> 01:16:28,958
HOSPITAL

856
01:16:50,000 --> 01:16:53,041
AMSTERDAM, 30 APRIL 1980
CORONATION DAY

857
01:17:00,833 --> 01:17:01,873
NO HABITATION
NO CORONATION

858
01:17:20,166 --> 01:17:24,166
Practically all the prominent guests
are staying in the Amstel Hotel,

859
01:17:24,250 --> 01:17:26,666
which is heavily guarded.

860
01:17:26,750 --> 01:17:31,375
All these measures are in place to ensure
a smooth coronation on the Dam.

861
01:17:31,458 --> 01:17:36,416
Before the visitors enter the church,
they'll pass through metal detectors

862
01:17:36,500 --> 01:17:39,500
provided by Schiphol Airport.

863
01:17:39,583 --> 01:17:44,791
Let's go to our reporter Hugo van Rijn
for an update on the current situation.

864
01:17:44,875 --> 01:17:51,125
Fences have been placed
and the police are stopping all traffic.

865
01:17:51,208 --> 01:17:53,791
Only cyclists and public transport…

866
01:17:56,666 --> 01:17:59,541
Okay, today is the big day.

867
01:17:59,625 --> 01:18:05,166
Thanks to Mr Hans Wiegel, I have
about 6,000 policemen at my disposal,

868
01:18:05,250 --> 01:18:10,041
and probably the same number of squatters,
demonstrators and opportunists

869
01:18:10,125 --> 01:18:16,000
who want to have their own party.
The threat to security remains serious.

870
01:18:16,083 --> 01:18:18,458
It didn't have to come to this.

871
01:18:18,541 --> 01:18:22,125
We don't want power.
We don't want money.

872
01:18:22,208 --> 01:18:24,666
We don't want to be on TV.

873
01:18:24,750 --> 01:18:28,833
Waiting in the Moses Hall are the
chairmen of the Upper and Lower House,

874
01:18:28,916 --> 01:18:31,875
the representatives of the Dutch Antilles,
the cabinet,

875
01:18:31,958 --> 01:18:34,083
the vice-president
of the Council of State,

876
01:18:34,166 --> 01:18:38,333
the queen's commissioner and
the Amsterdam mayor. The princess…

877
01:18:41,291 --> 01:18:48,041
Today, everyone's eyes are focused
on Dam Square and on nothing else.

878
01:18:48,125 --> 01:18:51,375
No fuck-ups, no hesitating.

879
01:18:51,458 --> 01:18:55,375
If you have to, you hit first
and then ask questions.

880
01:18:55,458 --> 01:18:59,291
But I don't want to see
any firearms today.

881
01:19:02,750 --> 01:19:05,291
I'm not going down in history

882
01:19:05,375 --> 01:19:09,416
as the chief of police
who had a massacre on his hands.

883
01:19:09,500 --> 01:19:13,083
Accommodation, safety, honesty.

884
01:19:13,166 --> 01:19:16,708
And yes, we're prepared to die for it.

885
01:19:16,791 --> 01:19:21,416
The outer ring is shut off to squatters,
demonstrators or any other scumbags.

886
01:19:21,500 --> 01:19:26,166
- No habitation.
- No coronation.

887
01:19:26,250 --> 01:19:30,208
I only want to see
people celebrating, today.

888
01:19:30,291 --> 01:19:32,000
Okay, let's get to work.

889
01:19:42,916 --> 01:19:47,000
- Post 1 to Post 11. How are you?
- Post 11, everything under control.

890
01:19:47,750 --> 01:19:50,208
- Good. Stand by.
- Stand by.

891
01:20:00,916 --> 01:20:04,833
At the moment,
the situation is fairly calm.

892
01:20:04,916 --> 01:20:10,625
The number of wounded policemen is six.
Of the squatters it's unknown.

893
01:20:24,833 --> 01:20:27,250
Jurre to Command, all quiet.

894
01:20:31,375 --> 01:20:36,833
31 to Command, we've got trainloads
of demonstrators are heading your way.

895
01:20:36,916 --> 01:20:40,458
God, Jesus.
What a fucking awful day.

896
01:20:40,541 --> 01:20:45,333
- Shouldn't we draw the bridges?
- Good advice, not doing it.

897
01:20:47,666 --> 01:20:51,958
A building is being squatted
on Kinkerstraat right now.

898
01:20:52,041 --> 01:20:55,250
Unit A,
move from Nieuwmarkt to Kinkerstraat.

899
01:20:55,333 --> 01:20:56,791
Switch to Kinkerstraat.

900
01:21:07,208 --> 01:21:10,291
Okay, guys.
Everyone keep their eyes peeled.

901
01:21:17,458 --> 01:21:21,125
Look to the left. Top window.
Activity.

902
01:21:21,208 --> 01:21:24,000
Can we see what's happening?
What do you see?

903
01:21:25,041 --> 01:21:29,000
I have no idea.
I've got my eyes on them.

904
01:21:36,583 --> 01:21:41,208
It's a banner, a banner.
They're letting down a banner.

905
01:21:41,291 --> 01:21:44,083
Can somebody please
get those rats out of there?

906
01:21:44,166 --> 01:21:47,500
By eleven o'clock,
Dam Square is full of people

907
01:21:47,583 --> 01:21:51,083
waiting for the abdicated
and the new queen

908
01:21:51,166 --> 01:21:53,500
to appear on the palace balcony.

909
01:22:06,125 --> 01:22:11,833
I introduce to you
Beatrix, your new queen.

910
01:22:14,958 --> 01:22:17,041
Yes, they're inside.

911
01:22:20,958 --> 01:22:22,708
It's all under control.

912
01:22:24,333 --> 01:22:27,291
…as Princess Juliana.

913
01:22:28,458 --> 01:22:32,916
All together we head into the future.

914
01:22:33,000 --> 01:22:34,875
We're all set, Bob.

915
01:22:37,125 --> 01:22:39,916
I strive for nothing else

916
01:22:40,000 --> 01:22:45,416
but to be at your disposal
and that of the people,

917
01:22:45,500 --> 01:22:47,625
and to serve the nation.

918
01:22:47,708 --> 01:22:51,625
- I'll be right back.
- Long live the Netherlands.

919
01:22:56,666 --> 01:22:59,166
- Wait. Command?
- Yes, come in.

920
01:22:59,250 --> 01:23:00,666
Should Tonnie…

921
01:23:03,333 --> 01:23:06,625
- Hello, Command?
- I can't hear you, Jurre.

922
01:23:08,833 --> 01:23:12,000
Guys, this isn't happening, is it?

923
01:23:12,083 --> 01:23:14,500
Hello, can somebody answer me?

924
01:23:17,833 --> 01:23:20,875
Hello? Okay, I'm…

925
01:23:22,333 --> 01:23:27,208
Jesus fucking Christ.
Come on, get on with it.

926
01:23:29,041 --> 01:23:33,750
…where you first appeared
as Queen Juliana,

927
01:23:34,958 --> 01:23:38,625
I now wish you

928
01:23:38,708 --> 01:23:43,875
many more years
of happiness and satisfaction…

929
01:23:43,958 --> 01:23:46,791
- Jurre for Command.
- …as Princess Juliana.

930
01:23:47,666 --> 01:23:49,958
Command, Command.

931
01:23:50,041 --> 01:23:51,958
Long live the Netherlands.

932
01:24:16,708 --> 01:24:19,250
Hey, bike for sale.

933
01:24:50,583 --> 01:24:52,875
- Did it all work out?
- I'm here, aren't I?

934
01:24:56,875 --> 01:25:01,041
Bob, I'm not going in, I've done my bit.
You have uniforms and a get-away car.

935
01:25:01,125 --> 01:25:04,750
Your bit? Your bit is done
once we've paid the Belgians.

936
01:25:04,833 --> 01:25:07,541
Or did you think
we'd be doing the dirty work?

937
01:25:07,625 --> 01:25:13,500
We're in this shit because your goons
can't control themselves. Okay?

938
01:25:13,583 --> 01:25:17,833
And you were there, weren't you?
Or did I dream all that?

939
01:25:41,958 --> 01:25:46,666
Emergency, ma'am. Call your boss
and gather everyone outside.

940
01:25:46,750 --> 01:25:50,416
The police has declared
a state of emergency.

941
01:26:06,291 --> 01:26:09,750
- Can I help you?
- An emergency due to the squatter riots.

942
01:26:09,833 --> 01:26:13,875
- Everybody must leave the building.
- Linda, gather the staff.

943
01:26:24,208 --> 01:26:25,875
Stand over here.

944
01:26:43,083 --> 01:26:45,541
- The alarm is switched off.
- That's great.

945
01:26:48,000 --> 01:26:50,125
We want to take a look in your safe.

946
01:26:55,666 --> 01:26:58,166
Command?

947
01:26:59,000 --> 01:27:02,458
Guys, I… Why don't I hear anything?

948
01:27:02,541 --> 01:27:04,416
We don't have access to the safe.

949
01:27:17,125 --> 01:27:20,708
- Has anyone done a first-aid course?
- Me.

950
01:27:27,666 --> 01:27:31,625
- Fuck, goddammit.
- Can somebody open the safe now?

951
01:27:31,708 --> 01:27:33,666
Jurre to Command.

952
01:27:33,750 --> 01:27:36,125
- What the fuck are you doing?
- Ma'am, this way.

953
01:27:36,208 --> 01:27:38,791
I'll go with you, come on.

954
01:27:45,416 --> 01:27:49,541
- You fucking psychopath.
- You're on the lookout, half-ass crook.

955
01:27:50,875 --> 01:27:55,500
Wait here, stand still.
Line up here and stand still.

956
01:28:05,250 --> 01:28:08,125
Open it. Perfect, next.

957
01:28:08,208 --> 01:28:11,416
Well done. Give me the keys.
Don't move!

958
01:28:21,125 --> 01:28:25,875
Breathe in and out. You'll be fine.
You can call an ambulance once we're gone.

959
01:28:28,500 --> 01:28:31,000
- Jurre.
- Where are they?

960
01:28:33,416 --> 01:28:36,125
- I'm glad you're here.
- Where are they?

961
01:28:40,125 --> 01:28:43,250
- Call an ambulance.
- Move away.

962
01:28:43,333 --> 01:28:48,791
- This is not what it seems.
- I'm not stupid.

963
01:28:53,916 --> 01:28:57,041
- I told you it's not all black and white.
- Move away.

964
01:28:57,125 --> 01:28:59,250
What a first week you're having.

965
01:29:00,125 --> 01:29:02,458
- Come on!
- Move, pigs.

966
01:29:02,541 --> 01:29:05,958
Move it, faster! Get in there!

967
01:29:07,666 --> 01:29:11,041
- This is bigger than you think.
- With you and Bob, yes.

968
01:29:14,000 --> 01:29:15,333
I'm undercover.

969
01:29:17,458 --> 01:29:20,916
I'm undercover. Help me, please.

970
01:29:21,000 --> 01:29:23,750
- Bob is emptying out the safe.
- How's that?

971
01:29:23,833 --> 01:29:25,625
Honestly, Jurre.

972
01:29:27,708 --> 01:29:30,875
Grab his arm.
He passed out. Take him outside.

973
01:29:30,958 --> 01:29:34,250
- Hold his arm.
- Yes, we must tie it off. His belt.

974
01:29:42,166 --> 01:29:43,625
Sorry, buddy.

975
01:29:50,250 --> 01:29:51,375
Come on.

976
01:29:52,541 --> 01:29:56,250
- What's all this?
- Some loser trying to be a hero.

977
01:29:56,333 --> 01:29:58,833
- Well, finish him.
- No.

978
01:30:00,583 --> 01:30:01,666
Goddammit.

979
01:30:03,208 --> 01:30:05,000
Get the fuck out of here.

980
01:30:14,250 --> 01:30:19,083
AMSTERDAM, 1 MAY 1980
8 HOURS AFTER THE CORONATION

981
01:30:19,166 --> 01:30:21,291
There he is.

982
01:30:22,625 --> 01:30:24,375
Well…

983
01:30:24,458 --> 01:30:27,791
I have 80 officers in hospital.

984
01:30:27,875 --> 01:30:33,375
The riots are ongoing,
but the coronation went smoothly.

985
01:30:34,666 --> 01:30:40,875
I suppose the leaders of the free world
are probably having their dessert.

986
01:30:40,958 --> 01:30:43,625
- What are these for?
- That was quite impressive.

987
01:30:43,708 --> 01:30:48,791
Right under our noses, very smart.
And we were very dumb.

988
01:30:49,625 --> 01:30:54,083
I'd appreciate it if you were
to tell me exactly what happened.

989
01:30:57,666 --> 01:31:01,708
We were on the lookout
when Tonnie suddenly left.

990
01:31:02,708 --> 01:31:07,250
I followed him and he went into a bank
with some other guys.

991
01:31:07,333 --> 01:31:11,250
I tried to stop him,
but he knocked me out.

992
01:31:11,333 --> 01:31:16,875
Yes, well, Tonnie told me a very
different story. Didn't you, Tonnie?

993
01:31:27,708 --> 01:31:31,666
He knows exactly what happened.
Don't you?

994
01:31:38,375 --> 01:31:40,500
Do you know where the money is?

995
01:31:40,583 --> 01:31:45,166
Tonnie just told me that you were
the one who suddenly took off

996
01:31:45,250 --> 01:31:48,041
to play bank robbers with your mates.

997
01:31:48,125 --> 01:31:50,416
Who are your mates?

998
01:31:55,333 --> 01:31:57,375
Bob Donkers is one of them, isn't he?

999
01:31:57,458 --> 01:32:02,291
- So Tonnie killed the bank manager then?
- Killed?

1000
01:32:02,375 --> 01:32:05,416
No, when I passed out,
nobody was dead.

1001
01:32:05,500 --> 01:32:09,666
He's in a coma, a severed artery.
A breath away from dying.

1002
01:32:09,750 --> 01:32:14,458
And the fact that you betrayed us to the
squatters doesn't help you much either.

1003
01:32:14,541 --> 01:32:17,541
But until I've figured it out,
you'll be guarded.

1004
01:32:19,625 --> 01:32:23,000
Who the hell are you really,
Jurre from Urk?

1005
01:32:26,083 --> 01:32:27,583
Chief?

1006
01:32:30,625 --> 01:32:31,791
Tonnie.

1007
01:32:58,916 --> 01:33:00,208
What is it?

1008
01:33:14,375 --> 01:33:15,541
Sorry.

1009
01:33:20,708 --> 01:33:22,041
Taxi.

1010
01:33:24,041 --> 01:33:25,708
Jordaan.

1011
01:33:52,541 --> 01:33:54,125
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

1012
01:33:54,208 --> 01:33:56,000
Make it 22.

1013
01:34:01,166 --> 01:34:02,791
Hang on, wait a second.

1014
01:34:06,375 --> 01:34:08,791
I think we're going for another drive.

1015
01:34:32,625 --> 01:34:36,625
Yes, stop here. Stop.

1016
01:35:02,375 --> 01:35:05,750
Seppe, it's good to see you.

1017
01:35:18,208 --> 01:35:19,750
Ton.

1018
01:35:30,875 --> 01:35:32,625
It's probably too much.

1019
01:35:38,000 --> 01:35:40,666
Well, how about you guys?

1020
01:35:40,750 --> 01:35:43,125
- What about us?
- The coke.

1021
01:35:43,916 --> 01:35:46,458
- There is no coke.
- Well, give it back then.

1022
01:35:46,541 --> 01:35:49,333
We've decided not to do business
with you anymore.

1023
01:35:49,958 --> 01:35:54,458
Take it easy, everybody.
Let's calm down.

1024
01:36:00,000 --> 01:36:03,125
What? Is this about Marcel?

1025
01:36:06,333 --> 01:36:11,500
Marcel was a junkie
and hence a risk to send on errands.

1026
01:36:11,583 --> 01:36:14,458
First of all,
I decide who runs my errands.

1027
01:36:14,541 --> 01:36:19,458
Secondly, Marcel may have been a junkie,
but he was my friend, and family.

1028
01:36:19,541 --> 01:36:22,958
And that, Bob,
brings us to our third point.

1029
01:36:23,041 --> 01:36:24,750
You don't touch my family.

1030
01:36:24,833 --> 01:36:27,416
How was I supposed to know
he was family?

1031
01:36:29,583 --> 01:36:34,250
Listen, we must be able
to solve this as gentlemen.

1032
01:36:35,833 --> 01:36:40,083
If we have to raise the price,
that's not a problem for me.

1033
01:36:45,416 --> 01:36:49,083
See?
We just need to talk to each other, Seppe.

1034
01:36:49,166 --> 01:36:51,291
All the squatters are locked up

1035
01:36:51,375 --> 01:36:54,166
so if you can't do business with me,
with who can you?

1036
01:36:54,250 --> 01:36:58,000
What's the world coming to
if even we don't have a moral code…

1037
01:37:08,458 --> 01:37:11,708
I'm sorry, but it was
such a boring conversation.

1038
01:37:14,875 --> 01:37:18,791
It's a bit impolite, but we'd still be
here in the morning. Right, Barrie?

1039
01:37:23,458 --> 01:37:27,000
And you don't mess with family.

1040
01:37:27,083 --> 01:37:29,291
I totally agree with that.

1041
01:37:32,791 --> 01:37:36,291
Five kilos a week for starters?

1042
01:37:36,375 --> 01:37:39,875
Fine. And Barrie here is all right.

1043
01:37:42,541 --> 01:37:44,958
But I'm not too sure about this retard.

1044
01:37:47,541 --> 01:37:49,166
I thought you were a cop.

1045
01:37:49,250 --> 01:37:51,750
- I am.
- Yes, he is.

1046
01:37:51,833 --> 01:37:55,666
And coincidentally, he's also
the last person to see Marcel alive.

1047
01:37:55,750 --> 01:38:00,708
It was his idea to dump Marcel
in the canal dressed up as a squatter.

1048
01:38:00,791 --> 01:38:02,000
Wasn't it?

1049
01:38:03,375 --> 01:38:05,000
Fucking asshole.

1050
01:38:21,041 --> 01:38:23,083
Say hello to Marcel.

1051
01:39:20,083 --> 01:39:22,250
Man, oh man.

1052
01:39:26,125 --> 01:39:29,375
Goddammit.

1053
01:39:33,166 --> 01:39:35,666
It's all fucked up.

1054
01:39:40,625 --> 01:39:42,416
Jurre?

1055
01:39:47,208 --> 01:39:49,666
It was all for nothing.

1056
01:39:53,291 --> 01:39:55,125
Hey, buddy.

1057
01:40:00,083 --> 01:40:05,750
You used me in everything.
You knew all along who Marcel was.

1058
01:40:06,833 --> 01:40:09,875
You were on top of everything.

1059
01:40:09,958 --> 01:40:13,291
It should never have come to this.

1060
01:40:13,375 --> 01:40:17,625
That business with the squatters and the
attack was all part of Bob's smoke screen.

1061
01:40:17,708 --> 01:40:21,708
- How long have you been working for Bob?
- I don't work for or with Bob.

1062
01:40:21,791 --> 01:40:23,750
For how long?

1063
01:40:23,833 --> 01:40:27,708
I work undercover
to roll up this entire fucking operation.

1064
01:40:27,791 --> 01:40:31,041
Yeah, we all know that story,
just like in the bank.

1065
01:40:32,666 --> 01:40:34,625
Keep that hand away from there.

1066
01:40:36,541 --> 01:40:41,708
Call an ambulance, I'm losing blood.
A lot of it.

1067
01:40:45,500 --> 01:40:50,916
- Are you giving up on me?
- I saw the whole thing. I'm not like you.

1068
01:40:51,875 --> 01:40:56,416
That's why I love you, buddy.
You're not like the rest of them.

1069
01:40:56,500 --> 01:41:00,333
You're real. I can just picture it.

1070
01:41:02,916 --> 01:41:05,541
Pien and you.

1071
01:41:05,625 --> 01:41:08,708
Don't fucking sweet talk me.

1072
01:41:10,500 --> 01:41:13,625
You're a beautiful person, Jurre DeKok.

1073
01:41:15,000 --> 01:41:17,666
And hey, lesson number 13.

1074
01:41:17,750 --> 01:41:20,250
- Stop.
- Lesson 13:

1075
01:41:20,333 --> 01:41:24,500
Unfortunately in our world,
who you hang out with…

1076
01:41:25,750 --> 01:41:27,708
is who you get contaminated by.

1077
01:41:28,958 --> 01:41:30,333
I'm sorry.

1078
01:41:49,041 --> 01:41:50,833
No, no.

1079
01:41:56,416 --> 01:41:59,666
- Jurre?
- No, no.

1080
01:42:03,625 --> 01:42:06,583
No. No, Tonnie.

1081
01:42:11,291 --> 01:42:15,916
They're on their way,
they're on their way.

1082
01:42:50,583 --> 01:42:52,166
What a mess.

1083
01:42:56,208 --> 01:43:01,791
That bank manager of yours,
he has come to. So…

1084
01:43:04,375 --> 01:43:05,875
Well done.

1085
01:43:12,750 --> 01:43:14,416
He said…

1086
01:43:15,875 --> 01:43:18,958
He said that he was working undercover.

1087
01:43:19,041 --> 01:43:21,875
That all the top brass knew about it.

1088
01:43:24,291 --> 01:43:26,458
That's not true, is it?

1089
01:43:28,083 --> 01:43:29,458
No.

1090
01:43:40,375 --> 01:43:41,750
Your firearm.

1091
01:43:44,625 --> 01:43:46,166
Your firearm.

1092
01:43:53,291 --> 01:43:58,041
I want a brief police report
and a statement.

1093
01:43:58,125 --> 01:44:00,875
Nothing complicated, okay?

1094
01:44:00,958 --> 01:44:03,291
I'll see you Monday morning.

1095
01:44:03,375 --> 01:44:04,791
Okay.

1096
01:45:06,791 --> 01:45:08,291
To Tonnie.

1097
01:45:10,291 --> 01:45:12,333
To Tonnie.

1098
01:45:19,500 --> 01:45:22,416
He fucking succeeded, after all.

1099
01:45:24,541 --> 01:45:28,333
- What?
- In the saddle.

1100
01:45:29,916 --> 01:45:34,333
I always used to say: They'll have to
push you into a grave when you're 120.

1101
01:45:36,166 --> 01:45:37,875
The fucking bastards.

1102
01:45:37,958 --> 01:45:40,750
Don't get me wrong,
Tonnie had his share of mistakes.

1103
01:45:40,833 --> 01:45:43,958
If you steal a rich man's watch,
that's one thing.

1104
01:45:44,041 --> 01:45:46,166
But you just don't shoot people.

1105
01:45:57,541 --> 01:45:59,583
I'll put it on a tab.

1106
01:46:01,666 --> 01:46:03,583
Always have money on you.

1107
01:46:07,083 --> 01:46:08,458
Lesson number one.
