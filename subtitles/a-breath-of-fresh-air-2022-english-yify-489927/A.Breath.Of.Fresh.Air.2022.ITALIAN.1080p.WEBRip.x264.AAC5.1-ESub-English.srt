1
00:01:06,750 --> 00:01:09,875
Fārūq, this is a nice one.
Wow. Look at this!

2
00:01:09,958 --> 00:01:11,458
Good evening. Reservations?

3
00:01:11,541 --> 00:01:14,208
Move your little hands.
Do your job. Thanks.

4
00:01:14,708 --> 00:01:17,666
Good. I've given you
a nice discount, okay?

5
00:01:19,083 --> 00:01:21,041
The acrobatic pizza king!

6
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,541
No little acrobatic games.

7
00:01:28,166 --> 00:01:29,416
I'm watching you.

8
00:01:29,500 --> 00:01:30,333
Mom.

9
00:01:31,458 --> 00:01:33,125
I have a live show tonight.

10
00:01:34,250 --> 00:01:35,291
What if I…

11
00:01:36,333 --> 00:01:38,750
I say your dad's right.
You're untrustworthy.

12
00:01:38,833 --> 00:01:41,958
-Here. Don't let your dad see you!
-Thanks.

13
00:01:43,666 --> 00:01:45,583
WRIT OF EXECUTION
PRECAUTIONARY SEIZURE

14
00:01:45,666 --> 00:01:47,000
Sweetheart.

15
00:01:47,666 --> 00:01:48,958
Okay. I'll tell him.

16
00:01:49,916 --> 00:01:51,000
No worries at all.

17
00:01:52,541 --> 00:01:55,541
Tomorrow, make her
a wire transfer of 3,000 euros.

18
00:01:55,625 --> 00:01:57,833
3,000 euros?!

19
00:01:59,125 --> 00:02:00,291
What has she done?

20
00:02:00,375 --> 00:02:03,125
She's late with her rent, poor girl.
The Dutch are strict.

21
00:02:04,291 --> 00:02:05,125
Look at this.

22
00:02:05,708 --> 00:02:08,958
A little black dress. Chic.
A classic. Do you like it?

23
00:02:09,041 --> 00:02:12,708
Honey, we're going to an exclusive place.
We need to stand out.

24
00:02:12,791 --> 00:02:14,250
Come on. Raise the bar.

25
00:02:14,333 --> 00:02:18,958
My goodness. What is it the Oscars night?
I thought it was a birthday.

26
00:02:19,041 --> 00:02:22,083
It isn't just a birthday.
Dario's also become a manager.

27
00:02:22,166 --> 00:02:23,583
There. Precisely.

28
00:02:24,083 --> 00:02:27,000
A 1,700-euro watch
sounds very oafish to me.

29
00:02:27,083 --> 00:02:28,541
You'll embarrass people.

30
00:02:29,041 --> 00:02:32,791
Not this again? It's an investment.
I give him a big present,

31
00:02:32,875 --> 00:02:35,208
and he does us
a big favor on our mortgage.

32
00:02:42,333 --> 00:02:43,166
Yes?

33
00:02:43,958 --> 00:02:44,791
Tell me.

34
00:02:47,291 --> 00:02:48,125
A lawyer?

35
00:02:49,416 --> 00:02:50,250
Which lawyer?

36
00:02:51,625 --> 00:02:53,208
No. It's not me.

37
00:02:54,791 --> 00:02:57,416
No. I don't know any Rosario.

38
00:02:57,500 --> 00:03:00,375
Okay, it's me. I'm Rosario. What's up?

39
00:03:00,458 --> 00:03:03,291
You've become a lawyer? I'm happy for you.

40
00:03:03,375 --> 00:03:04,208
Tell me.

41
00:03:07,833 --> 00:03:09,125
When did it happen?

42
00:03:12,750 --> 00:03:15,250
No. I'm not interested in the inheritance.

43
00:03:18,083 --> 00:03:18,916
Bye.

44
00:03:23,833 --> 00:03:24,666
Who was it?

45
00:03:26,333 --> 00:03:27,250
A call center.

46
00:03:27,333 --> 00:03:29,750
You're emotional
because a call center called.

47
00:03:29,833 --> 00:03:32,791
No, it's… the menthol shaving cream.

48
00:03:33,833 --> 00:03:34,666
Yeah.

49
00:03:44,375 --> 00:03:45,458
I knew it.

50
00:03:47,125 --> 00:03:50,666
-I'm going home and changing.
-Honey, don't exaggerate.

51
00:03:50,750 --> 00:03:53,916
You're making it bigger than it is.
Nobody looks at our clothes.

52
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,250
Where's the restroom?

53
00:03:56,208 --> 00:03:57,125
We've just…

54
00:03:57,791 --> 00:03:59,875
Usually, it's at the far right.

55
00:03:59,958 --> 00:04:00,958
Thanks.

56
00:04:01,041 --> 00:04:05,000
See? You should be friendly too
and make new friends. Let's go.

57
00:04:05,083 --> 00:04:06,375
Come on.

58
00:04:07,666 --> 00:04:09,708
What's wrong? Shall I drag you?

59
00:04:11,125 --> 00:04:12,041
I am a guest.

60
00:04:14,958 --> 00:04:17,625
Darione! Great to see you.

61
00:04:17,708 --> 00:04:20,291
-Ramona, let me hug you.
-Hi.

62
00:04:20,375 --> 00:04:22,833
Dario. Listen.

63
00:04:24,166 --> 00:04:28,375
I could use a little breathing space.
I've received a writ of execution.

64
00:04:30,708 --> 00:04:31,541
Now that

65
00:04:32,208 --> 00:04:35,041
you are a manager,
you could stop it, right?

66
00:04:35,125 --> 00:04:39,208
No, because the head office
has confirmed the securitization.

67
00:04:40,291 --> 00:04:42,125
-Meaning?
-Meaning that…

68
00:04:42,208 --> 00:04:46,666
The most I can do is give you two weeks,
but if you don't cover at least 25%

69
00:04:46,750 --> 00:04:50,333
of mortgage arrears,
then it's bye to Gelso.

70
00:04:50,416 --> 00:04:52,166
But that's 50,000 euros.

71
00:04:52,250 --> 00:04:55,208
I know, but I told you
not to buy the space next door.

72
00:04:55,291 --> 00:04:56,833
-Dario.
-Hey there.

73
00:04:57,500 --> 00:04:58,916
-Listen, Dario.
-Yeah.

74
00:04:59,958 --> 00:05:02,583
-Can you not say anything to Teresa?
-Okay.

75
00:05:02,666 --> 00:05:05,083
-Don't worry. Come on.
-Thanks.

76
00:05:05,958 --> 00:05:07,916
Excuse me? Some Prosecco, please?

77
00:05:08,416 --> 00:05:09,333
Not this again…

78
00:05:21,833 --> 00:05:23,041
Olé!

79
00:05:23,625 --> 00:05:27,458
A mug with a skull!
I really wanted it. It's too cool.

80
00:05:32,458 --> 00:05:34,458
-Olé!
-You're crazy. You are!

81
00:05:35,166 --> 00:05:36,000
I love them.

82
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:42,541
Attention. "Happy birthday,
Dario, from Salvo and Teresa."

83
00:05:42,625 --> 00:05:45,625
Thank you.

84
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:51,875
Olé!

85
00:05:54,375 --> 00:05:55,750
Did he buy him a watch?

86
00:05:55,833 --> 00:05:57,666
-It's not real. Is it?
-A watch?

87
00:05:57,750 --> 00:05:58,583
Come on.

88
00:05:59,791 --> 00:06:03,458
-Not at all. Are you joking? It's a fake.
-It's fake.

89
00:06:03,541 --> 00:06:06,291
I really thought he went for
a kitschy, Southern-style gift.

90
00:06:08,833 --> 00:06:11,875
-It looks fucking real though.
-Well, yeah.

91
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,208
-It looks real to me.
-What the fuck are you saying?

92
00:06:17,291 --> 00:06:20,958
Can't you tell it's a fake? If you throw
it in the sangria, it won't even float.

93
00:06:22,125 --> 00:06:23,708
You're crazy!

94
00:06:26,875 --> 00:06:27,750
What's here?

95
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:29,958
I am not the waiter--

96
00:06:30,041 --> 00:06:32,541
Attention. No card here.

97
00:06:36,333 --> 00:06:37,166
Olé!

98
00:06:38,291 --> 00:06:39,125
Put it away.

99
00:06:40,625 --> 00:06:42,041
Put it away. Take it.

100
00:06:49,041 --> 00:06:49,875
Olé!

101
00:07:16,958 --> 00:07:18,166
Good morning.

102
00:07:19,250 --> 00:07:21,083
You got up early this morning.

103
00:07:21,708 --> 00:07:22,541
Yeah.

104
00:07:23,125 --> 00:07:25,500
-Early start.
-And how was last night?

105
00:07:25,583 --> 00:07:28,458
Good. We worked our ass off, but…

106
00:07:28,541 --> 00:07:30,000
-Good.
-Good boy.

107
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:33,333
-Thanks.
-I know Fārūq did everything, you fool.

108
00:07:34,416 --> 00:07:37,833
Who did you take after?
Your sister never lied to me. Never.

109
00:07:37,916 --> 00:07:40,708
-Are you sure?
-Did she tell you she's feeling down?

110
00:07:40,791 --> 00:07:43,125
That's why I want to go and see her.

111
00:07:43,208 --> 00:07:45,166
Now you worry about your sister.

112
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:47,750
I have to…

113
00:07:48,791 --> 00:07:51,541
-I have to give a demo to a label.
-Who's this?

114
00:07:51,625 --> 00:07:54,291
A label means a record label.

115
00:07:55,041 --> 00:07:59,000
They're not replying to my emails,
so I wanna go there and bring my tracks.

116
00:07:59,083 --> 00:08:02,250
Look how proactive he can be
when it comes to playing

117
00:08:02,333 --> 00:08:03,750
the deejay.

118
00:08:03,833 --> 00:08:05,250
Producer sound designer.

119
00:08:10,458 --> 00:08:12,000
You're opening today.

120
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,291
Tidy up your thoughts, Freddy Mercury.

121
00:08:16,375 --> 00:08:19,000
Freddy Mercury's got
jack shit to do with it.

122
00:08:19,083 --> 00:08:22,875
-You don't even know what music I play.
-Do you call that music?

123
00:08:24,833 --> 00:08:30,083
Oh my goodness, this sucks.
You twist and turn and pull the blankets.

124
00:08:31,666 --> 00:08:33,291
A bed is made for sleeping.

125
00:08:35,708 --> 00:08:39,458
-Not just for sleeping.
-Get off, will you?

126
00:08:40,291 --> 00:08:43,375
If you don't want to treat insomnia,
do whatever you want.

127
00:08:43,875 --> 00:08:47,916
Go out. Go for a walk.
Take the usual walk. As long as you go.

128
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:50,541
So at least one of us will sleep.

129
00:08:51,583 --> 00:08:52,708
God willing.

130
00:09:24,375 --> 00:09:26,250
Have you tried sleeping pills?

131
00:09:26,333 --> 00:09:27,750
That's for bumpkins.

132
00:09:28,416 --> 00:09:30,500
I solve problems without any help.

133
00:09:31,208 --> 00:09:35,375
But if La Zia is still there,
it means you could do with a little help.

134
00:09:35,458 --> 00:09:38,083
A good debt always drives away a bad one.

135
00:09:39,208 --> 00:09:41,041
It's the trap of neoliberalism.

136
00:09:44,041 --> 00:09:46,000
Too much culture is bad for you.

137
00:09:49,541 --> 00:09:50,375
So.

138
00:09:52,041 --> 00:09:53,791
So you know the conditions.

139
00:09:54,750 --> 00:09:59,666
Increased by 10% since this time,
the amount is pretty high.

140
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,541
Do we have to do this?

141
00:10:16,125 --> 00:10:18,666
Don't lean on that. You're a jinx.

142
00:10:22,291 --> 00:10:25,041
Darione! Big news!

143
00:10:25,125 --> 00:10:29,250
We have the 50,000 euros,
but you'll let me defer the rest, right?

144
00:10:30,875 --> 00:10:33,833
Talk soon. See you tomorrow.
I'll drop by tomorrow.

145
00:11:09,166 --> 00:11:11,875
I knew you wouldn't have come
to my funeral.

146
00:11:12,541 --> 00:11:14,000
You are a dissolute son.

147
00:11:15,333 --> 00:11:16,500
Everyone was there.

148
00:11:16,583 --> 00:11:20,916
Even Uncle Cicco from Canicattì
was there, and he's 95! You weren't.

149
00:11:21,625 --> 00:11:22,458
Well done.

150
00:11:23,333 --> 00:11:24,375
Where are we?

151
00:11:24,458 --> 00:11:28,291
It's a hiatus, which separates us
from the living and the dead.

152
00:11:28,375 --> 00:11:31,041
And since when do you use
words such as "hiatus"

153
00:11:31,125 --> 00:11:34,666
when the most difficult word you used
when alive was sausage?

154
00:11:34,750 --> 00:11:38,041
Help me unload the tractor, or will you
just stand there and look pretty?

155
00:11:41,208 --> 00:11:44,875
Salvo, stop! Thank you.
Pretend I have accepted your help.

156
00:11:44,958 --> 00:11:46,375
Stop it. I'll take care.

157
00:11:48,041 --> 00:11:50,125
You're a useless thing. Useless.

158
00:11:50,958 --> 00:11:52,916
Why don't you give me lotto numbers

159
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:56,166
and save me
from this postmortem lecturing?

160
00:11:56,250 --> 00:11:58,375
Remember one thing. I came in peace,

161
00:11:58,958 --> 00:12:01,666
and you're upsetting me
even now that I'm dead.

162
00:12:02,250 --> 00:12:03,583
Do you know that saying?

163
00:12:03,666 --> 00:12:07,208
"Blessed is the bird
who builds its nest in its own village."

164
00:12:07,875 --> 00:12:09,208
I leave you with that.

165
00:12:15,583 --> 00:12:18,500
Don't worry.
You've only got a few bruises.

166
00:12:18,583 --> 00:12:21,416
I'll discharge you
as soon as the report's ready.

167
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:25,666
By the way, looking at your scooter,
you've been blessed by a miracle.

168
00:12:25,750 --> 00:12:29,416
-Someone up there must love you.
-Curse me, more than anything.

169
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:32,041
From the hiatus.

170
00:12:35,750 --> 00:12:40,708
You seem to be a little stressed out,
Mr. Macaluso. I suggest you get some rest.

171
00:12:41,833 --> 00:12:43,916
-See you later.
-Thank you, Doctor.

172
00:12:48,458 --> 00:12:49,458
What happened?

173
00:12:54,291 --> 00:12:56,250
-My father has died.
-No!

174
00:12:57,750 --> 00:13:00,041
Honey, I am so sorry,
but when did it happen?

175
00:13:01,583 --> 00:13:05,666
-Help me get down. I want to take a walk.
-Yes, come on. Easy.

176
00:13:06,291 --> 00:13:09,250
Listen. Is there anything that…

177
00:13:09,333 --> 00:13:10,416
Some water?

178
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:13,083
-No, a plum cake.
-You idiot. Hop off.

179
00:13:13,166 --> 00:13:15,875
What a villain.
Instead of giving me lotto numbers,

180
00:13:15,958 --> 00:13:19,375
he told me about
an old Sicilian saying, Verga style.

181
00:13:19,458 --> 00:13:22,333
He who could hardly read a shampoo label.

182
00:13:22,416 --> 00:13:23,500
Which saying?

183
00:13:23,583 --> 00:13:29,125
Like, "The happy bird makes its nest
in its own village." Something like that.

184
00:13:30,375 --> 00:13:34,625
Well, it's a very clear sign
that you must go down south.

185
00:13:34,708 --> 00:13:37,916
You wanna be like rednecks
who believe in this crap?

186
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:41,333
Come on. Give me a coin.
I'll get a coffee.

187
00:13:42,125 --> 00:13:44,875
You're his only child.
He deserves a farewell.

188
00:13:44,958 --> 00:13:47,291
Don't be a shithead as usual. Come on.

189
00:13:47,375 --> 00:13:50,291
-How does this work?
-Up. That's for coins. Here.

190
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,708
He said I'm a useless thing.

191
00:13:54,083 --> 00:13:59,375
So, keep calm. Stay cool.
Didn't you hear what the doctor said?

192
00:13:59,458 --> 00:14:01,000
You're stressed out, okay?

193
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:06,208
Why don't you go down south a few days?
Say your last farewell to your dad, rest…

194
00:14:06,291 --> 00:14:11,000
-It'd be good for you. You can relax.
-Don't you dare. I'm not going back there.

195
00:14:11,083 --> 00:14:12,125
And I am not…

196
00:14:12,625 --> 00:14:13,708
I'm not…

197
00:14:14,458 --> 00:14:16,583
I am not stressed out!

198
00:14:17,458 --> 00:14:18,708
What's your problem?!

199
00:14:24,875 --> 00:14:27,708
Dad hasn't been sleeping
since things have gone bad at work.

200
00:14:27,791 --> 00:14:31,750
-So he nags me at night too.
-I told him not to expand his business.

201
00:14:32,875 --> 00:14:35,291
Mom gives in to him all the time. Always.

202
00:14:36,833 --> 00:14:39,583
I can't wait to move out, honestly.

203
00:14:40,833 --> 00:14:44,333
A friend of mine will have
a room available soon.

204
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:48,791
Enzo, it's been three years that
your friend's meant to have a free room.

205
00:14:48,875 --> 00:14:50,166
It's now available.

206
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,666
Anyway, how did it go
with that record label?

207
00:14:56,500 --> 00:14:58,791
-Good.
-Did they listen to your demo?

208
00:14:58,875 --> 00:15:01,291
Yes. They said they'll let me know soon.

209
00:15:14,916 --> 00:15:16,791
Why didn't you give it to them?

210
00:15:17,833 --> 00:15:18,916
I knew it already.

211
00:15:20,250 --> 00:15:22,750
Enzo, why don't you tell me things?
I'm not Dad.

212
00:15:22,833 --> 00:15:24,625
-You can talk to me.
-You're worse.

213
00:15:24,708 --> 00:15:28,000
-He doesn't rummage in my pockets.
-You asked for money for this trip.

214
00:15:28,083 --> 00:15:31,375
And you haven't got the guts
to go and give a fucking envelope?

215
00:15:34,916 --> 00:15:37,791
I come to see you to get a break,
and I get a lecture here too?

216
00:15:37,875 --> 00:15:39,291
You love lectures, Enzo.

217
00:15:40,083 --> 00:15:42,250
You love being the baby of the family.

218
00:15:42,333 --> 00:15:46,333
Otherwise, look, keep staying
in your nice little bedroom,

219
00:15:46,416 --> 00:15:49,625
with the Dragon Ball poster on the wall,
moaning all day long

220
00:15:49,708 --> 00:15:52,625
about wanting to move out,
and nobody will say anything.

221
00:15:54,750 --> 00:15:59,250
I've got an idea. Let's get up,
walk in that coffee shop,

222
00:15:59,333 --> 00:16:02,333
and smoke a big joint,
so you can chill a bit, okay?

223
00:16:02,416 --> 00:16:04,333
-See how you are?
-Seriously, Emma.

224
00:16:04,416 --> 00:16:07,208
I mean it. So you can chill
and stop criticizing.

225
00:16:07,291 --> 00:16:09,750
If I may, it's easy
to criticize from here.

226
00:16:09,833 --> 00:16:12,333
Who's the one home with Dad in Milan? Me.

227
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:13,916
Are you coming?

228
00:16:15,541 --> 00:16:16,750
Whatever. I'm going.

229
00:16:24,541 --> 00:16:27,708
Moro speaking from Via Venezia, 26 red…

230
00:16:34,083 --> 00:16:37,208
POLICE

231
00:16:41,125 --> 00:16:44,000
Okay, copy that.
We're arriving at the police station

232
00:16:44,083 --> 00:16:47,458
with the loan shark from Via Sala Bar.
We're leaving now.

233
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:48,875
Received.

234
00:17:28,458 --> 00:17:31,291
-I bet you're from here.
-You lost the bet. I'm from Milan.

235
00:17:31,375 --> 00:17:32,333
I'm here on business.

236
00:17:32,416 --> 00:17:35,708
-I have a cousin in Milan who owns a bar.
-Could you look ahead, please?

237
00:17:35,791 --> 00:17:40,541
You know, it was a dump. Then he expanded,
and my cousin has made real money.

238
00:17:40,625 --> 00:17:42,333
Look ahead now, please!

239
00:17:43,083 --> 00:17:44,416
What a bad temper.

240
00:18:40,708 --> 00:18:43,416
Lillo! Is that really you?

241
00:18:46,083 --> 00:18:48,750
You've grown a lot.
Have you been eating wild boars?

242
00:18:49,416 --> 00:18:50,833
Come give me a hug.

243
00:18:59,625 --> 00:19:01,500
Rosario called me.

244
00:19:01,583 --> 00:19:03,500
My goodness, what a tragedy.

245
00:19:03,583 --> 00:19:04,958
That was so unexpected.

246
00:19:06,208 --> 00:19:07,375
A real blow.

247
00:19:08,500 --> 00:19:11,875
He mentioned inheritance,
as if I am interested in that.

248
00:19:13,333 --> 00:19:16,166
But how much would we inherit exactly?

249
00:19:19,208 --> 00:19:20,208
How much?

250
00:19:21,625 --> 00:19:22,750
I mean, not that I…

251
00:19:24,416 --> 00:19:25,500
am interested.

252
00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:34,583
Thank you for the warm welcome.

253
00:19:54,333 --> 00:19:58,083
-Where are you running to, Napoli?
-Napoli, come here!

254
00:19:58,166 --> 00:20:00,000
Where are you going? Come here.

255
00:20:01,250 --> 00:20:02,458
Where are you going?

256
00:20:02,541 --> 00:20:05,166
-What do you do now?
-You can't run away now.

257
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,166
Where did you want to go?

258
00:20:09,250 --> 00:20:11,791
-What did you want to do?
-Neapolitan, you can't run now.

259
00:20:11,875 --> 00:20:13,666
I'd spit in your mouth.

260
00:20:28,333 --> 00:20:30,416
-Yes?
-Rosario, it's Salvo.

261
00:20:34,958 --> 00:20:37,041
Mazzacana!

262
00:20:48,458 --> 00:20:49,291
Here it is.

263
00:20:52,541 --> 00:20:56,208
-Why are you touching it?
-You were giving it, and I was taking it.

264
00:20:56,291 --> 00:20:58,958
I mean, clearly,
that's what you were doing.

265
00:20:59,041 --> 00:21:01,458
Are you putting it away? You called me.

266
00:21:02,250 --> 00:21:05,166
I've traveled 2,000 kilometers.
I came from Milan.

267
00:21:05,250 --> 00:21:08,666
-Your brother needs to be here too.
-He's not even talking to me.

268
00:21:08,750 --> 00:21:11,583
I get it, but we can't do it otherwise.

269
00:21:15,875 --> 00:21:17,916
Do you remember when we were kids?

270
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:21,583
Those two waiting for you
outside the school because they wanted

271
00:21:22,291 --> 00:21:23,541
to beat you up?

272
00:21:23,625 --> 00:21:25,791
Just because you were
the smartest in the class.

273
00:21:26,833 --> 00:21:28,333
But I cared about you.

274
00:21:28,416 --> 00:21:33,083
And if you are where you are today,
I'm not saying you owe me a bit.

275
00:21:33,166 --> 00:21:35,041
No, I don't, but...

276
00:21:38,541 --> 00:21:41,333
It won't leave this room. It won't.

277
00:21:48,708 --> 00:21:49,541
So.

278
00:21:50,708 --> 00:21:51,583
"Last will."

279
00:21:52,916 --> 00:21:58,291
"I, the undersigned, Nunzio Macaluso,
being of sound mind,

280
00:21:58,375 --> 00:22:01,541
appoint my sons, Calogero and Salvatore,

281
00:22:01,625 --> 00:22:04,583
co-heirs of the family home
and its attached plots."

282
00:22:05,291 --> 00:22:07,375
"Yours sincerely, Nunzio Macaluso."

283
00:22:07,458 --> 00:22:09,958
Well, I can sell and monetize.

284
00:22:10,041 --> 00:22:14,625
By the way, this reminds me
that the mayor would like to welcome you.

285
00:22:14,708 --> 00:22:16,875
Don't tell me it's still Beppe Randazzo?

286
00:22:16,958 --> 00:22:18,416
No way. It's his son.

287
00:22:18,500 --> 00:22:22,791
Mimmo U' Catarrusu. I used to beat him up
one day yes and the other one too.

288
00:22:30,958 --> 00:22:32,083
See, I ask about you.

289
00:22:32,166 --> 00:22:37,083
I've done my research and was told
that you make the best pizza in Milan.

290
00:22:37,166 --> 00:22:38,625
The best in Lombardy.

291
00:22:41,541 --> 00:22:43,000
Your father, how is he?

292
00:22:43,541 --> 00:22:44,750
He passed away.

293
00:22:44,833 --> 00:22:46,791
-Really? I'm sorry.
-Yes.

294
00:22:47,291 --> 00:22:50,208
Sure, he's with Nunzio.
He cared about your dad.

295
00:22:50,291 --> 00:22:55,125
Because he was the only one who supported
him in that damned business with snails.

296
00:22:55,208 --> 00:22:58,000
Do you remember? The snails business.

297
00:22:58,083 --> 00:22:59,708
You did some bullshit, Dad.

298
00:23:00,916 --> 00:23:02,125
Listen up.

299
00:23:02,875 --> 00:23:05,125
I wanted to meet with you because…

300
00:23:06,583 --> 00:23:09,750
Salvo, let's be clear.
I'm interested in your family house.

301
00:23:09,833 --> 00:23:13,458
-What's wrong with that?
-Nothing wrong. I want to retire there.

302
00:23:13,541 --> 00:23:17,041
And I also want
to make peace with the ecosystem.

303
00:23:17,125 --> 00:23:18,250
Good.

304
00:23:18,333 --> 00:23:22,416
So I thought about an amount,
which I might be embarrassed to say.

305
00:23:23,708 --> 00:23:24,583
Salvo,

306
00:23:24,666 --> 00:23:29,333
considering its abandoned state,
the unbuildable state of the lot,

307
00:23:30,208 --> 00:23:33,583
and the devaluation
of the very old property,

308
00:23:34,375 --> 00:23:35,458
this is my figure.

309
00:23:43,500 --> 00:23:45,291
-Salvuccio.
-It's--

310
00:23:47,250 --> 00:23:48,250
What do you think?

311
00:23:50,875 --> 00:23:53,583
I mean, it sounds good. I don't know…

312
00:23:56,791 --> 00:23:58,666
-Salvo.
-It can be done.

313
00:23:59,833 --> 00:24:03,625
-Tell me where to sign.
-Slow down.

314
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:09,250
There's one little thing. Very little…

315
00:24:09,333 --> 00:24:10,416
What little thing?

316
00:24:10,500 --> 00:24:14,291
Salvuccio, you need to convince
your brother to give up his share too.

317
00:24:14,375 --> 00:24:15,333
A piece of cake.

318
00:24:15,416 --> 00:24:18,833
A piece of cake? When was the last time
you saw your brother?

319
00:24:18,916 --> 00:24:23,083
No. Keep this.
It helps lubricate the gears.

320
00:24:23,750 --> 00:24:26,541
My love. All good. I'll tell you later.

321
00:24:27,458 --> 00:24:31,333
I was right.
I knew I had to come back down south.

322
00:24:31,416 --> 00:24:33,666
-Salvo!
-No. Sure.

323
00:24:33,750 --> 00:24:36,583
-But I called. The line's always busy.
-Salvo.

324
00:24:36,666 --> 00:24:39,291
-Or there's no connection. I don't know…
-Is that you?

325
00:24:39,375 --> 00:24:40,708
Is that you? Sa'!

326
00:24:42,416 --> 00:24:43,458
Salvo, dude!

327
00:24:43,541 --> 00:24:46,375
No, they're not robbing me.
They're old friends.

328
00:24:46,458 --> 00:24:49,791
Honey, I'll call you later
when I have more time.

329
00:24:49,875 --> 00:24:51,375
-Salvo, come on.
-Bye.

330
00:24:51,458 --> 00:24:53,750
The new Aci Fontana Stadium, Salvo,

331
00:24:53,833 --> 00:24:55,750
with 15,000 covered seating.

332
00:24:55,833 --> 00:25:00,041
You won't get 15,000 people
even if you invite the whole province.

333
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:04,125
The president promised
to take us to Serie B in three years.

334
00:25:04,791 --> 00:25:07,375
He's a builder
and lives in Milan, like you.

335
00:25:07,458 --> 00:25:10,583
-Maybe you know him too.
-Of course I do!

336
00:25:10,666 --> 00:25:14,416
Three million people, and I know them all.
What the hell, Castagna?

337
00:25:14,500 --> 00:25:15,916
-Take it easy.
-He's right.

338
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,625
Let's show respect
to the Schillaci of pizza.

339
00:25:18,708 --> 00:25:21,250
He's made some good money up there!

340
00:25:22,541 --> 00:25:25,666
Don Angelo, another round
on the uncle from America!

341
00:25:25,750 --> 00:25:27,666
-You still like her, right?
-Excuse me.

342
00:25:29,125 --> 00:25:31,458
Salvo, where are you going? Salvo!

343
00:25:31,541 --> 00:25:32,875
Pussy is pussy.

344
00:25:48,833 --> 00:25:50,916
-Good morning.
-Good morning.

345
00:26:03,625 --> 00:26:05,500
So, Bettina, what are we doing?

346
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:07,958
My usual. Brazilian waxing.

347
00:26:10,125 --> 00:26:12,333
He doesn't want to go,
then he buys the ticket.

348
00:26:12,416 --> 00:26:14,041
Then he doesn't want to go anymore.

349
00:26:14,125 --> 00:26:16,958
Then he packs last minute
and nearly misses his flight.

350
00:26:17,041 --> 00:26:19,458
Teresa, you don't have to be so paranoid.

351
00:26:19,541 --> 00:26:22,500
If a man wants to cheat on you,
he'll do it anyway.

352
00:26:22,583 --> 00:26:26,291
And if you want to get hurt,
go and rummage in his bedside table.

353
00:26:26,375 --> 00:26:28,750
Yeah. His bedside table.

354
00:26:28,833 --> 00:26:33,250
Yeah, that's ingenious. They put it
under your nose where you'll never look.

355
00:26:33,333 --> 00:26:35,416
And if you find out, they say,

356
00:26:35,500 --> 00:26:39,750
"You think if I wanted to hide something,
I'd put it in the bedside table?"

357
00:26:41,500 --> 00:26:44,083
Breathe in the scent of salt. Breathe in.

358
00:26:44,750 --> 00:26:45,583
Breathe in.

359
00:27:23,083 --> 00:27:23,958
Hey.

360
00:27:24,958 --> 00:27:25,833
Enzo.

361
00:27:33,958 --> 00:27:36,541
-How did it go?
-No one knocks in this house.

362
00:27:36,625 --> 00:27:39,500
-Did you give them your demo?
-Yes. I did.

363
00:27:39,583 --> 00:27:42,333
-Good. You must be happy.
-Yes, I'm happy.

364
00:27:42,416 --> 00:27:47,250
Listen, I was just curious,

365
00:27:48,291 --> 00:27:51,875
if you had to hide something,
where would you put it?

366
00:27:51,958 --> 00:27:54,708
-What do you need to hide?
-Forget about "what."

367
00:27:54,791 --> 00:27:58,375
If you have to hide it,
without thinking, where would you put it?

368
00:27:58,458 --> 00:28:00,083
I don't know, Mom,

369
00:28:01,625 --> 00:28:03,541
in the bedside table?

370
00:28:27,250 --> 00:28:29,083
"I'm waiting for you, Carme'."

371
00:28:37,958 --> 00:28:38,791
"Carme',

372
00:28:39,625 --> 00:28:42,208
with your hand, you messed up my head."

373
00:28:43,250 --> 00:28:46,583
"You messed up my heart too."

374
00:28:47,333 --> 00:28:50,541
"My heart burns and steals my thoughts,

375
00:28:51,416 --> 00:28:53,416
then it moves away and goes down…"

376
00:28:53,500 --> 00:28:56,083
I'm gonna kill you, you son of a bitch.

377
00:28:59,250 --> 00:29:01,291
-The number you have di…
-Fuck you.

378
00:29:31,291 --> 00:29:32,208
You're awake?

379
00:29:34,416 --> 00:29:37,416
I thought that you farmers
went to bed with the sun.

380
00:29:41,916 --> 00:29:44,208
You don't talk to me
because you're angry with me?

381
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:48,125
I've invited you to Milan many times,
but you never came.

382
00:29:51,208 --> 00:29:54,166
You're leaving me
in the disused part of the house?

383
00:29:55,500 --> 00:29:59,375
You're taking the bathroom, and if I need
to pee, do I do it in the fireplace?

384
00:30:05,500 --> 00:30:08,208
Why don't we talk about
the mayor's proposal?

385
00:30:10,500 --> 00:30:13,083
Hey, look at this. Look.

386
00:30:14,291 --> 00:30:18,708
Let's lubricate your rusty gears.
Check this out.

387
00:30:26,750 --> 00:30:27,666
Screw this.

388
00:30:30,666 --> 00:30:33,083
See, I managed to make you talk.

389
00:30:39,500 --> 00:30:40,333
Lillo?

390
00:30:41,416 --> 00:30:43,625
Do not enter my part of the house.

391
00:30:46,791 --> 00:30:50,500
I have a pizzeria in Milan
and I am drowning in debt.

392
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:52,875
I need that money.

393
00:30:54,958 --> 00:30:56,750
Do you want me to go broke?

394
00:30:57,708 --> 00:30:59,916
Where were you when Dad went broke?

395
00:31:00,750 --> 00:31:04,333
I was here, among snails
and promissory notes,

396
00:31:04,416 --> 00:31:07,416
while you were enjoying
your nice pizzeria up north!

397
00:31:08,458 --> 00:31:10,958
You didn't even come to the funeral, Cain!

398
00:31:16,791 --> 00:31:18,625
Are you playing the jaw harp?

399
00:31:21,166 --> 00:31:23,125
Can you play me "Wish You Were Here"?

400
00:32:23,625 --> 00:32:24,833
Salvo.

401
00:32:25,708 --> 00:32:27,041
Do you know who he is?

402
00:32:27,875 --> 00:32:29,291
It's Mazzacana.

403
00:32:29,958 --> 00:32:31,166
Mazzacana!

404
00:32:33,083 --> 00:32:36,458
If he finds out that you stole his shoes,
he'll kill you.

405
00:32:36,541 --> 00:32:37,875
No, he can't find out.

406
00:32:39,041 --> 00:32:42,458
Lillo? Can you see the pizzeria?
They opened it last week.

407
00:32:43,875 --> 00:32:45,666
People come here from Aci Fontana.

408
00:32:46,416 --> 00:32:48,125
They must be making a lot of money.

409
00:32:49,166 --> 00:32:51,500
Look at that. It never ends!

410
00:32:52,791 --> 00:32:54,708
Close your eyes and make a wish.

411
00:32:58,875 --> 00:33:00,958
Can you teach me how to make pizza?

412
00:33:01,666 --> 00:33:02,750
Of course, I will.

413
00:33:04,375 --> 00:33:07,583
Do you think I'd leave you here
slaving with Dad and his snails?

414
00:33:07,666 --> 00:33:10,166
I can't work alone in our pizzeria, can I?

415
00:33:14,833 --> 00:33:18,208
Can you see the damage these snails do?

416
00:33:19,125 --> 00:33:22,083
With those antennas, they move big stones

417
00:33:23,833 --> 00:33:25,625
-Swear.
-I swear.

418
00:33:28,916 --> 00:33:30,250
Do we have to do this?

419
00:33:30,333 --> 00:33:31,666
Give me your hand.

420
00:35:43,083 --> 00:35:44,125
Son of a bitch!

421
00:35:59,500 --> 00:36:02,166
Selling our family's house
is a sacrifice for me too,

422
00:36:02,250 --> 00:36:04,666
but I have to protect my pizzeria.

423
00:36:04,750 --> 00:36:07,708
Actually, you said
we'd open the pizzeria together.

424
00:36:08,666 --> 00:36:09,916
What did you call it?

425
00:36:11,458 --> 00:36:12,416
Sciuri Sciuri.

426
00:36:12,958 --> 00:36:14,041
That's original.

427
00:36:15,708 --> 00:36:18,333
Dad's will is for us to scatter his ashes.

428
00:36:18,416 --> 00:36:20,333
If we don't do it,
the house won't be ours.

429
00:36:20,416 --> 00:36:23,500
Easy. Get them and we'll scatter them.
Plenty of room here.

430
00:36:23,583 --> 00:36:26,458
He said we should do it
with this and with this.

431
00:36:26,958 --> 00:36:30,125
On top of the mountain,
and when the wind is mungibiddisi.

432
00:36:30,208 --> 00:36:32,291
Is he giving orders even when dead?

433
00:36:32,375 --> 00:36:35,458
What does he care
if the wind is or isn't mungibiddisi?

434
00:36:35,541 --> 00:36:37,750
And your family must be present too.

435
00:36:37,833 --> 00:36:39,333
But he's never even met them!

436
00:36:40,166 --> 00:36:41,375
That's what he said.

437
00:36:54,375 --> 00:36:58,583
I have no family anymore, Lillo.
My wife left me, and she took my house.

438
00:36:59,208 --> 00:37:01,708
I swap alimony
with vouchers at the pizzeria.

439
00:37:04,958 --> 00:37:06,625
I basically live and sleep there.

440
00:37:07,666 --> 00:37:08,500
My son

441
00:37:09,083 --> 00:37:11,916
got lost in music and drugs.

442
00:37:13,250 --> 00:37:15,333
Crack, purple, Special K,

443
00:37:16,541 --> 00:37:21,125
CBD, THC, TNT,
and my wife says it's all my fault.

444
00:37:22,708 --> 00:37:25,208
My daughter ran away and she's missing.

445
00:37:25,291 --> 00:37:27,416
-And my wife--
-Says it's your fault.

446
00:37:27,500 --> 00:37:29,166
You haven't changed, Salvo.

447
00:37:29,958 --> 00:37:31,583
Lillo.

448
00:37:37,375 --> 00:37:38,583
Okay. Let's see now.

449
00:37:40,666 --> 00:37:41,875
Did you say "sell"?

450
00:37:42,458 --> 00:37:43,708
I said "see."

451
00:37:49,166 --> 00:37:51,208
How long has it been since you washed?

452
00:37:51,291 --> 00:37:53,583
Since you haven't let me
use your bathroom.

453
00:37:56,666 --> 00:38:00,041
Shall we go and scatter the ashes
on the top of the mountain?

454
00:38:00,125 --> 00:38:02,541
Can't you see the wind isn't mungibiddisi?

455
00:38:02,625 --> 00:38:03,833
-Tomorrow.
-Tomorrow.

456
00:38:07,375 --> 00:38:08,583
I love you, Lillo.

457
00:38:13,125 --> 00:38:13,958
Salvo.

458
00:38:14,666 --> 00:38:16,500
Do you know what Geronimo said?

459
00:38:17,291 --> 00:38:18,666
That you can't give in.

460
00:38:20,666 --> 00:38:21,583
You must fight.

461
00:38:22,375 --> 00:38:24,000
Until you're the last.

462
00:38:30,791 --> 00:38:32,375
Have you ever seen Dad cry?

463
00:38:34,375 --> 00:38:35,708
He doesn't have a heart.

464
00:38:44,541 --> 00:38:45,875
Damn slimesucker.

465
00:38:51,666 --> 00:38:52,500
What's this?

466
00:38:56,208 --> 00:38:57,416
Here's the tree.

467
00:38:57,500 --> 00:39:01,875
We place the tables near the oven,
and in the summer, we install a pergola.

468
00:39:02,791 --> 00:39:03,625
I like it.

469
00:39:05,333 --> 00:39:06,500
But the name sucks.

470
00:39:08,750 --> 00:39:09,583
Il Gelso?

471
00:39:10,791 --> 00:39:12,708
We need something more original.

472
00:39:14,541 --> 00:39:15,375
Sciuri Sciuri.

473
00:39:15,458 --> 00:39:17,083
I don't like Sciuri Sciuri.

474
00:39:17,166 --> 00:39:19,208
Shouldn't the majority decide?

475
00:39:19,291 --> 00:39:20,416
Yeah, the majority.

476
00:39:21,625 --> 00:39:22,750
But I'm the eldest.

477
00:39:35,125 --> 00:39:38,458
-The number you have…
-I don't know why he doesn't pick up.

478
00:39:38,541 --> 00:39:42,041
Ma'am, even if he answers,
I'll have to put the locks on.

479
00:39:42,125 --> 00:39:45,125
-The pizzeria is going on auction--
-What auction?

480
00:39:45,208 --> 00:39:48,291
-You never gave us a warning.
-Not even the army can drag me out!

481
00:39:48,375 --> 00:39:51,333
Come on, guys. Don't you start too.

482
00:39:51,416 --> 00:39:55,083
Be good, guys.
Now open the locks and we'll go. Okay?

483
00:39:55,166 --> 00:39:56,000
Come on.

484
00:39:56,625 --> 00:39:57,875
-What?
-The key.

485
00:39:59,958 --> 00:40:01,875
-The key--
-I ate it.

486
00:40:11,041 --> 00:40:13,166
-We're done.
-Ma'am, have a good day.

487
00:40:13,250 --> 00:40:14,833
-Goodbye.
-Goodbye.

488
00:40:22,666 --> 00:40:23,500
Mom.

489
00:40:25,166 --> 00:40:26,833
What's happening?

490
00:40:26,916 --> 00:40:29,541
Sweetheart, what are you doing here?

491
00:40:30,333 --> 00:40:33,791
Are you sure all the money
from the auction goes to the bank?

492
00:40:33,875 --> 00:40:39,541
Yes. Anyway, we couldn't buy it back.
I mean, we're not allowed at the auction.

493
00:40:40,625 --> 00:40:41,458
Good.

494
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:10,250
Get rid of that stupid face.
Who are you, and mainly, what do you want?

495
00:41:11,583 --> 00:41:15,166
Nice to meet you. I'm Alfonsino,
but everybody calls me Fofò.

496
00:41:17,875 --> 00:41:19,833
You're a master to me.

497
00:41:19,916 --> 00:41:23,500
I made a cover of your song
and launched it on the Internet.

498
00:41:23,583 --> 00:41:27,416
-I wanted you to hear it.
-What makes you think I'm interested?

499
00:41:28,708 --> 00:41:30,916
Come on. Piss off.

500
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:32,375
Redneck, go back home.

501
00:41:33,500 --> 00:41:34,333
Wait.

502
00:41:36,250 --> 00:41:37,333
I'll listen to it.

503
00:41:38,166 --> 00:41:40,041
Only if you let me make a phone call.

504
00:41:41,208 --> 00:41:42,041
Swear.

505
00:41:43,333 --> 00:41:44,166
I swear.

506
00:42:07,541 --> 00:42:11,291
I'M WAITING FOR YOU, CARME'

507
00:42:11,375 --> 00:42:13,916
I miss you tonight…

508
00:42:15,750 --> 00:42:17,583
So? What do you think?

509
00:42:18,541 --> 00:42:22,458
That you gotta get your ass kicked a lot
before you can do something good.

510
00:42:22,541 --> 00:42:25,291
-Too bad that I have almost 5,000 views.
-What?

511
00:42:25,375 --> 00:42:28,833
-5,000 views.
-I mean…

512
00:42:28,916 --> 00:42:33,125
You're trying to find long-term success
off of someone else's career?

513
00:42:33,208 --> 00:42:36,416
What are you talking about?
I only made this song.

514
00:42:36,916 --> 00:42:38,416
Wind is mungibiddisi.

515
00:42:39,125 --> 00:42:40,708
-Good.
-We can go.

516
00:42:40,791 --> 00:42:42,666
I'll get the stick and we'll go.

517
00:42:42,750 --> 00:42:45,791
Fofò. Get lost. We gotta do
something important.

518
00:42:53,750 --> 00:42:55,166
What are you doing here?

519
00:42:55,791 --> 00:42:56,625
Emma.

520
00:42:57,166 --> 00:43:00,916
-You're here too? Why?
-Thanks to you, they kicked me out, Dad.

521
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:03,583
What's it got to do with me?
I'll call the bank

522
00:43:03,666 --> 00:43:05,916
and they'll remember
my sermon till Christmas…

523
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:11,375
Pray to God you have a valid reason
why this fucking phone is always off.

524
00:43:11,458 --> 00:43:14,708
Did you want to leave me in the shit?
Do you know they seized Il Gelso?

525
00:43:14,791 --> 00:43:15,625
Jackass!

526
00:43:17,791 --> 00:43:22,333
-What do you think you'll do now?
-Teresa, can't you let me explain? I mean…

527
00:43:23,583 --> 00:43:27,333
It's the trap of neoliberalism.
It's a thing…

528
00:43:27,416 --> 00:43:29,125
While we're at it!

529
00:43:29,208 --> 00:43:31,208
Please, tell me who this whore is?

530
00:43:31,291 --> 00:43:33,625
Hey, watch your tongue. That's my mom.

531
00:43:33,708 --> 00:43:36,791
-Carmela is your mom?
-You have an illegitimate son too?

532
00:43:36,875 --> 00:43:38,333
-No.
-And didn't say anything?

533
00:43:39,375 --> 00:43:40,458
What the-- Ouch!

534
00:43:40,541 --> 00:43:43,041
-Are you crazy?
-You hid it in the bedside table!

535
00:43:43,125 --> 00:43:45,750
I'll kill you.
I'll take your life away. I swear to God!

536
00:43:45,833 --> 00:43:49,875
Bloody hell, Teresa. It's just a song!
There's nothing wrong with it!

537
00:43:49,958 --> 00:43:52,208
I wouldn't hide
it in the bedside table otherwise!

538
00:43:52,291 --> 00:43:55,250
I knew you'd say that, coward!

539
00:43:55,333 --> 00:43:56,208
Enzo.

540
00:43:57,166 --> 00:44:00,083
Talk some sense into your mother.
Please, help me.

541
00:44:05,250 --> 00:44:07,666
You used to sing Sceneggiate Napoletane,

542
00:44:08,250 --> 00:44:10,875
with that hairdo,
and you criticize my music?

543
00:44:11,833 --> 00:44:13,625
Tidy up your thoughts.

544
00:44:14,125 --> 00:44:16,666
Guys, let's go find a hotel.
Enough. Let's go.

545
00:44:17,416 --> 00:44:22,000
Salvo. You found your missing daughter,
and you didn't tell me?

546
00:44:22,083 --> 00:44:24,208
It's wonderful. We should celebrate.

547
00:44:26,291 --> 00:44:27,791
And who's this young man?

548
00:44:28,750 --> 00:44:29,833
Your son,

549
00:44:30,541 --> 00:44:33,750
the drug addict, DBC, THC, SPA…

550
00:44:33,833 --> 00:44:35,291
The lady, of course…

551
00:44:36,875 --> 00:44:40,833
She's your wife, isn't she?
The one who divorced you

552
00:44:41,458 --> 00:44:42,625
and left you broke.

553
00:44:43,416 --> 00:44:46,208
Excuse the interference. I'm Lillo.

554
00:44:47,125 --> 00:44:48,083
Salvo's brother.

555
00:44:48,916 --> 00:44:51,833
-His…
-Your brother, Dad?

556
00:44:51,916 --> 00:44:53,416
You have a brother?

557
00:44:54,125 --> 00:44:57,250
Yes, but he didn't tell you
because I don't exist for him.

558
00:45:00,583 --> 00:45:03,625
Hi, pleased to meet you.
I'm Teresa, Salvo's ex-wife.

559
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:17,000
Hi Lillo. Have you seen Fofò?
I don't know where to look anymore.

560
00:45:17,083 --> 00:45:20,625
Yes, he's here.
Look who came to see me, Salvo's family.

561
00:45:20,708 --> 00:45:23,041
-Salvo.
-She's Teresa, my sister-in-law.

562
00:45:23,625 --> 00:45:25,166
Nice to meet you. Carmela.

563
00:45:25,666 --> 00:45:27,833
Salvo. My God, it's been ages!

564
00:45:28,916 --> 00:45:29,875
Hello.

565
00:45:30,875 --> 00:45:33,833
-I'm sorry about your dad.
-These things happen.

566
00:45:33,916 --> 00:45:39,291
Carmela is a nice person.
She raised her son alone in Naples.

567
00:45:39,375 --> 00:45:42,125
-Nice to meet you. Carmela.
-Fofò's father was an asshole.

568
00:45:42,208 --> 00:45:44,000
He abandoned her when she was…

569
00:45:45,875 --> 00:45:49,833
-And she came back here about a year ago.
-Okay.

570
00:45:49,916 --> 00:45:52,791
Let's go home to do your homework
or I'll break your neck.

571
00:45:52,875 --> 00:45:54,708
-Mom, let's stay here.
-Why?

572
00:45:54,791 --> 00:45:59,083
I promised Enzo I'll show him
the video clip of Salvo's original song.

573
00:45:59,166 --> 00:46:01,000
-That video clip…
-Still around.

574
00:46:01,083 --> 00:46:02,791
I'd be glad if you stayed.

575
00:46:02,875 --> 00:46:05,208
Yeah, so you can tell us some things.

576
00:46:05,291 --> 00:46:06,916
Dad told us nothing about you.

577
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:09,750
-He didn't even tell us he had a brother.
-You didn't?

578
00:46:09,833 --> 00:46:11,875
-No.
-Maybe he wanted to surprise us.

579
00:46:11,958 --> 00:46:15,500
I don't like talking about myself.
I'm not that self-centered.

580
00:46:17,250 --> 00:46:18,083
Okay, then.

581
00:46:19,083 --> 00:46:21,500
Stay here, everyone. Refresh yourselves.

582
00:46:21,583 --> 00:46:24,416
-We'll eat something. No hotels, Teresa.
-Thanks.

583
00:46:24,500 --> 00:46:28,166
-There's room for everyone in this house.
-Thank you so much.

584
00:46:28,250 --> 00:46:30,375
-I'll deal with you later.
-The luggage.

585
00:46:30,458 --> 00:46:32,916
-You can leave it. No thieves here.
-Okay.

586
00:46:33,583 --> 00:46:37,000
When I said everyone,
I meant everyone but you.

587
00:46:37,083 --> 00:46:38,916
Stay in your part of the house.

588
00:46:40,416 --> 00:46:44,625
Dad, if there are any leftovers,
I'll make you a doggy bag.

589
00:46:47,916 --> 00:46:50,500
Be my guests.
Stay all squeezed like sardines

590
00:46:51,083 --> 00:46:54,041
while I enjoy my entire space for myself.

591
00:46:56,250 --> 00:46:58,166
In harmony with nature.

592
00:46:58,833 --> 00:47:01,375
What the fuck do you want? Hey!

593
00:47:12,208 --> 00:47:13,125
No way.

594
00:47:19,125 --> 00:47:20,125
Oh my God.

595
00:47:24,291 --> 00:47:27,875
I miss you tonight…

596
00:47:27,958 --> 00:47:30,208
He's really into it. Marvelous.

597
00:47:30,291 --> 00:47:31,916
See how good he is?

598
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:33,541
This can't be real.

599
00:47:35,375 --> 00:47:37,875
-Anyway, the song is nice.
-Yes, it's nice.

600
00:47:37,958 --> 00:47:40,666
-Not exactly joyful, let's say.
-There she is.

601
00:47:40,750 --> 00:47:43,833
-You were beautiful.
-Thanks. I had long hair…

602
00:47:43,916 --> 00:47:45,708
Your brother is shocked. Look.

603
00:47:47,041 --> 00:47:50,375
-And I lay awake…
-I feel emotional.

604
00:47:50,916 --> 00:47:53,750
-Here comes the instrumental bit.
-Thank God.

605
00:47:53,833 --> 00:47:56,500
A bit of a break from your dad singing.

606
00:47:58,416 --> 00:48:00,416
I miss you

607
00:48:00,500 --> 00:48:02,875
Carmela--
You need to show pain. That's not enough.

608
00:48:02,958 --> 00:48:07,166
I miss you, Carmela, tonight

609
00:48:09,708 --> 00:48:10,958
What an awful thing.

610
00:48:11,041 --> 00:48:13,625
I miss you tonight

611
00:48:14,875 --> 00:48:18,333
You, Christmas Star

612
00:48:18,416 --> 00:48:23,750
And I lay awake, Carmela

613
00:48:25,958 --> 00:48:29,833
But for you, I'm a betrayal

614
00:48:29,916 --> 00:48:33,625
An enemy during war

615
00:48:33,708 --> 00:48:37,041
I'm a door that you lock

616
00:48:39,500 --> 00:48:40,833
Carmela

617
00:48:43,208 --> 00:48:48,000
When he heard that I was in Naples,
he moved there, using pizza as an excuse.

618
00:48:48,083 --> 00:48:50,791
And he insisted on making this video.

619
00:48:50,875 --> 00:48:53,666
I didn't mind the song, so I said yes.

620
00:48:54,916 --> 00:48:58,708
I don't know, maybe because of this,
he deluded himself a bit.

621
00:48:58,791 --> 00:49:02,708
Let's say it was a kind
of unrequited love.

622
00:49:03,958 --> 00:49:05,958
But then this song was a flop.

623
00:49:06,041 --> 00:49:08,041
-Really?
-Strange, really.

624
00:49:08,750 --> 00:49:12,375
So then, he went to Milan,
and I never saw him again.

625
00:49:13,250 --> 00:49:15,750
Alfonsino's been listening to it
since he was little.

626
00:49:15,833 --> 00:49:17,166
Sweetheart, I'm sorry.

627
00:49:17,250 --> 00:49:20,250
When I was younger,
I thought Salvo was my dad.

628
00:49:20,333 --> 00:49:22,291
Consider yourself lucky he isn't.

629
00:49:22,375 --> 00:49:28,708
You died without any bell ringing

630
00:49:28,791 --> 00:49:32,833
And trallaleru lalleru lalleru lalleru

631
00:49:32,916 --> 00:49:35,750
Lalleru lalleru lallà

632
00:49:46,958 --> 00:49:49,208
-Two more beers, Don Angelo.
-Yes.

633
00:49:53,791 --> 00:49:54,625
Thanks.

634
00:49:58,250 --> 00:50:01,916
Your father was a good man.
Then he was caught by the evil eye.

635
00:50:03,458 --> 00:50:06,375
And his path crossed
with some really mean people.

636
00:50:06,458 --> 00:50:08,500
Who are these very mean people?

637
00:50:08,583 --> 00:50:10,000
Ask your brother.

638
00:50:11,750 --> 00:50:12,583
I also know

639
00:50:13,333 --> 00:50:15,125
that he once went to Milan,

640
00:50:15,208 --> 00:50:18,625
but he didn't have the guts
to go to your pizzeria.

641
00:50:26,916 --> 00:50:27,833
Salvo.

642
00:50:27,916 --> 00:50:32,750
Lallaleru lalleru lalleru
Lalleru lalleru lallà!

643
00:50:32,833 --> 00:50:34,041
"Carme',

644
00:50:34,125 --> 00:50:36,708
with your hand, you messed up my head,

645
00:50:37,291 --> 00:50:39,958
which burns and steals my thoughts."

646
00:50:40,041 --> 00:50:42,125
"Then it moves away and goes down."

647
00:50:42,208 --> 00:50:45,000
"It doesn't know
whether to beat or sing anymore."

648
00:50:45,083 --> 00:50:47,083
"I have no voice now, Carme'."

649
00:50:47,625 --> 00:50:51,083
"All I have left of you
is the spring, a big breath,

650
00:50:51,166 --> 00:50:52,583
a jump from the sky."

651
00:50:54,208 --> 00:50:55,625
-It's awful.
-Beautiful.

652
00:51:36,083 --> 00:51:38,125
It'll be hell divorcing at my age.

653
00:51:38,208 --> 00:51:40,875
Dad, why didn't you tell her
you were risking seizure?

654
00:51:43,125 --> 00:51:45,750
I tried,
but she always has something to do.

655
00:51:53,083 --> 00:51:55,583
-Sugar?
-No. Bitter like life.

656
00:51:56,958 --> 00:51:59,625
To me, you're a betrayal

657
00:52:00,291 --> 00:52:02,625
An enemy during…

658
00:52:06,333 --> 00:52:07,166
Night.

659
00:52:08,083 --> 00:52:11,666
You're a door opening

660
00:52:12,541 --> 00:52:13,875
Carmela

661
00:52:16,083 --> 00:52:16,916
Finished.

662
00:52:17,750 --> 00:52:18,666
That's enough.

663
00:52:20,166 --> 00:52:25,416
So, I'll explain it once more. I write
to the bank and ask for new installments.

664
00:52:25,500 --> 00:52:29,250
While Dad calls Dario
and pledges to give 50,000 in arrears,

665
00:52:29,333 --> 00:52:33,583
mortgaging our house in Milan.
This is the only way to stop the auction.

666
00:52:33,666 --> 00:52:35,458
No, honey, you can forget about it.

667
00:52:35,541 --> 00:52:38,500
Half of the house's mine.
Without my signature, he can do nothing.

668
00:52:38,583 --> 00:52:41,208
Calm down. There are always two options.

669
00:52:41,291 --> 00:52:43,333
-One is this.
-And the other one?

670
00:52:43,416 --> 00:52:45,666
I inherited half of the family house.

671
00:52:45,750 --> 00:52:49,791
The mayor fell in love with this place
and wants to retire here.

672
00:52:49,875 --> 00:52:53,958
I worked hard on him,
and I got a huge figure.

673
00:52:54,041 --> 00:52:56,208
I almost convinced Lillo to sell.

674
00:52:57,000 --> 00:53:00,125
But then you arrived,
and everything has gone to hell.

675
00:53:00,208 --> 00:53:03,125
-You nearly convinced him?
-I opened up his heart.

676
00:53:03,208 --> 00:53:05,250
You go and talk to that grumpy man.

677
00:53:06,041 --> 00:53:08,625
Shall we take a step at a time? Shall we?

678
00:53:08,708 --> 00:53:11,625
The mayor has given me till San Procopio.

679
00:53:11,708 --> 00:53:13,958
Little step? We need an elephant step.

680
00:53:14,041 --> 00:53:18,250
Exactly. Thus, you have to apologize.

681
00:53:18,333 --> 00:53:19,458
What for?

682
00:53:19,958 --> 00:53:22,833
For crossing him out,
stealing his name for the pizzeria

683
00:53:22,916 --> 00:53:25,541
and the idea of the pizzeria.
Shall I go on?

684
00:53:25,625 --> 00:53:29,625
I refuse to regress to adolescence
because my brother's stuck there

685
00:53:29,708 --> 00:53:31,500
and my wife dropped to his level.

686
00:53:32,166 --> 00:53:34,500
Look, you know what? Do as you please.

687
00:53:37,125 --> 00:53:40,166
-You're leaving already?
-We made some progress since this morning.

688
00:53:40,250 --> 00:53:42,916
Five minutes ago we were about to divorce.

689
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:46,125
You didn't even teach
that poor man how to make pizza.

690
00:53:46,208 --> 00:53:48,916
Did he tell you
all my fucking business in just one night?

691
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:51,625
Come on, Dad. It's easy. Repeat after me,

692
00:53:51,708 --> 00:53:54,291
"I wanted to say I'm sorry."

693
00:53:55,875 --> 00:53:56,708
Listen, Lillo.

694
00:53:57,208 --> 00:53:59,583
I wanted to say… You know that

695
00:53:59,666 --> 00:54:03,000
with the money from the house,
you could reopen the pizzeria?

696
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:09,916
Go on. Roll the dough.

697
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:12,625
You want to teach me
how to make pizza now after 40 years?

698
00:54:12,708 --> 00:54:14,500
Jeez, you're so fussy!

699
00:54:14,583 --> 00:54:15,750
Come on. Come here.

700
00:54:17,541 --> 00:54:18,416
Do what I do.

701
00:54:19,458 --> 00:54:22,166
Widen the dough, thoroughly, okay?

702
00:54:22,958 --> 00:54:24,541
Then with your fingertips…

703
00:54:25,125 --> 00:54:28,000
Loosen up, soft on your legs. That's it.

704
00:54:28,916 --> 00:54:30,458
See, you're good at it.

705
00:54:32,541 --> 00:54:34,208
You're a born pizza maker.

706
00:54:36,500 --> 00:54:38,250
I'll give you the franchise.

707
00:54:38,333 --> 00:54:39,958
Il Gelso 2.

708
00:54:40,458 --> 00:54:43,958
It would be like realizing
our old project from afar.

709
00:54:44,541 --> 00:54:48,916
-From 1,500 kilometers?
-Jeez! You're still so fussy.

710
00:54:49,833 --> 00:54:53,041
All right, you are Il Gelso,
and I'll be Il Gelso 2.

711
00:54:54,291 --> 00:54:55,666
Lay the tomato.

712
00:54:55,750 --> 00:54:59,000
Add a bit of basil,
a handful of mozzarella,

713
00:54:59,541 --> 00:55:03,000
then you add a bit of olive oil,
if you like. Now you try.

714
00:55:04,625 --> 00:55:06,708
Now take a handful of mozzarella.

715
00:55:07,333 --> 00:55:11,166
-Put it on, that's too much, but…
-I'll put it on the edges.

716
00:55:11,666 --> 00:55:14,208
-You'll eat this one.
-What's wrong with it?

717
00:55:14,291 --> 00:55:17,125
Take the peel. Wait. It's not--

718
00:55:17,208 --> 00:55:19,250
Come closer. Well done.

719
00:55:20,208 --> 00:55:23,541
Perfect. Let's make a calzone with this,
which is better.

720
00:55:23,625 --> 00:55:27,083
Let's make a calzone.
This is yours. Put it in the oven.

721
00:55:27,166 --> 00:55:31,833
I had a look, and there are only
a few competitors in such a wide area.

722
00:55:31,916 --> 00:55:33,333
-Who?
-"Competitor."

723
00:55:33,416 --> 00:55:36,708
She got a master's degree in economics
and now she speaks like this.

724
00:55:36,791 --> 00:55:39,791
-I mean, there isn't a pizzeria nearby?
-Tell me about it.

725
00:55:39,875 --> 00:55:44,375
To eat a pizza with Fofò,
I end up spending more on gas.

726
00:55:44,458 --> 00:55:47,750
Because there are no competitors.

727
00:55:47,833 --> 00:55:50,750
And as a business administrator,
you know about this…

728
00:55:52,291 --> 00:55:53,333
Who wants a beer?

729
00:55:55,875 --> 00:55:57,708
Wait. Give it one more minute.

730
00:55:59,291 --> 00:56:03,250
Mozzarella took off its clothes

731
00:56:03,333 --> 00:56:06,625
And a hug melts into your chest

732
00:56:06,708 --> 00:56:10,666
And you forget all your suffering!

733
00:56:12,583 --> 00:56:13,875
Lillo helped me too.

734
00:56:13,958 --> 00:56:15,958
A round of applause for Lillo.

735
00:56:17,958 --> 00:56:20,000
Wow, Uncle.

736
00:56:20,083 --> 00:56:22,000
Some guys have all the luck.

737
00:56:22,083 --> 00:56:23,666
A little trim maybe…

738
00:56:26,291 --> 00:56:27,791
I'd like to make a toast.

739
00:56:29,666 --> 00:56:30,791
I drink to you,

740
00:56:31,375 --> 00:56:32,583
long-lost brother,

741
00:56:33,375 --> 00:56:36,166
in the hope of becoming business partners

742
00:56:36,250 --> 00:56:37,125
at a distance.

743
00:56:37,791 --> 00:56:41,625
-He made a rhyme.
-Of course. Without it, it's not a toast.

744
00:56:41,708 --> 00:56:42,791
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

745
00:56:42,875 --> 00:56:44,666
-Cheers, sweetheart.
-Cheers.

746
00:56:50,750 --> 00:56:51,958
To this family.

747
00:56:52,541 --> 00:56:53,875
To this family.

748
00:56:58,000 --> 00:56:58,833
So,

749
00:57:00,041 --> 00:57:02,000
tomorrow, we fulfill

750
00:57:03,458 --> 00:57:04,625
our old man's will

751
00:57:05,375 --> 00:57:06,750
on the top of the hill,

752
00:57:07,291 --> 00:57:09,375
all together, okay?

753
00:57:10,916 --> 00:57:11,791
All together.

754
00:57:13,041 --> 00:57:15,916
-Enjoy your meal, or it'll get cold.
-Enjoy your meal.

755
00:57:25,375 --> 00:57:27,000
Damn. Where is he?

756
00:57:27,541 --> 00:57:29,375
This farce will never end.

757
00:57:29,458 --> 00:57:31,375
-Did you apologize to him?
-Sure.

758
00:57:32,666 --> 00:57:35,500
I mean, I didn't use those exact words.

759
00:57:35,583 --> 00:57:38,708
-But it was implied.
-Because you are still shitty like always.

760
00:57:38,791 --> 00:57:40,958
Oh well. That's an improvement.

761
00:57:41,041 --> 00:57:43,041
From shithead to shitty.

762
00:57:43,125 --> 00:57:45,666
-Now it's my fault, is it?
-It's not mine.

763
00:57:48,916 --> 00:57:51,833
Grandpa, this is Enzo.
Enzo, this is Grandpa.

764
00:57:51,916 --> 00:57:53,041
Here. Do something.

765
00:57:56,458 --> 00:57:57,291
Lillo!

766
00:57:58,208 --> 00:58:00,333
Lillo. We're waiting for you.

767
00:58:12,791 --> 00:58:14,958
Impressive how much our uncle reads.

768
00:58:15,875 --> 00:58:18,291
I've always said too much culture is bad.

769
00:58:20,083 --> 00:58:22,916
Maybe he's there already?
He always gets up at dawn.

770
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:25,208
Blessed is he who sleeps. Let's go.

771
00:58:28,333 --> 00:58:31,208
I miss you tonight

772
00:58:31,291 --> 00:58:33,250
Indiana Jones, are you sure?

773
00:58:33,333 --> 00:58:35,625
You asking me every two minutes isn't fun!

774
00:58:35,708 --> 00:58:37,166
Are you sure?

775
00:58:38,916 --> 00:58:40,500
My dear, I grew up here.

776
00:58:54,916 --> 00:58:55,750
This way.

777
00:58:56,250 --> 00:58:57,750
Okay. If he grew up here…

778
00:58:58,583 --> 00:59:02,125
I didn't think it was so urgent.
You should have explained it better.

779
00:59:02,208 --> 00:59:06,375
-If you hide things from me…
-I remind you, you hid your brother.

780
00:59:06,458 --> 00:59:09,333
You didn't ask me
if I had a brother, did you?

781
00:59:09,416 --> 00:59:12,083
Did you ask me
if I quit my master's studies?

782
00:59:12,166 --> 00:59:13,750
-No, I didn't.
-Exactly.

783
00:59:14,791 --> 00:59:17,750
-What the fuck did you do?
-Why do you act like this?

784
00:59:17,833 --> 00:59:22,166
You intimidate me. I was opening up
with you. I won't talk to you anymore.

785
00:59:22,250 --> 00:59:23,166
Is there more?

786
00:59:24,875 --> 00:59:27,041
It's a boar. I know it's a boar!

787
00:59:31,125 --> 00:59:34,291
But it's Lillo.
Lillo, where are you going? It's us.

788
00:59:35,916 --> 00:59:38,291
Thank God the head
of the family's protecting us.

789
00:59:38,375 --> 00:59:40,791
I was watching your back.

790
00:59:41,375 --> 00:59:42,958
Let's follow him. Come on.

791
00:59:43,833 --> 00:59:47,458
He's playing cowboys
and Indians, silly man. Lillo!

792
00:59:48,791 --> 00:59:49,875
Lillo!

793
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:53,541
Little brother, I saw you.

794
00:59:54,375 --> 00:59:57,666
Come out.
I know that you want me to sweat for it.

795
00:59:58,375 --> 01:00:02,916
That's fine, but a prank isn't funny
if it goes on for too long.

796
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:16,208
I didn't forget. You stole my shoes.

797
01:00:18,083 --> 01:00:18,958
Mazzacana.

798
01:00:19,916 --> 01:00:22,041
Have you been barefoot for 40 years?

799
01:00:44,458 --> 01:00:46,208
-Good afternoon.
-Hello.

800
01:00:53,791 --> 01:00:57,833
-Did you really steal his shoes?
-He's confusing me with your uncle.

801
01:00:58,875 --> 01:01:01,208
How will you manage without shoes now?

802
01:01:01,291 --> 01:01:04,750
He managed for 40 years.
I will make it for 40 minutes.

803
01:01:06,416 --> 01:01:07,250
See?

804
01:01:14,416 --> 01:01:15,250
Lillo?

805
01:01:18,791 --> 01:01:21,541
-I miss you, Uncle Lillo
-Uncle?

806
01:01:21,625 --> 01:01:22,541
Lillo?

807
01:01:51,166 --> 01:01:52,041
See?

808
01:01:52,791 --> 01:01:54,166
I added a stage too.

809
01:01:55,875 --> 01:01:58,375
So you can sing Neapolitan songs,
how you like it.

810
01:01:58,458 --> 01:02:03,458
Good idea. And we could also host
Communions, confirmations, weddings…

811
01:02:04,333 --> 01:02:07,375
And give me this poison

812
01:02:07,916 --> 01:02:11,333
Don't wait until tomorrow

813
01:02:11,416 --> 01:02:14,375
Regardless

814
01:02:15,500 --> 01:02:20,083
Whether you kill me or not
I won't tell you anything

815
01:02:20,666 --> 01:02:22,583
Wow! This pizza is delicious!

816
01:02:22,666 --> 01:02:24,666
Can I order one more?

817
01:02:24,750 --> 01:02:27,250
I'll give you a nice "pizza" in your face.

818
01:02:28,458 --> 01:02:29,708
How is this then?

819
01:02:30,750 --> 01:02:34,500
I work hard, spitting blood,
and you're here dicking around?

820
01:02:36,916 --> 01:02:38,125
What's this?

821
01:02:42,958 --> 01:02:43,875
Pizzeria

822
01:02:44,541 --> 01:02:45,625
Il Gelso.

823
01:02:49,541 --> 01:02:51,541
Whose idea is this? Yours?

824
01:02:55,375 --> 01:02:58,958
You just say it to protect your brother,
aka "useless thing."

825
01:02:59,833 --> 01:03:02,666
Salvo, I tell you something,
and write it here.

826
01:03:03,208 --> 01:03:04,583
"He who lives upon hope

827
01:03:06,041 --> 01:03:07,375
will die fasting."

828
01:03:08,041 --> 01:03:10,625
Tonight you'll suck snails' slime.

829
01:03:10,708 --> 01:03:11,666
And with this…

830
01:03:13,791 --> 01:03:14,625
With this,

831
01:03:15,375 --> 01:03:17,500
you can wipe your ass!

832
01:03:18,875 --> 01:03:19,916
The engineer.

833
01:03:20,500 --> 01:03:23,083
We have an engineer at home, an architect,

834
01:03:23,166 --> 01:03:25,000
a singer. "And give me this poison."

835
01:03:25,833 --> 01:03:27,166
He wants to do everything!

836
01:03:29,708 --> 01:03:30,583
Get to work!

837
01:03:40,541 --> 01:03:42,208
What's that, a treasure map?

838
01:03:49,000 --> 01:03:49,916
Hey, Dad.

839
01:03:50,583 --> 01:03:51,916
Don't blame yourself.

840
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:57,500
Some years ago,
I also wrote on the wall in the cellar,

841
01:03:58,625 --> 01:04:00,083
"Salvo, shit pizza."

842
01:04:22,458 --> 01:04:25,708
Little brother,
see how I fulfill our old man's wishes!

843
01:04:27,250 --> 01:04:31,291
Now, slimesucker, you're free to nag
all the microfauna you'll meet.

844
01:04:52,791 --> 01:04:56,000
I knew I shouldn't have come back
to this shitty place.

845
01:05:01,791 --> 01:05:03,750
When was the last time you slept?

846
01:05:05,916 --> 01:05:09,166
A whole life criticizing your dad,
then you do the same things.

847
01:05:09,250 --> 01:05:11,291
Proud, touchy.

848
01:05:12,041 --> 01:05:14,166
Constantly dwelling on the past.

849
01:05:14,250 --> 01:05:16,416
-You know what my mom used to say?
-What?

850
01:05:16,500 --> 01:05:20,500
"If you walk looking back,
you'll bang your head."

851
01:05:20,583 --> 01:05:22,250
Luckily, I listened to her.

852
01:05:22,333 --> 01:05:27,041
Or else I'd still be in Naples
getting abused by Fofò's father.

853
01:05:27,125 --> 01:05:30,416
I'm glad you listened to her,
or you wouldn't be here.

854
01:05:31,208 --> 01:05:33,250
Then you should listen to her too.

855
01:05:35,208 --> 01:05:37,583
That's why I decided to go "all in."

856
01:05:37,666 --> 01:05:38,500
"All in"?

857
01:05:39,458 --> 01:05:41,375
What's that, like "coming out"?

858
01:05:41,458 --> 01:05:44,041
-Jeez, I didn't know.
-What are you talking about?

859
01:05:44,125 --> 01:05:47,041
-That's why you get waxed. You're gay!
-What are you saying?

860
01:05:47,125 --> 01:05:48,166
What nice news.

861
01:05:48,250 --> 01:05:51,458
Cut it out, Carmela.
"All in" is a poker thing,

862
01:05:51,541 --> 01:05:53,333
when you risk all you have.

863
01:05:53,416 --> 01:05:57,208
If you lose, you're screwed,
but if you win, you really win.

864
01:05:58,125 --> 01:06:00,208
If I don't do it now,
I won't ever be able to.

865
01:06:00,291 --> 01:06:02,041
Well done, Lillo. Thank God.

866
01:06:02,125 --> 01:06:05,500
Once in a while, a bit of bravery
in life is good for you.

867
01:06:06,375 --> 01:06:07,541
What are those?

868
01:06:08,125 --> 01:06:11,583
Who knows. Since I've been back,
nearly every morning,

869
01:06:11,666 --> 01:06:13,333
I find one outside the door.

870
01:06:14,125 --> 01:06:16,166
-Why don't you open them?
-No.

871
01:06:16,250 --> 01:06:19,708
I'll open them when whoever leaves them
has the guts to show himself.

872
01:06:21,416 --> 01:06:22,333
Come on.

873
01:06:22,416 --> 01:06:24,250
On the count of three. One,

874
01:06:24,916 --> 01:06:25,750
two!

875
01:06:27,875 --> 01:06:30,375
-Didn't you say three?
-I forgot.

876
01:06:30,458 --> 01:06:33,833
Do you know what your son calls me?
"Shit pizza."

877
01:06:33,916 --> 01:06:34,750
Really?

878
01:06:35,708 --> 01:06:36,916
Did you know that?

879
01:06:37,958 --> 01:06:38,791
You too?

880
01:06:42,625 --> 01:06:46,666
I'm sorry. Could you stop a moment?
I'd like to tell you something.

881
01:06:46,750 --> 01:06:48,041
Me too.

882
01:06:48,125 --> 01:06:51,916
I miss you, Carmela

883
01:06:52,000 --> 01:06:53,791
Caress me

884
01:06:54,291 --> 01:06:56,083
-Dad!
-No! What are you doing?

885
01:06:56,166 --> 01:06:58,000
-Dad!
-Stop it! Let go of him!

886
01:06:58,833 --> 01:07:00,208
Have you gone mad?

887
01:07:02,166 --> 01:07:05,458
He's taking the piss.
You think I have an illegitimate son.

888
01:07:05,541 --> 01:07:08,916
She quit her master's,
and I'm the one who's gone mad?

889
01:07:10,583 --> 01:07:12,333
You're all with Lillo.

890
01:07:12,416 --> 01:07:14,791
You brought me here
to make me dwell on my past.

891
01:07:17,291 --> 01:07:19,083
Bravo. Always blaming others!

892
01:07:21,041 --> 01:07:21,875
Gosh.

893
01:07:24,833 --> 01:07:26,250
Did you quit your master's?

894
01:08:11,125 --> 01:08:12,083
Sorry, Lillo.

895
01:08:13,041 --> 01:08:16,166
Can I ask you
how did your brother convince you?

896
01:08:24,458 --> 01:08:25,291
Sure.

897
01:08:41,791 --> 01:08:42,625
Beautiful.

898
01:08:48,291 --> 01:08:52,541
Emma! It's not that way.
It's this way. We're almost there!

899
01:08:54,500 --> 01:08:56,958
You'll have to find your way back!

900
01:08:57,041 --> 01:08:59,833
I won't call the forest ranger!

901
01:09:01,541 --> 01:09:02,750
I'm going!

902
01:09:04,416 --> 01:09:05,250
Bye!

903
01:09:06,833 --> 01:09:08,625
You too? But I'm barefoot.

904
01:09:10,125 --> 01:09:10,958
I'm going!

905
01:09:54,916 --> 01:09:56,250
Did you see Mazzacana?

906
01:10:03,375 --> 01:10:06,041
Where were you?
We've been looking for you all day.

907
01:10:06,541 --> 01:10:09,083
The wind isn't mungibiddisi.
I went for a walk.

908
01:10:09,166 --> 01:10:11,750
But what's this wind blowing mungibuddisi?

909
01:10:11,833 --> 01:10:15,666
Wind is mungibiddisi when it's
a wind coming from the mountain.

910
01:10:17,583 --> 01:10:20,041
A wind that gets into your bones,
a wind of change.

911
01:10:22,625 --> 01:10:24,416
Are you playing games with me?

912
01:10:25,041 --> 01:10:28,541
Did you plan everything
so that I'd find it there? Did you?

913
01:10:29,333 --> 01:10:30,250
Dad ripped this up

914
01:10:30,333 --> 01:10:33,625
because he didn't want to admit
that you were right and the idea was good.

915
01:10:34,208 --> 01:10:35,625
Then he patched it up.

916
01:10:36,625 --> 01:10:38,416
Because he hoped you'd come back.

917
01:10:40,708 --> 01:10:41,666
And I buried it.

918
01:10:44,958 --> 01:10:47,041
Let's go and fetch some oil.

919
01:10:47,541 --> 01:10:48,958
Will you cut some bread?

920
01:11:07,166 --> 01:11:08,750
Snails ate Dad up.

921
01:11:12,166 --> 01:11:14,125
He asked Peppu Sinnaco for money.

922
01:11:16,333 --> 01:11:18,083
And that bastard usurer

923
01:11:19,000 --> 01:11:20,583
took advantage of that.

924
01:11:23,166 --> 01:11:24,000
Here. Try it.

925
01:11:39,666 --> 01:11:40,916
Dad was proud of you.

926
01:11:42,833 --> 01:11:44,500
His pride zipped his mouth.

927
01:11:53,083 --> 01:11:54,291
And I trusted you.

928
01:12:03,291 --> 01:12:04,916
Does your ass hurt?

929
01:12:05,000 --> 01:12:05,833
Shut up.

930
01:12:06,375 --> 01:12:09,458
Idiot. You're lucky
I'm the only one who gets blamed.

931
01:12:17,333 --> 01:12:20,541
-Shall we write him a few words, Salvo?
-Write what?

932
01:12:21,708 --> 01:12:22,583
"Dear Father,

933
01:12:23,625 --> 01:12:24,583
without 'dear'."

934
01:12:25,666 --> 01:12:31,125
"We ran away because any other place
is better than here."

935
01:12:32,291 --> 01:12:38,250
"But don't worry, the belts you gave us
will be paid back with interest."

936
01:12:41,208 --> 01:12:44,666
He took all the gas.
Damn slimesucker. Lillo, let's go.

937
01:12:46,250 --> 01:12:47,375
Lillo! Let's go!

938
01:12:48,416 --> 01:12:52,666
I wrote to Dad, also on your behalf,
that he shouldn't be angry with us,

939
01:12:52,750 --> 01:12:55,375
and that we'll come back when we're rich.

940
01:12:57,291 --> 01:13:00,500
Salvo, are you sure
it's the right night to run away?

941
01:13:01,083 --> 01:13:02,666
Are you shitting yourself?

942
01:13:02,750 --> 01:13:05,583
If you say you wanna do something,
you gotta go till the end.

943
01:13:05,666 --> 01:13:07,125
You said it, didn't you?

944
01:13:08,083 --> 01:13:09,000
Lillo!

945
01:13:09,083 --> 01:13:11,833
-Salvo, help me!
-Lillo, did you hurt yourself?

946
01:13:11,916 --> 01:13:14,250
-Help me!
-Lillo! Salvo!

947
01:13:14,333 --> 01:13:16,916
-How am I gonna get you out of there?
-Help me!

948
01:13:17,000 --> 01:13:19,958
-Come here.
-I can't reach it!

949
01:13:20,083 --> 01:13:22,208
-Come! Jump!
-You come down here.

950
01:13:22,291 --> 01:13:26,833
No, I can't come down in the hole.
We'll both be stuck! Jump. Find a way.

951
01:13:26,916 --> 01:13:29,291
-Salvo! Lillo!
-Almost there.

952
01:13:29,375 --> 01:13:31,500
-Is it you two?
-Reach down.

953
01:13:32,666 --> 01:13:34,625
Lillo, quick! Your hand, quick!

954
01:13:34,708 --> 01:13:35,708
Where are you going?

955
01:13:35,791 --> 01:13:37,458
-Give me your hand!
-I can't reach!

956
01:13:37,541 --> 01:13:41,583
-Your hand, quick, Lillo. He's coming.
-Come down. Lift me up.

957
01:13:41,666 --> 01:13:44,166
Lillo. I fought.

958
01:13:44,250 --> 01:13:47,416
-No, Salvo.
-I'm the last one standing.

959
01:13:47,500 --> 01:13:51,166
-If I catch you! I'll deal with you later!
-I'm sorry. I swear.

960
01:13:51,250 --> 01:13:55,791
-I'll be in touch.
-No, Salvo! Don't leave me! Salvo!

961
01:13:55,875 --> 01:13:56,833
Salvo.

962
01:14:07,500 --> 01:14:08,833
The night we ran away,

963
01:14:10,958 --> 01:14:13,291
I knew you fell in the hole on purpose.

964
01:14:14,375 --> 01:14:15,875
You didn't want to leave.

965
01:14:16,500 --> 01:14:19,958
You hoped the old man would catch us,
so I couldn't run away either.

966
01:14:20,041 --> 01:14:23,083
This is what you tell yourself.
The truth is you abandoned me.

967
01:14:23,166 --> 01:14:26,750
-You threw me like an anchor with no rope.
-Are you saying I betrayed you?

968
01:14:33,000 --> 01:14:37,458
You are just jealous.

969
01:14:37,541 --> 01:14:40,625
It's not my fault
if your life went the way it did.

970
01:14:40,708 --> 01:14:43,166
But now that you can change it,

971
01:14:44,125 --> 01:14:48,666
only because I'll gain something,
you cling to everything to avoid selling.

972
01:14:49,916 --> 01:14:51,333
Why are you saying this?

973
01:14:51,416 --> 01:14:54,208
-I went to the mayor's and signed.
-I'm telling--

974
01:14:58,333 --> 01:15:01,125
The cards are on the table.
Now it's your turn.

975
01:15:01,750 --> 01:15:06,458
My dear Salvo, you have to decide
whether to save our family's house

976
01:15:06,541 --> 01:15:08,583
or save your own pale ass.

977
01:15:10,125 --> 01:15:11,416
Like you always have.

978
01:15:16,250 --> 01:15:18,166
Get the bread and shut the door.

979
01:15:50,666 --> 01:15:52,750
So? What do you think?

980
01:15:54,583 --> 01:15:59,291
Excuse my honesty,
but this "stomp" is not my thing.

981
01:16:03,708 --> 01:16:07,625
-No way. I can't believe it.
-No, trust me. I really don't like it.

982
01:16:07,708 --> 01:16:12,458
My stupid sister sent
my demo to the producer in Amsterdam.

983
01:16:12,541 --> 01:16:16,750
-Aren't you happy?
-No, I'm not happy. He says it sucks.

984
01:16:16,833 --> 01:16:18,125
And he's right.

985
01:16:18,208 --> 01:16:22,083
This "stomp" without a bit
of Neapolitan ain't worth shit.

986
01:16:27,041 --> 01:16:29,750
As if that's a way
to break up with a girl!

987
01:16:30,250 --> 01:16:34,333
-He disappeared into thin air.
-Stop it. You sound like you've been left.

988
01:16:34,416 --> 01:16:36,416
Jerk. Coward.

989
01:16:36,500 --> 01:16:37,833
-Yokel.
-Yokel!

990
01:16:37,916 --> 01:16:41,083
I'll find him. I swear to God
I'll take a flight to Amsterdam

991
01:16:41,166 --> 01:16:43,416
and have him arrested! Bastard.

992
01:16:44,000 --> 01:16:44,875
Cuckold.

993
01:16:44,958 --> 01:16:48,375
-Cuckold.
-Mom! It's my fault. I messed up.

994
01:16:51,958 --> 01:16:55,541
Honey? What's up? Are you sick?

995
01:16:56,375 --> 01:16:57,833
Hey. Breathe.

996
01:16:59,125 --> 01:17:01,041
There. She got upset. See?

997
01:17:02,125 --> 01:17:03,416
Bloody scoundrel.

998
01:17:03,500 --> 01:17:06,666
Honey, I think
it could have been your uncle's salami.

999
01:17:07,500 --> 01:17:10,666
It's very tasty,
but the food here is very rich so…

1000
01:17:17,541 --> 01:17:22,083
-Here. You'll feel better now, lighter.
-Here. Drink some water.

1001
01:17:22,166 --> 01:17:23,750
How's that? Better?

1002
01:17:24,250 --> 01:17:28,041
I remember when I was pregnant.
The first months, I lived in the bathroom.

1003
01:17:33,083 --> 01:17:36,416
Oh my God. Of course.
How did I not get it?

1004
01:17:37,125 --> 01:17:38,083
Sweetheart.

1005
01:17:39,250 --> 01:17:41,750
-Have you seen a gynecologist?
-Never.

1006
01:17:41,833 --> 01:17:46,000
Never? How come?
It's bad you've never been.

1007
01:17:47,208 --> 01:17:49,541
-No.
-Can you do it now?

1008
01:17:49,625 --> 01:17:51,166
-Yes.
-Is it too late?

1009
01:17:51,250 --> 01:17:53,000
-No.
-I don't remember.

1010
01:17:53,083 --> 01:17:55,833
-God. She's sick…
-What's wrong? Come here.

1011
01:17:55,916 --> 01:17:58,041
-Come and sit down.
-I can't breathe.

1012
01:17:58,125 --> 01:18:01,250
No. Take a deep breath. Deep.

1013
01:18:02,375 --> 01:18:04,458
Again. There. Yes, have some water.

1014
01:18:17,125 --> 01:18:20,291
I miss you tonight

1015
01:18:20,375 --> 01:18:23,458
A faraway caress

1016
01:18:23,541 --> 01:18:26,875
I miss you tonight

1017
01:18:26,958 --> 01:18:30,500
You, in my heart, and it hurts

1018
01:18:30,583 --> 01:18:32,500
I miss you tonight

1019
01:18:32,583 --> 01:18:36,041
You, Christmas Star

1020
01:18:36,666 --> 01:18:39,958
And I lay awake

1021
01:18:40,041 --> 01:18:42,208
Carmela

1022
01:18:43,083 --> 01:18:45,916
To you, I am a betrayal

1023
01:18:46,000 --> 01:18:48,500
An enemy during war

1024
01:18:49,250 --> 01:18:52,791
A door that you lock

1025
01:18:52,875 --> 01:18:53,791
Carmela

1026
01:19:09,625 --> 01:19:13,458
People would do anything for power.
I'm not interested in that.

1027
01:19:14,958 --> 01:19:17,416
A busy life and lethargic sex

1028
01:19:17,500 --> 01:19:20,500
haven't allowed me to have heirs.

1029
01:19:20,583 --> 01:19:23,916
For this reason, I wanted to leave a mark.

1030
01:19:24,791 --> 01:19:26,125
Can you keep a secret?

1031
01:19:30,166 --> 01:19:32,666
The new stadium for Aci Fontana.

1032
01:19:36,041 --> 01:19:38,333
At least the tree stayed. I'm glad.

1033
01:19:39,916 --> 01:19:40,875
It'll be cut down

1034
01:19:41,375 --> 01:19:45,333
and it will be commemorated
by a more stylish mulberry tree

1035
01:19:45,416 --> 01:19:46,791
in Swedish fiberboard.

1036
01:19:47,416 --> 01:19:49,333
Placed at the entrance to the VIP Area.

1037
01:19:49,416 --> 01:19:51,583
I insisted on this

1038
01:19:51,666 --> 01:19:53,875
to honor your father's memory.

1039
01:19:54,458 --> 01:19:55,291
Thanks.

1040
01:19:56,541 --> 01:20:01,541
I'm sorry, but weren't you against it?
Didn't you say you liked the ecosystem?

1041
01:20:01,625 --> 01:20:05,166
Yes. But there's one thing
I like more than the ecosystem.

1042
01:20:05,250 --> 01:20:06,875
-Football?
-Money.

1043
01:20:07,541 --> 01:20:10,416
Damn it, how much I love
the beautiful money.

1044
01:20:10,500 --> 01:20:14,708
I knew right away
you're not moralistic like your brother.

1045
01:20:14,791 --> 01:20:16,416
You're an entrepreneur.

1046
01:20:18,625 --> 01:20:20,875
I'm enchanted every time I look at it.

1047
01:20:22,125 --> 01:20:24,208
A watched pot never boils.

1048
01:20:24,291 --> 01:20:26,500
Shall we let this pot boil?

1049
01:20:38,708 --> 01:20:39,708
An entrepreneur.

1050
01:20:58,333 --> 01:20:59,458
What are you doing?

1051
01:21:00,708 --> 01:21:01,666
Don't pull that face.

1052
01:21:01,750 --> 01:21:05,500
-You went to the Town Hall. You signed.
-What are you doing?

1053
01:21:05,583 --> 01:21:09,833
I won't give that jerk the satisfaction
of cutting down my mulberry. I'll do it.

1054
01:21:09,916 --> 01:21:12,666
You wanna cut down the mulberry?
What are you thinking?

1055
01:21:12,750 --> 01:21:15,416
He wants to demolish our whole property.
Don't you get it?

1056
01:21:15,500 --> 01:21:21,000
Ah! I know it all! I don't sign,
then I sign, then he passes the ball.

1057
01:21:21,083 --> 01:21:24,208
Then he gets angry if I sign.
What the fuck is in your head?

1058
01:21:24,291 --> 01:21:26,416
I had a doubt in my head but not anymore.

1059
01:21:27,083 --> 01:21:30,250
Give me the urn back
and get the fuck out of here.

1060
01:21:31,083 --> 01:21:32,500
-The urn?
-That's right.

1061
01:21:32,583 --> 01:21:35,416
-That vase with inside…
-Precisely.

1062
01:21:36,166 --> 01:21:37,833
That-- That box?

1063
01:21:38,416 --> 01:21:43,000
That… We went to the top of the mountain…

1064
01:21:43,083 --> 01:21:45,208
-But we didn't intend--
-What are you saying?

1065
01:21:45,291 --> 01:21:48,125
-I was saying--
-Salvo, what?

1066
01:21:48,208 --> 01:21:51,083
-Do you want it to end badly?
-No. The wind blew.

1067
01:21:51,166 --> 01:21:53,625
And Dad is now in the microfauna.

1068
01:21:53,708 --> 01:21:56,166
-He's happy--
-Cain!

1069
01:21:56,250 --> 01:21:58,125
-What Cain? You Cain.
-Cain!

1070
01:21:58,208 --> 01:21:59,500
-Cain!
-Easy!

1071
01:22:00,125 --> 01:22:03,291
Cain. You sold
your family for 4,000 Lira. Cain!

1072
01:22:04,958 --> 01:22:07,500
-You signed!
-Suck.

1073
01:22:09,041 --> 01:22:11,458
-You signed!
-Suck.

1074
01:22:26,000 --> 01:22:27,125
How are you, Mayor?

1075
01:22:28,083 --> 01:22:31,666
-Don't touch me! Go away!
-Are you all right?

1076
01:22:31,750 --> 01:22:34,375
Everyone get out!

1077
01:22:36,708 --> 01:22:39,000
Suck. I signed "Suck."

1078
01:22:39,583 --> 01:22:40,458
"Suck."

1079
01:22:41,708 --> 01:22:44,375
S-U-C-K.

1080
01:22:47,541 --> 01:22:49,541
Which is also an anagram for "Sorry."

1081
01:22:56,833 --> 01:22:59,791
It's not an anagram.
It's alliterative because of the "S."

1082
01:23:00,291 --> 01:23:02,708
Yeah, S as in the shithead that you are.

1083
01:23:07,416 --> 01:23:09,875
-Were you fighting?
-No. We were talking.

1084
01:23:09,958 --> 01:23:11,833
Just an intense discussion.

1085
01:23:11,916 --> 01:23:13,875
Honey, please, enough.

1086
01:23:13,958 --> 01:23:16,458
You're too old for this. Come on.

1087
01:23:17,458 --> 01:23:19,708
Also because you'll be a grandpa soon.

1088
01:23:22,875 --> 01:23:25,791
Enzo. Have you knocked up a girl?

1089
01:23:25,875 --> 01:23:27,500
Did I?

1090
01:23:28,083 --> 01:23:30,083
Have you knocked up a girl?!

1091
01:23:31,375 --> 01:23:32,333
Did you know it?

1092
01:23:34,583 --> 01:23:35,416
Emma.

1093
01:23:45,875 --> 01:23:46,708
Is it a boy?

1094
01:23:48,791 --> 01:23:52,291
-I'm joking.
-It's a girl.

1095
01:23:52,375 --> 01:23:54,833
Six of one and half a dozen of the other.

1096
01:24:02,250 --> 01:24:06,625
You said it. To save the pizzeria,
we need to mortgage our house in Milan.

1097
01:24:06,708 --> 01:24:09,541
-But there are always two options.
-That's right.

1098
01:24:09,625 --> 01:24:12,541
-You mentioned one now.
-What's the other one?

1099
01:24:12,625 --> 01:24:14,208
It's that you stay here.

1100
01:24:15,125 --> 01:24:16,000
Doing what?

1101
01:24:24,208 --> 01:24:27,333
There are a lot of European funds
available for things like these.

1102
01:24:28,083 --> 01:24:31,541
And you could sell the house in Milan
instead of mortgaging it.

1103
01:24:32,500 --> 01:24:35,541
-You could make money.
-Your mom doesn't want to.

1104
01:24:35,625 --> 01:24:38,166
Your mom may have changed her mind.

1105
01:24:38,250 --> 01:24:40,041
-When?
-Just now.

1106
01:24:40,125 --> 01:24:43,083
And I could help you
to start off the business

1107
01:24:43,166 --> 01:24:44,791
until we go back to Amsterdam.

1108
01:24:44,875 --> 01:24:45,833
"We" who?

1109
01:24:46,625 --> 01:24:48,000
-Didn't I tell you?
-No.

1110
01:24:48,500 --> 01:24:51,500
-I decided she'll be born here.
-She'll call her Carmela.

1111
01:24:51,583 --> 01:24:53,541
-Joking.
-Yes. Maybe the next one.

1112
01:24:54,375 --> 01:24:56,916
There's even a music stage?

1113
01:24:58,708 --> 01:24:59,541
Hey.

1114
01:25:03,500 --> 01:25:04,416
Dad…

1115
01:25:05,583 --> 01:25:07,625
I have to tell you something too.

1116
01:25:08,125 --> 01:25:10,000
I don't want to be a pizza maker.

1117
01:25:10,958 --> 01:25:14,458
And what do you want to be,
a sound designer?

1118
01:25:14,541 --> 01:25:18,708
Yes. I want to be a sound designer.
Maybe I won't succeed, but I'll try.

1119
01:25:19,291 --> 01:25:21,583
And I want to live on my own.

1120
01:25:21,666 --> 01:25:23,791
Oh my God. I miss you a lot already.

1121
01:25:24,750 --> 01:25:27,708
-How will you pay the rent?
-I'll find a job.

1122
01:25:27,791 --> 01:25:31,041
Maybe at the beginning,
only at the beginning,

1123
01:25:31,875 --> 01:25:33,208
I could help you here.

1124
01:25:33,875 --> 01:25:37,041
In the beginning. Until I become an uncle.

1125
01:25:49,708 --> 01:25:52,625
Whereas I'd like to sleep
until I become a grandpa.

1126
01:25:53,166 --> 01:25:55,750
Get out of here, Salvo. God help us.

1127
01:26:01,875 --> 01:26:03,583
You want to live on your own?

1128
01:26:04,375 --> 01:26:06,416
-Dad saw that.
-Sweetheart.

1129
01:26:25,291 --> 01:26:26,416
Guys, soon…

1130
01:26:28,875 --> 01:26:30,166
Music!

1131
01:26:39,583 --> 01:26:40,500
Good party.

1132
01:26:43,666 --> 01:26:44,791
Music!

1133
01:26:58,541 --> 01:26:59,375
What's up?

1134
01:27:01,708 --> 01:27:02,791
Do you want to smoke?

1135
01:27:04,291 --> 01:27:05,541
Do you want to dance?

1136
01:27:13,791 --> 01:27:15,291
It was you then.

1137
01:27:21,416 --> 01:27:22,541
I made it myself.

1138
01:27:22,625 --> 01:27:23,541
Do you like it?

1139
01:27:25,791 --> 01:27:28,833
Yes. It's not really my style,

1140
01:27:30,000 --> 01:27:31,083
but it's pretty.

1141
01:27:31,666 --> 01:27:32,666
I'll put it on.

1142
01:27:34,625 --> 01:27:38,500
Sorry, Carmela, don't be offended,
but I wanted to ask you

1143
01:27:40,375 --> 01:27:41,583
if I could kiss you.

1144
01:27:44,875 --> 01:27:46,333
But I'm out of practice.

1145
01:27:49,583 --> 01:27:51,041
It's just like swimming.

1146
01:27:51,125 --> 01:27:52,416
But I can't swim.

1147
01:27:55,791 --> 01:27:58,375
You start with a dive…

1148
01:28:00,583 --> 01:28:01,875
On the count of three.

1149
01:28:04,500 --> 01:28:05,458
One…

1150
01:28:33,375 --> 01:28:35,083
Can I ask you something?

1151
01:28:35,166 --> 01:28:37,083
Hurry up. I've got things to do.

1152
01:28:38,125 --> 01:28:40,333
Why didn't you ever tell me anything nice?

1153
01:28:40,416 --> 01:28:41,916
What should I have told you?

1154
01:28:42,000 --> 01:28:46,416
If you encouraged me, I could have become
a rock star, the king of pizza.

1155
01:28:47,000 --> 01:28:50,458
The inventor of the pillow to sleep
with your arm under your head.

1156
01:28:50,958 --> 01:28:51,916
Just anything.

1157
01:28:53,125 --> 01:28:55,666
Maybe because I'm a useless thing.

1158
01:28:57,708 --> 01:28:58,541
No.

1159
01:28:59,666 --> 01:29:01,000
I am a useless thing.

1160
01:29:01,500 --> 01:29:03,916
That means that we're two useless things.

1161
01:29:04,791 --> 01:29:06,958
As they say, I passed you the gene.

1162
01:29:08,708 --> 01:29:10,708
I'm sorry I got it too late.

1163
01:29:12,375 --> 01:29:14,166
But it's not too late for you.

1164
01:29:14,250 --> 01:29:15,083
Dad.

1165
01:29:16,875 --> 01:29:19,250
We'll open a pizzeria
on our family estate.

1166
01:29:20,458 --> 01:29:21,666
As they say,

1167
01:29:21,750 --> 01:29:25,166
"Blessed is the bird
that makes its nest in its own village."

1168
01:29:25,250 --> 01:29:26,708
You remembered it.

1169
01:29:28,958 --> 01:29:29,958
Good job, Salvo.

1170
01:29:30,583 --> 01:29:31,416
My dear son.

1171
01:29:37,000 --> 01:29:38,541
Dad, since we made peace,

1172
01:29:40,041 --> 01:29:43,666
can you give me the lotto numbers?
I need them like oxygen.

1173
01:29:44,541 --> 01:29:45,708
Now more than ever.

1174
01:29:47,958 --> 01:29:48,875
Forty-seven.

1175
01:29:50,208 --> 01:29:51,250
Forty-seven?

1176
01:29:53,166 --> 01:29:54,208
Sixty-eight.

1177
01:29:54,291 --> 01:29:57,416
-Can you turn off the tractor?
-Eighty-eight.

1178
01:29:57,500 --> 01:29:58,791
I didn't get that.

1179
01:30:00,583 --> 01:30:02,250
Can you spell it, please?

1180
01:30:04,333 --> 01:30:05,958
Speak up. Spell it.

1181
01:30:09,000 --> 01:30:10,291
Fuck off.

1182
01:30:22,750 --> 01:30:24,500
Did you get this white wine?

1183
01:35:48,208 --> 01:35:51,791
