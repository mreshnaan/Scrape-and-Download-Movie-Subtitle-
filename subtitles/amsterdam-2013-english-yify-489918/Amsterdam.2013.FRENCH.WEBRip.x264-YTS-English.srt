1
00:01:18,815 --> 00:01:20,408
I'm stronger than you!

2
00:01:21,951 --> 00:01:23,214
There's Uncle Jeff.

3
00:01:24,787 --> 00:01:26,153
Bye, guys.

4
00:01:30,059 --> 00:01:31,823
- You'll bring us salmon?
- You bet!

5
00:01:32,295 --> 00:01:33,295
Bye, my love.

6
00:01:33,796 --> 00:01:34,796
Safe trip.

7
00:01:39,235 --> 00:01:40,635
Bye, kiddos.

8
00:02:21,277 --> 00:02:22,277
You alright?

9
00:02:23,012 --> 00:02:24,503
Yeah, top shape. Why?

10
00:02:55,211 --> 00:02:58,670
<i>With sunny skies everywhere,
it's a beautiful fall day,</i>

11
00:02:58,815 --> 00:03:00,579
<i>and the weekend...</i>

12
00:06:19,549 --> 00:06:21,381
I'm not so sure about this.

13
00:06:21,551 --> 00:06:22,551
What?

14
00:06:27,557 --> 00:06:28,557
OK.

15
00:06:31,227 --> 00:06:34,129
Yes!

16
00:07:34,590 --> 00:07:37,822
Let's keep it tidy.
Which drawer do you want?

17
00:07:37,994 --> 00:07:39,860
I'd like the bottom one.

18
00:07:40,029 --> 00:07:42,362
Marco, take whatever one you want.

19
00:07:43,165 --> 00:07:45,191
Sam, mind if I take
the bottom drawer?

20
00:07:46,602 --> 00:07:47,602
Sam?

21
00:08:05,187 --> 00:08:06,849
What are you doing?

22
00:08:07,023 --> 00:08:09,458
If I want to be in shape for later...

23
00:08:09,625 --> 00:08:11,856
Hey, bank boss, we're in Amsterdam.

24
00:08:12,028 --> 00:08:13,826
Move, before I slug you.

25
00:08:17,033 --> 00:08:19,867
- What are you doing?
- Getting ready to go out.

26
00:08:20,036 --> 00:08:23,006
No shaving. We've gone fishing.
Wake up!

27
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:25,804
I'll put on clean undies at least.

28
00:08:30,046 --> 00:08:31,412
What are you doing?

29
00:08:31,647 --> 00:08:33,479
Aren't you going to unpack?

30
00:08:33,649 --> 00:08:34,878
You bet.

31
00:08:35,051 --> 00:08:37,748
Guys, wait for me. Guys!

32
00:08:55,504 --> 00:08:56,665
Who's gonna roll?

33
00:09:05,848 --> 00:09:08,511
Eeny, meeny, miny, moe,

34
00:09:08,684 --> 00:09:10,277
Catch a tiger by the toe...

35
00:09:10,419 --> 00:09:12,718
And you are it!

36
00:09:23,699 --> 00:09:25,725
Why do I always lose?

37
00:09:25,901 --> 00:09:27,699
Want to vote instead?

38
00:09:29,705 --> 00:09:30,764
I hate you.

39
00:09:30,940 --> 00:09:32,101
Come on!

40
00:10:51,787 --> 00:10:54,018
I'm as nervous
as for my first communion.

41
00:10:54,190 --> 00:10:56,716
All you need
is your leopard g-string.

42
00:11:05,201 --> 00:11:08,797
So, have you ever played around?

43
00:11:09,371 --> 00:11:12,808
I'd have told you.
Why are you asking?

44
00:11:14,210 --> 00:11:15,210
No reason.

45
00:11:17,847 --> 00:11:19,213
Move over.

46
00:11:19,381 --> 00:11:21,373
- Move, move!
- Take it easy.

47
00:11:23,085 --> 00:11:24,246
What are you doing?

48
00:11:25,588 --> 00:11:27,022
Here.

49
00:11:30,392 --> 00:11:32,224
You can't be serious.

50
00:11:32,394 --> 00:11:33,657
Where'd you find it?

51
00:11:33,829 --> 00:11:35,764
It'll help us rise and shine.

52
00:11:35,931 --> 00:11:37,593
What are you up to?

53
00:11:39,034 --> 00:11:41,230
We're here to party, but...

54
00:11:41,403 --> 00:11:45,238
Shit, guys. When we were
planning our trip back home,

55
00:11:45,407 --> 00:11:48,377
you were ready for anything,
but now you're...

56
00:11:49,745 --> 00:11:51,213
What did we say?

57
00:11:52,848 --> 00:11:54,407
You only live once.

58
00:11:58,087 --> 00:11:59,087
C'mon!

59
00:11:59,255 --> 00:12:01,087
If I'm going to hell,

60
00:12:01,257 --> 00:12:02,555
then with my pals!

61
00:12:03,626 --> 00:12:04,626
Cheers!

62
00:12:10,399 --> 00:12:11,924
- Godawful!
- Your turn.

63
00:12:27,449 --> 00:12:29,384
So, in the Red Light District...?

64
00:12:29,551 --> 00:12:32,715
The book says,
when you see a girl you like,

65
00:12:32,888 --> 00:12:37,258
you knock on her door, pay her,
and you get it on.

66
00:12:37,426 --> 00:12:38,724
Love at first sight!

67
00:12:40,462 --> 00:12:42,158
Do you have to bargain?

68
00:12:42,331 --> 00:12:44,926
I hope not
'cause you'd get screwed.

69
00:12:46,101 --> 00:12:47,467
Jerks!

70
00:12:49,905 --> 00:12:51,897
Don't worry, it's a flat rate.

71
00:13:03,919 --> 00:13:05,820
But how do you choose?

72
00:13:07,690 --> 00:13:11,320
Me, to get hard,
I need to chat a bit first.

73
00:13:12,928 --> 00:13:17,332
Choose one who looks like Béatrice.
It'll feel like home.

74
00:13:20,502 --> 00:13:21,800
I hope they're OK.

75
00:13:22,504 --> 00:13:24,473
My daughter was getting a cold.

76
00:13:26,342 --> 00:13:27,970
Why don't we call them?

77
00:13:28,143 --> 00:13:30,305
Ask if they did their homework,

78
00:13:30,479 --> 00:13:33,381
what they ate for supper,
if things are OK?

79
00:13:34,350 --> 00:13:35,716
Guys...

80
00:13:39,154 --> 00:13:40,622
You sound like old farts.

81
00:13:43,459 --> 00:13:44,483
Party.

82
00:13:44,793 --> 00:13:46,523
Let's go, you clowns!

83
00:14:01,076 --> 00:14:02,169
Well...

84
00:14:03,178 --> 00:14:04,373
see you later.

85
00:14:32,775 --> 00:14:34,403
See you at the hotel.

86
00:14:43,218 --> 00:14:44,413
Hello.

87
00:17:06,562 --> 00:17:08,190
Christ, you're gorgeous.

88
00:17:11,733 --> 00:17:13,361
You have the same eyes.

89
00:19:54,529 --> 00:19:57,021
It's just, we've been trying for 10 years.

90
00:19:57,199 --> 00:19:59,327
I find it strange, that's all.

91
00:20:02,204 --> 00:20:04,105
I don't give a shit about statistics.

92
00:20:08,744 --> 00:20:10,906
Anything to tell me, Madeleine?

93
00:20:15,751 --> 00:20:18,118
No, no, course not.

94
00:20:18,754 --> 00:20:19,915
I'm happy.

95
00:20:21,356 --> 00:20:23,120
Yeah, they're really biting.

96
00:20:27,763 --> 00:20:29,129
Kiss you. Bye.

97
00:20:33,135 --> 00:20:34,135
Me too.

98
00:21:19,781 --> 00:21:21,682
Jeff? Jeff!

99
00:21:22,984 --> 00:21:24,418
Sam's not back!

100
00:21:50,345 --> 00:21:51,836
71.

101
00:21:54,216 --> 00:21:56,185
What's he doing here?

102
00:21:57,219 --> 00:21:58,949
75. This is the place.

103
00:22:03,458 --> 00:22:04,858
Hey, you clowns!

104
00:22:05,460 --> 00:22:07,452
Wanna tango with some trout?

105
00:22:19,374 --> 00:22:20,398
Hi!

106
00:22:20,509 --> 00:22:23,502
This is Juul, our fishing guide.
C'mon.

107
00:23:07,088 --> 00:23:09,284
We won't be completely lying.

108
00:23:18,733 --> 00:23:19,928
So, you studs?

109
00:23:22,103 --> 00:23:23,103
Last night?

110
00:23:27,943 --> 00:23:29,104
It was alright.

111
00:23:29,945 --> 00:23:31,937
Shit, I want details, boys!

112
00:23:32,948 --> 00:23:35,543
It's like bicycling.
You don't forget.

113
00:23:38,553 --> 00:23:41,751
Like bicycling?
Wow, must've been steamy!

114
00:23:42,657 --> 00:23:44,125
Me, not so good.

115
00:23:45,894 --> 00:23:46,953
Oh yeah?

116
00:23:48,129 --> 00:23:49,129
Yeah.

117
00:23:55,403 --> 00:23:56,427
Couldn't get it up?

118
00:23:59,975 --> 00:24:01,568
I thought of Madeleine.

119
00:24:05,180 --> 00:24:06,580
No big deal.

120
00:24:07,248 --> 00:24:08,443
Nah, it's no big deal.

121
00:24:08,583 --> 00:24:10,176
You'll do better tonight.

122
00:24:16,458 --> 00:24:19,121
Fish on, boys!

123
00:24:19,294 --> 00:24:20,785
Holy shit!

124
00:24:54,829 --> 00:24:56,354
Madeleine's pregnant.

125
00:24:57,032 --> 00:24:59,194
She told me as I was leaving.

126
00:24:59,300 --> 00:25:00,300
What?

127
00:25:01,202 --> 00:25:02,329
So that explains it!

128
00:25:04,072 --> 00:25:06,041
Welcome to the club!

129
00:25:07,842 --> 00:25:11,870
Finally! You'd given up hope!
One guy squirmed through.

130
00:25:12,047 --> 00:25:14,744
Mom said never trust doctors,

131
00:25:14,916 --> 00:25:16,407
or bank managers!

132
00:25:17,652 --> 00:25:18,652
Right.

133
00:25:19,054 --> 00:25:20,215
Brother-in-law,

134
00:25:20,388 --> 00:25:22,357
I'm so happy for you both.

135
00:25:24,426 --> 00:25:26,224
You tried for so long.

136
00:25:46,247 --> 00:25:48,341
Sam, this calls for a celebration!

137
00:25:50,685 --> 00:25:52,244
See you at the hotel.

138
00:25:53,188 --> 00:25:55,089
Sam, don't freak out.

139
00:25:55,724 --> 00:25:57,454
I was a wreck with my first.

140
00:25:58,093 --> 00:25:59,686
Sam, come on!

141
00:26:12,107 --> 00:26:13,700
He didn't come back.

142
00:26:23,284 --> 00:26:25,116
Good idea, let's pack.

143
00:26:28,723 --> 00:26:31,454
There must be something else.
I'm sure.

144
00:26:31,593 --> 00:26:33,289
It's not just the baby.

145
00:26:35,063 --> 00:26:37,726
There's gotta be more to it.

146
00:26:38,333 --> 00:26:41,132
Come on, you freaked out
with your first.

147
00:26:44,272 --> 00:26:47,265
- What are you doing?
- My mouth's dry.

148
00:26:48,276 --> 00:26:50,905
Go easy on that,
we're flying home.

149
00:27:03,691 --> 00:27:05,853
Maybe he's in
the Red Light District.

150
00:27:06,294 --> 00:27:08,525
To see if he can get it up.

151
00:27:10,498 --> 00:27:13,991
I'll go shower.
Save time in the morning.

152
00:27:14,135 --> 00:27:16,127
Tell the front desk to wake us.

153
00:29:09,617 --> 00:29:12,052
Jeff! Sam's not back.

154
00:29:15,123 --> 00:29:16,123
No way!

155
00:29:16,224 --> 00:29:17,385
Christ, our flight.

156
00:29:21,129 --> 00:29:23,496
Bea can't find out about our trip.

157
00:29:23,665 --> 00:29:25,964
- OK, relax.
- Yeah, relax.

158
00:29:26,134 --> 00:29:29,901
And you? They'll love this
at the bank. Fucking shit!

159
00:29:30,071 --> 00:29:32,631
- Look, don't freak out!
- Freak out?

160
00:29:33,074 --> 00:29:34,565
We have to look for him.

161
00:29:35,410 --> 00:29:36,434
Where?

162
00:29:42,183 --> 00:29:44,277
Don't ever pull that again!

163
00:29:45,453 --> 00:29:47,684
I figured I should tell you.

164
00:29:47,855 --> 00:29:49,084
What?

165
00:29:50,959 --> 00:29:53,155
That I won't be flying with you.

166
00:29:53,328 --> 00:29:55,297
Wait. You can't do that.

167
00:29:55,463 --> 00:29:58,456
I need some time.
A couple of days.

168
00:29:59,267 --> 00:30:01,668
The plan only works
if you come too.

169
00:30:05,373 --> 00:30:07,933
Enough horsing around.
You're coming!

170
00:30:08,109 --> 00:30:10,135
We're all boarding that plane.

171
00:30:10,311 --> 00:30:11,438
Get off me.

172
00:30:11,612 --> 00:30:13,205
What'll we tell the girls?

173
00:30:13,681 --> 00:30:15,115
Sam, shit!

174
00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:20,679
Sam, wait, fuck!

175
00:30:22,690 --> 00:30:25,159
- Tell 'em I stayed at the camp.
- No.

176
00:30:25,326 --> 00:30:27,727
Madeleine will charge down there.

177
00:30:28,129 --> 00:30:31,327
Forget it. You're coming with us.
That's final.

178
00:30:33,901 --> 00:30:35,335
Please, guys.

179
00:30:36,137 --> 00:30:37,469
Help me, OK?

180
00:30:42,377 --> 00:30:43,377
Sam, stop.

181
00:30:47,048 --> 00:30:49,176
Shit, what are we going to do?

182
00:30:49,250 --> 00:30:50,718
Quit fooling around.

183
00:30:50,885 --> 00:30:52,080
Sam, stop.

184
00:30:53,354 --> 00:30:54,913
Shit!

185
00:30:56,524 --> 00:30:58,720
You can't. Fuck, our plan!

186
00:31:02,930 --> 00:31:04,330
Sam, stop it.

187
00:31:04,499 --> 00:31:06,400
If you do this, you bastard...

188
00:31:06,567 --> 00:31:09,366
I don't want that baby. No way.

189
00:31:09,537 --> 00:31:11,369
Don't you get it?

190
00:31:18,946 --> 00:31:21,438
I'll come Wednesday.
Do it for me, guys.

191
00:31:25,953 --> 00:31:27,546
I love you, guys.

192
00:32:52,440 --> 00:32:53,533
It's Daddy!

193
00:32:57,645 --> 00:32:59,773
Hi, kiddo. Where's Dad?

194
00:32:59,947 --> 00:33:01,779
Let me catch my breath.

195
00:33:01,949 --> 00:33:03,850
I hope you brought trout.

196
00:33:03,985 --> 00:33:05,510
Or we'll be eating you.

197
00:33:05,686 --> 00:33:07,314
Don't I get a kiss?

198
00:33:07,488 --> 00:33:09,047
Sorry.

199
00:33:09,657 --> 00:33:11,285
Where's my dad?

200
00:33:11,492 --> 00:33:14,155
Give Uncle Jeff a break.
Take your bath.

201
00:33:16,497 --> 00:33:19,296
Forget the bath.
Just put them to bed.

202
00:33:23,137 --> 00:33:25,504
Should we order some pizza?

203
00:33:28,509 --> 00:33:31,138
Jeff, has anything happened?

204
00:33:31,312 --> 00:33:32,507
Well...

205
00:33:33,514 --> 00:33:35,676
- Yes and no.
- Where are the others?

206
00:33:37,518 --> 00:33:39,510
We think that

207
00:33:39,687 --> 00:33:41,519
Sam went into the woods.

208
00:33:41,889 --> 00:33:43,016
What?

209
00:33:43,524 --> 00:33:44,890
What do you mean?

210
00:33:45,326 --> 00:33:46,919
It's been 24 hours.

211
00:33:47,094 --> 00:33:49,723
- 24 hours?
- He'll be back.

212
00:33:49,897 --> 00:33:52,332
Tomorrow or the day after...

213
00:33:52,700 --> 00:33:55,363
- He probably wanted to be alone.
- Wait.

214
00:33:55,937 --> 00:33:57,667
Did he leave or is he lost?

215
00:33:58,706 --> 00:34:02,165
We woke up yesterday, he was gone.
So we figure...

216
00:34:02,343 --> 00:34:05,370
I bet he's at Jodoin's trailer.
He must be.

217
00:34:05,546 --> 00:34:07,071
We checked. He wasn't there.

218
00:34:07,915 --> 00:34:09,315
Since it was raining, we...

219
00:34:09,450 --> 00:34:10,975
It was sunny here.

220
00:34:11,118 --> 00:34:12,677
Well, it rained there.

221
00:34:14,121 --> 00:34:15,919
We wanted to tell you.

222
00:34:16,924 --> 00:34:18,415
I'm going back to search
with Marco.

223
00:34:18,559 --> 00:34:20,619
Why'd he go off by himself?

224
00:34:22,129 --> 00:34:24,121
We had a few beers that night.

225
00:34:24,365 --> 00:34:26,527
He became, like... aggressive.

226
00:34:26,734 --> 00:34:30,364
You know how he can be.
So then, well lubricated...

227
00:34:30,571 --> 00:34:33,302
Aggressive?
What were you talking about?

228
00:34:36,577 --> 00:34:38,910
We were riding each other,
that's all.

229
00:34:40,147 --> 00:34:41,945
Not me, mostly Marco.

230
00:34:42,083 --> 00:34:43,949
Marco and Sam fought?

231
00:34:44,151 --> 00:34:47,952
We all got carried away.
Sam went for a walk to calm down.

232
00:34:48,155 --> 00:34:50,317
Next morning he wasn't back.

233
00:34:51,259 --> 00:34:53,387
Look. You stay here.

234
00:34:53,594 --> 00:34:58,123
I'll return to the camp and look
with Marco. We'll find him, OK?

235
00:34:58,966 --> 00:35:00,958
- Don't panic.
- Don't panic?

236
00:35:01,168 --> 00:35:04,570
My brother's been gone 24 hours
and I shouldn't panic?

237
00:35:05,106 --> 00:35:07,769
It's not like he's never
been in the woods.

238
00:35:08,242 --> 00:35:09,767
No cause for alarm.

239
00:35:11,012 --> 00:35:12,012
We'll find him.

240
00:35:16,017 --> 00:35:17,610
Trust me.

241
00:35:33,034 --> 00:35:34,832
Sam and I own a sawmill.

242
00:35:35,036 --> 00:35:36,800
A lumberyard.

243
00:35:37,271 --> 00:35:40,435
Nothing big,
but enough to feed two families.

244
00:35:42,043 --> 00:35:46,447
I got married first, to Simone,
Sam's sister.

245
00:35:46,814 --> 00:35:48,783
Marc and Sam were my best men.

246
00:35:49,784 --> 00:35:52,811
Jeff's the godfather
of my youngest, Jeremy.

247
00:35:54,055 --> 00:35:56,388
Every year we go on a fishing trip.

248
00:35:56,624 --> 00:35:58,217
Like when we were kids.

249
00:35:59,293 --> 00:36:03,458
We'd been drinking. You know
how it is, with old friends...

250
00:36:04,131 --> 00:36:07,033
Nothing happened.
Just a little quarrel.

251
00:36:08,035 --> 00:36:11,665
Can I be more specific?
Just guys being guys.

252
00:36:11,872 --> 00:36:14,239
I have no idea why he left.

253
00:36:14,475 --> 00:36:16,808
I figured he wanted to sober up.

254
00:36:19,647 --> 00:36:22,640
Sam can be touchy.
He got upset, and then...

255
00:36:23,484 --> 00:36:25,180
Tempers flared and finally,

256
00:36:25,386 --> 00:36:26,820
he stormed out.

257
00:36:35,096 --> 00:36:36,096
OK, everybody.

258
00:36:36,197 --> 00:36:40,328
Gather round, please.
We're going to start.

259
00:36:41,502 --> 00:36:46,338
First of all, thanks for the big
turnout, we really appreciate it.

260
00:36:48,542 --> 00:36:50,542
This is Detective Thibault,
who'll say a few words.

261
00:36:50,878 --> 00:36:52,073
Detective...

262
00:36:52,279 --> 00:36:54,544
We'll form groups of four or five.

263
00:36:55,716 --> 00:36:59,676
Mr Patenaude is a woodsman, so
from experience, I'd say he's hurt.

264
00:37:00,721 --> 00:37:04,055
Team leaders, don't forget
your first aid kits.

265
00:37:04,291 --> 00:37:06,260
Check Jodoin's trailer.

266
00:37:06,394 --> 00:37:07,726
I'm sure he's there.

267
00:37:08,696 --> 00:37:10,221
The guys looked. He's not there.

268
00:37:10,431 --> 00:37:12,195
As kids it was our hangout.

269
00:37:13,367 --> 00:37:14,630
You know.

270
00:37:15,936 --> 00:37:16,936
Tell them!

271
00:37:19,740 --> 00:37:22,232
- Go on, Detective.
- We'll focus on

272
00:37:22,443 --> 00:37:25,538
where he was last seen,
west of the mountain.

273
00:37:27,381 --> 00:37:28,747
Is that right, guys?

274
00:37:39,794 --> 00:37:41,763
Calm down. You look suspicious.

275
00:37:42,496 --> 00:37:44,761
Weren't we stalling for time?

276
00:37:45,499 --> 00:37:49,300
Look, the girls overreacted.
We just have to play along.

277
00:37:49,970 --> 00:37:52,599
They'll realize we weren't here.

278
00:37:59,180 --> 00:38:00,341
Relax.

279
00:38:00,581 --> 00:38:02,140
They won't investigate.

280
00:38:03,417 --> 00:38:07,650
- If they call customs?
- Why would they? He's in the woods.

281
00:38:07,855 --> 00:38:08,948
Everything OK?

282
00:38:09,824 --> 00:38:11,019
Yeah, sure.

283
00:38:11,826 --> 00:38:14,660
Sorry, I need you
to each lead a team.

284
00:38:15,830 --> 00:38:16,957
It's all good.

285
00:38:17,631 --> 00:38:19,964
Come on,
I'll take you to your group.

286
00:38:55,669 --> 00:38:57,638
Did you check the stream?

287
00:38:57,838 --> 00:38:59,397
Yeah, I think so.

288
00:38:59,907 --> 00:39:02,172
- You think so?
- I dunno, Bea.

289
00:39:02,376 --> 00:39:04,743
- It was dark.
- Even so...

290
00:39:04,979 --> 00:39:07,175
You would've heard the stream.

291
00:39:08,249 --> 00:39:09,410
Maybe, but...

292
00:39:11,485 --> 00:39:13,147
What did you fight about?

293
00:39:13,687 --> 00:39:17,988
Sam started to rag us. We were soused,
having fun, and suddenly,

294
00:39:18,192 --> 00:39:21,424
- he didn't feel so hot.
- I bet. Gimme a break.

295
00:39:21,896 --> 00:39:23,421
What happened?

296
00:39:28,235 --> 00:39:29,863
Look me in the eyes.

297
00:39:31,505 --> 00:39:34,441
I know you. You're hiding something.

298
00:39:36,510 --> 00:39:38,376
Look, Bea...

299
00:39:39,513 --> 00:39:41,072
We behaved like jerks.

300
00:39:44,285 --> 00:39:47,881
You fought about the loan, right?
I knew it.

301
00:39:49,089 --> 00:39:51,456
That's right. It was about my debt.

302
00:39:52,092 --> 00:39:55,085
With the renovations,
I'm behind. Sam's mad.

303
00:39:55,296 --> 00:39:57,788
I'll be glad when that's over with.

304
00:39:58,032 --> 00:40:00,900
Me too. It'll be behind us soon.

305
00:40:01,735 --> 00:40:02,896
I promise.

306
00:40:06,106 --> 00:40:08,268
Let's get back to the others.

307
00:40:22,323 --> 00:40:24,258
Ask for Martine at the bank.

308
00:40:25,960 --> 00:40:27,929
I'll call you next week.

309
00:40:29,964 --> 00:40:31,091
Right.

310
00:40:31,966 --> 00:40:33,298
Thank you, Mr Paquette.

311
00:40:41,976 --> 00:40:43,239
He called me.

312
00:40:45,579 --> 00:40:46,579
When?

313
00:40:46,747 --> 00:40:48,739
While you were fishing.

314
00:40:51,986 --> 00:40:53,420
What did he say?

315
00:40:53,621 --> 00:40:55,487
Did you tell him about us?

316
00:40:55,689 --> 00:40:56,952
Of course not.

317
00:40:57,591 --> 00:40:58,957
No way!

318
00:41:00,361 --> 00:41:02,330
I haven't told anyone.

319
00:41:04,164 --> 00:41:07,328
Shit, why did we do it?

320
00:41:15,609 --> 00:41:17,134
I'm pregnant, Jeff.

321
00:41:35,396 --> 00:41:36,557
I know.

322
00:41:38,632 --> 00:41:39,998
He told you?

323
00:41:41,835 --> 00:41:44,236
I'm sure that's why he took off.

324
00:41:49,643 --> 00:41:51,305
How many weeks?

325
00:41:56,050 --> 00:41:57,382
Sam's the father.

326
00:42:01,355 --> 00:42:03,017
I'm sure it's his.

327
00:42:07,661 --> 00:42:09,095
Isn't it strange that...

328
00:42:09,329 --> 00:42:11,264
Jeff, please.

329
00:43:22,736 --> 00:43:23,736
Hi, Noémie.

330
00:43:24,605 --> 00:43:26,403
Sorry, we're late.

331
00:43:29,443 --> 00:43:30,934
- Everything OK?
- Sure.

332
00:43:31,245 --> 00:43:32,941
Cathy said she was cold upstairs.

333
00:43:37,017 --> 00:43:38,781
We have to insulate.

334
00:43:38,986 --> 00:43:42,013
- Winter's coming.
- I know, I'm on it.

335
00:43:46,627 --> 00:43:48,425
- Do you have any cash?
- Sure.

336
00:43:49,263 --> 00:43:50,595
- Thanks.
- Bye.

337
00:43:52,866 --> 00:43:54,425
1, 2, 3... Here.

338
00:43:55,936 --> 00:43:56,936
Where's this from?

339
00:43:58,539 --> 00:43:59,700
This?

340
00:43:59,840 --> 00:44:01,001
It's nothing.

341
00:44:01,608 --> 00:44:02,974
- Thanks.
- Bye.

342
00:44:03,143 --> 00:44:04,202
Say hi to your parents.

343
00:44:11,285 --> 00:44:13,618
Come, I'll put you to bed.

344
00:44:31,305 --> 00:44:32,398
My baby.

345
00:44:53,894 --> 00:44:55,157
I'm off.

346
00:44:55,529 --> 00:44:57,088
You're going back now?

347
00:44:59,333 --> 00:45:01,199
We start early tomorrow.

348
00:45:05,105 --> 00:45:06,869
What's wrong?

349
00:45:07,908 --> 00:45:10,002
I don't want to become like them.

350
00:45:10,911 --> 00:45:12,709
- Like who?
- Jeff and Simone...

351
00:45:12,913 --> 00:45:15,439
Sam who's always sniping
at Madeleine.

352
00:45:18,719 --> 00:45:20,585
We're not like them, Bea.

353
00:45:28,362 --> 00:45:31,799
- I have to go.
- I know but, I need a cuddle.

354
00:45:33,634 --> 00:45:34,634
You!

355
00:45:35,569 --> 00:45:36,901
Well...

356
00:45:59,159 --> 00:46:00,159
Here.

357
00:46:00,294 --> 00:46:01,728
I stopped taking them.

358
00:46:02,763 --> 00:46:05,323
- Why?
- I need a clear head.

359
00:46:05,766 --> 00:46:06,927
Come on.

360
00:46:07,167 --> 00:46:10,001
We have to tell Julie
her uncle's missing.

361
00:46:12,172 --> 00:46:13,800
Let's not upset her.

362
00:46:14,007 --> 00:46:17,774
- She has her mid-terms.
- Don't worry, I'll do it.

363
00:46:17,978 --> 00:46:21,506
No reason to involve everyone.
We'll find him soon.

364
00:46:21,748 --> 00:46:23,580
Why'd you let him leave?

365
00:46:24,785 --> 00:46:26,253
What were you thinking?

366
00:47:32,419 --> 00:47:36,857
<i>We said you're lost in the woods.
Nake sure you let your beard grow.</i>

367
00:48:16,096 --> 00:48:17,096
<i>Hello?</i>

368
00:48:18,298 --> 00:48:19,459
<i>Nadeleine?</i>

369
00:48:30,911 --> 00:48:33,278
Sam, it's me.

370
00:48:35,148 --> 00:48:36,377
<i>Why are you there?</i>

371
00:48:37,117 --> 00:48:40,713
We're all at the cottage.
We said you got lost.

372
00:48:41,755 --> 00:48:44,725
The cops are here. It's no joke.

373
00:48:45,125 --> 00:48:47,287
The whole village is worried sick.

374
00:48:47,561 --> 00:48:49,723
Let's not make things worse.

375
00:48:49,930 --> 00:48:51,296
<i>Where's Nadeleine?</i>

376
00:48:53,333 --> 00:48:54,733
She's sleeping.

377
00:48:55,335 --> 00:48:56,735
On the sofa.

378
00:48:56,937 --> 00:48:59,497
<i>Wake her up. I want to talk to her.</i>

379
00:49:00,140 --> 00:49:03,110
You'll talk to her when you're back, OK?

380
00:49:04,344 --> 00:49:06,745
- It'll all work out.
<i>- No, it won't.</i>

381
00:49:06,947 --> 00:49:08,745
<i>The baby's not mine.</i>

382
00:50:04,304 --> 00:50:05,363
Hi.

383
00:50:13,380 --> 00:50:15,246
I was just saying.

384
00:50:15,515 --> 00:50:18,713
He stopped gambling.
He's paying off his loan.

385
00:50:20,253 --> 00:50:21,653
What's up?

386
00:50:21,855 --> 00:50:24,415
I was explaining your fight
with Sam.

387
00:50:25,892 --> 00:50:27,224
Why didn't you tell me?

388
00:50:27,727 --> 00:50:30,526
Well, 'cause... there's nothing to say.

389
00:50:30,730 --> 00:50:32,699
I pay off my loan monthly.

390
00:50:33,700 --> 00:50:35,862
Jeff endorsed the loan at the bank.

391
00:50:37,237 --> 00:50:38,603
Mind if we check?

392
00:50:39,706 --> 00:50:41,265
No problem. Right, Jeff?

393
00:50:46,713 --> 00:50:47,713
Perfect.

394
00:50:50,717 --> 00:50:52,242
OK, everybody!

395
00:50:52,619 --> 00:50:54,247
You're fewer today.

396
00:50:55,088 --> 00:50:57,887
So you have to be
even more vigilant.

397
00:50:58,858 --> 00:51:01,293
Why not just say
I smashed his skull?

398
00:51:01,528 --> 00:51:04,293
I said the first thing
that occurred to me.

399
00:51:04,531 --> 00:51:08,195
Fuck! Don't go putting ideas
into their head!

400
00:51:17,544 --> 00:51:19,706
I want my life the way it was.

401
00:51:24,751 --> 00:51:26,481
That's not going to happen.

402
00:51:28,555 --> 00:51:30,080
What do you mean?

403
00:51:31,391 --> 00:51:34,225
Look at us, Marco.
What are we doing?

404
00:51:36,396 --> 00:51:38,262
We're sticking to the plan.

405
00:51:38,798 --> 00:51:40,323
We should tell them.

406
00:51:41,234 --> 00:51:43,465
Shit, tell them what?

407
00:51:43,670 --> 00:51:45,161
The truth.

408
00:51:45,405 --> 00:51:46,634
The truth?

409
00:51:47,073 --> 00:51:48,097
What truth, Jeff?

410
00:51:48,775 --> 00:51:51,768
"Sorry, girls,
but we were lying to you.

411
00:51:51,978 --> 00:51:57,110
We went to Amsterdam to screw around
and get high. Sam's still there."

412
00:51:57,584 --> 00:52:00,110
I'd love to see Simone's face
when she hears.

413
00:52:05,158 --> 00:52:06,524
Your truth means...

414
00:52:08,161 --> 00:52:10,756
I'd see my kids every second weekend.

415
00:52:15,001 --> 00:52:16,970
I don't want to lose Béatrice.

416
00:52:17,370 --> 00:52:20,340
I'm lucky she's still here
after all I've done.

417
00:52:22,609 --> 00:52:23,770
I know.

418
00:52:29,182 --> 00:52:30,878
We have to play the game.

419
00:52:31,484 --> 00:52:32,543
We've no choice.

420
00:53:03,583 --> 00:53:06,382
We'll stop here.
We're beyond the perimeter.

421
00:53:07,053 --> 00:53:08,385
Simone, come back!

422
00:53:08,822 --> 00:53:12,657
- Have you gone crazy?
- Don't call me crazy!

423
00:53:15,228 --> 00:53:18,027
Am I the only one
who wants to find him?

424
00:53:34,247 --> 00:53:36,216
How can we break his ankle?

425
00:53:38,084 --> 00:53:40,576
Take it easy.
We're not gonna break it,

426
00:53:40,787 --> 00:53:42,221
just sprain it.

427
00:53:45,458 --> 00:53:46,858
Is it dirty enough?

428
00:53:55,101 --> 00:53:57,229
Will they buy that he stayed here?

429
00:53:58,905 --> 00:54:00,237
If he's wounded...

430
00:54:01,741 --> 00:54:03,209
We actually pulled it off.

431
00:54:04,277 --> 00:54:06,769
Tomorrow it'll all be over.

432
00:54:06,913 --> 00:54:09,246
Good job, dude. Come on.

433
00:54:18,925 --> 00:54:21,724
Noémie's going to sleep over tonight.

434
00:54:21,928 --> 00:54:25,092
- And tomorrow?
- My mom will fill in, OK?

435
00:54:26,933 --> 00:54:28,799
I was just asking. Jeez!

436
00:54:34,140 --> 00:54:35,768
What's going on, Marco?

437
00:54:38,745 --> 00:54:39,838
Nothing.

438
00:54:44,517 --> 00:54:46,748
The card was declined at the store.

439
00:54:49,155 --> 00:54:51,681
Darnit, I forgot to pay this month.

440
00:55:03,536 --> 00:55:04,629
How you doing?

441
00:55:14,214 --> 00:55:17,446
He knows the area
like the back of his hand.

442
00:55:19,986 --> 00:55:21,511
He's either hurt,

443
00:55:22,355 --> 00:55:23,948
or gone.

444
00:55:26,125 --> 00:55:27,787
With the weather getting colder...

445
00:55:33,566 --> 00:55:35,159
I meant, with the baby.

446
00:55:48,381 --> 00:55:50,350
You started gambling again.

447
00:55:54,220 --> 00:55:56,348
We'll get through this together.

448
00:55:57,390 --> 00:55:59,552
We've seen worse. Right, baby?

449
00:56:01,594 --> 00:56:03,358
We have a great family.

450
00:56:04,063 --> 00:56:08,262
Nothing and no one
is going to destroy it, OK?

451
00:56:15,942 --> 00:56:17,774
I'm not an idiot.

452
00:56:20,046 --> 00:56:21,046
I know it's mine.

453
00:56:21,080 --> 00:56:22,080
Look...

454
00:56:23,249 --> 00:56:25,946
We did something stupid, one night.

455
00:56:27,053 --> 00:56:29,045
But now...

456
00:56:29,255 --> 00:56:33,784
I was stupid not to invite you
to the prom before him.

457
00:56:38,264 --> 00:56:39,562
What do you mean?

458
00:56:48,875 --> 00:56:50,605
Goddamn shitty day!

459
00:56:55,882 --> 00:56:57,817
What? Did I piss in your punch?

460
00:57:05,291 --> 00:57:07,419
I'm going to bed. G'night.

461
00:57:09,662 --> 00:57:10,823
Good night.

462
00:57:16,903 --> 00:57:18,428
What did I do?

463
00:57:18,905 --> 00:57:20,066
Nothing.

464
00:57:21,307 --> 00:57:22,639
Forget it.

465
00:57:53,940 --> 00:57:55,670
He's out there somewhere.

466
00:57:57,343 --> 00:57:59,676
We'll find him, Simone.

467
00:58:01,514 --> 00:58:04,313
When he's upset,
he goes off and pouts.

468
00:58:06,152 --> 00:58:08,883
He always comes back.
You know that.

469
00:58:11,157 --> 00:58:13,126
Close the window, it's cold.

470
00:58:17,530 --> 00:58:19,123
Come to bed.

471
00:58:19,966 --> 00:58:21,457
I'm beat.

472
00:58:23,970 --> 00:58:25,233
Yeah, right.

473
00:58:57,270 --> 00:58:58,898
<i>Help!</i>

474
00:59:28,301 --> 00:59:29,929
Simone's not with you?

475
00:59:42,248 --> 00:59:44,808
She can't go
looking in the trailer!

476
00:59:45,051 --> 00:59:48,112
Leave her to me. Stick to the plan.
You pick him up.

477
00:59:48,321 --> 00:59:50,984
I'll say you had work.

478
00:59:52,458 --> 00:59:54,586
- Did you see Simone?
- She's not inside?

479
00:59:56,996 --> 00:59:58,430
Jeff!

480
01:00:08,641 --> 01:00:10,234
Did we forget anything?

481
01:00:11,277 --> 01:00:14,008
Marco! Jeff! Come on! It's Simone!

482
01:00:15,281 --> 01:00:16,442
Shit.

483
01:00:17,083 --> 01:00:18,608
We stick to the plan.

484
01:00:27,593 --> 01:00:28,925
Girls!

485
01:00:29,128 --> 01:00:30,824
What's going on?

486
01:00:41,674 --> 01:00:42,835
Down there!

487
01:01:39,165 --> 01:01:41,657
<i>Uh, no. Nr Nasson?</i>

488
01:01:42,168 --> 01:01:43,168
Yes.

489
01:01:43,369 --> 01:01:46,533
<i>This is Nadine Cousineau
from Citibank Visa.</i>

490
01:01:46,739 --> 01:01:49,106
<i>Did you leave the country recently?</i>

491
01:01:49,942 --> 01:01:51,376
No, why?

492
01:01:51,577 --> 01:01:55,878
<i>Your company credit card
may have been used fraudulently.</i>

493
01:01:57,516 --> 01:01:59,451
Fucking hell!

494
01:01:59,585 --> 01:02:00,917
<i>Nr Nasson?</i>

495
01:02:02,755 --> 01:02:07,352
- What happened?
<i>- Someone in Amsterdam withdrew $1000.</i>

496
01:02:09,729 --> 01:02:10,753
<i>Nr Nasson?</i>

497
01:02:15,735 --> 01:02:17,863
Mommy, I'm bored.

498
01:02:18,971 --> 01:02:20,940
Daddy will be here soon.

499
01:02:22,975 --> 01:02:25,376
What's keeping him so long?

500
01:02:32,418 --> 01:02:33,579
Mr Décarie?

501
01:02:37,056 --> 01:02:38,581
How is she?

502
01:02:38,991 --> 01:02:40,755
She's out of danger.

503
01:02:42,094 --> 01:02:45,087
She suffered a hip fracture
and a slight concussion.

504
01:02:45,798 --> 01:02:47,232
Can we see her?

505
01:02:47,433 --> 01:02:50,164
Not just yet. She needs to rest.

506
01:02:51,237 --> 01:02:53,638
- What's going on?
- Where were you?

507
01:02:53,839 --> 01:02:56,900
- We almost lost her.
- You're not serious?

508
01:03:01,280 --> 01:03:03,579
She has a concussion and a broken hip.

509
01:03:04,417 --> 01:03:05,942
What if we hadn't found her?

510
01:03:06,152 --> 01:03:09,281
She's in good hands here.

511
01:03:09,455 --> 01:03:11,447
How did she fall?

512
01:03:13,426 --> 01:03:15,088
Will he be OK?

513
01:03:22,268 --> 01:03:23,793
Jeff, listen.

514
01:03:24,270 --> 01:03:26,637
I waited two hours.
He wasn't there.

515
01:03:27,673 --> 01:03:30,040
You get it? He just withdrew $1000!

516
01:03:30,276 --> 01:03:31,801
Simone nearly died.

517
01:03:32,478 --> 01:03:33,810
Because of us.

518
01:03:40,486 --> 01:03:41,920
Marco...

519
01:03:42,054 --> 01:03:42,851
What?

520
01:03:43,055 --> 01:03:45,047
I have to tell you something.

521
01:03:45,691 --> 01:03:47,819
But promise to keep it to yourself.

522
01:03:48,694 --> 01:03:50,026
Yeah, sure.

523
01:03:58,504 --> 01:04:00,666
I got Madeleine pregnant.

524
01:04:07,079 --> 01:04:08,672
You're kidding me.

525
01:04:14,887 --> 01:04:17,186
When? When did you do it?

526
01:04:17,890 --> 01:04:21,258
The week you were both
logging up north.

527
01:04:24,530 --> 01:04:27,022
How could you do it, shit?

528
01:04:28,534 --> 01:04:30,264
We just did.

529
01:04:36,542 --> 01:04:38,704
Bravo, you fuck!

530
01:04:41,380 --> 01:04:44,544
All this bullshit is your fault!

531
01:04:44,750 --> 01:04:46,878
I told you
because you're my friend.

532
01:04:47,753 --> 01:04:49,619
I couldn't keep it in anymore.

533
01:04:49,922 --> 01:04:52,289
No, it's so I'll take your side.

534
01:04:52,925 --> 01:04:56,089
Why didn't you tell me before?

535
01:05:02,768 --> 01:05:06,102
You ruined our lives
for a roll in the hay!

536
01:05:11,777 --> 01:05:13,109
I love her.

537
01:05:17,917 --> 01:05:20,546
Jesus fucking Christ...

538
01:06:08,367 --> 01:06:12,031
<i>We are starting our approach to Nontreal.</i>

539
01:06:13,038 --> 01:06:15,872
<i>The ground temperature is -16° C.</i>

540
01:06:16,709 --> 01:06:21,511
<i>Thank you for flying with us.
Happy holidays to you all.</i>

541
01:08:31,577 --> 01:08:32,738
Madeleine?

542
01:10:07,673 --> 01:10:09,005
Stop running.

543
01:10:12,177 --> 01:10:14,840
I never thought
it could happen to me.

544
01:10:15,047 --> 01:10:18,677
Like, the dumb cliché:
"The love of my life."

545
01:10:19,051 --> 01:10:21,748
Well, bang! It hit me too.

546
01:10:21,954 --> 01:10:23,855
I'm so happy for you.

547
01:10:24,256 --> 01:10:25,256
Name's Philippe.

548
01:10:26,058 --> 01:10:28,618
Julie, you're 17.

549
01:10:29,061 --> 01:10:31,087
- So what?
- If it's true,

550
01:10:31,296 --> 01:10:33,856
you've got at least
50 years with him.

551
01:10:34,066 --> 01:10:36,626
- Mom...
- 50 years is a long time.

552
01:10:42,074 --> 01:10:46,068
As I was saying, I met him in class in...

553
01:10:48,480 --> 01:10:49,880
Another.

554
01:11:43,969 --> 01:11:49,101
I know we open our presents tomorrow,
but I have a little surprise for us.

555
01:11:52,544 --> 01:11:54,103
Merry Christmas, <i>mi amor.</i>

556
01:11:59,785 --> 01:12:02,311
You'll have to shop for a swimsuit.

557
01:12:02,521 --> 01:12:07,323
- We'll roast our pina coladas.
- Marco, I'm so happy!

558
01:12:07,559 --> 01:12:09,027
Thank you, my love!

559
01:12:22,574 --> 01:12:24,008
BUSINESS FOR SALE: SOLD

560
01:12:47,533 --> 01:12:49,729
No, don't.

561
01:12:50,602 --> 01:12:52,571
I'll have a white wine.

562
01:15:42,374 --> 01:15:45,037
Don't touch or talk to her.
Understand?

563
01:15:45,243 --> 01:15:47,405
- Relax.
- Your wife is in there!

564
01:15:47,612 --> 01:15:49,240
And your daughter! Everyone!

565
01:15:49,448 --> 01:15:52,680
- Stay away from her!
- I just wanted to dance.

566
01:15:52,884 --> 01:15:55,410
We got lucky with the cops.

567
01:15:55,620 --> 01:15:57,748
Don't screw things up!

568
01:16:05,797 --> 01:16:07,231
You got a problem, bud?

569
01:16:14,606 --> 01:16:16,438
What's going on?

570
01:16:16,641 --> 01:16:18,974
- Nothing. We're fine.
- It's cool.

571
01:16:19,745 --> 01:16:21,577
I'm glad you two are talking.

572
01:16:23,415 --> 01:16:25,782
It's Christmas, after all.

573
01:16:26,885 --> 01:16:28,376
Right.

574
01:16:28,820 --> 01:16:31,619
Come inside.
We're going to toast Sam.

575
01:16:31,823 --> 01:16:33,382
I'll just finish this.

576
01:16:36,828 --> 01:16:39,627
Wake up!
I won't let you ruin my life.

577
01:16:39,831 --> 01:16:41,800
You bet, old man.

578
01:18:05,817 --> 01:18:08,651
Thanks for the lift.

579
01:18:09,487 --> 01:18:10,487
Our pleasure.

580
01:18:12,157 --> 01:18:14,717
Next year, you'll dance too,
Simone.

581
01:18:14,926 --> 01:18:16,326
Yeah, sure.

582
01:18:16,728 --> 01:18:18,594
Bye, Auntie. See you tomorrow?

583
01:18:18,830 --> 01:18:19,830
Yup...

584
01:18:20,732 --> 01:18:21,893
See you tomorrow.

585
01:18:49,527 --> 01:18:50,620
Hello?

586
01:19:30,802 --> 01:19:32,168
Anybody there?

587
01:19:38,443 --> 01:19:39,638
Who's there?

588
01:20:03,034 --> 01:20:05,196
I thought you were dead.

589
01:20:07,639 --> 01:20:09,198
With my best friend.

590
01:20:23,288 --> 01:20:25,223
I'm pregnant and you abandoned me.

591
01:20:33,865 --> 01:20:35,458
What did you expect?

592
01:20:37,669 --> 01:20:40,036
I'd pretend nothing happened?

593
01:20:45,343 --> 01:20:46,470
Do you know

594
01:20:46,878 --> 01:20:49,507
how many nights
I spent waiting for you?

595
01:20:49,681 --> 01:20:51,206
It's not mine, fuck!

596
01:20:56,521 --> 01:20:57,521
Sam...

597
01:21:04,863 --> 01:21:06,832
When did it happen?

598
01:21:08,366 --> 01:21:10,028
When did you betray me?

599
01:21:15,874 --> 01:21:19,242
While... you stopped
looking at me, Sam.

600
01:21:21,880 --> 01:21:24,907
So everything we said was bullshit?

601
01:21:26,684 --> 01:21:29,244
- The adoption, tests, doctors...
- Where were you?

602
01:21:35,894 --> 01:21:37,055
Where were you?

603
01:21:40,698 --> 01:21:42,064
Where?

604
01:21:43,968 --> 01:21:45,266
Where?

605
01:21:52,911 --> 01:21:54,277
Amsterdam.

606
01:22:36,354 --> 01:22:37,913
Come on, kiddos!

607
01:22:38,123 --> 01:22:40,115
I need help cutting the tree!

608
01:22:46,698 --> 01:22:48,792
Mom, you need to rest.

609
01:22:49,200 --> 01:22:51,294
I won't stay in bed all my life.

610
01:22:51,870 --> 01:22:54,772
The doctor said to take it easy.

611
01:22:55,306 --> 01:22:57,070
Julie, get off my back.

612
01:22:57,208 --> 01:22:59,234
Be reasonable. Lie down.

613
01:22:59,377 --> 01:23:00,606
I'll bring your coffee.

614
01:23:01,613 --> 01:23:03,138
Let her help you.

615
01:23:04,983 --> 01:23:06,975
- I don't need help.
- Mom...

616
01:23:07,619 --> 01:23:09,952
Especially not your dad
and his pity!

617
01:23:20,632 --> 01:23:21,964
I'm sorry.

618
01:23:22,800 --> 01:23:24,166
All this...

619
01:23:25,203 --> 01:23:26,569
It's my fault.

620
01:23:29,007 --> 01:23:31,169
The perfect father!

621
01:23:38,216 --> 01:23:39,377
You disgust me.

622
01:23:44,022 --> 01:23:45,581
Where are you going?

623
01:23:48,026 --> 01:23:49,585
To buy cigarettes.

624
01:23:50,228 --> 01:23:51,856
Think I'm stupid?

625
01:23:55,033 --> 01:23:57,229
- Tell the truth for once!
- Stop.

626
01:23:58,369 --> 01:23:59,701
Go on, tell your daughter!

627
01:23:59,837 --> 01:24:02,204
- Want me to tell the truth?
- Yes.

628
01:24:02,407 --> 01:24:06,208
Every morning since Julie moved out,
I wonder why I stay.

629
01:24:10,248 --> 01:24:11,546
Yeah, right.

630
01:24:12,617 --> 01:24:15,018
Next you'll beg my forgiveness.

631
01:25:51,949 --> 01:25:54,942
We'll find an even bigger one
than last year.

632
01:25:55,153 --> 01:25:58,146
Chanel's dad got an artificial one.

633
01:25:58,356 --> 01:26:00,951
It's cold.
I want to play on the computer!

634
01:26:01,159 --> 01:26:04,357
Quit griping. It's Christmas,
you need fresh air.

635
01:26:04,562 --> 01:26:05,894
Go on, get in.

636
01:26:08,166 --> 01:26:09,532
You too, sweetie.

637
01:26:10,168 --> 01:26:12,535
Buckle up your brother.
OK.

638
01:26:25,817 --> 01:26:27,479
What's wrong?

639
01:26:27,685 --> 01:26:30,678
Dad's going to cut the tree
with Uncle Jeff.

640
01:26:30,888 --> 01:26:33,858
- How come?
- He said it won't take long.

641
01:26:34,392 --> 01:26:35,985
What now?

642
01:28:06,083 --> 01:28:08,814
To: Marc & Jeff
From: Santa

643
01:28:40,318 --> 01:28:41,684
Like a beer, guys?

644
01:29:16,153 --> 01:29:18,520
Sit down.
Make yourselves comfortable.

645
01:29:31,369 --> 01:29:32,894
Have you been back long?

646
01:29:34,372 --> 01:29:36,773
30 years we're friends.
You realize?

647
01:29:40,578 --> 01:29:44,345
Look, Sam, it hasn't been easy
for us here either.

648
01:29:46,017 --> 01:29:47,747
You really screwed us.

649
01:29:48,619 --> 01:29:51,555
Amsterdam only worked
if we stuck together.

650
01:29:53,791 --> 01:29:54,952
30 years.

651
01:29:55,860 --> 01:29:57,556
You were gone two months.

652
01:29:58,396 --> 01:29:59,955
We did what we could.

653
01:30:04,201 --> 01:30:05,201
Sure.

654
01:30:06,203 --> 01:30:07,728
Your renovations, great.

655
01:30:09,607 --> 01:30:10,870
I did nothing wrong.

656
01:30:12,043 --> 01:30:13,978
How else could I support my family?

657
01:30:14,812 --> 01:30:17,372
You were blowing company money
in Amsterdam.

658
01:30:19,417 --> 01:30:21,079
I had to sell.

659
01:30:22,420 --> 01:30:24,787
That's alright, Marco.
I understand.

660
01:30:28,225 --> 01:30:29,625
I'm sorry, buddy.

661
01:30:30,428 --> 01:30:31,794
That's alright.

662
01:30:32,830 --> 01:30:33,830
Yeah.

663
01:30:39,637 --> 01:30:42,163
It hurt to see the mill closed.

664
01:30:46,310 --> 01:30:47,403
It was our dream, remember?

665
01:30:53,451 --> 01:30:55,818
So much happens in two months.

666
01:30:57,455 --> 01:30:58,821
But there's one thing...

667
01:31:00,257 --> 01:31:02,624
I couldn't stop thinking about.

668
01:31:03,127 --> 01:31:04,186
Look, Sam...

669
01:31:05,463 --> 01:31:07,830
Who got my wife pregnant?

670
01:31:21,278 --> 01:31:22,644
Where's Madeleine?

671
01:31:26,684 --> 01:31:28,448
What do you want me to do?

672
01:31:30,121 --> 01:31:31,214
Say I'm sorry?

673
01:31:31,689 --> 01:31:35,649
Yeah, apologize.
All this crap is your fault.

674
01:31:36,293 --> 01:31:38,455
You know, if I did it,

675
01:31:40,131 --> 01:31:41,463
it's 'cause...

676
01:31:42,133 --> 01:31:43,658
'Cause why?

677
01:31:46,203 --> 01:31:48,069
Just say you're sorry.
Now's the time.

678
01:31:51,709 --> 01:31:53,678
I wanted to take her to the prom.

679
01:31:57,515 --> 01:31:59,074
She's my wife, Jeff.

680
01:32:01,152 --> 01:32:02,677
You slept with my wife.

681
01:32:11,896 --> 01:32:13,489
The baby's mine.

682
01:32:17,168 --> 01:32:18,261
I know.

683
01:32:23,941 --> 01:32:25,500
I can't have kids.

684
01:32:29,346 --> 01:32:32,111
But you know how much
I wanted to be a dad.

685
01:32:49,967 --> 01:32:51,128
I'm sorry.

686
01:33:04,381 --> 01:33:06,077
Where's Madeleine?

687
01:33:06,283 --> 01:33:07,546
She's gone.

688
01:33:09,386 --> 01:33:10,547
Gone where?

689
01:33:12,590 --> 01:33:14,752
The truth was too much for her.

690
01:33:16,460 --> 01:33:18,759
- What did you tell her?
- Everything.

691
01:33:18,963 --> 01:33:21,558
Amsterdam, the drugs, the girls.
Everything.

692
01:33:22,233 --> 01:33:24,327
Christ, she'll tell everyone.

693
01:33:25,736 --> 01:33:27,170
No, I don't think so.

694
01:33:28,005 --> 01:33:29,337
She just left.

695
01:33:30,608 --> 01:33:32,008
She was furious.

696
01:33:38,415 --> 01:33:39,974
What were you hoping?

697
01:33:41,252 --> 01:33:42,777
She'd leave with you?

698
01:33:51,262 --> 01:33:52,662
There's only one solution.

699
01:33:55,266 --> 01:33:56,962
We get in the car and go.

700
01:33:57,635 --> 01:33:58,830
What? Go where?

701
01:33:59,036 --> 01:34:00,368
Christmas dinner.

702
01:34:02,439 --> 01:34:03,805
And we tell them.

703
01:34:05,042 --> 01:34:06,374
Like men.

704
01:34:06,644 --> 01:34:10,945
The return of the Messiah on Christmas?
No one will buy it.

705
01:34:11,148 --> 01:34:12,616
Why not?

706
01:34:12,817 --> 01:34:15,810
What's the plan?
We buy back the mill?

707
01:34:16,287 --> 01:34:20,156
You two share custody of the kid
with Madeleine?

708
01:34:20,357 --> 01:34:21,882
Gimme a break!

709
01:34:24,295 --> 01:34:25,820
There's another solution.

710
01:34:27,464 --> 01:34:29,160
A lot simpler, too.

711
01:34:44,381 --> 01:34:47,215
- Don't be an idiot!
- Eeny meeny miny moe...

712
01:34:47,418 --> 01:34:48,909
Calm down. Calm down.

713
01:34:50,387 --> 01:34:51,480
Calm down!

714
01:34:54,391 --> 01:34:55,391
Me.

715
01:34:55,693 --> 01:34:57,457
It's OK, Marco.

716
01:34:57,595 --> 01:34:58,927
For once I lose.

717
01:34:59,163 --> 01:35:01,257
- Better for everyone.
- What?

718
01:35:01,498 --> 01:35:03,262
- I'm going.
- Wait.

719
01:35:03,500 --> 01:35:05,901
I'll jump in the lake.
It'll be over.

720
01:35:06,103 --> 01:35:07,503
- Sam, please...
- Get back.

721
01:35:07,705 --> 01:35:09,606
- Calm down.
- I said, back!

722
01:35:09,840 --> 01:35:11,570
- Let's talk.
- Fuck you!

723
01:35:11,775 --> 01:35:13,266
Stop!

724
01:35:20,517 --> 01:35:22,042
It's been fun, guys.

725
01:35:31,295 --> 01:35:32,295
Sam!

726
01:35:33,697 --> 01:35:35,097
What are you doing?

727
01:36:20,511 --> 01:36:21,740
<i>Don't be stupid!</i>

728
01:36:59,616 --> 01:37:00,982
Fuck!

729
01:37:45,662 --> 01:37:48,029
Enough! Enough!

730
01:38:40,317 --> 01:38:42,912
Mommy, when do we open
the presents?

731
01:38:43,420 --> 01:38:44,649
After supper, sweetie.

732
01:38:45,923 --> 01:38:48,085
Still no word from Madeleine?

733
01:38:56,333 --> 01:38:58,666
Make an effort. It's Christmas.

734
01:39:06,743 --> 01:39:08,905
What's wrong, darling?

735
01:39:11,348 --> 01:39:12,680
What's wrong?

736
01:39:15,752 --> 01:39:17,084
Sam's dead.

737
01:39:21,158 --> 01:39:23,684
Of course you're sad he's not here.

738
01:39:24,962 --> 01:39:26,521
I miss him too.

739
01:39:33,770 --> 01:39:36,103
- Are you alright?
- I'll be OK.

740
01:39:37,174 --> 01:39:39,336
- Take a few minutes.
- Sure.

741
01:39:40,177 --> 01:39:41,177
I'm coming.

742
01:39:41,612 --> 01:39:44,548
Supper everybody.
Too bad for Madeleine.

743
01:42:57,541 --> 01:42:59,339
Merry Christmas!
