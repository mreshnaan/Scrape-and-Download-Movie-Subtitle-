1
00:00:27,906 --> 00:00:29,444
Ow! Oh my god…

2
00:00:37,359 --> 00:00:38,997
Wow, are they down?

3
00:00:40,669 --> 00:00:43,369
Nice job. That was fast.

4
00:00:43,776 --> 00:00:45,598
Yeah, they’re whooped.

5
00:00:46,474 --> 00:00:50,638
I thought I was gonna lose it when they wouldn’t quit with that Captain Underpants thing.

6
00:00:51,239 --> 00:00:53,365
They have no idea what it was like to grow up

7
00:00:53,366 --> 00:00:55,539
back when kids got spanked.

8
00:00:57,012 --> 00:00:58,312
Oh, god...

9
00:00:59,569 --> 00:01:00,917
That looks good.

10
00:01:02,612 --> 00:01:05,135
- Have a little. - No, I shouldn't.

11
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:09,075
What the…?

12
00:01:09,512 --> 00:01:10,812
What?

13
00:01:12,810 --> 00:01:13,810
JACOB: Wow.

14
00:01:15,176 --> 00:01:16,488
ALLI: Oh my god!

15
00:01:17,063 --> 00:01:18,563
Oh, I can't watch.

16
00:01:19,870 --> 00:01:21,300
As she keeps watching.

17
00:01:22,309 --> 00:01:24,705
But seriously, they need to order some drapes.

18
00:01:25,129 --> 00:01:26,547
It’s disgraceful.

19
00:01:27,510 --> 00:01:29,492
Alright, stop drooling.

20
00:01:36,391 --> 00:01:38,805
They’re christening the new apartment.

21
00:01:39,767 --> 00:01:42,667
Do you think they really don’t think that people can see them?

22
00:01:43,312 --> 00:01:46,112
Or are they getting off on it?

23
00:01:47,502 --> 00:01:50,005
I just think they really don’t care.

24
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
- Woah! - Woah.

25
00:01:53,460 --> 00:01:54,782
That’s a new one.

26
00:01:57,730 --> 00:01:59,827
She’s very flexible.

27
00:02:03,223 --> 00:02:04,957
You know, he’s really hot too.

28
00:02:06,860 --> 00:02:09,010
I didn’t say hot. I said flexible.

29
00:02:12,142 --> 00:02:14,178
Do you think we should turn out the lights?

30
00:02:17,779 --> 00:02:20,427
Why should we turn out the lights? We’re not doing anything.

31
00:02:20,428 --> 00:02:21,928
They’re the ones who are…

32
00:02:59,417 --> 00:03:00,787
ALLI: Just one more second!

33
00:03:01,743 --> 00:03:03,343
We’re almost there.

34
00:03:03,866 --> 00:03:05,439
- JACOB: No! (Laughs) - ALLI: Alright.

35
00:03:05,950 --> 00:03:07,400
OK, just keep holding it.

36
00:03:07,401 --> 00:03:10,151
JACOB: No, he thinks that’s what a producer does.

37
00:03:10,152 --> 00:03:11,752
Quick, quick, quick!

38
00:03:13,353 --> 00:03:14,720
Quick, quick, quick!

39
00:03:14,721 --> 00:03:19,071
JACOB: Well, that's because he doesn’t know exactly what happens in a studio session.

40
00:03:19,072 --> 00:03:20,672
ALLI: How are you doing, Tanner?

41
00:03:20,673 --> 00:03:22,473
ALLI: No, no, no! Into the toilet!

42
00:03:22,674 --> 00:03:25,513
JACOB: It’s like the label’s being run by freakin’ teenagers.

43
00:03:27,565 --> 00:03:28,865
JACOB: I know.

44
00:03:29,166 --> 00:03:30,503
You’re still in here.

45
00:03:30,804 --> 00:03:32,226
What did he do?

46
00:03:32,427 --> 00:03:34,127
What? He missed the toilet.

47
00:03:34,128 --> 00:03:35,928
- Again? - Yes, again.

48
00:03:35,929 --> 00:03:37,229
It's okay.

49
00:03:38,119 --> 00:03:39,485
ALLI: Here, I need to...

50
00:03:41,476 --> 00:03:44,228
JACOB: Look, no, I love the song and I will send it.

51
00:03:44,617 --> 00:03:48,145
But honestly, I don’t think they give two shits about what I think anymore.

52
00:03:50,499 --> 00:03:51,799
Okay.

53
00:03:52,029 --> 00:03:53,597
Alright. Break a leg tonight.

54
00:03:54,222 --> 00:03:55,522
Laters!

55
00:03:57,214 --> 00:03:58,514
Sorry.

56
00:04:01,770 --> 00:04:03,070
(Mockingly) Laters!

57
00:04:03,971 --> 00:04:05,591
What is that supposed to mean?

58
00:04:07,359 --> 00:04:09,541
I just spent my whole Saturday

59
00:04:10,115 --> 00:04:13,319
haggling about contracts and recoupment schedules

60
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:15,320
while you guys were out having fun.

61
00:04:15,521 --> 00:04:18,821
I would give anything to haggle about a recoupment schedule.

62
00:04:22,414 --> 00:04:24,142
Why are you working out here?

63
00:04:27,344 --> 00:04:30,054
Just the... Skype signal's better.

64
00:04:30,903 --> 00:04:32,410
Are your friends home?

65
00:04:33,346 --> 00:04:35,370
- My friends? - Yeah.

66
00:04:35,668 --> 00:04:37,113
Across the street?

67
00:04:37,408 --> 00:04:40,352
Or are you working too hard to notice them?

68
00:04:41,318 --> 00:04:42,618
Oh, shit.

69
00:04:44,847 --> 00:04:46,147
Alright.

70
00:04:46,566 --> 00:04:48,761
Fine, alright - I got it, thank you!

71
00:04:49,784 --> 00:04:51,934
- Woah, what happened to you today? - What happened to me?

72
00:04:51,935 --> 00:04:54,035
I was juggling three kids all day by myself

73
00:04:54,036 --> 00:04:56,336
at the zoo in the snow. And one of them was

74
00:04:56,337 --> 00:04:59,037
snotty or poopy or hungry or had a scraped

75
00:04:59,038 --> 00:05:00,638
knee every 'effing second.

76
00:05:00,639 --> 00:05:02,839
I had four hours of sleep last night!

77
00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:05,707
Because I was up nursing or getting spit up on.

78
00:05:05,708 --> 00:05:08,408
And then I got home and my husband is just chilling

79
00:05:08,409 --> 00:05:10,309
with his music bros and

80
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:12,630
gawking at the neighbors with his dick hanging out.

81
00:05:12,630 --> 00:05:14,293
Woah!

82
00:05:14,293 --> 00:05:18,027
Hey guys, why don’t you go into your room for a little bit?

83
00:05:20,206 --> 00:05:21,506
Here you go.

84
00:05:21,769 --> 00:05:25,179
I’ll come in and hang out in a minute, okay?

85
00:05:27,180 --> 00:05:29,380
I thought after three months they’d figure out

86
00:05:29,381 --> 00:05:31,381
there’s a whole building of people who live over here.

87
00:05:31,382 --> 00:05:33,632
I swear to God, it’s like they live with us.

88
00:05:33,833 --> 00:05:35,833
I think you might be overreacting a little.

89
00:05:35,834 --> 00:05:37,134
Oh, do you?

90
00:05:37,135 --> 00:05:39,635
Are you enjoying the binoculars you wanted for your birthday present

91
00:05:39,636 --> 00:05:41,236
to use in the Catskills?

92
00:05:44,852 --> 00:05:47,520
Look, I know I’m not 22

93
00:05:47,819 --> 00:05:50,437
and I’m tired all the time

94
00:05:50,829 --> 00:05:54,338
and my nipples feel like a piranha has been fucking gnawing at them.

95
00:05:54,733 --> 00:05:56,365
But it’s just a little dispiriting

96
00:05:56,366 --> 00:05:58,840
the way you’re captivated by them.

97
00:05:59,907 --> 00:06:03,460
Wait a minute. I don’t think I’m the only one who's captivated.

98
00:06:05,872 --> 00:06:08,786
They’re like a car crash that you can’t look away from.

99
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:13,405
Okay, a beautiful sexy young car crash.

100
00:06:13,406 --> 00:06:14,706
I didn’t say that!

101
00:06:15,396 --> 00:06:17,771
I mean for real, do they have jobs?

102
00:06:17,772 --> 00:06:20,772
Or clothes? All they do is host dance parties

103
00:06:20,773 --> 00:06:22,673
and sleep till noon and screw.

104
00:06:23,030 --> 00:06:26,080
You have no idea what it feels like to have your face constantly rubbed --

105
00:06:26,081 --> 00:06:27,781
Yes, I do!

106
00:06:28,065 --> 00:06:29,865
What, you think I like talking about

107
00:06:29,866 --> 00:06:33,006
how many times Luther pooped or who’s doing drop off?

108
00:06:33,945 --> 00:06:36,618
And I’m becoming the old geezer at work.

109
00:06:37,630 --> 00:06:39,951
I’ve ever started getting grey pubic hairs.

110
00:06:40,630 --> 00:06:43,620
Which I assume you haven’t noticed because when would you?

111
00:06:45,217 --> 00:06:47,217
You’re not the only one who misses being 20.

112
00:06:48,395 --> 00:06:50,017
Staying up all night.

113
00:06:50,250 --> 00:06:51,718
Getting jiggy with it.

114
00:06:53,269 --> 00:06:54,769
Getting jiggy with it?

115
00:06:55,996 --> 00:06:58,517
You know that song came out before your friends were born.

116
00:06:58,517 --> 00:06:59,353
Ow.

117
00:06:59,353 --> 00:07:01,484
- Well, it did! - Let’s stop talking.

118
00:07:01,485 --> 00:07:02,785
Come here.

119
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:16,320
(Music starts: "Nobody Else Will Be There" by The National)

120
00:07:22,321 --> 00:07:26,367
You said we’re not so tied together.

121
00:07:28,999 --> 00:07:31,194
What did you mean?

122
00:07:34,740 --> 00:07:38,779
Meet me in the stairwell in a second

123
00:07:40,694 --> 00:07:43,432
For a glass of gin.

124
00:07:46,236 --> 00:07:50,244
Nobody else will be there then.

125
00:07:51,079 --> 00:07:54,066
Nobody else will be there.

126
00:07:54,067 --> 00:07:55,467
Oh, no! Oh yuck yuck yuck!

127
00:08:01,396 --> 00:08:05,999
Can you remind me the building you live in?

128
00:08:07,780 --> 00:08:10,747
I’m on my way.

129
00:08:13,300 --> 00:08:18,295
It’s getting cold again but New York’s gorgeous.

130
00:08:19,534 --> 00:08:22,934
It’s a subway day.

131
00:08:24,965 --> 00:08:29,059
Nobody else will be there then.

132
00:08:29,810 --> 00:08:33,102
Nobody else will be there.

133
00:08:34,666 --> 00:08:38,766
Nobody else will be there then.

134
00:08:39,510 --> 00:08:42,612
Nobody else will be there.

135
00:08:49,420 --> 00:08:51,100
KID: Look it, look it!

136
00:08:52,764 --> 00:08:54,146
ALLI: Well, can you get on standby?

137
00:08:59,225 --> 00:09:01,503
Jesus, well what time does that get you in?

138
00:09:02,300 --> 00:09:04,300
KID: That's a lot of tape.

139
00:09:05,227 --> 00:09:07,315
Have you tried just ripping into them?

140
00:09:09,709 --> 00:09:13,061
Okay, alright. Call me if you get on.

141
00:09:21,356 --> 00:09:24,506
Goodbyes always take us

142
00:09:25,207 --> 00:09:27,207
Half an hour.

143
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,800
Can’t we just go home?

144
00:09:32,841 --> 00:09:36,866
Nobody else will be there then.

145
00:09:37,675 --> 00:09:40,975
Nobody else will be there.

146
00:09:42,506 --> 00:09:46,587
Nobody else will be there then.

147
00:09:47,350 --> 00:09:50,650
Nobody else will be there.

148
00:10:17,350 --> 00:10:22,350
(Music ends.)

149
00:10:53,741 --> 00:10:55,041
Hey.

150
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:02,020
Is that the guy?

151
00:11:02,770 --> 00:11:04,070
Yeah.

152
00:11:05,460 --> 00:11:07,227
Did he shave his head?

153
00:11:07,862 --> 00:11:09,162
I guess so.

154
00:11:10,100 --> 00:11:11,711
I guess I haven’t seen him in a while.

155
00:11:13,520 --> 00:11:15,181
He doesn’t look so good.

156
00:11:16,299 --> 00:11:17,599
No.

157
00:11:18,824 --> 00:11:20,424
Do you think he’s hungover?

158
00:11:21,923 --> 00:11:23,223
I don’t know.

159
00:11:24,314 --> 00:11:27,182
KID: Daddy, Tanner bit my leg!

160
00:11:28,820 --> 00:11:32,395
Why would you even have your leg near his mouth?

161
00:11:43,243 --> 00:11:45,943
Okay, be good!

162
00:11:47,928 --> 00:11:49,811
Can you give the phone to daddy?

163
00:11:52,803 --> 00:11:56,108
Yeah, if you need to, just go to the blue whale room

164
00:11:56,109 --> 00:11:58,049
and let the kids run around.

165
00:11:58,271 --> 00:12:01,068
It’s so dark in there, Luther will probably just fall asleep.

166
00:12:02,984 --> 00:12:05,928
I know, I’m going to get in the tub with my book right now.

167
00:12:07,864 --> 00:12:09,177
Okay.

168
00:12:09,178 --> 00:12:10,478
See you then.

169
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,780
(Doorbell rings.)

170
00:13:07,780 --> 00:13:09,789
(Door opens.)

171
00:13:09,789 --> 00:13:11,476
- Hi. Thank you!

172
00:13:12,342 --> 00:13:13,642
- Take care.

173
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:40,380
Are you okay?

174
00:16:40,740 --> 00:16:42,040
Yeah.

175
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:47,700
What?

176
00:16:51,134 --> 00:16:54,098
Do you live in that building right over there?

177
00:16:58,342 --> 00:16:59,642
Yes.

178
00:17:00,467 --> 00:17:01,889
I think...

179
00:17:02,568 --> 00:17:05,758
I think our apartments might face each other.

180
00:17:07,386 --> 00:17:08,686
Really?

181
00:17:09,730 --> 00:17:11,238
You have a little girl

182
00:17:12,189 --> 00:17:14,642
and a boy and a baby.

183
00:17:17,144 --> 00:17:18,849
I hope that doesn't seem creepy.

184
00:17:19,050 --> 00:17:20,350
No.

185
00:17:20,551 --> 00:17:22,051
Your children are...

186
00:17:22,728 --> 00:17:24,387
Really adorable.

187
00:17:26,156 --> 00:17:27,860
And hilarious.

188
00:17:30,005 --> 00:17:31,465
My husband and I.

189
00:17:40,401 --> 00:17:42,261
My husband...

190
00:17:44,188 --> 00:17:46,863
Has been really sick.

191
00:17:47,186 --> 00:17:48,486
And...

192
00:17:48,731 --> 00:17:50,031
We would

193
00:17:50,463 --> 00:17:53,469
look over and see your kids

194
00:17:54,425 --> 00:17:57,723
and you or your husband, I guess.

195
00:17:58,568 --> 00:18:01,146
Sitting up at night to feed the new baby.

196
00:18:01,147 --> 00:18:02,447
It was...

197
00:18:05,841 --> 00:18:07,141
It was...

198
00:18:26,790 --> 00:18:28,090
JACOB: Hello?

199
00:18:29,596 --> 00:18:30,896
Hi!

200
00:18:34,018 --> 00:18:36,094
- Hi mommy. - Hi sweetie pie.

201
00:18:36,860 --> 00:18:38,789
- How was it? - Good.

202
00:18:40,131 --> 00:18:41,530
What did you do?

203
00:18:41,993 --> 00:18:44,185
We saw a Tyrannosaurus Rex!

204
00:18:44,805 --> 00:18:46,105
ALLI: You did?

205
00:18:46,106 --> 00:18:47,406
Did Luther like it?

206
00:18:47,407 --> 00:18:48,707
No, he cried.

207
00:18:48,708 --> 00:18:51,642
And Daddy let us stop for milkshakes.

208
00:18:51,643 --> 00:18:54,043
Oh, Daddy let you stop for milkshakes?

209
00:18:54,446 --> 00:18:57,703
- We gave Luther some milkshake. - You gave Luther some milkshake?

210
00:18:57,704 --> 00:19:00,184
JACOB: Just a little bit! And he fell asleep.

211
00:19:05,320 --> 00:19:07,441
How are you? How was your day off?
