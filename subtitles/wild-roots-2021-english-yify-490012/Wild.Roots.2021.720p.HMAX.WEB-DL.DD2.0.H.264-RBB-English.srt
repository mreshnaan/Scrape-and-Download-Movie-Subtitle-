1
00:00:45,499 --> 00:00:48,259
WILD ROOTS

2
00:00:50,420 --> 00:00:53,219
Hey buddy!
It's time to leave, we are closing.

3
00:00:53,300 --> 00:00:56,539
- I'll just drink this.
- You'll drink it outside. Move!

4
00:00:58,259 --> 00:00:59,499
Hey!

5
00:01:00,980 --> 00:01:03,660
Sleeping beauty! Wake up!

6
00:02:13,780 --> 00:02:15,340
Hey!
You can't do that here!

7
00:02:16,340 --> 00:02:17,699
Put the brush back and go!

8
00:02:19,739 --> 00:02:21,539
Are you deaf?
Put the brush back!

9
00:02:40,060 --> 00:02:43,660
- Was she expelled?
- We were going to leave, anyway.

10
00:02:43,739 --> 00:02:47,340
They don't pay much attention to children
there. It's better for Niki here.

11
00:02:47,900 --> 00:02:49,579
Wasn't she going to come too?

12
00:02:50,380 --> 00:02:52,819
She had a bellyache,
and went to the bathroom.

13
00:02:52,900 --> 00:02:54,819
- Are you the child's legal guardian?
- Yes.

14
00:02:55,139 --> 00:02:57,419
- And her parents?
- Her mother died.

15
00:02:57,819 --> 00:03:01,259
- My condolences. And her father?
- We don't keep in touch.

16
00:03:01,340 --> 00:03:04,100
She could join the sixth graders
even today.

17
00:03:04,180 --> 00:03:06,780
But if she feels sick
then she should rest.

18
00:03:09,019 --> 00:03:09,979
Did you hear?

19
00:03:12,660 --> 00:03:15,620
Karola, long time no see.

20
00:03:22,739 --> 00:03:24,620
Hello, how can I help you?

21
00:03:24,699 --> 00:03:28,460
Hello... I have a savings account
with a prize car.

22
00:03:28,539 --> 00:03:29,380
You won a car?

23
00:03:30,660 --> 00:03:34,419
- No, I need the money from the account.
- Your passbook, please.

24
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:35,819
And if I don't have it?

25
00:03:36,220 --> 00:03:39,139
I'd suggest that you find it
and then come back again.

26
00:03:39,859 --> 00:03:42,259
- Then I'd say I can't get it.
- How so?

27
00:03:42,340 --> 00:03:43,579
Like I said.

28
00:03:44,060 --> 00:03:45,460
I don't want to get into this, but...

29
00:03:45,539 --> 00:03:50,340
You're in it now, there must be some
record of my money here.

30
00:03:50,419 --> 00:03:52,220
That's what a passbook is for.

31
00:03:52,739 --> 00:03:54,859
It's the official record that
you invested at our bank.

32
00:03:55,579 --> 00:03:57,859
Without it, anyone could
come in and claim money.

33
00:03:58,419 --> 00:04:01,739
You mean it's not here?
Where the fuck is it?

34
00:04:02,299 --> 00:04:04,780
Calm down please,
or else I can't help you.

35
00:04:11,660 --> 00:04:12,579
Here you are.

36
00:04:13,299 --> 00:04:15,460
ID. Address card.
Shop loyalty card...

37
00:04:16,499 --> 00:04:20,059
...a photo of my mother, what else
will make you believe me?

38
00:04:20,140 --> 00:04:21,660
That's not how it works, sir.

39
00:04:22,900 --> 00:04:24,059
What's the problem?

40
00:04:28,460 --> 00:04:31,340
What's the problem?
You steal people's money.

41
00:04:31,419 --> 00:04:34,539
You shuffle it then make it
disappear like fucking Houdini!

42
00:04:34,619 --> 00:04:37,460
- Leave the building.
- And if I don't, what then?

43
00:04:37,539 --> 00:04:39,780
- I'll call the police.
- 'Cause I want to take my money out?

44
00:04:39,859 --> 00:04:43,140
- You're disrupting service.
- What service? Your service is shit here!

45
00:04:43,460 --> 00:04:45,260
I want to talk to your bosses.

46
00:04:55,340 --> 00:04:59,820
Fuck, just call your daddy.
You're all clowns. Go fuck yourselves.

47
00:05:08,739 --> 00:05:11,140
- Not bad, but it's not my style.
- I'll try it on.

48
00:05:18,379 --> 00:05:19,739
What did you do in England?

49
00:05:20,379 --> 00:05:23,419
- Well, all sorts. I didn't go to school.
- How come?

50
00:05:23,939 --> 00:05:25,499
- They didn't mind.
- Your parents?

51
00:05:26,580 --> 00:05:30,299
My mom is a musician. She's in a
synth-pop band, and I joined her on tour.

52
00:05:30,660 --> 00:05:32,299
- Is she the singer?
- The drummer.

53
00:05:32,379 --> 00:05:33,939
- Cool.
- Check this out.

54
00:05:50,820 --> 00:05:52,700
Don't you have any
clean socks?

55
00:05:53,460 --> 00:05:55,059
Hello!

56
00:05:57,460 --> 00:05:58,419
Hello!

57
00:05:59,220 --> 00:06:01,100
Don't you have any
clean socks?

58
00:06:07,419 --> 00:06:10,619
- You can't try them on without socks.
- Then how?

59
00:06:10,700 --> 00:06:12,220
Only with clean socks.

60
00:06:15,820 --> 00:06:17,580
I'm calling the manager.

61
00:07:11,419 --> 00:07:12,460
Pali, come here.

62
00:07:14,260 --> 00:07:17,379
- What is it?
- He ate the kid's sandwich.

63
00:07:17,460 --> 00:07:20,739
- OK, I'll deal with him.
- Come on, Domi, it's 7:30!

64
00:07:25,340 --> 00:07:26,460
Hey.

65
00:07:27,100 --> 00:07:28,260
Wake up, already.

66
00:07:29,340 --> 00:07:31,260
You fuckin' ate Domi's lunch.

67
00:07:33,499 --> 00:07:37,220
- A little diet won't hurt that kid.
- Don't be such an asshole.

68
00:07:37,780 --> 00:07:39,260
- Did you go to the bank?
- Yeah.

69
00:07:39,340 --> 00:07:41,059
- And?
- Nothing.

70
00:07:41,140 --> 00:07:44,220
- They need that fucking passbook.
- Maybe you should go and ask for it.

71
00:07:44,299 --> 00:07:45,780
- You go for it.
- Me?

72
00:07:45,859 --> 00:07:49,419
I asked you to pick up
my things, right?

73
00:07:51,499 --> 00:07:55,260
It doesn't matter when
your brother is in need, right?

74
00:07:58,900 --> 00:08:01,700
- It's weird if I go instead of you.
- It's you who needs money.

75
00:08:01,780 --> 00:08:03,260
I need money?

76
00:08:03,340 --> 00:08:06,859
You eat my food, you sleep on my couch
and it's me who needs money?

77
00:08:06,939 --> 00:08:09,059
Every day, my wife asks
when you're going to chip in.

78
00:08:09,140 --> 00:08:10,419
I'll give when I get it.

79
00:08:12,739 --> 00:08:13,979
Come!

80
00:09:21,180 --> 00:09:22,220
Hello...

81
00:09:29,420 --> 00:09:30,499
Hello, Éva.

82
00:09:31,340 --> 00:09:32,300
Hello, Éva.

83
00:09:33,060 --> 00:09:33,979
It's me, Tibi.

84
00:10:26,580 --> 00:10:27,940
Can I buy some new shoes?

85
00:10:29,379 --> 00:10:32,820
- You already have some.
- But the sole's coming off.

86
00:10:34,940 --> 00:10:36,220
How much are they?

87
00:10:37,379 --> 00:10:38,340
21 thousand.

88
00:10:44,220 --> 00:10:45,499
Go on, pick it up!

89
00:10:54,300 --> 00:10:55,220
Hello.

90
00:10:57,460 --> 00:10:58,899
It's Tibi.

91
00:11:01,340 --> 00:11:02,899
Is anyone there?

92
00:11:03,979 --> 00:11:04,979
Hello?

93
00:11:06,340 --> 00:11:07,580
Who is it?

94
00:11:09,460 --> 00:11:10,420
Who is it?

95
00:11:17,340 --> 00:11:18,259
Who was that?

96
00:11:19,540 --> 00:11:20,460
Tibi.

97
00:11:24,019 --> 00:11:24,940
What did he want?

98
00:11:26,619 --> 00:11:27,540
I don't know.

99
00:11:28,019 --> 00:11:29,379
What do you mean, you don't know?

100
00:11:30,300 --> 00:11:33,019
- Why didn't you call me?
- He hung up.

101
00:11:33,859 --> 00:11:35,979
If he calls again,
give the phone to me.

102
00:12:09,619 --> 00:12:10,379
Who's that?

103
00:12:11,700 --> 00:12:14,180
- My dad.
- Got a proper pic of him?

104
00:12:14,259 --> 00:12:16,940
- No, because he's wanted by the police.
- Why?

105
00:12:18,180 --> 00:12:22,460
He has an offshore firm in the Bahamas.
We get a lot of money from it.

106
00:12:26,739 --> 00:12:28,019
He is my mom's manager.

107
00:12:29,019 --> 00:12:31,979
If you're so rich, why do you
always borrow money?

108
00:12:32,499 --> 00:12:35,940
- I told you, I left my purse at home.
- Why are you such a liar?

109
00:12:36,019 --> 00:12:38,540
- I'm not lying.
- Yeah, right.

110
00:12:41,739 --> 00:12:43,019
What's the matter?

111
00:12:49,739 --> 00:12:51,460
How do you have the nerve
to come here?

112
00:12:51,540 --> 00:12:52,619
I need the papers.

113
00:12:53,100 --> 00:12:54,940
You think I still have them?

114
00:12:56,899 --> 00:12:59,060
I told you not to
come here anymore!

115
00:12:59,499 --> 00:13:03,300
- We don't want to hear about him.
- Maybe it was mixed with Edina's stuff.

116
00:13:03,379 --> 00:13:05,100
Get lost!

117
00:14:13,220 --> 00:14:14,540
Granny

118
00:14:23,139 --> 00:14:25,220
<i>Why didn't you answer?</i>
<i>Where are you?</i>

119
00:14:25,300 --> 00:14:26,259
At Karola's.

120
00:14:27,019 --> 00:14:29,940
<i>Are you in the city?</i>
<i>What's that noise?</i>

121
00:14:30,300 --> 00:14:31,259
We're on our way.

122
00:14:31,779 --> 00:14:32,700
To their place.

123
00:14:33,180 --> 00:14:36,420
<i>Come home! You didn't tell me</i>
<i>you're staying out!</i>

124
00:14:36,899 --> 00:14:38,100
They live really far.

125
00:14:38,979 --> 00:14:40,019
In Budakeszi.

126
00:14:40,420 --> 00:14:42,940
<i>Then ask her mother</i>
<i>to bring you home!</i>

127
00:14:43,460 --> 00:14:44,379
She's gone to bed.

128
00:14:46,580 --> 00:14:49,139
<i>Next time, tell me</i>
<i>you're sleeping over!</i>

129
00:14:49,460 --> 00:14:50,379
Sorry.

130
00:15:40,379 --> 00:15:43,739
I put up with shit from
your mother-in-law and Kinga.

131
00:15:43,820 --> 00:15:46,499
It's not the best fucking time
to discuss this.

132
00:15:46,580 --> 00:15:50,060
You think it's okay that I go for your
stuff, 'cause you don't dare?

133
00:15:50,139 --> 00:15:51,420
I went back to work.

134
00:15:52,540 --> 00:15:55,460
- I'm tired of cleaning up after you.
- You clean up?

135
00:15:55,540 --> 00:15:57,619
I keep your house in order!
Your fucking garden!

136
00:15:57,700 --> 00:16:00,420
I take your dog for a piss.
Should I fuck your wife too?

137
00:16:00,499 --> 00:16:03,060
- Then she might calm down.
- Give me the keys.

138
00:16:04,259 --> 00:16:08,019
Get out in the morning.
I don't want to see you there anymore.

139
00:16:11,820 --> 00:16:13,619
Stop. Show me your purse.

140
00:16:16,340 --> 00:16:18,220
- You can't take that in.
- Are you serious?

141
00:16:18,300 --> 00:16:20,420
- I said throw it out.
- It's only water!

142
00:16:20,499 --> 00:16:23,019
I don't care, throw it out!

143
00:16:26,019 --> 00:16:26,859
Enjoy the party.

144
00:16:29,540 --> 00:16:31,700
- Hold it!
- What's the problem?

145
00:16:31,779 --> 00:16:33,739
- She can't walk.
- Get off.

146
00:16:33,820 --> 00:16:35,580
Your friend let us in.

147
00:16:35,659 --> 00:16:37,019
- What's wrong?
- She can barely walk.

148
00:16:37,100 --> 00:16:39,859
- Calm the fuck down.
- Don't tell me to calm down.

149
00:16:39,940 --> 00:16:42,379
- I've had it with you!
- They are off their faces!

150
00:16:42,460 --> 00:16:43,619
I don't care! Hey, girls!

151
00:16:44,100 --> 00:16:45,700
Stop! What's the rush?

152
00:16:48,259 --> 00:16:52,460
Back off! You can't take booze in.
Who do you think you are?

153
00:16:52,540 --> 00:16:54,259
Go back!

154
00:17:35,939 --> 00:17:39,060
- I told you, you can't come in!
- Fuck off!

155
00:18:37,699 --> 00:18:39,260
What are you doing here?

156
00:18:40,379 --> 00:18:42,379
Dorci, take this kid away from here!

157
00:18:44,179 --> 00:18:45,939
What the fuck is going on here?

158
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:48,899
- What have you done?
- They came at me with a wine glass.

159
00:18:49,659 --> 00:18:52,300
Get the fuck outta here.
Your shift is over.

160
00:19:04,379 --> 00:19:06,340
What happened down there?

161
00:19:08,699 --> 00:19:09,619
So...

162
00:19:10,100 --> 00:19:11,139
How did you get in?

163
00:19:13,179 --> 00:19:14,139
Who were you with?

164
00:19:18,899 --> 00:19:20,540
I have to call your parents.

165
00:19:21,500 --> 00:19:22,939
Please, talk to me!

166
00:19:24,899 --> 00:19:27,020
She was walking around alone.

167
00:20:03,219 --> 00:20:04,340
Could you leave us?

168
00:20:04,419 --> 00:20:05,580
- Why?
- Please.

169
00:20:05,899 --> 00:20:07,859
- But Gábor told me to...
- She's with me.

170
00:20:08,459 --> 00:20:10,020
- What?
- Like I said.

171
00:20:22,540 --> 00:20:23,780
How did you get here?

172
00:20:26,540 --> 00:20:28,179
How did you find me?

173
00:20:29,859 --> 00:20:31,580
Who told you I was here? Huh?

174
00:20:34,060 --> 00:20:35,139
Nobody.

175
00:20:35,820 --> 00:20:37,060
Then, how?

176
00:20:37,540 --> 00:20:39,740
Did you see what
happened upstairs?

177
00:20:42,740 --> 00:20:44,100
Why did you come here?

178
00:20:45,260 --> 00:20:47,780
It's no place for a kid,
for fuck's sake!

179
00:20:49,020 --> 00:20:51,139
They'll be
looking for you at home.

180
00:20:52,980 --> 00:20:54,540
Where do they think you are?

181
00:20:55,859 --> 00:20:57,260
With a friend.

182
00:21:01,980 --> 00:21:04,100
I have to get out of here.

183
00:21:04,179 --> 00:21:05,379
Now.

184
00:21:06,300 --> 00:21:07,340
Come.

185
00:21:09,699 --> 00:21:10,619
I said come.

186
00:21:27,179 --> 00:21:28,780
I'm taking you home, OK?

187
00:21:30,540 --> 00:21:32,179
I can go home on my own.

188
00:21:38,820 --> 00:21:39,740
Are you hungry?

189
00:22:02,100 --> 00:22:03,459
What will you have?

190
00:22:04,740 --> 00:22:07,219
- Come on.
- I'm not hungry.

191
00:22:08,060 --> 00:22:09,139
It's up to you.

192
00:22:22,780 --> 00:22:25,459
I bought these for you.
I don't eat dessert.

193
00:22:27,379 --> 00:22:29,260
You can take it to school, hm?

194
00:22:29,859 --> 00:22:31,300
School lunch is crap.

195
00:22:35,020 --> 00:22:36,419
I don't want it.

196
00:23:00,419 --> 00:23:03,219
Can you believe this?
Are you blind, man?

197
00:23:13,899 --> 00:23:17,020
This guy too.
Can't you see, you prick?

198
00:23:19,619 --> 00:23:22,100
Unbelievable. I mean, seriously.

199
00:23:35,300 --> 00:23:36,459
I'm conquered.

200
00:23:37,859 --> 00:23:40,340
Overcome by the forces of nature.

201
00:24:01,580 --> 00:24:02,820
Where do you live?

202
00:24:06,939 --> 00:24:08,379
Can't we go to your place?

203
00:24:10,580 --> 00:24:11,980
It's not that simple.

204
00:24:12,459 --> 00:24:13,619
Why?

205
00:24:16,939 --> 00:24:18,300
I'm in between places.

206
00:24:22,699 --> 00:24:24,340
But I happen to know a place.

207
00:24:30,179 --> 00:24:34,060
In two weeks, they're gonna alter
this place. Until then, it's free.

208
00:24:34,580 --> 00:24:36,459
Can you put on some music?

209
00:24:36,820 --> 00:24:37,820
Sure.

210
00:25:32,219 --> 00:25:34,219
Do you want to put on something?

211
00:26:25,580 --> 00:26:27,980
- What language is this?
- Icelandic.

212
00:26:29,100 --> 00:26:30,139
What's she saying?

213
00:28:19,020 --> 00:28:20,060
Listen...

214
00:28:23,859 --> 00:28:26,139
My life is a mess right now.

215
00:28:27,300 --> 00:28:31,100
I have no place to live.
You saw, I couldn't take you anywhere.

216
00:28:31,500 --> 00:28:33,820
If I get a bit more money,
then maybe...

217
00:28:34,740 --> 00:28:38,619
but right now, it's just too complicated
for us to meet everyday.

218
00:28:44,060 --> 00:28:46,459
It's better that way, believe me.

219
00:29:18,780 --> 00:29:19,899
My T-shirts?

220
00:29:19,980 --> 00:29:22,780
Kinga washed them.
They're on the drying rack.

221
00:29:27,580 --> 00:29:28,980
You have a place to go?

222
00:29:30,020 --> 00:29:31,340
Don't act like you care.

223
00:29:32,020 --> 00:29:34,699
- I wanted to help.
- I can see that.

224
00:29:35,659 --> 00:29:37,980
Some people are beyond help.

225
00:29:43,219 --> 00:29:49,580
Last year we learned about
animals with a similar diet: cattle.

226
00:29:56,300 --> 00:29:58,580
This is the third time
you're late.

227
00:30:19,659 --> 00:30:21,540
- Your shoes are cool.
- Thanks.

228
00:30:23,300 --> 00:30:26,540
- You said you didn't like them.
- I changed my mind.

229
00:30:27,419 --> 00:30:29,179
- Is it a problem?
- No.

230
00:30:30,419 --> 00:30:33,340
I bet your criminal father
can buy them for you, right?

231
00:30:33,419 --> 00:30:34,340
Stupid cunt.

232
00:30:34,419 --> 00:30:36,619
What's going on back there?

233
00:30:37,580 --> 00:30:38,699
Niki, stand up.

234
00:30:47,260 --> 00:30:49,619
How many stomachs does a cow have?

235
00:30:53,859 --> 00:30:54,859
69.

236
00:30:56,459 --> 00:30:57,580
69.

237
00:31:01,659 --> 00:31:02,859
69, really?

238
00:31:03,980 --> 00:31:06,780
Okay, bring me your report book.

239
00:31:06,859 --> 00:31:07,859
That is an F.

240
00:32:47,219 --> 00:32:48,340
Listen.

241
00:32:49,060 --> 00:32:50,139
You've lost this.

242
00:32:54,219 --> 00:32:58,659
Listen, I acted shit, I'm sorry.
Let's sit down somewhere and talk.

243
00:32:59,020 --> 00:33:00,540
Do you know this man?

244
00:33:01,939 --> 00:33:03,459
Do you know this man?

245
00:33:03,540 --> 00:33:04,300
No.

246
00:33:04,619 --> 00:33:06,340
Leave this child alone.

247
00:33:06,419 --> 00:33:08,540
- Let's go this way.
- That's not where I'm going.

248
00:33:08,619 --> 00:33:11,139
- Would you go away!
- Ma'am would you just calm down?

249
00:33:11,219 --> 00:33:13,139
You're not going to molest this child!

250
00:33:13,619 --> 00:33:14,980
- Is he your father?
- No.

251
00:33:16,379 --> 00:33:18,020
- Who are you?
- Fuck, I don't believe it.

252
00:33:18,100 --> 00:33:19,659
I'm going to report you.

253
00:33:28,899 --> 00:33:30,540
Where are you going?

254
00:33:34,980 --> 00:33:36,020
You hear?

255
00:33:36,899 --> 00:33:37,980
Nowhere.

256
00:33:43,340 --> 00:33:45,179
Fine, I'm going with you.

257
00:34:10,580 --> 00:34:13,779
Are you serious?
This is so embarrassing.

258
00:34:13,860 --> 00:34:16,699
I'll give you money instead.
How much do you need?

259
00:34:16,779 --> 00:34:17,980
21 thousand.

260
00:34:25,380 --> 00:34:26,819
Maybe not today.

261
00:34:29,779 --> 00:34:32,020
Didn't I tell you
not to come here?

262
00:34:35,739 --> 00:34:36,779
Or else?

263
00:34:37,900 --> 00:34:39,779
What are you gonna do about it?

264
00:34:43,139 --> 00:34:44,139
Keep working.

265
00:35:21,339 --> 00:35:22,619
She is nice.

266
00:35:23,460 --> 00:35:24,739
She sure is.

267
00:35:51,580 --> 00:35:52,500
Rad.

268
00:35:55,139 --> 00:35:56,139
Cool.

269
00:35:58,020 --> 00:35:58,900
Check this out.

270
00:36:02,860 --> 00:36:04,259
This is the one I like.

271
00:36:05,819 --> 00:36:07,139
Not bad.

272
00:36:15,460 --> 00:36:17,139
I'm not loaded right now.

273
00:36:19,100 --> 00:36:21,900
But there is something
you could find for me.

274
00:36:22,380 --> 00:36:24,779
A little green book,
with the word Passbook on it.

275
00:36:25,299 --> 00:36:28,699
With that, I could buy you those shoes.
It must be at the bottom of a drawer.

276
00:36:28,779 --> 00:36:31,139
Come with me
and let's find it together.

277
00:36:34,659 --> 00:36:36,100
I'm not welcome there.

278
00:36:39,540 --> 00:36:41,659
Why is Granny so angry with you?

279
00:36:43,060 --> 00:36:44,900
Because... you were in prison?

280
00:36:47,420 --> 00:36:48,339
That's right.

281
00:36:48,940 --> 00:36:49,900
What did you do?

282
00:36:53,420 --> 00:36:56,860
I did a lot of shit. I was all over
the place, making trouble all the time.

283
00:36:58,179 --> 00:36:59,699
Why, what did she tell you?

284
00:37:03,659 --> 00:37:07,580
That I shouldn't talk to you.
And that you'll never look for me.

285
00:37:09,619 --> 00:37:10,980
See, here I am.

286
00:37:20,779 --> 00:37:23,819
- Aren't you going to pick it up?
- It's unknown.

287
00:37:28,940 --> 00:37:31,580
Don't tell them at home
that you met me, okay?

288
00:37:41,420 --> 00:37:42,819
Are you coming tomorrow?

289
00:37:44,139 --> 00:37:45,139
I can.

290
00:38:00,259 --> 00:38:02,339
- Hello.
- Good afternoon.

291
00:38:03,060 --> 00:38:04,659
Is this Tibor Kondor?

292
00:38:05,380 --> 00:38:06,460
Yes?

293
00:38:06,540 --> 00:38:10,659
<i>I'm calling from the Life Protection Unit</i>
<i>of Budapest Police HQ.</i>

294
00:38:10,739 --> 00:38:13,339
<i>You have to come in</i>
<i>for questioning.</i>

295
00:38:14,020 --> 00:38:15,179
Regarding what?

296
00:38:15,739 --> 00:38:19,420
<i>The man you beat up Thursday night</i>
<i>fell into a coma today.</i>

297
00:38:19,819 --> 00:38:22,299
<i>Come and see me</i>
<i>in Teve street at 10 AM.</i>

298
00:38:28,980 --> 00:38:33,940
Tibor Kondor. Regarding the
life-threatening assault

299
00:38:34,020 --> 00:38:38,580
that took place on Thursday
September 16, at 22:14,

300
00:38:38,659 --> 00:38:40,699
I am questioning you as a suspect.

301
00:38:41,299 --> 00:38:44,020
You can file a complaint
against being suspected,

302
00:38:44,100 --> 00:38:46,619
you are not obliged to speak.

303
00:38:46,699 --> 00:38:49,739
You may refuse to speak at
any time during the procedure.

304
00:38:49,819 --> 00:38:52,580
- Do you understand this information?
- Yes.

305
00:38:53,139 --> 00:38:55,540
In your own words,
tell me what happened.

306
00:38:57,219 --> 00:38:59,699
He came with his girlfriend,
who was shitfaced.

307
00:39:00,060 --> 00:39:04,500
Told them that they can't go in.
But they got in somehow.

308
00:39:04,580 --> 00:39:06,420
Then I told them that wasn't okay.

309
00:39:07,580 --> 00:39:10,100
First, the woman came at me,
then the guy.

310
00:39:10,179 --> 00:39:13,580
He was already on a roll,
so I gave him a little twist.

311
00:39:13,659 --> 00:39:16,460
- Can you be more concrete?
- Concrete how?

312
00:39:16,540 --> 00:39:19,179
"They got in somehow."
"He was already on a roll."

313
00:39:19,259 --> 00:39:22,819
"I gave him a little twist."
Can you elaborate?

314
00:39:23,619 --> 00:39:25,940
They wanted to go in,
but I didn't let them.

315
00:39:26,020 --> 00:39:28,020
- My colleague let them...
- His name?

316
00:39:28,100 --> 00:39:29,739
Zsolt Bene let them in.

317
00:39:29,819 --> 00:39:34,779
I suspected that this was a mistake,
since, as I mentioned, they were drunk.

318
00:39:35,500 --> 00:39:37,060
I told them to leave.

319
00:39:37,139 --> 00:39:43,100
Then she picked up a fat wine glass,
broke it, and lunged at me with a shard.

320
00:39:43,500 --> 00:39:47,540
Well, that's... Only a woman can do that.
Then he hit me...

321
00:39:49,139 --> 00:39:51,739
and I did hit him back,
more than once.

322
00:39:52,500 --> 00:39:56,339
But what was I supposed to do?
Stand there like a dick at a wedding?

323
00:39:56,420 --> 00:39:58,259
- Do you wish to say anything else?
- No.

324
00:39:59,380 --> 00:40:02,179
I checked your record.
You have a criminal history.

325
00:40:03,339 --> 00:40:06,020
You did four years for
vehicular manslaughter.

326
00:40:06,100 --> 00:40:07,339
That is not relevant.

327
00:40:07,420 --> 00:40:10,540
This is not the first time the suspect
committed a life-threatening crime,

328
00:40:10,619 --> 00:40:12,779
so, I believe that it is relevant.

329
00:40:12,860 --> 00:40:16,380
Under the influence of drugs
and alcohol he caused an accident

330
00:40:16,460 --> 00:40:19,139
resulting in the death of his partner,
Edina Várkonyi.

331
00:40:19,219 --> 00:40:20,779
I'm going to report bias.

332
00:40:20,860 --> 00:40:23,819
Don't you see a pattern
between these two cases?

333
00:40:53,540 --> 00:40:57,060
- Are we going to the theatre?
- To the circus, young lady.

334
00:41:26,779 --> 00:41:28,500
- Evenin'.
- Good evening.

335
00:41:31,139 --> 00:41:34,619
Listen, guys. The doors are open until 7.
After that, you're standing outside.

336
00:41:35,179 --> 00:41:38,339
Richie, look at you.
You want me to button you up?

337
00:41:40,139 --> 00:41:40,980
What a dick.

338
00:41:42,259 --> 00:41:44,139
One more week, then I'm gone.

339
00:41:45,299 --> 00:41:46,299
Because?

340
00:41:46,380 --> 00:41:48,540
To fuck about here,
for 1500 Forints per hour?

341
00:41:48,619 --> 00:41:51,020
Looking like a penguin? Fuck that.
I'm outta here!

342
00:41:51,500 --> 00:41:52,779
Where?

343
00:41:54,299 --> 00:41:56,980
Barcelona,
they are hiring at a casino.

344
00:41:57,060 --> 00:41:59,219
I'd work two days a week,
and I'll make 150 Euros a day.

345
00:41:59,580 --> 00:42:00,900
I'll party the whole time.

346
00:42:01,659 --> 00:42:04,219
Be careful, or they'll
take you as a dancer too.

347
00:42:04,299 --> 00:42:05,980
You're just envious.

348
00:42:11,699 --> 00:42:13,060
I'm at Karola's...

349
00:42:14,739 --> 00:42:15,779
Hello.

350
00:42:16,219 --> 00:42:18,139
Are you Julcsi's daughter?

351
00:42:18,739 --> 00:42:22,259
Look! It's Julcsi's daughter.
You're Anna, right?

352
00:42:22,339 --> 00:42:26,299
Your mom told me a lot about you.
That you do modeling and such.

353
00:42:28,339 --> 00:42:29,580
Tell me, how is it?

354
00:42:30,259 --> 00:42:32,739
- Well...
- You were abroad... In Japan, right?

355
00:42:32,819 --> 00:42:34,940
Yes, and in Cuba too.

356
00:42:35,020 --> 00:42:36,460
- You hear that?
- Yeah, great.

357
00:42:36,940 --> 00:42:39,179
Yes, we lived
on a yacht the whole time.

358
00:42:39,779 --> 00:42:41,219
Considering that,
you look pale.

359
00:42:41,299 --> 00:42:44,900
They sprayed me with a whitening cream
so I wouldn't get a tan.

360
00:42:44,980 --> 00:42:47,860
- With a whitening cream?
- There you are!

361
00:42:47,940 --> 00:42:50,299
- We introduced ourselves to Anna.
- Hello, I'm Julcsi.

362
00:42:51,460 --> 00:42:54,900
- She is not your daughter?
- I could never get Anna to come here.

363
00:42:57,020 --> 00:42:59,819
So? Where can I buy
that skin whitener?

364
00:43:01,100 --> 00:43:02,020
Leave her be.

365
00:43:04,179 --> 00:43:05,100
This is outrageous!

366
00:43:42,100 --> 00:43:43,580
- What's the matter?
- She sneaked in.

367
00:43:43,980 --> 00:43:45,900
- I'll handle it.
- I'll handle it myself.

368
00:43:46,900 --> 00:43:47,819
She is with me.

369
00:43:48,219 --> 00:43:50,819
For this they could
cancel our contract!

370
00:43:50,900 --> 00:43:53,739
There's no need to be mad,
she'll sit here quietly.

371
00:43:54,060 --> 00:43:54,980
Why aren't you at your place?

372
00:43:55,540 --> 00:43:58,100
- He brought this child in here.
- Who is she?

373
00:43:58,659 --> 00:43:59,860
My daughter.

374
00:44:01,020 --> 00:44:04,179
- What's got into you?
- I'll let you two handle this.

375
00:44:05,139 --> 00:44:07,500
This is a workplace,
not a fucking kids' party.

376
00:44:08,100 --> 00:44:10,139
Is it a problem that
she ate two sandwiches?

377
00:44:10,219 --> 00:44:13,420
No, the problem is that
you always get into trouble.

378
00:44:13,500 --> 00:44:16,380
For me, it's not worth it.
Get outta here, okay?

379
00:44:18,900 --> 00:44:20,619
- Are you firing me?
- That's right.

380
00:44:21,380 --> 00:44:22,540
Right now, right here?

381
00:44:22,980 --> 00:44:25,819
And your free shelter is gone.
Move out from B7.

382
00:44:29,380 --> 00:44:31,060
The exit is not that way!

383
00:44:56,619 --> 00:44:57,900
Bon appétit!

384
00:45:08,619 --> 00:45:10,219
What are you looking at?

385
00:45:12,900 --> 00:45:15,900
This fuckin' shit!
Fuck this!

386
00:45:18,940 --> 00:45:19,940
Hey, Tibi, stop it.

387
00:45:20,020 --> 00:45:21,299
- Come outside.
- I'll eat this first.

388
00:45:21,380 --> 00:45:24,139
- Buddy! Don't do this, come on!
- I said now.

389
00:45:25,060 --> 00:45:25,980
Sorry.

390
00:45:35,860 --> 00:45:37,980
Stop it! Come outside!
Come on.

391
00:45:38,500 --> 00:45:41,060
- You'll have to carry me...
- That's enough.

392
00:46:01,739 --> 00:46:02,739
What is it now?

393
00:46:04,299 --> 00:46:06,299
- Why did you do that?
- Do what?

394
00:46:06,779 --> 00:46:09,580
- We were supposed to leave!
- We did leave, didn't we?

395
00:46:16,580 --> 00:46:19,060
Why feel sorry for them?

396
00:46:30,580 --> 00:46:31,980
Was I an asshole?

397
00:46:35,619 --> 00:46:36,540
Yes.

398
00:46:39,819 --> 00:46:41,380
Show me how much.

399
00:46:44,659 --> 00:46:46,380
So I wasn't an asshole.

400
00:46:49,139 --> 00:46:50,779
That's all?

401
00:46:53,739 --> 00:46:55,739
I won't ever be an asshole again.

402
00:46:56,339 --> 00:46:57,659
Promise?

403
00:47:02,100 --> 00:47:03,460
Promise.

404
00:47:33,020 --> 00:47:34,259
Tastes like shit.

405
00:47:34,699 --> 00:47:35,819
I like it.

406
00:47:50,100 --> 00:47:53,100
You should invite
this Karola over sometime.

407
00:48:05,219 --> 00:48:07,980
It's always them hosting you.
It's not right.

408
00:48:08,940 --> 00:48:12,139
- What her parents do for a living?
- They're lawyers.

409
00:48:21,060 --> 00:48:22,259
What are you looking for?

410
00:48:22,900 --> 00:48:25,100
- Some tools.
- What for?

411
00:48:25,900 --> 00:48:27,219
For home economics.

412
00:48:28,339 --> 00:48:30,100
I'll find you some tools tomorrow.

413
00:48:37,699 --> 00:48:39,739
- Are you coming?
- Coming.

414
00:49:16,699 --> 00:49:17,619
Thank you.

415
00:49:18,380 --> 00:49:19,739
It was next to this.

416
00:49:22,940 --> 00:49:24,339
It was mom's, right?

417
00:49:27,219 --> 00:49:28,940
I couldn't find the other one.

418
00:49:31,299 --> 00:49:32,779
She only wore one.

419
00:49:33,420 --> 00:49:34,659
Why?

420
00:49:36,219 --> 00:49:37,500
It was her idea.

421
00:49:38,060 --> 00:49:40,380
She always had odd socks.

422
00:50:20,259 --> 00:50:21,540
What are you doing?

423
00:50:22,179 --> 00:50:23,380
What do you think? I'm cooking.

424
00:50:24,380 --> 00:50:26,940
You don't need that much.
It'll be disgusting.

425
00:50:27,420 --> 00:50:28,380
Really?

426
00:50:37,219 --> 00:50:38,739
You seem to be
doing great with this.

427
00:50:39,139 --> 00:50:42,020
- In England, I always cooked for myself.
- You were in England?

428
00:50:42,420 --> 00:50:44,580
I was an exchange student
in Liverpool.

429
00:50:44,659 --> 00:50:47,060
Exchange student...
what the heck is that?

430
00:50:47,460 --> 00:50:49,779
I lived with an English girl,
but her parents sent me back,

431
00:50:49,860 --> 00:50:51,619
because she told them
that I broke her hand.

432
00:50:52,060 --> 00:50:54,460
And... It wasn't you?

433
00:50:54,860 --> 00:50:57,940
No, but she cried so hard,
the teachers believed her.

434
00:50:58,020 --> 00:51:00,420
And when I came back
they kicked me out of the school.

435
00:51:01,779 --> 00:51:03,100
Why are you lying?

436
00:51:03,860 --> 00:51:05,100
I'm not lying.

437
00:51:05,179 --> 00:51:07,739
Don't give me that,
I can see you're faking.

438
00:51:08,420 --> 00:51:11,339
She fell out of a tree.
She was clumsy. That's it.

439
00:51:13,900 --> 00:51:16,020
I built a hideout in a tall tree,

440
00:51:16,100 --> 00:51:19,339
then Emily and her friend climbed in,
and they didn't let me in.

441
00:51:19,420 --> 00:51:21,420
But I built the whole thing on my own!

442
00:51:21,819 --> 00:51:24,299
So I locked them inside,
and took away the ladder.

443
00:51:24,380 --> 00:51:26,420
They sat up there all day long!

444
00:51:26,500 --> 00:51:28,619
Then Emily got out.

445
00:51:28,699 --> 00:51:31,219
But it's not my fault
if she can't jump properly.

446
00:51:33,020 --> 00:51:34,659
Did you tell them this?

447
00:51:37,819 --> 00:51:42,139
If you had said this, then maybe you
wouldn't have to take the blame, right?

448
00:51:45,299 --> 00:51:47,900
But I'd love to have
a word with this Emily.

449
00:51:53,540 --> 00:51:54,460
Hello.

450
00:51:55,380 --> 00:51:57,339
- Hello.
- Hi!

451
00:52:07,699 --> 00:52:09,940
Can't you see the room is occupied?

452
00:52:11,580 --> 00:52:13,500
There isn't room
for four of us.

453
00:52:13,819 --> 00:52:16,699
It's a shared kitchen,
didn't you see the sign?

454
00:52:18,060 --> 00:52:20,739
I can't believe it.
We can't get five minutes in peace!

455
00:52:21,500 --> 00:52:23,500
- Relax, man.
- Don't 'relax' me.

456
00:52:26,940 --> 00:52:28,259
Niki, come on.

457
00:52:29,420 --> 00:52:30,819
Did you hear?

458
00:52:41,580 --> 00:52:43,060
Thank you very much.

459
00:53:30,259 --> 00:53:31,580
Tastes good.

460
00:53:48,179 --> 00:53:51,020
I got a letter from the police.

461
00:53:51,100 --> 00:53:54,139
<i>We have to appear as witnesses,</i>
<i>because of a fight.</i>

462
00:53:54,739 --> 00:53:56,540
<i>- Did somebody hurt you?</i>
<i>- No!</i>

463
00:53:57,179 --> 00:54:00,540
<i>- What is all this? You can tell me...</i>
<i>- Nothing happened!</i>

464
00:54:00,619 --> 00:54:03,900
<i>What is this business</i>
<i>with the police?</i>

465
00:54:04,500 --> 00:54:05,540
I don't know.

466
00:54:05,860 --> 00:54:08,500
<i>Come home,</i>
<i>and we'll talk about it, okay?</i>

467
00:54:09,139 --> 00:54:10,460
Okay.

468
00:54:15,380 --> 00:54:16,940
Something wrong?

469
00:54:17,699 --> 00:54:19,900
Granny got a letter from the police.

470
00:54:20,699 --> 00:54:23,819
We have to go in.
Because of that fight.

471
00:54:25,060 --> 00:54:27,380
You don't have to say anything.
Okay?

472
00:54:28,779 --> 00:54:30,940
Don't say anything,
and it'll be fine.

473
00:54:52,900 --> 00:54:54,619
Niki, do you know
why we're here?

474
00:54:59,299 --> 00:55:02,739
There is CCTV footage of you
on Thursday, September 16...

475
00:55:03,100 --> 00:55:06,500
at the entrance of a nightclub called Red.

476
00:55:08,060 --> 00:55:12,500
That night, there was a fight in the club.
There is no footage of that.

477
00:55:13,020 --> 00:55:16,380
Your father, Tibor Kondor
got into a fight with a man.

478
00:55:16,900 --> 00:55:18,259
Did he come to see you?

479
00:55:18,339 --> 00:55:20,699
It's important that we let Niki speak,
so please...

480
00:55:20,779 --> 00:55:23,699
I told you to tell me
if he contacts you.

481
00:55:23,779 --> 00:55:27,860
If you don't let the girl speak,
I'll have to ask you to leave the room.

482
00:55:30,460 --> 00:55:34,420
You should know that if you tell me
what you saw, it might help your father,

483
00:55:34,500 --> 00:55:36,179
or it might not.

484
00:55:36,819 --> 00:55:40,779
You must be careful to
answer me honestly.

485
00:55:44,980 --> 00:55:48,940
Can you tell me why you went
to the place where your father worked?

486
00:55:49,020 --> 00:55:52,739
- You went there yourself? At night?
- I have to ask you to leave the room.

487
00:55:52,819 --> 00:55:55,100
I have the right to know
what happened to my granddaughter.

488
00:55:55,179 --> 00:55:58,299
You are obstructing questioning,
please leave.

489
00:56:00,860 --> 00:56:02,699
Until you do, we can't continue.

490
00:56:12,060 --> 00:56:14,219
If you are ready,
we can continue.

491
00:56:16,699 --> 00:56:20,420
Can you tell me why you went
to the place where your father worked?

492
00:56:24,500 --> 00:56:27,020
Did your father ask you to go there?

493
00:56:28,699 --> 00:56:30,299
You wanted to go there?

494
00:56:32,139 --> 00:56:33,980
Why did you want to go there?

495
00:56:36,500 --> 00:56:38,819
Did you want to say something to him?

496
00:56:40,460 --> 00:56:42,339
I just wanted to see him.

497
00:56:43,580 --> 00:56:44,500
Why?

498
00:56:45,860 --> 00:56:49,299
- I heard that he was there.
- Where was he, until then?

499
00:56:50,699 --> 00:56:52,060
- Inside.
- Where?

500
00:56:53,860 --> 00:56:54,900
In prison.

501
00:57:00,460 --> 00:57:02,299
And did you see him at the club?

502
00:57:05,980 --> 00:57:06,900
Yes.

503
00:57:07,619 --> 00:57:09,219
And did you see the fight?

504
00:57:11,580 --> 00:57:12,659
No.

505
00:57:13,699 --> 00:57:15,900
You didn't see anybody fighting?

506
00:57:17,619 --> 00:57:21,020
Well... I did. A woman went at him,
and wanted to beat him up.

507
00:57:21,100 --> 00:57:22,179
Your father?

508
00:57:23,940 --> 00:57:24,860
Yes.

509
00:57:25,819 --> 00:57:28,420
Then did you see the fight, or didn't you?

510
00:57:30,900 --> 00:57:31,980
I saw it.

511
00:57:34,460 --> 00:57:36,819
And did you see your father fight?

512
00:57:40,299 --> 00:57:43,179
Remember, I told you,
there are no right or wrong answers.

513
00:57:43,819 --> 00:57:46,259
What matters is that you tell the truth.

514
00:57:47,619 --> 00:57:48,540
Yes...

515
00:57:51,580 --> 00:57:54,100
Did your father
strike the first blow?

516
00:58:05,339 --> 00:58:06,619
No.

517
00:58:08,900 --> 00:58:10,739
Thank you for your help.

518
00:58:11,980 --> 00:58:13,299
We are finished.

519
00:58:17,739 --> 00:58:21,460
I'm calling the medical expert.
Do you stand by your opinion?

520
00:58:21,540 --> 00:58:22,580
Yes.

521
00:58:22,659 --> 00:58:25,299
Please, in a few sentences,
summarize your expert opinion.

522
00:58:28,060 --> 00:58:30,619
Based on my examinations,
I came to the conclusion

523
00:58:31,060 --> 00:58:34,020
that as a result of strikes
from the accused's fist,

524
00:58:34,100 --> 00:58:36,779
and due to a fall to the ground
the victim sustained...

525
00:58:37,100 --> 00:58:39,900
serious injuries that resulted in
bleeding within the skull.

526
00:58:39,980 --> 00:58:44,139
The victim was only saved from death
due to prompt medical assistance.

527
00:58:44,619 --> 00:58:46,540
To this day, the victim is comatose,

528
00:58:46,619 --> 00:58:50,139
and the long-term effects of
his injury are unpredictable.

529
00:59:09,699 --> 00:59:10,699
Go inside.

530
00:59:12,139 --> 00:59:13,100
Hear me?

531
00:59:14,779 --> 00:59:15,460
Niki.

532
00:59:17,940 --> 00:59:18,940
Niki!

533
00:59:22,179 --> 00:59:23,860
You have the nerve
to show up here?

534
00:59:24,179 --> 00:59:27,619
You promised me
that you wouldn't look for her anymore.

535
00:59:28,420 --> 00:59:30,020
She came to see me.

536
00:59:30,980 --> 00:59:32,540
And I wanted to see her, too.

537
00:59:33,259 --> 00:59:36,380
What do you want?
Haven't you caused pain enough?

538
00:59:40,299 --> 00:59:41,460
I'm sorry.

539
00:59:42,259 --> 00:59:46,060
If I see you near her again,
I'll tell her what you did!

540
00:59:48,060 --> 00:59:49,540
You took her away from me...

541
00:59:53,020 --> 00:59:55,460
- I didn't mean to.
- You didn't mean to...

542
00:59:56,179 --> 00:59:59,460
You made her get into the car
while you were drunk!

543
01:00:01,299 --> 01:00:03,020
She pulled the wheel.

544
01:01:14,339 --> 01:01:15,380
What did you do?

545
01:01:23,380 --> 01:01:24,540
We were driving.

546
01:01:27,179 --> 01:01:28,100
We had a fight.

547
01:01:31,219 --> 01:01:32,980
I was being jealous again.

548
01:01:36,900 --> 01:01:38,460
I was driving too fast.

549
01:01:39,259 --> 01:01:40,860
I was really mad, and she...

550
01:01:42,659 --> 01:01:45,739
...she wanted to get out
while the car was moving.

551
01:01:49,259 --> 01:01:51,020
We crashed into the guard rail.

552
01:01:55,420 --> 01:01:57,259
I didn't want to hurt her.

553
01:01:58,299 --> 01:02:00,139
You two were my everything.

554
01:04:26,940 --> 01:04:29,020
Niki

555
01:04:42,259 --> 01:04:43,339
I don't know, I think it's math.

556
01:04:44,020 --> 01:04:45,739
- We have physics next.
- How do you know?

557
01:04:45,819 --> 01:04:47,619
We got the final schedule.

558
01:04:47,699 --> 01:04:50,739
Well, the teacher told me that
she'd send it to me, but she didn't.

559
01:04:52,020 --> 01:04:53,779
- But then what is the next class?
- I don't know.

560
01:04:53,860 --> 01:04:56,179
Something really stinks here.

561
01:05:00,020 --> 01:05:02,299
It really stinks here.

562
01:05:44,860 --> 01:05:47,299
What's going on here?
Both of you, stop it, this instant!

563
01:05:47,819 --> 01:05:49,779
Give me your report book, now!

564
01:05:57,659 --> 01:05:59,940
I'd like to see both of your parents.

565
01:06:03,339 --> 01:06:05,259
In this closed hearing,
the court has reached,

566
01:06:05,339 --> 01:06:07,500
and announces
the following verdict.

567
01:06:08,060 --> 01:06:13,420
The accused, Tibor Kondor, is guilty
of causing life threatening bodily harm.

568
01:06:14,259 --> 01:06:18,060
The court now sentences him
to spend three years in prison.

569
01:06:19,219 --> 01:06:22,380
The sentence is to be spent
in a medium-security prison.

570
01:06:28,219 --> 01:06:30,219
This fucking thing...

571
01:06:41,380 --> 01:06:42,580
Closing time!

572
01:06:45,860 --> 01:06:47,380
I'm closing up now.

573
01:06:48,420 --> 01:06:49,339
Hey.

574
01:06:50,259 --> 01:06:51,339
Wake up.

575
01:07:00,420 --> 01:07:01,739
Let me drink this one.

576
01:07:02,060 --> 01:07:03,219
Uh-huh.

577
01:07:26,259 --> 01:07:27,900
This is what I owe you, right?

578
01:07:30,540 --> 01:07:31,619
No?

579
01:07:33,380 --> 01:07:34,299
Thanks.

580
01:07:36,060 --> 01:07:37,020
You want to come in?

581
01:07:38,179 --> 01:07:39,739
Get inside! Shoo! Get in!

582
01:07:41,739 --> 01:07:43,139
Get inside!

583
01:07:44,659 --> 01:07:45,779
I'd rather not.

584
01:07:46,819 --> 01:07:48,619
When are you going inside?

585
01:07:48,699 --> 01:07:50,659
Tonight.
The lawyer called.

586
01:07:51,420 --> 01:07:52,500
I'm sorry.

587
01:08:06,259 --> 01:08:07,619
What are you lookin' at?

588
01:08:08,779 --> 01:08:09,940
No more walks.

589
01:08:17,259 --> 01:08:20,579
<i>Can you come to school now?</i>
<i>Room 8b, fourth floor.</i>

590
01:08:23,419 --> 01:08:24,419
What is it?

591
01:08:27,940 --> 01:08:29,579
Can I take the car for a ride?

592
01:08:30,259 --> 01:08:31,219
Now?

593
01:08:31,579 --> 01:08:34,740
I have to make a stop.
I'll bring it back right away.

594
01:08:48,379 --> 01:08:50,700
Did you tell them at home
about the meeting?

595
01:08:51,259 --> 01:08:53,780
- Yes.
- Then why did nobody come?

596
01:08:55,980 --> 01:08:57,660
Show me your report book.

597
01:09:10,700 --> 01:09:11,980
This isn't signed.

598
01:09:14,020 --> 01:09:16,179
This will have consequences.

599
01:09:16,259 --> 01:09:19,219
I'm going to speak
to your grandmother.

600
01:09:20,259 --> 01:09:22,539
Sorry, we'll have to
reschedule this meeting.

601
01:09:22,620 --> 01:09:26,179
I left work early today.
Karola missed sports practice.

602
01:09:26,259 --> 01:09:29,660
I see, but we can't proceed...

603
01:09:30,060 --> 01:09:33,060
I'm sorry you had to
come here for no reason.

604
01:09:36,299 --> 01:09:38,299
- Afternoon!
- Good afternoon.

605
01:09:40,299 --> 01:09:41,860
I'm Niki's father.

606
01:09:43,900 --> 01:09:46,259
You didn't tell your grandmother?

607
01:09:50,060 --> 01:09:55,339
Thank you for coming, but the fact is
that you aren't Niki's legal guardian.

608
01:09:55,419 --> 01:09:58,780
And without the legal guardian
we cannot represent Niki here.

609
01:09:59,139 --> 01:10:03,060
What legal guardian? Did I invite myself?
My daughter called me.

610
01:10:03,139 --> 01:10:05,579
Yes, I know, but you can't stay here.

611
01:10:08,660 --> 01:10:09,700
What's the issue?

612
01:10:12,419 --> 01:10:13,339
Go on.

613
01:10:13,980 --> 01:10:15,660
Tell us what you did.

614
01:10:19,100 --> 01:10:20,740
You're not proud of it, are you?

615
01:10:21,100 --> 01:10:23,259
- I had a fight.
- She attacked Karola.

616
01:10:23,339 --> 01:10:26,379
Scratched her so badly,
it left a wound on her face.

617
01:10:28,980 --> 01:10:31,379
Did anyone ask her why she did it?

618
01:10:31,459 --> 01:10:34,379
I don't think this level of aggression
is ever acceptable.

619
01:10:34,940 --> 01:10:36,980
So are they just here for decoration?

620
01:10:37,419 --> 01:10:39,179
All right, Niki...

621
01:10:39,740 --> 01:10:42,459
...would you tell us
what made you so angry?

622
01:10:43,900 --> 01:10:46,419
She smeared
dogshit on my shoes.

623
01:10:47,820 --> 01:10:49,700
- You did what?
- Is that true?

624
01:10:50,139 --> 01:10:52,579
- She got the same ones I had!
- I wanted them first!

625
01:10:52,660 --> 01:10:56,539
- Why didn't you buy them?
- You said you didn't even like them!

626
01:11:00,339 --> 01:11:02,100
Tell me something you fought for.

627
01:11:02,179 --> 01:11:05,020
Something you really wanted
and you did everything for it.

628
01:11:05,339 --> 01:11:07,339
We'll deal with this, okay?

629
01:11:09,100 --> 01:11:10,100
Nothing?

630
01:11:10,179 --> 01:11:13,139
- We came first in volleyball.
- What did you get for it?

631
01:11:13,660 --> 01:11:14,860
A medal.

632
01:11:15,419 --> 01:11:18,539
- What if I pissed on your medal?
- Leave my child alone!

633
01:11:18,620 --> 01:11:21,780
- That tone isn't necessary, OK?
- We won't resolve things like this.

634
01:11:22,499 --> 01:11:23,740
Would you be pleased?

635
01:11:24,539 --> 01:11:26,179
I'd be a real asshole,
if I did that, right?

636
01:11:26,539 --> 01:11:28,259
Niki worked fucking hard
for those shoes.

637
01:11:28,660 --> 01:11:33,060
Oh really? And so she can fight?
As if that were an excuse.

638
01:11:34,060 --> 01:11:35,339
You know what?

639
01:11:39,980 --> 01:11:41,419
Here, buy the shoes.

640
01:11:41,900 --> 01:11:45,259
But my daughter was hurt,
and this won't undo it.

641
01:11:46,900 --> 01:11:47,900
Do you want it?

642
01:11:50,179 --> 01:11:51,100
Me neither.

643
01:11:51,419 --> 01:11:54,940
It seems the only way to get even
is if I shit on your daughter's shoes.

644
01:11:55,020 --> 01:11:57,219
Let's stop, right here.
Please, leave.

645
01:11:58,860 --> 01:11:59,940
Gladly.

646
01:12:00,020 --> 01:12:01,219
Niki, are you coming?

647
01:12:37,780 --> 01:12:38,700
You have a car?

648
01:12:39,740 --> 01:12:40,660
Rad.

649
01:12:48,780 --> 01:12:50,060
Where are we going?

650
01:12:54,700 --> 01:12:56,499
Elvira lawyer

651
01:13:02,259 --> 01:13:04,499
Wanna come with me to Barcelona?

652
01:13:06,379 --> 01:13:08,299
I'd have a job there...

653
01:13:10,379 --> 01:13:13,219
What do you say?
We'll leave all these assholes behind.

654
01:13:14,499 --> 01:13:15,499
Cool.

655
01:13:17,299 --> 01:13:19,900
- But we can't take your phone with us.
- Why?

656
01:13:19,980 --> 01:13:22,419
Don't worry,
I'll buy you a better one.

657
01:13:57,179 --> 01:13:59,219
What's the beach like?
Pebbles or sand?

658
01:13:59,299 --> 01:14:01,820
- Whichever you want.
- I'd prefer pebbles.

659
01:14:01,900 --> 01:14:04,419
The water is much clearer,
and I can see my feet.

660
01:15:39,339 --> 01:15:40,259
Pump no. 4.

661
01:15:41,020 --> 01:15:42,620
5710 Forints.

662
01:15:47,660 --> 01:15:48,860
This too?

663
01:15:50,060 --> 01:15:51,139
8Yeah.

664
01:16:03,539 --> 01:16:05,179
8805 Forints.

665
01:16:10,020 --> 01:16:13,219
Fuck, I thought I had more money.
Do you have any?

666
01:16:28,020 --> 01:16:29,860
That's enough for the gas.

667
01:16:36,379 --> 01:16:39,820
- Then we won't take these.
- Just leave them here.

668
01:16:42,860 --> 01:16:44,100
Thanks.

669
01:16:50,539 --> 01:16:52,900
Yes... that's a good girl.

670
01:16:55,299 --> 01:16:56,860
We're almost done.

671
01:17:00,459 --> 01:17:01,419
All right.

672
01:17:02,459 --> 01:17:03,900
Good girl.

673
01:17:04,299 --> 01:17:05,740
You're a good girl.

674
01:17:09,539 --> 01:17:11,100
We're almost done.

675
01:17:11,499 --> 01:17:12,900
Okay.

676
01:17:13,459 --> 01:17:14,660
There you go.

677
01:17:22,700 --> 01:17:25,259
There.
Now we lift this up.

678
01:17:26,299 --> 01:17:27,219
Okay.

679
01:17:36,539 --> 01:17:38,499
It's okay now.

680
01:17:44,100 --> 01:17:45,259
Almost done.

681
01:17:47,820 --> 01:17:49,299
We're just about done.

682
01:18:07,820 --> 01:18:10,740
If all goes well,
we'll be on the beach tomorrow.

683
01:18:14,459 --> 01:18:16,940
Cool right?

684
01:18:37,139 --> 01:18:39,820
- What's wrong?
- Be quiet for a moment.

685
01:18:39,900 --> 01:18:41,419
What's going on?

686
01:19:38,940 --> 01:19:39,740
Are you hurt?

687
01:20:06,339 --> 01:20:07,459
What's wrong?

688
01:20:09,820 --> 01:20:11,740
I thought we were in trouble.

689
01:20:20,259 --> 01:20:22,139
Everything will be all right.

690
01:20:24,660 --> 01:20:26,660
Everything will be all right.

691
01:22:57,940 --> 01:22:59,219
Niki.

692
01:23:02,419 --> 01:23:03,579
Niki.

693
01:23:14,660 --> 01:23:15,940
Why have we come back?

694
01:23:17,579 --> 01:23:18,980
We're not going away?

695
01:23:20,259 --> 01:23:22,700
- You promised!
- You're expected at home.

696
01:23:22,780 --> 01:23:24,060
You promised!

697
01:23:27,379 --> 01:23:29,940
- We can't go to Barcelona right now.
- Why?

698
01:23:30,539 --> 01:23:31,780
I was convicted.

699
01:23:34,100 --> 01:23:35,940
Because of that fight you saw.

700
01:23:36,620 --> 01:23:37,980
Will you go away?

701
01:23:39,100 --> 01:23:40,060
Again?

702
01:24:04,740 --> 01:24:05,820
I'll come back.

703
01:24:09,219 --> 01:24:10,660
Now, go.

704
01:24:25,620 --> 01:24:26,780
Niki.

705
01:26:09,259 --> 01:26:10,700
- Good evening.
- Good evening.

706
01:26:10,780 --> 01:26:12,179
Evening.

707
01:26:15,620 --> 01:26:17,339
I think you're looking for me.

708
01:26:20,860 --> 01:26:22,259
Tibor Kondor.

709
01:26:24,820 --> 01:26:27,100
- Get to the front of the car.
- I'll call dispatch.

710
01:26:27,780 --> 01:26:29,419
Put your hands on the hood.

711
01:26:30,139 --> 01:26:32,780
I'm going to frisk
your clothes, understood?

712
01:26:32,860 --> 01:26:33,860
Yes.

713
01:26:33,940 --> 01:26:35,020
-What?
-I understand.

714
01:26:35,100 --> 01:26:38,780
...Tibor Kondor gave himself up.
He is currently being taken into custody.

715
01:26:44,660 --> 01:26:45,780
Hey!

716
01:26:46,339 --> 01:26:47,259
Stop!
