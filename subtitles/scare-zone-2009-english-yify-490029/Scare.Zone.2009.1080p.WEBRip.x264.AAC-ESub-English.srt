1
00:03:15,445 --> 00:03:17,363
- Fuckin' dickface!

2
00:03:19,157 --> 00:03:20,200
- Sorry.

3
00:03:20,241 --> 00:03:21,159
You ran into me.

4
00:03:23,453 --> 00:03:25,330
Spider, he's all
yours.

5
00:03:25,371 --> 00:03:26,581
- Lights!

6
00:03:28,041 --> 00:03:30,376
Darryl, Darryl, Darryl.

7
00:03:30,460 --> 00:03:31,377
It is Darryl right?

8
00:03:31,419 --> 00:03:32,921
- That's ri-
- Don't Darryl!

9
00:03:33,004 --> 00:03:34,631
Don't step in front of our
patrons, man.

10
00:03:34,714 --> 00:03:36,049
They will run you down and
stampede

11
00:03:36,090 --> 00:03:37,383
right over your ass, boy.

12
00:03:37,425 --> 00:03:39,427
You don't know pain until
you've had for teeny-bitches

13
00:03:39,469 --> 00:03:40,887
in six inch stilettos screamin'

14
00:03:40,970 --> 00:03:42,639
like a virgin on prom night!

15
00:03:44,015 --> 00:03:46,517
It's simple bro, in and out.

16
00:03:46,559 --> 00:03:47,852
Duck and jive ya know.

17
00:03:47,894 --> 00:03:49,896
Boo then skidoo.

18
00:03:49,938 --> 00:03:51,147
- Boo then skidoo.

19
00:03:51,773 --> 00:03:52,690
Boo then skidoo.

20
00:03:52,732 --> 00:03:53,858
- Bring your simple ass in here,
go.

21
00:03:53,942 --> 00:03:54,651
Go, go, go!

22
00:03:59,364 --> 00:04:00,615
You'll get it.

23
00:04:00,657 --> 00:04:01,491
You better get it.

24
00:04:01,532 --> 00:04:02,408
We open Friday!

25
00:04:03,201 --> 00:04:03,993
Heh, heh, heh!

26
00:04:04,035 --> 00:04:04,994
Hey now hold on,

27
00:04:05,078 --> 00:04:06,329
I don't want you getting all
stiff on me.

28
00:04:06,412 --> 00:04:07,622
I don't want you dancing
like those zombies

29
00:04:07,705 --> 00:04:09,874
in a Michael Jackson video, ya
know.

30
00:04:12,961 --> 00:04:14,212
None of that, okay?

31
00:04:14,254 --> 00:04:15,046
Come here.

32
00:04:15,088 --> 00:04:16,005
All right you got to stay loose.

33
00:04:16,047 --> 00:04:17,215
Move.

34
00:04:18,049 --> 00:04:18,758
Fresh meat!

35
00:04:20,343 --> 00:04:23,596
- Hey Spider, say hello to Bart,
Tracy,

36
00:04:23,638 --> 00:04:24,806
Margo, um-

37
00:04:24,889 --> 00:04:27,308
- Tyler.
- Tyler and Jake.

38
00:04:27,934 --> 00:04:30,687
- Okay, thank you miss Summer
and this is-

39
00:04:30,728 --> 00:04:31,938
- PJ, my fiancee.

40
00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:33,439
He's going to help out.

41
00:04:33,481 --> 00:04:34,357
Stop it.

42
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:35,692
- Yeah, good helper.

43
00:04:35,733 --> 00:04:37,819
Uh, and this is Darryl who, like
you,

44
00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:39,779
is new to the ways of fright!

45
00:04:39,821 --> 00:04:41,364
- Hey Bart.
- Hey Darryl.

46
00:04:41,406 --> 00:04:42,949
- We know each other from physi-

47
00:04:43,032 --> 00:04:43,866

00:04:43,950 --> 00:04:45,493
Welcome to Scare Zone year

00:04:45,576 --> 00:04:46,786

00:04:48,621 --> 00:04:49,998

52
00:04:52,166 --> 00:04:53,710
- Hey!

53
00:04:53,751 --> 00:04:54,794
- Look.

54
00:04:55,461 --> 00:04:57,338
You were scared, huh?

55
00:04:57,380 --> 00:04:58,339
You pussy.

56
00:04:58,381 --> 00:04:59,632
And now a tour of this year's
attraction:

57
00:04:59,716 --> 00:05:01,092
"Scare Zone Three: The
Psycho-Splatter

58
00:05:01,134 --> 00:05:02,760
Raw-topsy Slaughter Dungeon".

59
00:05:02,844 --> 00:05:03,636
- Yeah man!

60
00:05:03,678 --> 00:05:05,638
- All right follow me, kiddies.

61
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:08,349
Ah, what you, no, no, no.

62
00:05:08,391 --> 00:05:09,350
That's the gift shop.

63
00:05:09,392 --> 00:05:11,185
Okay that's where we end.

64
00:05:11,227 --> 00:05:12,603
This is where we start.

65
00:05:12,645 --> 00:05:13,730
Yeah, over here, yeah!

66
00:05:13,771 --> 00:05:14,897
Okay, why don't you
just stick close to me.

67
00:05:14,981 --> 00:05:15,940
- All right.
- All right?

68
00:05:15,982 --> 00:05:16,983
You're lookin' like you rode in

69
00:05:17,025 --> 00:05:18,067
on the short bus or somethin'.

70
00:05:18,109 --> 00:05:18,860
Come on, guys.

71
00:05:23,239 --> 00:05:24,324
- Excellent.

72
00:05:24,365 --> 00:05:25,199
Pablo!

73
00:05:25,241 --> 00:05:26,284
Donde esta

74
00:05:26,367 --> 00:05:28,328
the remote control?

75
00:05:28,369 --> 00:05:29,454
Fantastic.

76
00:05:29,495 --> 00:05:30,288
All right, good,

77
00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:31,873
let's see how we're doing.

78
00:05:33,499 --> 00:05:35,543
Brilliant!

79
00:05:35,626 --> 00:05:36,919
- Bravo Mr. Peters.

80
00:05:37,462 --> 00:05:39,756
- Ah-heh, that is fantastic.

81
00:05:42,717 --> 00:05:43,760
- I'm sorry, what?

82
00:05:43,801 --> 00:05:45,136
- Ah, no, it's very
good, it's very good eh?

83
00:05:45,178 --> 00:05:46,220
- All right, yeah, yeah, yeah.

84
00:05:46,304 --> 00:05:47,597
- So I pulse them through in
like

85
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:49,640
six to eight at a time, no conga
line,

86
00:05:49,682 --> 00:05:51,017
we want to separate
them into little clumps

87
00:05:51,059 --> 00:05:53,019
that way you can get
them to shit themselves.

88
00:05:53,061 --> 00:05:54,437
- Heh, that's right if they see

89
00:05:54,479 --> 00:05:56,105
you coming there's no surprise.

90
00:05:56,147 --> 00:05:57,982
- Boys and ghouls, meet the
owner

91
00:05:58,066 --> 00:06:00,276
and creator, the Duke of
Dementia,

92
00:06:00,318 --> 00:06:02,528
Scare Zone's own Sir Oliver
Peters!

93
00:06:02,570 --> 00:06:04,322
- Yeah, just Oliver will be
fine.

94
00:06:04,405 --> 00:06:06,074
- Hey man, good, I'm glad I ran
into you.

95
00:06:06,115 --> 00:06:07,200
You know I've got that
appointment-

96
00:06:08,409 --> 00:06:09,535
- And the newbies need to get
a tour from the man Oliver.

97
00:06:09,619 --> 00:06:10,536
- All right.

98
00:06:10,578 --> 00:06:11,371
Okay.

99
00:06:11,454 --> 00:06:12,455
Go!

100
00:06:12,497 --> 00:06:13,998
- All right, kids, scare ya
later.

101
00:06:14,082 --> 00:06:15,792
Don't touch!

102
00:06:15,875 --> 00:06:16,751
Don't touch.

103
00:06:16,793 --> 00:06:17,585
Excuse me!

104
00:06:17,627 --> 00:06:18,961
Excuse me, thank you, thank you.

105
00:06:19,045 --> 00:06:21,172
- All right, let's go
over to the next scene.

106
00:06:21,255 --> 00:06:22,548
There's more room in there.

107
00:06:24,384 --> 00:06:25,426
Voila!

108
00:06:26,469 --> 00:06:27,428
Ha-ha!

109
00:06:27,512 --> 00:06:29,222
Welcome my pretties on your

110
00:06:29,263 --> 00:06:30,890
next stop on the scare zone
tour:

111
00:06:30,973 --> 00:06:34,852
The Lair of the Slutty
Cannibal Vampiress Wench.

112
00:06:34,894 --> 00:06:36,312
Now, this poor fellow here is

113
00:06:36,354 --> 00:06:39,690
one of the vampiress's victims!

114
00:06:41,484 --> 00:06:44,445
He came directly from the
Camden dungeon of tortures.

115
00:06:44,487 --> 00:06:45,863
The first time Prince Harry saw

116
00:06:45,905 --> 00:06:48,199
this gag he 'bout shit himself.

117
00:06:48,282 --> 00:06:49,200
You.

118
00:06:49,283 --> 00:06:50,410
- Margo.
- Perfect!

119
00:06:50,493 --> 00:06:52,328
You could work this room, all
right?

120
00:06:52,412 --> 00:06:57,667
You are a slutty blood sucking
vampire seeking victims.

121
00:06:57,708 --> 00:06:58,918
Now, let me hear you hiss!

122
00:06:59,001 --> 00:07:00,253
- Hiss?
- Yep.

123
00:07:00,294 --> 00:07:01,838
- Uh, hisssss.

124
00:07:04,340 --> 00:07:07,844
- Okay, uh, let me hear you, a,
shriek!

125
00:07:07,927 --> 00:07:09,637
- Um, ahhhh.

126
00:07:09,679 --> 00:07:12,098
- Well, she's got the slutty
part down.

127
00:07:12,140 --> 00:07:12,890
- Shut up Trace!

128
00:07:12,932 --> 00:07:13,724
- No, no, no, no, no.

129
00:07:13,808 --> 00:07:14,600
It's not a problem.

130
00:07:14,684 --> 00:07:15,726
Come forth.

131
00:07:15,810 --> 00:07:16,644
- Um.
- C'mon.

132
00:07:16,686 --> 00:07:17,603
This is what will work for you,

133
00:07:17,645 --> 00:07:18,813
this is a shaker can.

134
00:07:21,774 --> 00:07:24,694
Okay, you come out of
the shadows, all right?

135
00:07:24,777 --> 00:07:26,279
And then, yee-ahhh!

136
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:28,114
It jars them pretty good.

137
00:07:28,156 --> 00:07:28,865
- Cool!

138
00:07:28,906 --> 00:07:31,033
Mind if I-
- Oh, yeah.

139
00:07:33,703 --> 00:07:34,787
All right, all right, all right,

140
00:07:34,829 --> 00:07:35,872
settle down, whoa!

141
00:07:35,955 --> 00:07:36,747
Settle down, champ.

142
00:07:36,789 --> 00:07:37,623
What's your name?

143
00:07:37,707 --> 00:07:38,833
- Tyler.
- Of course it is.

144
00:07:38,916 --> 00:07:40,918
I've got a job for you
and the skinny fellow

145
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:42,211
in a big scene down the hall.

146
00:07:42,253 --> 00:07:43,337
Moving on!

147
00:07:44,046 --> 00:07:45,173
- Hey Bart, Tyler's pretty

148
00:07:45,256 --> 00:07:47,633
good with that shaker
can, lots of practice.

149
00:07:48,676 --> 00:07:50,219
And you get to work with him!
- Oh, great.

150
00:07:50,261 --> 00:07:51,929
Thanks, dick-weed.

151
00:07:56,267 --> 00:07:57,268
- Okay here we come,

152
00:07:57,351 --> 00:07:58,895
comin' in, comin in, comin' in,
comin' in.

153
00:07:58,936 --> 00:08:00,104
Over there, over there, very
nice.

154
00:08:00,188 --> 00:08:01,355
Now before the big scene, our
guests

155
00:08:01,439 --> 00:08:04,442
must pass through the lye vat
dungeon.

156
00:08:04,525 --> 00:08:06,360
- What's a lye vat?

157
00:08:06,777 --> 00:08:09,197
- Yeah, lye was used in powder
form

158
00:08:09,238 --> 00:08:11,032
for cleaning hides,
chemically burning away

159
00:08:11,115 --> 00:08:12,742
the hair and the fat, yada,
yada, yada.

160
00:08:12,783 --> 00:08:15,244
But it also came in handy
if you were a serial killer

161
00:08:15,286 --> 00:08:17,955
trying to hide the stench of
your victims.

162
00:08:18,039 --> 00:08:19,665
- Gross.
- And you are?

163
00:08:19,707 --> 00:08:20,791
- Uh, Jake Jacobs.

164
00:08:20,833 --> 00:08:21,626
- Spectacular.

165
00:08:21,667 --> 00:08:22,752
Come over here.

166
00:08:22,793 --> 00:08:24,629
Now you will be in this part
of the slaughter dungeon

167
00:08:24,670 --> 00:08:26,547
wielding your bloody ax.

168
00:08:26,631 --> 00:08:28,299
You'll be dressed in a mask and
jump suit

169
00:08:28,341 --> 00:08:29,425
like your friend there.

170
00:08:29,509 --> 00:08:30,593
- Okay, ohh.

171
00:08:30,676 --> 00:08:32,595
Heavier than I thought.
- Yeah, that's

172
00:08:32,637 --> 00:08:33,930
because it's real.

173
00:08:34,013 --> 00:08:34,931
- Okay.
- Okay.

174
00:08:34,972 --> 00:08:36,891
Do you know how much a good
quality

175
00:08:36,933 --> 00:08:38,768
fake plastic ax costs?

176
00:08:38,809 --> 00:08:39,769
Damn right it's real!

177
00:08:39,852 --> 00:08:41,103
It's cheaper and it lasts
longer.

178
00:08:41,187 --> 00:08:43,272
The blade is not the
sharpest thing in the world,

179
00:08:43,314 --> 00:08:46,067
but it could hurt like hell
if you chop somebody with it.

180
00:08:46,150 --> 00:08:50,363
So, you hold it like this, and
threaten!

181
00:08:50,404 --> 00:08:51,322
All right?

182
00:08:51,405 --> 00:08:56,410
Now don't, let anybody grab it
from you.

183
00:09:01,123 --> 00:09:01,791
- Okay.

184
00:09:01,832 --> 00:09:03,042
- Good, okay, moving on.

185
00:09:03,084 --> 00:09:04,085
Chop chop!

186
00:09:04,126 --> 00:09:07,129
- Oh god it's real.
- Okay sexy man is crazy!

187
00:09:07,838 --> 00:09:09,298
- This is sweet.

188
00:09:09,966 --> 00:09:10,883
- I don't know.

189
00:09:10,967 --> 00:09:12,093
I think this Oliver guy knows a
little

190
00:09:12,176 --> 00:09:13,427
too much about hacking and
killing-

191
00:09:13,511 --> 00:09:15,513
- Yeah, and he's got plans
for "the skinny fellow".

192
00:09:15,555 --> 00:09:16,305
Chop chop!

193
00:09:24,605 --> 00:09:25,565
- Ha-ha!

194
00:09:25,606 --> 00:09:27,066
New for this year:

195
00:09:27,108 --> 00:09:29,318
The Raw-topsy Zone where, as you

196
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:31,571
can see, a number of hellish
morticians

197
00:09:31,612 --> 00:09:32,947
are watching a victim getting

198
00:09:32,989 --> 00:09:34,865
sliced up on the autopsy table.

199
00:09:34,907 --> 00:09:36,450
Now, sitting among the statues,

200
00:09:36,534 --> 00:09:40,663
looking just like the
dummies will be Tyler and-

201
00:09:40,705 --> 00:09:41,497
- Bart.

202
00:09:41,539 --> 00:09:42,373
- Bingo!

203
00:09:42,456 --> 00:09:44,000
You'll be frozen just like the
rest,

204
00:09:44,083 --> 00:09:47,128
and then you leap up and
boo-yah!

205
00:09:47,211 --> 00:09:49,380
You scream at unsuspecting
mazers.

206
00:09:49,422 --> 00:09:51,382
Now, you don't want to blow
your voice out, all right?

207
00:09:51,424 --> 00:09:53,467
So scream a couple of
times, and then other times

208
00:09:53,551 --> 00:09:57,597
you can use this aluminum
bat to hit the railing.

209
00:09:58,180 --> 00:09:59,557
Just don't hit anybody.

210
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:02,184
Remember, you scare fast then
pull back.

211
00:10:02,268 --> 00:10:04,937
You don't want some macho
creep punching you out.

212
00:10:04,979 --> 00:10:05,980
Dangerous.

213
00:10:06,063 --> 00:10:07,148
- Somebody takes a swing
at me and he's going down!

214
00:10:07,231 --> 00:10:08,691
- No, no, no Tyler.

215
00:10:08,774 --> 00:10:10,693
We do not slug the paying
guests.

216
00:10:10,735 --> 00:10:13,654
- Yeah, we're not supposed
to touch them at all, right?

217
00:10:13,696 --> 00:10:14,530
- That's right.

218
00:10:14,572 --> 00:10:15,239
No touchy.

219
00:10:15,323 --> 00:10:16,115
Too much liability.

220
00:10:16,157 --> 00:10:17,783
However we, the actors,

221
00:10:17,867 --> 00:10:20,119
can interact physically with
each other.

222
00:10:20,161 --> 00:10:22,705
- Tyler's all yours.
- For example, Summer

223
00:10:22,788 --> 00:10:25,583
here will play a live
victim getting sliced up

224
00:10:25,666 --> 00:10:26,751
by some mad doctor.

225
00:10:26,792 --> 00:10:29,003
You see, he amputates her leg

226
00:10:29,086 --> 00:10:30,546
while she's still squirming.

227
00:10:30,588 --> 00:10:32,173
It's a good gag.

228
00:10:32,214 --> 00:10:33,924
- Oh and I could be your doctor.

229
00:10:34,717 --> 00:10:36,093
Check this out!

230
00:10:36,135 --> 00:10:37,553
- No, PJ.

231
00:10:37,637 --> 00:10:38,387
No, Oliver.

232
00:10:38,471 --> 00:10:39,597
I told you, I'm helping you

233
00:10:39,639 --> 00:10:40,848
open this thing and then
we're going to Vegas

234
00:10:40,931 --> 00:10:42,475
to get married like you
promised.

235
00:10:42,516 --> 00:10:43,809
Right, honey?

236
00:10:44,977 --> 00:10:47,647
- Summer, could I talk to
you over here for a moment?

237
00:10:53,694 --> 00:10:54,820
- Look, I know you want to

238
00:10:54,904 --> 00:10:57,114
get the hell out of here
and start your new life

239
00:10:57,156 --> 00:10:58,574
with prince charming-

240
00:10:58,616 --> 00:10:59,992
- Awesome!

241
00:11:00,034 --> 00:11:01,661
- Excellent choice by the way.

242
00:11:01,744 --> 00:11:03,704
But I really need you here.

243
00:11:03,746 --> 00:11:04,580
- No you don't.

244
00:11:04,622 --> 00:11:05,790
You've got Claire, okay?

245
00:11:05,873 --> 00:11:07,166
I need to get out of my parent's
house.

246
00:11:07,249 --> 00:11:09,126
So we're getting married
this weekend as planned.

247
00:11:09,168 --> 00:11:10,503
- Look, open for me this Friday.

248
00:11:10,586 --> 00:11:13,130
If you can stay for Saturday and
Sunday

249
00:11:13,214 --> 00:11:15,675
I will make the honeymoon really
special.

250
00:11:15,716 --> 00:11:19,345
Come on you're the only
seasoned performer I've got.

251
00:11:20,930 --> 00:11:22,431
- All right I'll open for you
Friday

252
00:11:22,515 --> 00:11:25,768
and I'll talk to PJ about this
weekend.

253
00:11:25,810 --> 00:11:26,894
- Fair enough.

254
00:11:26,936 --> 00:11:29,855
Let's show the others
where they'll be stationed.

255
00:11:29,939 --> 00:11:31,524
And we are walking-

256
00:11:33,651 --> 00:11:36,404
- Oh, Tracy.
- Uh, I didn't do that-

257
00:11:38,406 --> 00:11:39,532
Oh my God I'm gonna puke!

258
00:11:39,615 --> 00:11:43,119
- What makes this smell?
- My own secret recipe.

259
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:46,288
- Why hello.
- Ugh that's bad.

260
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:49,583
That is so cool.

261
00:11:52,294 --> 00:11:54,004
- And we're walking.

262
00:11:54,463 --> 00:11:56,924
Okay good, come on, everyone
through the body bag room.

263
00:11:57,007 --> 00:11:58,718
I've turned the AC up in here to
turn this

264
00:11:58,759 --> 00:12:00,428
sucker into a freezer.

265
00:12:00,469 --> 00:12:02,346
Now, to the doll hall!

266
00:12:09,437 --> 00:12:10,688
Ha-ha!

267
00:12:10,730 --> 00:12:13,357
Isn't this fantastic!

268
00:12:13,399 --> 00:12:15,151
All right, and who's left?

269
00:12:15,192 --> 00:12:15,985
- Me.

270
00:12:16,026 --> 00:12:16,777
Darryl.

271
00:12:16,819 --> 00:12:17,528
- Bonanza!

272
00:12:17,570 --> 00:12:19,238
You will be in this zone

273
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:20,865
which was last year's big hit.

274
00:12:20,906 --> 00:12:24,577
It's entitled Dies and Dolls.

275
00:12:24,618 --> 00:12:25,953
You'll be dressed just as you
are,

276
00:12:25,995 --> 00:12:29,206
freaking people out with
your blood stained machete.

277
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:32,543
You know this still is my
favorite room.

278
00:12:32,626 --> 00:12:34,503
Every child's nightmare lives in
the eyes

279
00:12:34,545 --> 00:12:36,839
of these lifeless beings.

280
00:12:37,757 --> 00:12:40,134
I've been collecting them for
years.

281
00:12:40,676 --> 00:12:43,929
Years and years.

282
00:12:43,971 --> 00:12:44,722
- Yahhhh!

283
00:12:48,934 --> 00:12:49,685
You!

284
00:12:49,727 --> 00:12:50,644
You are-

285
00:12:50,686 --> 00:12:51,604
- Tracy!

286
00:12:51,645 --> 00:12:52,480
- Superlative!

287
00:12:52,521 --> 00:12:53,731
In this zone you will be a fresh

288
00:12:53,814 --> 00:12:55,483
victim wearing a wedding
dress and veil working up

289
00:12:55,524 --> 00:12:57,443
and down these stairs.

290
00:12:57,485 --> 00:12:58,778
Yes, you are a recent victim.

291
00:12:58,861 --> 00:13:01,614
Uh, you're turning vampire,
holding the bat-baby

292
00:13:01,697 --> 00:13:04,116
that you just gave bloody birth
to

293
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:06,619
via the old monkey-wrench
cesarean.

294
00:13:06,702 --> 00:13:07,661
- Oh my god.

295
00:13:07,703 --> 00:13:09,121
Can't I just get like

296
00:13:09,163 --> 00:13:10,915
a, shakey-up can?

297
00:13:10,956 --> 00:13:11,791
- No.

298
00:13:11,874 --> 00:13:14,418
No, you show people your mutated
newborn.

299
00:13:14,502 --> 00:13:16,629
Sir Oliver!

300
00:13:16,670 --> 00:13:19,048
It's ready!
- Ha-ha!

301
00:13:19,131 --> 00:13:21,258
Now, we are in for a treat!

302
00:13:25,012 --> 00:13:27,640
Ah, hello Jesus.

303
00:13:27,681 --> 00:13:28,432
- No, no, no.

304
00:13:28,474 --> 00:13:29,308
"Hey-Zu".

305
00:13:29,391 --> 00:13:30,142
- Ex-scusi.

306
00:13:31,685 --> 00:13:32,436
I'm sorry, what?

307
00:13:32,478 --> 00:13:33,646
- It, it's ready.

308
00:13:33,729 --> 00:13:34,480
It's ready!

309
00:13:34,563 --> 00:13:35,314
- Ah ha-ha!

310
00:13:35,356 --> 00:13:36,315
Buen provetcho!

311
00:13:36,357 --> 00:13:38,651
And now welcome to the insanity

312
00:13:38,692 --> 00:13:41,195
of the Psycho Strobelight Room!

313
00:13:51,163 --> 00:13:52,039
Heh-heh-heh.

314
00:13:52,081 --> 00:13:53,165
Good!

315
00:13:53,207 --> 00:13:57,044
As usual, I will be in the
finale area,

316
00:13:57,127 --> 00:13:59,213
playing the pumpkin carver,

317
00:13:59,296 --> 00:14:02,174
scaring people shitless with

318
00:14:02,925 --> 00:14:05,052
Bloody Molly my trademarked

319
00:14:05,094 --> 00:14:06,720
signature patent pending gas
powered

320
00:14:06,804 --> 00:14:08,722
two cycle 20-inch chainsaw.

321
00:14:08,764 --> 00:14:11,559
Now, this is where I
break one of my own rules,

322
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:13,769
and only I can do it.

323
00:14:13,811 --> 00:14:14,854
Bart.

324
00:14:14,895 --> 00:14:15,688
Come here.

325
00:14:25,406 --> 00:14:26,323
You see?

326
00:14:26,365 --> 00:14:28,325
I locked the chain on,
so no chain no pain.

327
00:14:28,367 --> 00:14:30,995
Just a hell of a lot
of vibration and noise.

328
00:14:31,036 --> 00:14:32,037
Grazie, Hymie.

329
00:14:32,121 --> 00:14:33,622
Now, I wouldn't normally
touch anybody with it,

330
00:14:33,664 --> 00:14:35,207
but if there's some complete ass

331
00:14:35,291 --> 00:14:37,543
acting too cool in front of his
friends,

332
00:14:37,626 --> 00:14:40,337
I might feel the need
to give him a gut check,

333
00:14:40,421 --> 00:14:41,380
like ol' Bart there.

334
00:14:41,463 --> 00:14:43,841
Now add to this the smoke
machines,

335
00:14:43,883 --> 00:14:45,217
lots of light and sound effects,

336
00:14:45,301 --> 00:14:47,595
the strobe room, the chainsaw
finale,

337
00:14:47,636 --> 00:14:50,931
yada, yada, yada, we happily
freak out the customers

338
00:14:51,015 --> 00:14:52,600
who happily scamper into the

339
00:14:52,641 --> 00:14:54,268
gift shop to spend more money!

340
00:14:55,185 --> 00:14:56,478
Jesus!

341
00:14:56,562 --> 00:14:57,605
No, no, no,
"Hey-Zu".

342
00:14:57,646 --> 00:14:58,480
- No, no, no.

343
00:14:58,522 --> 00:14:59,231
Whatever.

344
00:14:59,273 --> 00:15:00,232
What the hell was that?

345
00:15:06,906 --> 00:15:07,698
De nada.

346
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:08,782
Okay, uh, right.

347
00:15:08,824 --> 00:15:10,159
You go into the gift
shop and wait for Claire.

348
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:11,368
She'll give you your costumes

349
00:15:11,410 --> 00:15:14,079
and talk makeup for
anybody who needs help.

350
00:15:14,121 --> 00:15:15,623
Say that again but slower.

351
00:15:18,208 --> 00:15:19,627
- Yeah I've been coming
here the past few years.

352
00:15:19,668 --> 00:15:21,337
He's only open three
nights but at 10 bucks

353
00:15:21,378 --> 00:15:22,379
a head he makes a killing.

354
00:15:22,463 --> 00:15:23,339
- Oh, dude,

355
00:15:23,380 --> 00:15:24,465
I heard he used to manage a
house

356
00:15:24,506 --> 00:15:25,716
of horrors wax museum in London,

357
00:15:25,799 --> 00:15:27,051
but he got busted for
using real blood or a real

358
00:15:27,134 --> 00:15:28,344
corpse or something.

359
00:15:28,385 --> 00:15:29,511
- No, no!

360
00:15:29,553 --> 00:15:31,055
I heard he killed a goat live
just to watch people react.

361
00:15:31,138 --> 00:15:32,222
- Bullshit.

362
00:15:32,264 --> 00:15:33,515
- Yeah, no he got fired and
went to prison for, like,

363
00:15:33,599 --> 00:15:34,350
animal cruelty or something.

364
00:15:34,433 --> 00:15:35,351
- Oh no, no.

365
00:15:35,434 --> 00:15:36,477
I heard he went to
prison because he killed

366
00:15:36,518 --> 00:15:37,353
a boney, pasty virgin.

367
00:15:37,394 --> 00:15:38,854
- Oh, shut up asswipe.

368
00:15:41,690 --> 00:15:45,819
- Ooh, shopping!

369
00:15:45,903 --> 00:15:48,405
Oh, I wonder if we get, like,
half-off.

370
00:16:06,799 --> 00:16:08,133
- Who's the slut?

371
00:16:12,012 --> 00:16:13,055
Perfect.

372
00:16:13,764 --> 00:16:17,226
All right I designed this look
for you

373
00:16:17,768 --> 00:16:21,188
with this make-up illustration
you can work from.

374
00:16:21,271 --> 00:16:23,273
Your costume's over there, go
try it on

375
00:16:23,357 --> 00:16:25,943
and I'll help you with the
makeup later.

376
00:16:27,027 --> 00:16:28,779
The bride?

377
00:16:28,821 --> 00:16:30,030
Bat-boy's mother?

378
00:16:31,699 --> 00:16:33,242
I didn't design the dress.

379
00:16:33,325 --> 00:16:34,326
- Thank God.

380
00:16:34,410 --> 00:16:37,246
- Bought it at a consignment
shop, but it works.

381
00:16:37,329 --> 00:16:40,916
And your makeup needs to be more
defined.

382
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,668
Okay, we need to be able
to see it behind the veil.

383
00:16:42,751 --> 00:16:44,795
Why don't you slip that on, try
it out.

384
00:16:44,837 --> 00:16:45,879
- Great.

385
00:16:45,963 --> 00:16:47,589
- Dummies?
- Yo!

386
00:16:48,340 --> 00:16:50,175
- I mean morticians.

387
00:16:50,801 --> 00:16:53,804
You guys need to look just
like the mortician dummi-

388
00:16:57,599 --> 00:16:59,101
- Sorry.
- Costumes are over there,

389
00:16:59,184 --> 00:17:03,731
and I made boy-friendly
makeup directions for you.

390
00:17:03,772 --> 00:17:05,065
- Yes!

391
00:17:05,107 --> 00:17:06,191
- Makeup is with your costumes

392
00:17:06,275 --> 00:17:07,484
and we don't have a lot of room
in here

393
00:17:07,568 --> 00:17:09,862
so we put on our makeup here in
the shop.

394
00:17:09,945 --> 00:17:12,156
We rigged up a curtained
off changing area,

395
00:17:12,197 --> 00:17:14,742
it has one bench and one mirror-

396
00:17:15,784 --> 00:17:18,078
- Whoa!
- That's for the girls.

397
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:21,040
Boys just use the shop mirror.

398
00:17:23,667 --> 00:17:25,669
Masked psychos?

399
00:17:27,254 --> 00:17:30,132
I see you have your costume
already.

400
00:17:30,174 --> 00:17:31,258
Fit okay?

401
00:17:32,092 --> 00:17:32,885
- Yeah.

402
00:17:32,926 --> 00:17:34,136
Great.

403
00:17:34,178 --> 00:17:35,888
- And your mask, it's up there.

404
00:17:36,305 --> 00:17:39,433
There's lots of welder's gloves
and a mechanic jump suit,

405
00:17:39,475 --> 00:17:42,102
just pick ones that fit.

406
00:17:42,144 --> 00:17:43,062
Summer?

407
00:17:43,103 --> 00:17:44,855
I have your hospital
gown and doctor scrubs

408
00:17:44,938 --> 00:17:47,232
for PJ if Oliver can talk you
two into-

409
00:17:47,274 --> 00:17:48,275
- Claire, I don't know.

410
00:17:48,358 --> 00:17:50,235
Okay, we're leaving town to get
married.

411
00:17:54,156 --> 00:17:55,199
- Need a dress?

412
00:18:02,706 --> 00:18:03,791
- I look like a doctor.

413
00:18:18,847 --> 00:18:19,890
Perverts!

414
00:18:56,093 --> 00:18:57,052
- So, Claire,

415
00:18:57,094 --> 00:18:58,762
what part do you play?

416
00:18:58,804 --> 00:19:01,223
- Yeah, 'cause I really like
your costume.

417
00:19:01,306 --> 00:19:02,224
- Yeah.
- No.

418
00:19:02,307 --> 00:19:04,434
I stay here and work the gift
shop.

419
00:19:04,518 --> 00:19:08,355
Spider gets their money going
in, I get 'em going out.

420
00:19:08,897 --> 00:19:11,984
All right remember everybody,
today Spider

421
00:19:12,025 --> 00:19:14,611
rehearses you, but tomorrow
night we open.

422
00:19:14,653 --> 00:19:15,404
All right?

423
00:19:15,445 --> 00:19:16,238
Any questions?

424
00:19:16,321 --> 00:19:17,030
- Uh, yeah.

425
00:19:17,072 --> 00:19:18,699
Uh, who breaks us?

426
00:19:18,782 --> 00:19:19,658
- No breaks.

427
00:19:19,741 --> 00:19:21,285
- What?
- Look.

428
00:19:21,326 --> 00:19:22,452
We're open from seven p.m.

429
00:19:22,536 --> 00:19:23,954
until the last guest goes
through.

430
00:19:23,996 --> 00:19:25,414
All right, that's usually
'till, like midnight

431
00:19:25,497 --> 00:19:27,374
on the first two nights
and two a.m. on Halloween.

432
00:19:27,416 --> 00:19:28,458
- What if I have to pee?

433
00:19:28,542 --> 00:19:29,418
- Then pee!

434
00:19:29,459 --> 00:19:31,086
There's a toilet right there.

435
00:19:31,128 --> 00:19:32,754
And that's for everybody.

436
00:19:32,796 --> 00:19:34,631
- Okay, where do I smoke?

437
00:19:34,715 --> 00:19:36,008
- Out the back door in the
alley.

438
00:19:36,091 --> 00:19:38,427
Look, just duck out, do
whatever it is you need to do.

439
00:19:38,468 --> 00:19:39,803
No one in the maze is going to
say

440
00:19:39,887 --> 00:19:41,638
"Hey, there's supposed to
be a psycho killer here".

441
00:19:41,722 --> 00:19:45,350
Well, except maybe some
of our regulars. You!

442
00:19:45,392 --> 00:19:46,476
You were here last year, right?

443
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:48,103
- Uh, I only went though seven
times.

444
00:19:48,187 --> 00:19:49,771
Not like some of those
no-lifes who go through

445
00:19:49,813 --> 00:19:51,273
10 times a night if they can.

446
00:19:51,315 --> 00:19:52,441
- Yeah, 'cause you have a life.

447
00:19:52,482 --> 00:19:53,734
- Anyway, if you have to

448
00:19:53,775 --> 00:19:56,111
take a break just get back to
your post quickly so people

449
00:19:56,153 --> 00:19:56,987
get their money's worth.

450
00:19:57,029 --> 00:19:59,198
It's only three nights.

451
00:19:59,239 --> 00:20:00,407
You'll survive.

452
00:20:00,490 --> 00:20:01,617
And if we do good business,

453
00:20:01,658 --> 00:20:03,827
Oliver takes care of us with
nice bonuses.

454
00:20:03,911 --> 00:20:05,495
That's why I'm here.

455
00:20:05,579 --> 00:20:07,706
- I'm gonna need some help!

456
00:20:08,290 --> 00:20:09,166
- All right.

457
00:20:09,208 --> 00:20:12,002
Uh, boys, go see what Oliver
needs.

458
00:20:12,044 --> 00:20:13,253
And then everybody report to
Spider

459
00:20:13,337 --> 00:20:15,005
after lunch for rehearsals.

460
00:20:15,088 --> 00:20:16,131
Tyler!
- Yeah!

461
00:20:16,215 --> 00:20:19,426
- Every evening one person
has to come in an hour

462
00:20:19,468 --> 00:20:20,802
early to help Spider and Oliver

463
00:20:20,844 --> 00:20:22,137
prep the house for our guests.

464
00:20:22,221 --> 00:20:23,680
And you're up first.

465
00:20:23,764 --> 00:20:25,557
So, tomorrow at six.

466
00:20:25,599 --> 00:20:28,393
- I'll be here at five!
- Whatever.

467
00:20:30,479 --> 00:20:31,855
- High as you can there, Pablo.

468
00:20:31,939 --> 00:20:33,941
- Didn't this used to
be like, a Dollar Store?

469
00:20:33,982 --> 00:20:35,692
- No, it was a porno shop.

470
00:20:35,776 --> 00:20:37,903
- No way!
- Yeah!

471
00:20:37,945 --> 00:20:38,820
Douche!

472
00:20:38,904 --> 00:20:40,155
- You know actually this entire
attraction

473
00:20:40,197 --> 00:20:43,325
can fit into two pod containers.

474
00:20:43,367 --> 00:20:44,076
Yeah!

475
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:45,035
It takes me, Spider and half

476
00:20:45,077 --> 00:20:46,203
a dozen man-power guys.

477
00:20:46,286 --> 00:20:48,538
We can put the whole thing
up in a couple of days.

478
00:20:48,622 --> 00:20:51,250
Actually, Pablo, can you
get your men together?

479
00:20:51,291 --> 00:20:52,542
Uh, todos juntos?

480
00:20:52,626 --> 00:20:53,460
- Ah, si si.

481
00:20:57,881 --> 00:20:58,882
- Bellissimo.

482
00:20:58,966 --> 00:21:00,509
I'll tell ya, the biggest pain
in the ass

483
00:21:00,592 --> 00:21:03,428
is getting this sign up so hola
muchachos.

484
00:21:03,470 --> 00:21:06,390
Un, dos, trio!

485
00:21:11,645 --> 00:21:12,854
- "Prepare to be scared.

486
00:21:12,896 --> 00:21:14,690
Scare Zone Three this weekend!"

487
00:21:14,731 --> 00:21:16,108
Who comes up with this?

488
00:21:16,149 --> 00:21:17,067
- Oliver does.

489
00:21:17,109 --> 00:21:18,318
Keeps all this stuff in storage,

490
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:20,404
pulls it out once a
year and does his thing.

491
00:21:20,445 --> 00:21:21,571
- Hey, how do you think he makes

492
00:21:21,613 --> 00:21:23,407
that toilet scene smell so bad?

493
00:21:23,490 --> 00:21:24,950
- Ah he shits in the pots and
waits

494
00:21:24,992 --> 00:21:25,951
for the mold to grow.

495
00:21:25,993 --> 00:21:27,077
- No way!

496
00:21:27,119 --> 00:21:28,036
- Ha!

497
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:29,371
Jeez Bart, I don't know,
maybe he uses old socks

498
00:21:29,454 --> 00:21:31,415
or fertilizer or something.

499
00:21:31,456 --> 00:21:33,250
What do you think about Claire?

500
00:21:33,292 --> 00:21:34,001
- Freak.

501
00:21:34,042 --> 00:21:35,085
Goth gone wild.

502
00:21:35,127 --> 00:21:37,212
- I don't know, man,
awful smart to be a freak.

503
00:21:37,254 --> 00:21:38,422
Talented too.

504
00:21:38,463 --> 00:21:39,464
- Freak.

505
00:21:39,506 --> 00:21:42,634
"The Psycho-splatter
Raw-topsy Slaughter Dungeon."

506
00:21:43,593 --> 00:21:45,387
- Shit mother!

507
00:22:04,364 --> 00:22:05,198
- Damn!

508
00:22:05,282 --> 00:22:06,616
Maybe I shouldn't have come so
early.

509
00:22:14,124 --> 00:22:14,791
Hey!

510
00:22:14,875 --> 00:22:15,625
I'm here to-

511
00:22:59,169 --> 00:22:59,878
- What?

512
00:22:59,961 --> 00:23:01,463
- Uh, I think they're ready.

513
00:23:01,505 --> 00:23:03,048
Can we open early?

514
00:23:03,090 --> 00:23:03,799
- No.

515
00:23:03,882 --> 00:23:04,549
Hell no man!

516
00:23:04,633 --> 00:23:05,550
Tyler never showed.

517
00:23:05,592 --> 00:23:06,593
Me and Oliver had to open

518
00:23:06,676 --> 00:23:08,678
this whole damn place by
ourselves.

519
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:09,805
Shithead.

520
00:23:10,597 --> 00:23:11,640
Hold on.

521
00:23:13,225 --> 00:23:14,267
All right, you can go in now.

522
00:23:14,351 --> 00:23:14,976
Go!

523
00:23:15,018 --> 00:23:16,686
Go-go-go hurry up!

524
00:23:20,565 --> 00:23:21,566
All right you pussy worms!

525
00:23:21,608 --> 00:23:22,567
You ready to get freaked out?

526
00:23:22,609 --> 00:23:23,819
Yeah!

527
00:23:23,902 --> 00:23:26,279
- Are you ready for some blood
and guts?

528
00:23:26,321 --> 00:23:27,239
Yeah!

529
00:23:27,322 --> 00:23:28,615
- Then get ready for Scare Zone
Three:

530
00:23:28,698 --> 00:23:31,284
The Psycho-splatter
Raw-topsy Slaughter Dungeon!

531
00:23:31,326 --> 00:23:33,912
Yeah!

532
00:23:33,954 --> 00:23:35,497
- Opening in just 10 minutes!

533
00:23:37,958 --> 00:23:39,000
- Yeah.

534
00:23:39,543 --> 00:23:40,502
Hey, no masks in the maze.

535
00:23:40,585 --> 00:23:41,503
You guys know that!

536
00:23:41,545 --> 00:23:42,337
- Oh, no-no-no.

537
00:23:42,379 --> 00:23:43,505
Sorry Spidey.

538
00:23:43,547 --> 00:23:45,173
- Oh, hey freaky geeky.

539
00:23:45,215 --> 00:23:47,050
How've you been, man?

540
00:23:47,134 --> 00:23:49,678
Wow, you guys startin' to
multiply now.

541
00:23:50,137 --> 00:23:51,179
It was just the two of you
comin'

542
00:23:51,263 --> 00:23:52,222
in the last couple of years

543
00:23:52,264 --> 00:23:53,432
over and over and over again.

544
00:23:53,473 --> 00:23:54,474
I mean not that I mind.

545
00:23:54,516 --> 00:23:55,767
I like that you guys have no
life.

546
00:23:55,851 --> 00:23:56,935
Ha!

547
00:23:57,018 --> 00:23:58,145
As is our tradition,

548
00:23:58,228 --> 00:24:00,355
we have the winner of our
promotional Scare Zone

549
00:24:00,439 --> 00:24:02,899
T-shirt contest officially
unlock the doors

550
00:24:02,941 --> 00:24:04,067
to our chamber of horrors!

551
00:24:04,151 --> 00:24:05,318
Yeah, baby!

552
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:08,238
Woo-hoo!

553
00:24:12,075 --> 00:24:13,452
- It's open!

554
00:24:15,662 --> 00:24:17,956
- Thank you Miss Amber!

555
00:24:21,209 --> 00:24:22,419
All right boys, you know the
score,

556
00:24:22,461 --> 00:24:24,254
move inside to my podium and
wait there

557
00:24:24,337 --> 00:24:27,215
until I give the signal we're
open and I snatch your money.

558
00:24:27,299 --> 00:24:28,258
Ha!

559
00:24:30,552 --> 00:24:33,138
Excuse me, excuse me
out of the way please.

560
00:24:33,180 --> 00:24:36,433
Hey, man, Scare Zone 2, Dies &
Dolls, man.

561
00:24:36,475 --> 00:24:37,309
I love loyalty.

562
00:24:37,350 --> 00:24:38,810
That's good, that's good stuff.

563
00:24:38,894 --> 00:24:40,770
- Yeah, hey, when's Oliver going
to offer

564
00:24:40,812 --> 00:24:44,816
an unlimited admissions pass
for the regular customers.

565
00:24:44,858 --> 00:24:45,775
- Heh-heh.

566
00:24:45,817 --> 00:24:47,027
Why would he do that?

567
00:24:47,068 --> 00:24:49,154
You guys are stupid enough
to pay 10 bucks every time.

568
00:24:49,196 --> 00:24:50,906
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!

569
00:24:50,989 --> 00:24:51,823
Hi Claire!

570
00:24:53,742 --> 00:24:55,118
- We're good to go.

571
00:24:55,202 --> 00:24:57,579
- All right guys now remember no
masks,

572
00:24:57,621 --> 00:24:59,915
no smoking, no cameras!

573
00:24:59,998 --> 00:25:01,500
No checks, no credit cards.

574
00:25:01,541 --> 00:25:02,667
Just cash, baby.

575
00:25:02,751 --> 00:25:03,835
All right my fellow zonies!

576
00:25:03,919 --> 00:25:06,129
Scare Zone Three is now open for
business!

577
00:25:13,345 --> 00:25:14,596
- Raar!

578
00:25:14,638 --> 00:25:15,680
Shit!

579
00:25:37,827 --> 00:25:38,912
- Ah yes.

580
00:25:40,205 --> 00:25:41,039
- Help me!

581
00:25:50,465 --> 00:25:51,591
- Help me.

582
00:25:51,633 --> 00:25:52,592
Help me.

583
00:25:52,634 --> 00:25:53,635
Stop it!

584
00:25:53,677 --> 00:25:54,761
Help me.

585
00:26:03,770 --> 00:26:04,563
- Yah!

586
00:26:04,604 --> 00:26:05,647
Haaaa!

587
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:18,535
- All clear?

588
00:26:18,577 --> 00:26:19,869
Front door locked?

589
00:26:19,953 --> 00:26:23,415
All right, that is it for the
night!

590
00:26:26,167 --> 00:26:29,004
So we did pretty good for
the first night, right guys?

591
00:26:29,045 --> 00:26:30,797
Everybody got their costumes
hung up?

592
00:26:30,839 --> 00:26:31,715
Claire will pay everybody

593
00:26:31,756 --> 00:26:32,841
and let everybody out.

594
00:26:32,882 --> 00:26:35,093
Spider and I will close up the
attraction.

595
00:26:35,135 --> 00:26:37,596
Thank you for a great first
night.

596
00:26:37,679 --> 00:26:41,266
Claire, give everybody an extra
60 clams.

597
00:26:42,309 --> 00:26:43,226
Spider!

598
00:26:43,268 --> 00:26:44,352
Oliver!

599
00:26:44,436 --> 00:26:45,812
- Bullshit.

600
00:26:45,854 --> 00:26:47,814
This is why I'm leaving.

601
00:26:47,856 --> 00:26:48,773
I hate this town.

602
00:26:48,815 --> 00:26:49,858
This job is killing me.

603
00:26:49,941 --> 00:26:51,234
I'm in desperate need of a spa
treatment.

604
00:26:51,276 --> 00:26:52,736
- Hey, an extra 60 bucks isn't
ba-

605
00:26:52,819 --> 00:26:54,738
- And before I get home to
my goddamn parents' house

606
00:26:54,779 --> 00:26:56,781
where I'm living to try and
save money, horn dog over here

607
00:26:56,823 --> 00:26:59,242
is going to want to hump me up
one side and down the other.

608
00:26:59,326 --> 00:27:01,411
Of course I want him to so there
goes half

609
00:27:01,494 --> 00:27:04,414
the money we just made on a
cheap hotel.

610
00:27:04,456 --> 00:27:05,665
- We can do it in the car!

611
00:27:05,749 --> 00:27:07,125
- We are so out of here
tomorrow, Peege.

612
00:27:07,167 --> 00:27:10,920
- Um, tomorrow you're opening.

613
00:27:10,962 --> 00:27:11,796
- What?

614
00:27:11,838 --> 00:27:13,506
- Yeah, Spider has his
appointment,

615
00:27:13,590 --> 00:27:14,633
Oliver's not in 'till seven,

616
00:27:14,674 --> 00:27:15,717
you're the only one that knows
how

617
00:27:15,759 --> 00:27:17,177
to run the smoke machines.

618
00:27:17,260 --> 00:27:18,970
- Oh my God!

619
00:27:19,012 --> 00:27:19,846
- Thanks, Summer!

620
00:27:19,929 --> 00:27:21,556
"Thanks, Summer."

621
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:23,391
- What happened to
Amber the T-shirt pixie?

622
00:27:23,475 --> 00:27:26,144
- Oh, she's waiting for you in
the car.

623
00:27:26,186 --> 00:27:26,895
Bart!

624
00:27:26,978 --> 00:27:27,812
I'm kidding.

625
00:27:27,896 --> 00:27:29,105
Amber is only here for the
opening

626
00:27:29,147 --> 00:27:32,317
and then she goes to
her regular "night" job!

627
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:33,485
- Ohhhhhh.
- Get it.

628
00:27:33,526 --> 00:27:35,654
- Well, that just leaves
me, Tracy and Margo!

629
00:27:35,737 --> 00:27:38,031
Hey you guys want to hit
Denny's?

630
00:27:38,823 --> 00:27:39,949
- Sure.

631
00:27:39,991 --> 00:27:40,992
- Uh, Darryl?

632
00:27:41,034 --> 00:27:43,411
Can you stay a sec and help me
count cash?

633
00:27:43,453 --> 00:27:44,371
Sure.

634
00:27:44,454 --> 00:27:46,998
- Have fun with Edwina
Scissorhands.

635
00:27:52,712 --> 00:27:55,090
- Is this a lot of money for day
one?

636
00:27:58,927 --> 00:28:01,221
You're pretty fast with that
calculator.

637
00:28:01,262 --> 00:28:03,473
Did you learn that at school
or...

638
00:28:12,899 --> 00:28:14,025
Classic.

639
00:28:14,067 --> 00:28:15,276
- He's scared.
- That was awesome!

640
00:28:15,318 --> 00:28:17,529
- That was better than last
year.

641
00:28:18,697 --> 00:28:21,449
I'll never get tired of that
one.

642
00:28:29,416 --> 00:28:31,668
- Hey, boner!
- Shut up!

643
00:28:31,751 --> 00:28:34,337
Man, if I hear one more "boner"
line.

644
00:28:34,379 --> 00:28:35,505
- I don't know if this is worth

645
00:28:35,547 --> 00:28:36,464
an extra 40 bucks, man.

646
00:28:36,506 --> 00:28:37,799
We could get killed out here.

647
00:28:37,882 --> 00:28:41,177
Hey, I liked flagging
parked cars a lot better.

648
00:28:41,219 --> 00:28:42,303
- What?

649
00:28:42,345 --> 00:28:45,473
- I said I had an amazing night
counting money with Claire.

650
00:28:45,515 --> 00:28:46,725
- Yeah, sure you did.

651
00:28:46,808 --> 00:28:47,892
- Oh, we talked and laughed

652
00:28:47,976 --> 00:28:50,603
and she told me about her
family.

653
00:28:50,687 --> 00:28:51,396
- Yeah, who?

654
00:28:51,438 --> 00:28:52,647
The Addams Family?

655
00:28:54,524 --> 00:28:56,234
- Yeah!

656
00:28:56,276 --> 00:28:56,985
Look, man.

657
00:28:57,026 --> 00:28:58,611
She's a freak all right?

658
00:28:58,653 --> 00:29:00,363
- All right, a freak that can
add.

659
00:29:00,405 --> 00:29:02,157
Why are you focusing on her
when you know we can have

660
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:04,951
Margo's mangoes and Tracy's
tangerines!

661
00:29:06,745 --> 00:29:09,789
- Ah man, fu, was that a beer
bottle?

662
00:29:09,831 --> 00:29:10,999
- Shit mother!

663
00:29:14,836 --> 00:29:16,004
- Will you just stop?

664
00:29:16,045 --> 00:29:17,088
- What?

665
00:29:18,548 --> 00:29:19,632
- Stop it!

666
00:29:27,474 --> 00:29:30,393
Peege, can you hand me
another liter of fluid?

667
00:29:33,104 --> 00:29:36,524
- You know, I'd much rather be
giving you my bodily fluids.

668
00:29:36,608 --> 00:29:39,027
- That's sweet, honey,
but haven't you had enough

669
00:29:39,068 --> 00:29:39,944
of me by now?

670
00:29:40,862 --> 00:29:41,738
I'll could never get enough of
you.

671
00:29:41,821 --> 00:29:42,781
You are my-

672
00:29:42,822 --> 00:29:44,115
- Don't say it.

673
00:29:44,157 --> 00:29:45,200
- You are my-

674
00:29:45,241 --> 00:29:46,743
- Don't say it!

675
00:29:51,289 --> 00:29:52,207
Big boy.

676
00:29:52,248 --> 00:29:53,124
Come on.

677
00:29:53,166 --> 00:29:53,958
To the table.

678
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:54,834
To the table!

679
00:29:54,876 --> 00:29:55,627
Come on!

680
00:29:57,170 --> 00:29:59,088
Take your shirt off, take your
shirt off!

681
00:29:59,172 --> 00:30:00,423
Take it off!

682
00:30:06,638 --> 00:30:07,597
No, stop.
- What?

683
00:30:07,639 --> 00:30:09,265
- Stop, stop.

684
00:30:33,331 --> 00:30:34,499
- There.

685
00:30:34,541 --> 00:30:35,625
I got him.

686
00:30:37,752 --> 00:30:39,712
- I have to finish opening.

687
00:30:39,754 --> 00:30:41,172
- Ahhh, c'mon Summer!

688
00:30:41,256 --> 00:30:44,300
- I have to turn on the
lights and the sound.

689
00:30:44,342 --> 00:30:45,677
Get your shirt!

690
00:30:53,059 --> 00:30:55,770
Where's the frickin' audio?

691
00:30:57,939 --> 00:30:58,648
PJ!

692
00:30:58,690 --> 00:30:59,941
Stop playing with the chainsaw!

693
00:31:02,318 --> 00:31:02,986
PJ!

694
00:31:03,027 --> 00:31:04,362
Knock it off!

695
00:31:11,202 --> 00:31:12,370
PJ!

696
00:31:12,453 --> 00:31:13,037
PJ?

697
00:31:13,121 --> 00:31:15,123
What the fuck are...

698
00:31:22,130 --> 00:31:23,381
PJ?

699
00:31:23,464 --> 00:31:24,465
PJ!

700
00:31:51,284 --> 00:31:52,243
Scare Zone!

701
00:31:52,327 --> 00:31:53,244
Scare Zone!

702
00:31:53,328 --> 00:31:54,078
Scare Zone!

703
00:31:54,162 --> 00:31:54,913
Scare Zone!

704
00:31:54,996 --> 00:31:55,747
Scare Zone!

705
00:31:55,830 --> 00:31:56,581
Scare Zone!

706
00:31:56,664 --> 00:31:57,457
Scare Zone!

707
00:32:24,025 --> 00:32:24,859
Open!

708
00:32:24,901 --> 00:32:25,693
Open!

709
00:32:25,735 --> 00:32:26,736
Open!

710
00:32:26,819 --> 00:32:28,905
- Will you shut up!

711
00:32:28,947 --> 00:32:30,990
Oh shut up, calm down.

712
00:32:31,074 --> 00:32:33,284
We're not even open for
another half an hour.

713
00:32:33,368 --> 00:32:35,161
- Can't you open a little
earlier?

714
00:32:35,203 --> 00:32:36,204
Yeah!

715
00:32:36,287 --> 00:32:38,122
- I'm a little busy in here!

716
00:32:38,164 --> 00:32:42,877
Let me find something to
entertain you until we open.

717
00:32:45,380 --> 00:32:46,172
- No!

718
00:32:46,255 --> 00:32:46,965
No!

719
00:32:53,262 --> 00:32:54,305
Help me!

720
00:32:55,348 --> 00:32:56,724
Help me!

721
00:33:09,487 --> 00:33:11,072
- That was awesome!

722
00:33:12,782 --> 00:33:14,200
Do it again!

723
00:33:14,283 --> 00:33:15,410
Do it again!

724
00:33:15,493 --> 00:33:16,786
Do it again!

725
00:33:16,869 --> 00:33:17,996
Do it again!

726
00:33:18,079 --> 00:33:19,330
Do it again!

727
00:33:21,457 --> 00:33:23,835
- Hey man, why do I have to do
this again?

728
00:33:23,876 --> 00:33:24,627
It's PJ's turn!

729
00:33:24,669 --> 00:33:25,753
- PJ's gone, all right?

730
00:33:25,837 --> 00:33:26,838
You keep them happy.

731
00:33:26,921 --> 00:33:28,089
I've got to finish opening the
place up.

732
00:33:28,172 --> 00:33:29,590
- Wait, wait, wait, wait!
- What?

733
00:33:29,674 --> 00:33:30,883
- PJ's gone?

734
00:33:30,925 --> 00:33:31,843
And Summer too?

735
00:33:31,926 --> 00:33:32,885
- Yeah man gone and eloped!

736
00:33:32,927 --> 00:33:33,678
Something.

737
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:34,804
I don't know.

738
00:33:34,846 --> 00:33:36,222
Look, they opened the
place and apparently split.

739
00:33:36,264 --> 00:33:37,557
Okay, good luck to 'em, good
riddance.

740
00:33:37,640 --> 00:33:39,851
Go out there and keep
this crowd from rioting!

741
00:33:39,892 --> 00:33:40,977
Go, be a man!

742
00:33:55,158 --> 00:33:56,409
- I'm all by myself in here!

743
00:33:56,492 --> 00:33:58,870
First no Tyler, now no Summer
and PJ!

744
00:33:58,953 --> 00:34:00,455
- Relax my little mortician,

745
00:34:00,496 --> 00:34:03,249
Oliver Peters has it all sorted.

746
00:34:03,291 --> 00:34:04,834
At least for tonight.

747
00:34:04,876 --> 00:34:08,504
Ta-ta-da-ta-ta-ta-taaaa!

748
00:34:08,546 --> 00:34:09,464
Behold!

749
00:34:09,547 --> 00:34:12,967
An international twist
to our tortuous tale!

750
00:34:46,793 --> 00:34:48,377
Hey!

751
00:34:58,638 --> 00:34:59,722
- Darryl!

752
00:35:00,431 --> 00:35:02,558
You can come in now.

753
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:03,392
C'mon man go.

754
00:35:03,476 --> 00:35:05,770
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go.

755
00:35:09,398 --> 00:35:10,483
All right people, we're ready

756
00:35:10,525 --> 00:35:12,276
for you if your ready for a boo!

757
00:35:15,029 --> 00:35:16,614
As I was saying, no masks,

758
00:35:16,656 --> 00:35:18,407
no smoking, no...

759
00:35:18,449 --> 00:35:21,244
Hey, what are you three, what?

760
00:35:21,327 --> 00:35:23,663
You three bong turds
trying to get us shut down?

761
00:35:23,704 --> 00:35:26,165
- You got a problem with it,
"mon"?

762
00:35:27,041 --> 00:35:27,834
- Oh, no baby.

763
00:35:27,917 --> 00:35:29,085
I love the devil's lettuce.

764
00:35:29,710 --> 00:35:31,129
I also like my job.

765
00:35:31,212 --> 00:35:33,714
So, basically what I'm
trying to say here is

766
00:35:33,756 --> 00:35:35,049
nobody gets in until these three

767
00:35:35,133 --> 00:35:37,677
puff-puff mother-fuckers are out
of here!

768
00:35:37,718 --> 00:35:38,553
Smoke on that!

769
00:35:38,594 --> 00:35:40,304
- Hey, hey, shut the fuck up!

770
00:35:40,388 --> 00:35:42,223
- Get out of here assholes!

771
00:35:42,265 --> 00:35:43,766
- Kiss my ass, bitch!

772
00:35:43,808 --> 00:35:45,393
- Who you callin' bitch, bitch?

773
00:35:45,476 --> 00:35:48,729
- What are you looking
at you big Sasquatch?

774
00:35:48,771 --> 00:35:50,106
- Bye-bye boys.

775
00:35:50,148 --> 00:35:51,190
Toodles!

776
00:35:52,066 --> 00:35:53,985
And now my pretties,

777
00:35:54,026 --> 00:35:55,695
Scare Zone Three is open

778
00:35:55,736 --> 00:35:57,363
for the second night of fright!

779
00:35:57,405 --> 00:35:58,197
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!

780
00:36:03,244 --> 00:36:04,996
- Ha-ha-ha-ha-ah.

781
00:36:07,373 --> 00:36:09,625
I love Halloween.

782
00:36:15,381 --> 00:36:16,424
- Whoa!

783
00:36:21,387 --> 00:36:22,138
- Shit!

784
00:36:22,180 --> 00:36:23,264
- Ha-haaa.

785
00:36:34,358 --> 00:36:36,194
- Hey, I hate 20s!

786
00:36:40,072 --> 00:36:42,241
- Okay, that's the real dummy
there.

787
00:36:42,283 --> 00:36:43,409
This light is out.

788
00:36:43,451 --> 00:36:46,579
That guy used to be a girl,
and this is a fake leg!

789
00:36:57,340 --> 00:37:00,968
- Oh, what the hell happened to
this?

790
00:37:01,510 --> 00:37:02,762
- Who want's a beer?

791
00:37:04,555 --> 00:37:08,643
To the best "day two" in
the history of Scare Zone!

792
00:37:08,684 --> 00:37:09,936
Cheers!

793
00:37:09,977 --> 00:37:11,062
- We couldn't do any better
unless

794
00:37:11,103 --> 00:37:12,647
we were actually killing people.

795
00:37:13,481 --> 00:37:15,024
That would pack 'em in.

796
00:37:15,066 --> 00:37:16,609
- It actually would, you know.

797
00:37:19,445 --> 00:37:20,947
- Okay Claire.

798
00:37:20,988 --> 00:37:22,531
You're gonna freak out these
kids.

799
00:37:22,615 --> 00:37:24,992
Look, you guys did great
tonight.

800
00:37:25,034 --> 00:37:27,912
The spirits of the dead are with
us.

801
00:37:27,995 --> 00:37:28,704
- Whooooooo!

802
00:37:28,746 --> 00:37:29,830
- I would like everybody

803
00:37:29,872 --> 00:37:32,291
to take an extra 100
bones out of the till.

804
00:37:32,333 --> 00:37:34,377
Okay, Spider, let's go and close
up.

805
00:37:34,418 --> 00:37:35,628
Oh, I'm gonna need some extra
help

806
00:37:35,711 --> 00:37:37,546
with a broken window and wall
facade.

807
00:37:37,588 --> 00:37:38,714
I need two guys to hold it in

808
00:37:38,798 --> 00:37:41,175
place while we nail gun it to
the wall.

809
00:37:42,301 --> 00:37:44,428
It'll only take about 10
minutes.

810
00:37:44,971 --> 00:37:46,222
I'll throw in another 20 bucks.

811
00:37:46,305 --> 00:37:47,348
- I'm in.
- There you go.

812
00:37:47,431 --> 00:37:48,474
- No, uh, Oliver, you've been
great.

813
00:37:48,516 --> 00:37:49,767
You don't have to pay us.

814
00:37:49,809 --> 00:37:50,643
- Hey!

815
00:37:50,726 --> 00:37:51,560
Shut your pie hole.

816
00:37:51,602 --> 00:37:52,853
I could use the "dinero".

817
00:37:52,895 --> 00:37:53,604
- Heh-heh.

818
00:37:53,646 --> 00:37:54,605
Tonight I can afford it.

819
00:37:54,689 --> 00:37:55,690
- He can afford it.
- Let's go.

820
00:37:55,731 --> 00:37:56,732
- Let's go.
- Shut up.

821
00:37:56,816 --> 00:37:58,567
- Shut up.
- Stop tryin' to be me!

822
00:37:58,651 --> 00:38:00,528
- Tracy, you've got to
help me with my make-up,

823
00:38:00,569 --> 00:38:02,822
last time I about took
out a whole eyelash.

824
00:38:02,863 --> 00:38:04,365
- Okay, hang on a sec.

825
00:38:09,412 --> 00:38:10,496
Okay.

826
00:38:10,538 --> 00:38:11,539
Let's go!

827
00:38:11,622 --> 00:38:13,165
- Sexy.
- Yeah.

828
00:38:15,042 --> 00:38:17,378
- Senorita Claire, tell
Senor Oliver that we will not

829
00:38:17,461 --> 00:38:19,839
be performing for this job
tomorrow.

830
00:38:19,880 --> 00:38:21,924
He's too, como se dice?

831
00:38:22,008 --> 00:38:23,384
- Cheap!
- Cheap.

832
00:38:26,637 --> 00:38:29,223
- So, you need help again
counting?

833
00:38:31,142 --> 00:38:32,184
Okay.

834
00:38:38,107 --> 00:38:41,485
So it looks like Summer
and PJ really went for it.

835
00:38:41,527 --> 00:38:43,029
Yep, took the plunge.

836
00:38:43,070 --> 00:38:44,739
- They're dead.

837
00:38:44,780 --> 00:38:45,740
- What?

838
00:38:45,781 --> 00:38:46,824
- Dead.

839
00:38:48,034 --> 00:38:51,537
Any relationship that is
purely physical is death.

840
00:38:53,414 --> 00:38:55,374
They're just going to be a
statistic.

841
00:38:55,416 --> 00:38:56,459
- Well I hear today that two out

842
00:38:56,542 --> 00:38:58,461
of three divorces end in
marriage.

843
00:38:58,502 --> 00:39:00,129
- Not that death is bad.

844
00:39:00,212 --> 00:39:03,716
Death of a relationship, of the
spirit,

845
00:39:04,925 --> 00:39:06,344
death of the body.

846
00:39:07,219 --> 00:39:08,929
I saw a dead body once.

847
00:39:11,515 --> 00:39:14,310
Have you ever seen a
real dead body, Darryl?

848
00:39:15,019 --> 00:39:17,855
- Well, I saw my granddad's
ashes,

849
00:39:17,897 --> 00:39:20,775
it was kind of dusty.
- I was 11.

850
00:39:22,234 --> 00:39:25,112
I was riding my bike down Old
Camp Road

851
00:39:26,739 --> 00:39:30,493
when I saw, up ahead, this dust
cloud.

852
00:39:31,744 --> 00:39:35,289
As I came closer I saw that a
truck

853
00:39:35,331 --> 00:39:38,250
had run off the road
and slammed into a tree.

854
00:39:41,337 --> 00:39:42,421
That was okay.

855
00:39:42,463 --> 00:39:43,589
Kind of cool.

856
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:49,845
But further away in the grass
is what was really great.

857
00:39:52,348 --> 00:39:56,185
There was a boy, about my age.

858
00:39:56,227 --> 00:39:57,603
Blonde like me.

859
00:39:58,604 --> 00:40:00,439
He was lying in the grass.

860
00:40:01,982 --> 00:40:04,402
Not moving, not breathing.

861
00:40:05,945 --> 00:40:09,073
He must have been sitting
in the bed of the truck.

862
00:40:09,782 --> 00:40:12,827
Who knows how high or how hard
he hit?

863
00:40:14,245 --> 00:40:17,748
But now he was on his back, eyes
open,

864
00:40:17,832 --> 00:40:19,333
looking at the sky.

865
00:40:21,669 --> 00:40:23,129
Still.

866
00:40:23,170 --> 00:40:24,255
At peace.

867
00:40:25,589 --> 00:40:26,590
- Sorry.

868
00:40:26,632 --> 00:40:27,675
- Why?

869
00:40:29,135 --> 00:40:31,303
It was beautiful.

870
00:40:31,345 --> 00:40:33,139
And I was there.

871
00:40:35,224 --> 00:40:36,600
No one was around.

872
00:40:39,270 --> 00:40:43,190
I reached out, touched his face.

873
00:40:46,026 --> 00:40:47,486
Touched his lips.

874
00:40:50,906 --> 00:40:55,286
Then a car came down the
road and stopped to help.

875
00:40:55,786 --> 00:40:57,246
It ruined our moment.

876
00:41:00,416 --> 00:41:03,669
That's the closest I've ever
come to really knowing a boy.

877
00:41:05,129 --> 00:41:06,714
Claire, uh, we have
a, uh, we have a question.

878
00:41:06,755 --> 00:41:08,007
- Oh my god there's this,

879
00:41:08,090 --> 00:41:09,341
there's this phat Halloween
party that we want to go to.

880
00:41:09,425 --> 00:41:10,593
We want to go, like, and we-

881
00:41:10,676 --> 00:41:11,886
- And, look we just want
to leave in our costumes.

882
00:41:11,927 --> 00:41:12,887
- So, we'll see you there, okay?

883
00:41:12,928 --> 00:41:13,971
- Did you just invite her?

884
00:41:14,763 --> 00:41:16,599
- Bye ladies of the night!

885
00:41:21,979 --> 00:41:26,484
All right, well, I wish Summer
and PJ the best I guess.

886
00:41:26,525 --> 00:41:31,322
- Darryl, you seem like a nice
guy.

887
00:41:33,157 --> 00:41:35,242
Don't be like the rest of them.

888
00:41:36,202 --> 00:41:38,370
Don't force yourself on them.

889
00:41:39,872 --> 00:41:43,584
Don't, don't guilt and chide

890
00:41:43,626 --> 00:41:46,295
and force yourself on...

891
00:41:48,130 --> 00:41:49,882
Pretty little blonde.

892
00:41:49,924 --> 00:41:51,884
Come here, pretty little blonde.

893
00:41:51,926 --> 00:41:54,470
Bring your red lips over here.

894
00:41:59,683 --> 00:42:00,851
Black lips.

895
00:42:01,769 --> 00:42:02,895
Black hair.

896
00:42:02,937 --> 00:42:03,938
I'm dead.

897
00:42:04,396 --> 00:42:08,609
I'm not your plaything now, I'm
dead.

898
00:42:08,651 --> 00:42:09,693
Dead!

899
00:42:13,364 --> 00:42:16,158
- Okay, I'm officially creeped
out.

900
00:42:16,200 --> 00:42:17,743
Maybe you should relax.

901
00:42:20,037 --> 00:42:22,540
- Sometimes the haze is so
thick,

902
00:42:24,208 --> 00:42:27,878
the only way I can remind
myself I'm still in this world

903
00:42:29,046 --> 00:42:30,965
is with the pleasure of pain.

904
00:42:32,550 --> 00:42:36,929
Makes me feel good when
I'm in control of my pain.

905
00:42:39,473 --> 00:42:40,724
I like that.

906
00:42:43,727 --> 00:42:47,398
I've never let anyone watch me
before,

907
00:42:50,401 --> 00:42:52,736
but I like you Darryl.

908
00:43:02,913 --> 00:43:05,332
I've been working on this one.

909
00:43:12,256 --> 00:43:13,924
This is our secret.

910
00:43:28,439 --> 00:43:30,357
Makes me feel good.

911
00:43:40,618 --> 00:43:42,202
- Shit, what was that?

912
00:43:42,244 --> 00:43:44,121
- You'd better go see.

913
00:43:52,713 --> 00:43:53,714
- Holy shit!

914
00:43:53,797 --> 00:43:55,299
Can we not perform a simple

915
00:43:55,341 --> 00:43:57,760
task without this juvenile
Tom-fuckery!

916
00:43:57,843 --> 00:44:00,137
- I don't know what
happened, it just shot back

917
00:44:00,179 --> 00:44:01,096
or exploded or something.

918
00:44:01,138 --> 00:44:02,222
I, I don't know.

919
00:44:02,264 --> 00:44:02,973
- Hey man.

920
00:44:03,015 --> 00:44:04,058
Put the mother fuckin',

921
00:44:04,141 --> 00:44:05,434
Jake, put the motherfuckin' nail
gun down.

922
00:44:05,476 --> 00:44:06,602
- Put it down!

923
00:44:06,644 --> 00:44:08,729
Spider, I'm gonna need your
shirt.

924
00:44:08,812 --> 00:44:09,855
- Oh, yeah.

925
00:44:09,938 --> 00:44:12,358
- Darryl, unplug the compressor
before it blows again.

926
00:44:14,943 --> 00:44:15,694
Damn!

927
00:44:15,736 --> 00:44:18,489
- Oh, for fuck's sake!

928
00:44:19,198 --> 00:44:20,324
And don't you touch the nail.

929
00:44:20,407 --> 00:44:21,867
We're going to let the doctors
remove it.

930
00:44:21,909 --> 00:44:22,618
C'mon.

931
00:44:22,660 --> 00:44:23,577
Let's get him out of here.

932
00:44:23,619 --> 00:44:24,953
- I still get my 20 bucks?

933
00:44:25,037 --> 00:44:26,705
- Yeah, I'd rather pay that

934
00:44:26,747 --> 00:44:29,124
than for the tetanus
shots you're gonna need.

935
00:44:29,208 --> 00:44:34,421
- Ah, shit mother!
- C'mon you assholes!

936
00:45:00,572 --> 00:45:02,074
- Suck my balls, Scare Zone.

937
00:45:02,157 --> 00:45:03,367
Ha-ha-ha-ha!

938
00:45:03,951 --> 00:45:05,119
- What are you doing, bro?

939
00:45:05,202 --> 00:45:06,495
I told you she takes the
cash when she leaves, man.

940
00:45:06,578 --> 00:45:08,163
- I know that, I was just
checking.

941
00:45:08,205 --> 00:45:09,081
- You guys suck.

942
00:45:09,123 --> 00:45:10,916
Let's tag this this shit-hole.

943
00:45:10,958 --> 00:45:12,126
Yeehaw!

944
00:45:12,167 --> 00:45:14,878
- Yeah, suck my balls!

945
00:45:15,963 --> 00:45:20,759
Oh, no, no, no. Check this out.
- Whatcha got? Look at this.

946
00:45:20,801 --> 00:45:22,636
Whoooooo!

947
00:45:23,220 --> 00:45:25,639
- Hey, how 'bout this man?

948
00:45:32,938 --> 00:45:35,941
- Oh shit.
- Oh my God.

949
00:45:43,657 --> 00:45:46,910
Yeah!

950
00:45:50,080 --> 00:45:51,623
- He's paying for this.

951
00:46:14,104 --> 00:46:17,191
- What an ass.
- He so tagged you, man.

952
00:46:17,649 --> 00:46:19,610
- Let's just go back this way.

953
00:46:20,569 --> 00:46:21,361
Holy shit!

954
00:46:21,403 --> 00:46:23,238
Look at this toilet over here!

955
00:46:23,822 --> 00:46:25,157
It's so lifelike.

956
00:46:25,199 --> 00:46:26,450
- "Lifelike?"

957
00:46:28,160 --> 00:46:32,414
- Whichever asshole threw me
in here, is going to get, ahhh!

958
00:46:36,543 --> 00:46:38,796
C'mon bro, this is not,

959
00:46:42,382 --> 00:46:43,550
who's that?

960
00:46:51,350 --> 00:46:52,768
- It's not real.

961
00:47:02,653 --> 00:47:04,321
What have we got over here, man?

962
00:47:04,363 --> 00:47:05,656
- No idea.

963
00:47:07,199 --> 00:47:09,409
- Please, please, please!

964
00:47:15,374 --> 00:47:17,334
- What's that dip-shit up to
now?

965
00:47:17,376 --> 00:47:18,961
- Where the hell are we?

966
00:47:24,842 --> 00:47:26,343
- Where's that prick at?

967
00:47:26,385 --> 00:47:27,553
- Hey, we gotta get out of here.

968
00:47:27,594 --> 00:47:28,470
This is bullshit.

969
00:47:28,512 --> 00:47:30,430
- Just go check down that way.

970
00:47:32,307 --> 00:47:33,100
- Fuck it.

971
00:47:33,141 --> 00:47:33,892
I'm gone.

972
00:47:33,934 --> 00:47:35,060
And I've got the car keys.

973
00:47:35,143 --> 00:47:37,187
I don't give a rat's ass
about you piss heads.

974
00:47:39,106 --> 00:47:40,482
- Douche bag.

975
00:47:46,446 --> 00:47:49,199
Fuck man, where're you at?

976
00:47:49,283 --> 00:47:50,284
Hey!

977
00:47:50,951 --> 00:47:51,660
Hey!

978
00:47:53,704 --> 00:47:54,997
C'mon man!

979
00:47:55,789 --> 00:47:57,541
Stop dickin' around!

980
00:48:24,693 --> 00:48:26,778
Bart, honey, can you
get that?

981
00:48:26,820 --> 00:48:29,656
- Sorry mom, I'm injured.

982
00:48:31,408 --> 00:48:34,202
- Yes can I, uh, help you?

983
00:48:34,244 --> 00:48:35,579
- Yes ma'am, I'm Darryl Myers

984
00:48:35,621 --> 00:48:37,581
from the Scare Zone attraction.

985
00:48:37,623 --> 00:48:39,333
Is Bart home?

986
00:48:39,416 --> 00:48:40,918
- Well hello "Darryl Myers",

987
00:48:41,001 --> 00:48:44,713
Yes Bart is home, you know
my poor boy he's just-

988
00:48:44,796 --> 00:48:46,006
- Excuse me.

989
00:48:47,299 --> 00:48:48,634
Um, thank you for,

990
00:48:48,675 --> 00:48:50,552
uh, cleaning my pipes.

991
00:48:51,094 --> 00:48:53,180
Well, let me see what you have
there.

992
00:48:53,221 --> 00:48:55,390
Oh, how sweet.

993
00:48:55,432 --> 00:48:57,184
Well, let me just take these
from you

994
00:48:57,267 --> 00:48:59,227
and get them in some water.

995
00:49:01,355 --> 00:49:03,857
Can I get you anything to drink?

996
00:49:07,277 --> 00:49:08,320
Oh Bart!

997
00:49:08,362 --> 00:49:09,404
You have company!

998
00:49:09,446 --> 00:49:10,530
I thought I
was supposed to hang out

999
00:49:10,572 --> 00:49:12,032
with dad next weekend!

1000
00:49:12,115 --> 00:49:13,075
- No, dear.

1001
00:49:13,158 --> 00:49:16,119
It's your little friend
from the scary house.

1002
00:49:16,161 --> 00:49:18,205
He came to see how you're doing.

1003
00:49:18,246 --> 00:49:19,373
- I'm in too much pain!

1004
00:49:19,456 --> 00:49:21,124
Tell 'em to go away.

1005
00:49:21,750 --> 00:49:22,668
- Hello, Bart!

1006
00:49:22,751 --> 00:49:25,379
Heh, nice set up you big
bullshit artist.

1007
00:49:25,420 --> 00:49:26,880
- Close the door.

1008
00:49:26,964 --> 00:49:29,466
- Nice sheets.
- Close the door!

1009
00:49:31,385 --> 00:49:32,678
Don't screw it for me, man.

1010
00:49:32,719 --> 00:49:34,763
It's the first time in five
years my mom's sucked up to me.

1011
00:49:34,846 --> 00:49:37,975
- Looked like your mom was
suckin' up to the plumber.

1012
00:49:38,016 --> 00:49:39,476
- Funny, fag!

1013
00:49:39,559 --> 00:49:41,019
Yeah, check out this set-up.

1014
00:49:41,061 --> 00:49:41,979
This is sweet!

1015
00:49:42,020 --> 00:49:43,188
- Yeah, if you're seven.

1016
00:49:43,271 --> 00:49:45,649
- I'm taking this for
as long a ride as I, oh!

1017
00:49:45,691 --> 00:49:46,858
I love this part.

1018
00:49:54,408 --> 00:49:55,867
Hey, hey, hey!

1019
00:49:58,537 --> 00:49:59,454
- Sorry, Bart.

1020
00:49:59,538 --> 00:50:00,789
You and your "man-gina" need to
get out

1021
00:50:00,872 --> 00:50:03,500
of bed and help me with
today's marketing blitz.

1022
00:50:03,583 --> 00:50:04,543
- "Marketing blitz?"

1023
00:50:04,626 --> 00:50:06,670
What are you, an ad agency
executive?

1024
00:50:06,753 --> 00:50:10,215
- I need this money and Oliver
needs everyone in tonight.

1025
00:50:10,298 --> 00:50:11,591
- Excuse me.

1026
00:50:11,633 --> 00:50:12,801
Fatally injured.

1027
00:50:12,843 --> 00:50:14,928
- Fatal means dead,
genius, and you're lifting

1028
00:50:15,012 --> 00:50:16,388
your arm just fine.

1029
00:50:18,056 --> 00:50:21,226
C'mon, it's one more night.

1030
00:50:22,394 --> 00:50:23,770
- I get it.

1031
00:50:23,854 --> 00:50:24,938
You need me.

1032
00:50:25,439 --> 00:50:27,274
You can't go on without me.

1033
00:50:27,983 --> 00:50:30,694
I am Scare Zone.

1034
00:50:31,111 --> 00:50:33,530
But I can't hand out fliers.

1035
00:50:33,572 --> 00:50:34,614
Injured.

1036
00:50:35,615 --> 00:50:36,616
- Fine.

1037
00:50:36,658 --> 00:50:39,745
We're not actually "handing
out" flyers this time.

1038
00:50:43,165 --> 00:50:44,207
- Hey ladies!

1039
00:50:44,249 --> 00:50:46,001
"Scare Zone!"

1040
00:51:04,311 --> 00:51:06,313
Scare Zone!

1041
00:51:06,897 --> 00:51:08,065
Scare Zone!

1042
00:51:09,483 --> 00:51:10,400
- You're terrible.

1043
00:51:28,376 --> 00:51:30,003
- Tonight's the last night.

1044
00:51:30,045 --> 00:51:30,962
- Scare Zone!

1045
00:51:31,004 --> 00:51:32,047
Come check it out, you'll love
it!

1046
00:51:32,089 --> 00:51:34,091
- Yeah happy hallo-weeny!

1047
00:51:34,132 --> 00:51:35,092
Thanks!

1048
00:51:35,175 --> 00:51:36,301
- Dude, they're so hot.
- They were hot.

1049
00:51:36,384 --> 00:51:37,302
- I'm going to go meet them.

1050
00:51:37,344 --> 00:51:38,470
- No, no, no.

1051
00:51:38,512 --> 00:51:39,221
Dude.

1052
00:51:39,304 --> 00:51:40,222
We gotta go.

1053
00:51:40,263 --> 00:51:41,264
C'mon!

1054
00:51:51,399 --> 00:51:56,988
Oliver?

1055
00:52:19,177 --> 00:52:19,803
Jake!

1056
00:52:19,886 --> 00:52:20,846
What the fuck, man!

1057
00:52:20,929 --> 00:52:22,222
- The back door was open, man,
my bad.

1058
00:52:22,264 --> 00:52:23,348
- What'cha doing here?

1059
00:52:23,390 --> 00:52:25,058
- Oliver told me to come help
you set up.

1060
00:52:25,142 --> 00:52:26,184
- Oh he tell you but he don't
tell me?

1061
00:52:26,226 --> 00:52:28,061
Ain't this about a bitch.

1062
00:52:28,812 --> 00:52:30,105
Look, I'm glad you're
here, I need your help.

1063
00:52:30,188 --> 00:52:31,481
I've got an appointment
downtown.

1064
00:52:31,523 --> 00:52:32,190
- Heh.

1065
00:52:32,232 --> 00:52:33,150
An "appointment" right?

1066
00:52:33,191 --> 00:52:34,025
Heh-heh.

1067
00:52:34,067 --> 00:52:35,277
- Yes an appointment I've got to
meet

1068
00:52:35,360 --> 00:52:36,528
my parole officer is that okay
with you?

1069
00:52:36,570 --> 00:52:37,737
Can you focus?

1070
00:52:37,779 --> 00:52:38,613
Focus!

1071
00:52:38,697 --> 00:52:39,990
Look, first thing I need you to
do is

1072
00:52:40,073 --> 00:52:42,075
take this and put it back
where I found it, okay?

1073
00:52:42,159 --> 00:52:43,410
Now I've got to set up this damn
dummy

1074
00:52:43,493 --> 00:52:45,328
because those Spanish
assholes didn't show up,

1075
00:52:45,370 --> 00:52:47,247
so you go finish filling
up the fog machine,

1076
00:52:47,330 --> 00:52:48,915
then go turn on the sound
system,

1077
00:52:48,957 --> 00:52:50,000
but turn it to the knob with the

1078
00:52:50,083 --> 00:52:51,084
little piece of tape on it, then
go

1079
00:52:51,126 --> 00:52:52,169
turn on the strobe lights,

1080
00:52:52,252 --> 00:52:53,545
oh and fill the bat baby up with
water

1081
00:52:53,628 --> 00:52:55,046
and if you're looking
for something else to do,

1082
00:52:55,088 --> 00:52:57,048
you can finish this
list, do everything on it

1083
00:52:57,090 --> 00:53:00,886
then after your done, wait for
Oliver or Claire because uh,

1084
00:53:00,927 --> 00:53:03,305
uh, I ain't givin' you my keys.

1085
00:53:03,346 --> 00:53:04,097
Okay?

1086
00:53:04,181 --> 00:53:04,973
Ya got that?

1087
00:53:05,015 --> 00:53:06,099
- Got it.

1088
00:53:06,141 --> 00:53:07,601
- Now, Oliver's going to be
pissy 'cause I'm not here.

1089
00:53:07,642 --> 00:53:10,187
Don't let him take it out on
you, okay?

1090
00:53:10,228 --> 00:53:10,979
- 10-4.

1091
00:53:11,062 --> 00:53:12,147
- Yeah, "10-4" wonder bread.

1092
00:53:12,230 --> 00:53:13,940
Just go turn on the lye vat.

1093
00:53:14,024 --> 00:53:14,983
Go.

1094
00:53:15,025 --> 00:53:15,901
Go-go-go-go-go.

1095
00:53:15,942 --> 00:53:16,693
Go, go!

1096
00:53:16,735 --> 00:53:19,779
Can you speed? Urgency, yes, go.

1097
00:53:25,160 --> 00:53:26,661
Spanish people don't show up.

1098
00:53:26,703 --> 00:53:31,833
Bitches are supposed to like
work.

1099
00:54:17,545 --> 00:54:19,381
What kind of shit?

1100
00:54:41,111 --> 00:54:42,153
Oh shit!

1101
00:54:47,033 --> 00:54:48,285
Ahhhh, what?

1102
00:55:25,447 --> 00:55:26,614
- Ho-ho-ho!

1103
00:55:38,251 --> 00:55:39,711
- Welcome to "A Christmas to
Remember"

1104
00:55:39,794 --> 00:55:41,796
where it's Christmas 364 days a
year!

1105
00:55:41,880 --> 00:55:43,631
That's right every day but what,
what?

1106
00:55:43,673 --> 00:55:44,382
Christmas!

1107
00:55:44,424 --> 00:55:45,550
So, how can I help you?

1108
00:55:45,592 --> 00:55:50,180
- I'm looking for Claire, I'm
her brother.

1109
00:55:50,221 --> 00:55:51,222
- Brother, huh?

1110
00:55:51,264 --> 00:55:52,682
Funny, I don't see the family
resemblance.

1111
00:55:52,766 --> 00:55:55,310
'Course I guess you don't
put on the black lipstick

1112
00:55:55,393 --> 00:55:57,979
and the funny make-up
'till after midnight, huh?

1113
00:55:58,063 --> 00:55:59,898
Sandy, have you seen Miss
Claire?

1114
00:55:59,939 --> 00:56:00,732
Hang on honey,

1115
00:56:00,815 --> 00:56:01,775
I'll be right down.

1116
00:56:01,858 --> 00:56:05,278
- So, what's Claire's brother's
name?

1117
00:56:05,320 --> 00:56:06,821
- Me?

1118
00:56:07,697 --> 00:56:08,490
Darryl.

1119
00:56:08,573 --> 00:56:09,866
- Oh, really, what a
coinky-dink.

1120
00:56:09,908 --> 00:56:12,243
I've got an elf around here
named Darryl someplace.

1121
00:56:12,285 --> 00:56:14,621
- I didn't know Claire had a
brother,

1122
00:56:14,662 --> 00:56:16,164
she never mentioned a brother.

1123
00:56:16,247 --> 00:56:18,875
But, she's not a big talker.

1124
00:56:18,958 --> 00:56:21,086
You'll find her right
back there by gift wrap.

1125
00:56:21,169 --> 00:56:22,504
- Thank you.

1126
00:56:29,344 --> 00:56:30,220
Hey Claire.

1127
00:56:30,303 --> 00:56:32,555
- Oh, hey, what are you doing
here?

1128
00:56:32,597 --> 00:56:33,681
- You told me to come he-

1129
00:56:33,723 --> 00:56:35,016
- Shhhh!

1130
00:56:35,058 --> 00:56:38,103
Oh, you have a note from mom!

1131
00:56:38,978 --> 00:56:40,230
That is bad.

1132
00:56:40,271 --> 00:56:42,315
Oh, I'm glad you came.

1133
00:56:42,357 --> 00:56:44,526
Um, Sandy,

1134
00:56:44,567 --> 00:56:45,485
Sandy.

1135
00:56:45,568 --> 00:56:47,612
You know it looks like
our mom is really sick

1136
00:56:47,654 --> 00:56:52,409
and I'm gonna to leave
early to, um, care for her.

1137
00:56:52,492 --> 00:56:54,911
- You said your mother's dead,
dear.

1138
00:56:56,496 --> 00:56:58,665
No our, our mam is sick.

1139
00:56:58,706 --> 00:57:01,251
That's what we call our
grandmother.

1140
00:57:01,292 --> 00:57:02,085
- Yeah.

1141
00:57:02,127 --> 00:57:02,877
"Mam".

1142
00:57:02,919 --> 00:57:04,129
- I'm really sorry Mrs. Kane,

1143
00:57:04,212 --> 00:57:06,089
I really have to leave right
now.

1144
00:57:06,131 --> 00:57:08,133
You know, to get to, mam.

1145
00:57:08,174 --> 00:57:09,551
- I understand, dear.

1146
00:57:09,634 --> 00:57:12,220
So, I'll see you tomorrow
morning at 10.

1147
00:57:12,262 --> 00:57:13,721
It's a big day!

1148
00:57:13,805 --> 00:57:16,057
- Okay, I wouldn't miss it.

1149
00:57:16,099 --> 00:57:16,933
- Mam.

1150
00:57:17,016 --> 00:57:18,184
- The holiday shopping season
starts

1151
00:57:18,268 --> 00:57:20,353
the day after Halloween now, you
know!

1152
00:57:20,395 --> 00:57:21,646
Toodles!

1153
00:57:21,729 --> 00:57:22,897
- Whoo-hoo!

1154
00:57:24,524 --> 00:57:26,818
Oh, get me out of here!

1155
00:57:27,610 --> 00:57:28,445
Ha.

1156
00:57:28,528 --> 00:57:30,488
Ya think vampires and zombies
are scary?

1157
00:57:30,530 --> 00:57:31,990
Those people are scary!

1158
00:57:32,490 --> 00:57:34,868
- I thought you worked at a
funeral home.

1159
00:57:34,951 --> 00:57:36,578
- Who told you that?

1160
00:57:36,619 --> 00:57:37,662
- Nobody.

1161
00:57:37,704 --> 00:57:39,581
- No I've worked for the
Kanes for, like, four years

1162
00:57:39,664 --> 00:57:42,250
and they still creep me out.

1163
00:57:42,292 --> 00:57:43,168
- I dunno.

1164
00:57:43,251 --> 00:57:44,669
They seemed like, "Really nice
people".

1165
00:57:44,752 --> 00:57:46,254
Thanks for
getting me out of there,

1166
00:57:46,337 --> 00:57:48,756
I'm running out of
excuses to cut out early.

1167
00:57:48,798 --> 00:57:50,592
You confused them good.

1168
00:57:50,633 --> 00:57:52,927
- Hey, I'm just glad you called.

1169
00:57:52,969 --> 00:57:54,512
Is your car in the shop?

1170
00:57:54,554 --> 00:57:55,763
- I don't drive.

1171
00:57:55,805 --> 00:57:57,390
- Well how do you get around?

1172
00:57:57,432 --> 00:57:58,600
- I usually walk.

1173
00:57:58,641 --> 00:58:01,811
- This place is, like, 20
blocks from the strip mall.

1174
00:58:01,895 --> 00:58:04,355
- Or I'll bum a ride or
hitchhike.

1175
00:58:05,023 --> 00:58:07,150
- Isn't that a little dangerous?

1176
00:58:10,069 --> 00:58:10,987
- No.

1177
00:58:11,029 --> 00:58:11,738
- Shit!

1178
00:58:11,779 --> 00:58:12,697
Put that away!

1179
00:58:12,739 --> 00:58:14,491
Can't you carry, like, a can of
mace

1180
00:58:14,532 --> 00:58:16,075
or a taser or something?

1181
00:58:16,117 --> 00:58:18,536
- Mace doesn't stop them,
it just blinds them.

1182
00:58:18,578 --> 00:58:20,580
Tasers you gotta keep charged.

1183
00:58:20,663 --> 00:58:21,956
It's not practical.

1184
00:58:23,208 --> 00:58:24,209
- Good point.

1185
00:58:24,292 --> 00:58:26,419
- Oliver keeps a taser
charged and ready to go

1186
00:58:26,461 --> 00:58:28,588
underneath the cash
register at the gift shop,

1187
00:58:28,671 --> 00:58:32,759
but I'll stick with sexy Sadie,
thank you.

1188
00:58:34,344 --> 00:58:35,512
- She's named her gun.

1189
00:58:35,595 --> 00:58:37,055
Heh.

1190
00:58:37,096 --> 00:58:37,931
- Oh, turn here.

1191
00:58:37,972 --> 00:58:39,057
Turn here!

1192
00:58:47,398 --> 00:58:48,483
Stop here.

1193
00:58:54,531 --> 00:58:57,867
- How did I know this was
going to end at a cemetery?

1194
00:59:03,748 --> 00:59:04,457
Claire?

1195
00:59:13,841 --> 00:59:15,134
This isn't funny.

1196
00:59:18,179 --> 00:59:19,305
I knew it was you.

1197
00:59:19,389 --> 00:59:22,308
I just wanted to see what
you looked like laughing.

1198
00:59:22,350 --> 00:59:23,893
- Don't get used to it.

1199
00:59:24,561 --> 00:59:26,354
Let me show you something.

1200
00:59:34,988 --> 00:59:36,406
- God damn it.

1201
00:59:36,906 --> 00:59:40,785
- Darryl, I'd like you to meet
someone.

1202
00:59:42,912 --> 00:59:45,206
- Mary Elisabeth Landers.

1203
00:59:45,290 --> 00:59:46,124
- Hey, hey!

1204
00:59:46,165 --> 00:59:46,791
Buddy.

1205
00:59:46,874 --> 00:59:47,834
What are you doin'?

1206
00:59:47,875 --> 00:59:48,876
Do you know those kids over
there?

1207
00:59:48,918 --> 00:59:51,004
Are you listening to me?

1208
00:59:51,045 --> 00:59:52,171
- Your mother?

1209
00:59:52,213 --> 00:59:53,339
- No.

1210
00:59:53,381 --> 00:59:54,257
- Not your mother.

1211
00:59:54,299 --> 00:59:59,345
- No, my mother is, quite alive.

1212
00:59:59,470 --> 01:00:00,847
- Hello, ass-wipe,

1213
01:00:00,930 --> 01:00:02,640
I'm talkin' to you!

1214
01:00:09,480 --> 01:00:11,065
- No, she's my aunt.

1215
01:00:11,149 --> 01:00:12,692
My mother's sister.

1216
01:00:13,943 --> 01:00:16,487
Nothing exotic killed her, just
cancer.

1217
01:00:17,363 --> 01:00:19,490
But I wanted you to meet her.

1218
01:00:20,033 --> 01:00:21,618
You remind me a lot of her.

1219
01:00:30,293 --> 01:00:31,461
Hey Aunt Mare,

1220
01:00:33,087 --> 01:00:35,131
I'd like you to meet Darryl.

1221
01:00:46,267 --> 01:00:48,978
- Hello, Ms. Landers, how are
you?

1222
01:00:49,520 --> 01:00:51,898
- She can't talk to
you Darryl, she's dead.

1223
01:00:51,939 --> 01:00:52,732
- I know.

1224
01:01:01,574 --> 01:01:02,742
- You know, she was the only
person

1225
01:01:02,825 --> 01:01:05,370
that ever brought me a Christmas
present.

1226
01:01:05,453 --> 01:01:07,413
Every year she would bring me
something

1227
01:01:07,497 --> 01:01:09,707
and wrap it so beautifully.

1228
01:01:15,213 --> 01:01:17,298
She pretty much raised me 'till
I was 10.

1229
01:01:24,013 --> 01:01:26,015
My Aunt Mare kept me from harm.

1230
01:01:29,477 --> 01:01:30,353
Then she died.

1231
01:01:42,240 --> 01:01:45,785
One year she got me this snow
globe.

1232
01:01:48,329 --> 01:01:50,415
It was one of those real glass
ones,

1233
01:01:50,456 --> 01:01:53,626
not like the plastic
ones you see at the mall.

1234
01:01:54,585 --> 01:01:57,088
It had this whole little village
in it.

1235
01:01:59,716 --> 01:02:02,176
That became a great tool for my
mom.

1236
01:02:03,136 --> 01:02:06,597
She could just raise it up
and threaten to smash it.

1237
01:02:09,183 --> 01:02:11,602
She finally made good on that
threat.

1238
01:02:16,107 --> 01:02:20,611
Darryl, I really appreciate you

1239
01:02:21,320 --> 01:02:25,032
trying to strike up a
conversation
with me two nights ago.

1240
01:02:27,076 --> 01:02:30,163
- Hey, I'm sorry you lost
somebody

1241
01:02:30,204 --> 01:02:32,081
that you cared so much about.

1242
01:02:32,749 --> 01:02:35,668
It seems like things went
all down hill after that.

1243
01:02:36,169 --> 01:02:38,713
You seem to be fighting a lot of
demons.

1244
01:02:41,132 --> 01:02:43,342
- I was just a cute little
blonde

1245
01:02:43,426 --> 01:02:45,845
no one could keep their hands
off of.

1246
01:02:45,928 --> 01:02:49,307
- And, as a friend, albeit a new
friend,

1247
01:02:50,141 --> 01:02:51,601
I want to say something.

1248
01:02:53,144 --> 01:02:54,479
Go ahead.

1249
01:02:56,189 --> 01:03:00,276
- Be goth, carry guns
and hum strange tunes,

1250
01:03:01,235 --> 01:03:03,696
but you shouldn't be hurting
yourself.

1251
01:03:03,738 --> 01:03:05,573
You deserve better than that.

1252
01:03:06,157 --> 01:03:09,786
Get a tattoo and let the
professional hurt you!

1253
01:03:13,080 --> 01:03:15,583
- That could probably take some
therapy.

1254
01:03:16,751 --> 01:03:17,919
- Think about it.

1255
01:03:18,961 --> 01:03:22,548
Now, ready to go hack,

1256
01:03:22,590 --> 01:03:24,550
maim, bludgeon and slaughter
ourselves

1257
01:03:24,634 --> 01:03:26,427
to the delight of thousands?

1258
01:03:26,469 --> 01:03:27,261
- Yippie!

1259
01:03:27,303 --> 01:03:29,555
Ha-ha.

1260
01:03:29,597 --> 01:03:30,723
Bye Aunt Mare.

1261
01:03:32,225 --> 01:03:33,726
Happy Halloween.

1262
01:03:36,813 --> 01:03:39,816
- So I suppose you like "How
the Grinch Stole Christmas"?

1263
01:03:39,857 --> 01:03:40,733
- Love it!

1264
01:03:40,817 --> 01:03:41,984
- And your favorite movie of all
time,

1265
01:03:42,026 --> 01:03:43,152
the "Nightmare Before
Christmas"?

1266
01:03:43,236 --> 01:03:44,570
- Now you're getting me hot!

1267
01:03:53,538 --> 01:03:57,333
Chug, chug, chug,
chug, chug!

1268
01:04:16,727 --> 01:04:21,899
Let us in, let us
in, let us in, let us in!

1269
01:04:25,111 --> 01:04:26,153
- Uhhhh.

1270
01:04:27,613 --> 01:04:28,781
Oh, where the hell is Spider?

1271
01:04:28,865 --> 01:04:30,533
- Oh, how many times are
you going to say that?

1272
01:04:30,616 --> 01:04:32,243
- Well, where the hell is
Spider?

1273
01:04:32,326 --> 01:04:34,579
- He told me that he was coming
back.

1274
01:04:34,620 --> 01:04:36,330
- Did he say when?

1275
01:04:36,998 --> 01:04:37,832
Sorry.

1276
01:04:37,915 --> 01:04:39,083
Sorry Jake I know it's not your
fault.

1277
01:04:39,125 --> 01:04:40,668
Thanks for getting the place
open.

1278
01:04:40,710 --> 01:04:41,627
Okay.

1279
01:04:41,669 --> 01:04:43,212
I will work Spider's
line and take the cash.

1280
01:04:43,254 --> 01:04:43,963
- Oh good!

1281
01:04:44,005 --> 01:04:44,839
Here's your cash bags.

1282
01:04:44,922 --> 01:04:45,756
- Thank you.

1283
01:04:45,798 --> 01:04:47,341
Wait, Darryl come here.

1284
01:04:47,425 --> 01:04:48,426
If I'm going to cover for
Spider,

1285
01:04:48,467 --> 01:04:49,886
you have to cover for me.

1286
01:04:49,927 --> 01:04:53,764
I am entrusting you with
the chainsaw finale.

1287
01:04:53,806 --> 01:04:54,682
- Why me?

1288
01:04:54,724 --> 01:04:56,392
- Claire recommended you.

1289
01:04:57,643 --> 01:04:58,394
- Yeah.

1290
01:04:58,436 --> 01:04:59,103
I'm there!

1291
01:04:59,186 --> 01:05:00,021
Show me what to do.

1292
01:05:00,062 --> 01:05:01,063
- Nothing to it.

1293
01:05:01,105 --> 01:05:02,189
Here's the throttle,
this is the chain lock.

1294
01:05:02,231 --> 01:05:03,399
Now, keep that lock on.

1295
01:05:03,482 --> 01:05:05,526
Without that lock on you
could level a fucking forest.

1296
01:05:05,568 --> 01:05:06,819
So, for tonight, lock on.

1297
01:05:06,861 --> 01:05:07,528
Okay?

1298
01:05:07,570 --> 01:05:08,487
Now, try and rev her up.

1299
01:05:08,529 --> 01:05:09,614
Jam it there between your knees,

1300
01:05:09,655 --> 01:05:11,824
pull that cord as hard as you
can.

1301
01:05:13,159 --> 01:05:14,243
Straight up.

1302
01:05:15,411 --> 01:05:17,288
- Put a bit of mustard on it.

1303
01:05:18,247 --> 01:05:19,665
Ha ha ha ha!

1304
01:05:19,707 --> 01:05:20,666
And off!

1305
01:05:20,750 --> 01:05:23,794
Good, you have earned the orange
mask.

1306
01:05:23,878 --> 01:05:24,754
But don't get cocky.

1307
01:05:24,795 --> 01:05:25,838
I don't want you trying to bury

1308
01:05:25,922 --> 01:05:27,006
that thing into somebody's
stomach.

1309
01:05:27,048 --> 01:05:28,799
Just chase them around with it.

1310
01:05:28,841 --> 01:05:29,634
Good.

1311
01:05:29,675 --> 01:05:30,426
Okay.

1312
01:05:30,468 --> 01:05:31,594
Everyone, take your positions!

1313
01:05:35,514 --> 01:05:36,724
Let us in!

1314
01:05:36,766 --> 01:05:37,850
Let us in!

1315
01:05:37,892 --> 01:05:38,726
Let us in!

1316
01:05:38,768 --> 01:05:40,144
Let us in!

1317
01:05:40,186 --> 01:05:41,228
- Shut up!

1318
01:05:41,270 --> 01:05:42,396
Shut up!

1319
01:05:42,438 --> 01:05:43,481
Shut up!

1320
01:05:44,482 --> 01:05:45,608
- Hey Oliver!

1321
01:05:45,691 --> 01:05:46,567
Hey, where's Spidey?

1322
01:05:46,609 --> 01:05:47,944
You too cheap to pay him?

1323
01:05:48,027 --> 01:05:51,739
- How do you know he's not
in there somewhere, huh?

1324
01:05:51,781 --> 01:05:53,658
Waiting for you!

1325
01:05:55,076 --> 01:05:56,035
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha.

1326
01:05:56,077 --> 01:05:59,205
Let the slaughter begin!

1327
01:06:02,541 --> 01:06:05,419
Get in you date-less wonders!

1328
01:06:38,327 --> 01:06:41,872
- Everybody get batty, bloody
birth!

1329
01:06:48,379 --> 01:06:49,547
- And pull.

1330
01:06:52,341 --> 01:06:53,175
- Oh man.

1331
01:06:53,259 --> 01:06:56,053
Oh my god.
- This is disgusting.

1332
01:07:25,624 --> 01:07:27,334
- Would ya, would ya hurry up!

1333
01:07:27,376 --> 01:07:28,419
- All right, all right,

1334
01:07:28,502 --> 01:07:30,838
I'm here now I've got a
shit-load of tens.

1335
01:07:31,338 --> 01:07:33,174
Have a nice scare.

1336
01:07:33,257 --> 01:07:34,091
- Oliver.
- Yeah.

1337
01:07:34,133 --> 01:07:35,051
- I've got to go to work.

1338
01:07:35,134 --> 01:07:36,302
- Oh okay, save me a table.

1339
01:07:36,343 --> 01:07:37,386
I'll be there at two.

1340
01:07:37,470 --> 01:07:38,679
- Gotta pinch a loaf!
- What?

1341
01:07:38,763 --> 01:07:40,890
- Yeah, I've got to drop
the kids off at the pool!

1342
01:07:40,973 --> 01:07:41,724
- Hurry up!

1343
01:07:42,641 --> 01:07:44,643
- Damn!
- Ha, ha, ha, ha!

1344
01:08:01,327 --> 01:08:03,037
- Awesome!
- That was sick!

1345
01:08:03,120 --> 01:08:06,123
- That bloody guy coming
from the wall was new!

1346
01:08:07,041 --> 01:08:08,250
- Everything okay?

1347
01:08:09,126 --> 01:08:09,794
- Great!

1348
01:08:09,835 --> 01:08:10,753
I just have to 'go' bad.

1349
01:08:10,795 --> 01:08:11,670
- Oh, there's someone in there.

1350
01:08:12,546 --> 01:08:14,090
Oh, me next!

1351
01:08:14,673 --> 01:08:17,093
- Hey, I wouldn't go
in there if I were you.

1352
01:08:17,176 --> 01:08:20,012
- Man, I gotta do this
fast and get back at it.

1353
01:08:20,096 --> 01:08:21,430
Uh, no time for airing out!

1354
01:08:21,472 --> 01:08:22,681
Heads up!

1355
01:08:23,682 --> 01:08:26,727
- If I'm not back in three
hours, call the cops!

1356
01:09:02,179 --> 01:09:04,431
- Back to slice and dice!

1357
01:09:04,473 --> 01:09:05,516
Heh, heh, heh.

1358
01:09:14,483 --> 01:09:16,569
- Oh my gosh it's all wet in
there.

1359
01:09:16,652 --> 01:09:20,072
- You've have blood all over
you.

1360
01:09:20,156 --> 01:09:21,490
- So do you!

1361
01:09:41,969 --> 01:09:43,470
- Hey, you found my axe-

1362
01:09:53,814 --> 01:09:55,900
- Dad, this is so fake.

1363
01:10:12,082 --> 01:10:14,877
- Uh, that's stupid.
- Not even scary.

1364
01:10:14,919 --> 01:10:17,588
- Try scaring somebody next
time.

1365
01:10:21,217 --> 01:10:23,219
This had better not
stain.

1366
01:10:23,302 --> 01:10:24,720
- I think it's just like
invisible ink.

1367
01:10:24,762 --> 01:10:27,097
I think it will just
disappear after a few minutes.

1368
01:10:27,139 --> 01:10:28,599
- Oh, I don't think so.

1369
01:10:28,641 --> 01:10:29,600
Look at this.

1370
01:10:29,642 --> 01:10:32,228
- Maybe it's cherry juice or
something.

1371
01:10:35,522 --> 01:10:38,275
- Oh God, it tastes like blood.

1372
01:10:38,859 --> 01:10:39,860
- Back off!

1373
01:10:39,902 --> 01:10:41,779
That bitch's been
following us the whole way.

1374
01:10:41,862 --> 01:10:43,322
Get a life!

1375
01:10:43,364 --> 01:10:44,490
- What's going on?

1376
01:10:44,531 --> 01:10:45,866
- I don't know, there's
something wrong with Tracy.

1377
01:10:45,950 --> 01:10:47,117
- Is she hurt or sick?
- I don't know,

1378
01:10:47,159 --> 01:10:49,203
I can't tell with this damn
costume.

1379
01:10:50,537 --> 01:10:53,457
- Oh Jesus, she's been stabbed!

1380
01:10:53,499 --> 01:10:55,626
- I think I'm going to be sick.

1381
01:11:02,508 --> 01:11:05,261
- Someone just got stabbed!

1382
01:11:05,344 --> 01:11:07,513
- Excellent!
- Let's go.

1383
01:11:07,554 --> 01:11:08,973
- Whoa-whoa, wait!

1384
01:11:10,015 --> 01:11:11,183
Ladies and gentlemen,

1385
01:11:11,225 --> 01:11:13,352
just a slight technical
snafu, I will be right back.

1386
01:11:13,394 --> 01:11:16,563
I will be right back.

1387
01:11:17,273 --> 01:11:18,315
Shit.

1388
01:11:19,233 --> 01:11:22,111
- Heh, yeah, this blows chunks,
dude.

1389
01:11:24,196 --> 01:11:26,949
- Hey sexy, you want to suck on
this?

1390
01:11:39,712 --> 01:11:40,754
- Ummm.

1391
01:11:41,797 --> 01:11:42,798
- I don't know, I don't know.

1392
01:11:42,840 --> 01:11:43,924
The only thing I can think is,

1393
01:11:44,008 --> 01:11:45,050
we have this chair that shoots
blades

1394
01:11:45,092 --> 01:11:46,510
through a dummy's chest.

1395
01:11:47,011 --> 01:11:48,887
No, I, I know it's Halloween
and you've been getting

1396
01:11:48,971 --> 01:11:52,224
a lot of crank calls, but
I'm telling you this is real.

1397
01:11:52,308 --> 01:11:53,058
Just hurry.

1398
01:11:53,142 --> 01:11:54,601
Just hurry!

1399
01:11:54,643 --> 01:11:55,352
- Okay.

1400
01:11:55,394 --> 01:11:56,603
I'm calling this a night.

1401
01:11:56,645 --> 01:11:57,479
I'm going to-

1402
01:11:57,521 --> 01:11:58,480
- There's a big fight outside!

1403
01:11:58,522 --> 01:12:00,607
- Son of a bitch!

1404
01:12:00,691 --> 01:12:02,818
I'll go break it up and
wait for the paramedics.

1405
01:12:02,860 --> 01:12:04,778
- I'm okay, I've got
pressure on the wound.

1406
01:12:04,820 --> 01:12:05,863
- Okay.

1407
01:12:05,904 --> 01:12:08,032
Claire, you've got to get
everybody out of that maze.

1408
01:12:21,170 --> 01:12:22,379
- Shit!

1409
01:12:22,421 --> 01:12:23,464
- What's going on?

1410
01:12:25,549 --> 01:12:26,759
- Please move to the exits.

1411
01:12:26,800 --> 01:12:28,469
Thank you.

1412
01:12:28,510 --> 01:12:29,595
- Boo!

1413
01:12:29,636 --> 01:12:30,429
This place sucks!

1414
01:12:30,471 --> 01:12:31,347
I want my money back.

1415
01:12:31,388 --> 01:12:32,473
- Please move to the exit.

1416
01:12:32,556 --> 01:12:34,224
Oliver will refund your
admission outside.

1417
01:12:34,266 --> 01:12:35,017
Asshole.

1418
01:12:35,059 --> 01:12:36,143
Thank you!

1419
01:12:37,728 --> 01:12:39,521
The exit is that way.

1420
01:12:42,358 --> 01:12:44,777
- Oh, man, this place is
so much more effective

1421
01:12:44,818 --> 01:12:46,070
with music and lights.

1422
01:12:46,153 --> 01:12:47,363
Hi!

1423
01:12:47,404 --> 01:12:48,072
Claire!

1424
01:12:48,113 --> 01:12:49,156
- Oh, sorry about this.

1425
01:12:49,198 --> 01:12:50,199
Look you'll get your money back.

1426
01:12:50,240 --> 01:12:51,283
Please just move to the-

1427
01:12:59,792 --> 01:13:01,627
- Look, I said we're closed.

1428
01:13:01,668 --> 01:13:03,712
- I don't think you understand.

1429
01:13:03,796 --> 01:13:08,050
We came all the way across
town and stood in line

1430
01:13:08,092 --> 01:13:10,386
for two goddamn hours!

1431
01:13:10,469 --> 01:13:11,553
- Calm down.

1432
01:13:11,595 --> 01:13:12,262
Hold on.

1433
01:13:12,304 --> 01:13:13,138
We've had an accident.

1434
01:13:13,222 --> 01:13:14,056
- Oww, shit.

1435
01:13:14,139 --> 01:13:15,182
- We're waiting for an
ambulance.

1436
01:13:15,224 --> 01:13:16,058
Oh, I don't have time for this.

1437
01:13:16,100 --> 01:13:16,850
Where's Claire?

1438
01:13:16,892 --> 01:13:17,726
- I don't know.

1439
01:13:17,768 --> 01:13:18,852
- I'll be right back.

1440
01:13:18,936 --> 01:13:21,438
- Uh, I, I'm going to
wait for the ambulance.

1441
01:13:22,898 --> 01:13:24,608
- Two fuckin' hours!

1442
01:13:26,360 --> 01:13:27,444
- Claire?

1443
01:13:32,616 --> 01:13:34,076
Oh my God.

1444
01:13:34,118 --> 01:13:35,577
Claire.

1445
01:13:35,619 --> 01:13:36,662
Claire!

1446
01:13:37,830 --> 01:13:39,081
- Oh Claire.

1447
01:13:39,790 --> 01:13:41,708
Sweet, sweet Claire

1448
01:13:44,628 --> 01:13:45,963
- Have you seen Claire?

1449
01:13:46,004 --> 01:13:46,672
- No.

1450
01:13:46,713 --> 01:13:47,506
Is the ambulance here?

1451
01:13:47,589 --> 01:13:48,424
- I don't think so.

1452
01:13:48,507 --> 01:13:49,466
Bart and Margo are outside.

1453
01:13:49,508 --> 01:13:51,260
I'm going to call the police.

1454
01:13:53,095 --> 01:13:54,054
Where's Sparks Malloy?

1455
01:13:54,096 --> 01:13:56,932
- What?
- My fucking taser!

1456
01:13:59,226 --> 01:14:01,228
- Don't get up!

1457
01:14:01,311 --> 01:14:02,479
Don't move!

1458
01:14:04,231 --> 01:14:05,816
Just lie there.

1459
01:14:05,899 --> 01:14:09,278
That's right, just lie like in
death.

1460
01:14:09,361 --> 01:14:10,362
Lie.

1461
01:14:18,537 --> 01:14:19,830
Hah!

1462
01:14:19,913 --> 01:14:21,790
That's you, Claire.

1463
01:14:22,332 --> 01:14:23,792
That's my Claire.

1464
01:14:24,793 --> 01:14:25,627
I did it for you.

1465
01:14:25,669 --> 01:14:28,755
I, I did this all for you!

1466
01:14:30,716 --> 01:14:31,467
Yes!

1467
01:14:31,508 --> 01:14:32,843
Claire!

1468
01:14:32,885 --> 01:14:34,845
Yes, you wanted this.

1469
01:14:34,887 --> 01:14:35,596
This!

1470
01:14:35,637 --> 01:14:37,764
And I've come for you.

1471
01:14:37,806 --> 01:14:39,057
I know all about you.

1472
01:14:39,099 --> 01:14:43,729
I know, I know how you love
death!

1473
01:14:43,770 --> 01:14:47,566
I know how it, it thrills you...

1474
01:14:47,649 --> 01:14:49,985
like it thrills me!

1475
01:14:50,694 --> 01:14:56,325
It took me three years of
watching you and practicing.

1476
01:14:59,620 --> 01:15:00,996
And you, you,

1477
01:15:03,457 --> 01:15:05,375
you taught me how to cut.

1478
01:15:09,129 --> 01:15:12,216
We'd watch you on those
long quiet afternoons

1479
01:15:12,299 --> 01:15:15,928
when you didn't think anyone was
looking.

1480
01:15:15,969 --> 01:15:20,349
You didn't see us, but we saw
you.

1481
01:15:21,433 --> 01:15:23,644
We'd lean up to the glass

1482
01:15:23,685 --> 01:15:26,897
between the branches and the
boxes.

1483
01:15:27,731 --> 01:15:29,483
And we'd watch you through

1484
01:15:29,525 --> 01:15:31,652
the Christmas window.

1485
01:15:34,363 --> 01:15:35,989
- Yes, right away please.

1486
01:15:36,615 --> 01:15:39,910
Well, I think we have a
dangerous situation here.

1487
01:15:40,869 --> 01:15:42,371
Yes, I think so.

1488
01:15:42,454 --> 01:15:45,749
Look, one was wounded
and another was killed.

1489
01:15:45,791 --> 01:15:47,376
- What's going on, Oliver?

1490
01:15:47,417 --> 01:15:49,044
- Just get the cops here.

1491
01:15:49,086 --> 01:15:50,546
I don't know what's going on.

1492
01:15:50,587 --> 01:15:52,214
Don't go in there!

1493
01:15:52,297 --> 01:15:53,799
Jake's dead.

1494
01:15:53,840 --> 01:15:54,841
- What?

1495
01:15:54,883 --> 01:15:55,759
Where's Claire?

1496
01:15:55,801 --> 01:15:56,718
- I don't know.

1497
01:15:56,760 --> 01:15:57,761
I sent her in to get everybody
out-

1498
01:15:57,803 --> 01:15:59,805
- The ambulance is here!

1499
01:15:59,846 --> 01:16:01,473
- Darryl, don't do it.

1500
01:16:01,515 --> 01:16:02,599
They're here for Tracy.

1501
01:16:02,641 --> 01:16:04,518
The police are on their
way, let them do it.

1502
01:16:04,560 --> 01:16:05,686
- Claire is in there!

1503
01:16:05,769 --> 01:16:08,522
- Something else is in
there and it killed Jake.

1504
01:16:08,564 --> 01:16:09,731
You're a kid in a costume.

1505
01:16:09,773 --> 01:16:11,108
What are you gonna do?

1506
01:16:13,485 --> 01:16:15,112
- I'm going after Claire!

1507
01:16:17,281 --> 01:16:19,491
- You know what's funny, Claire?

1508
01:16:19,533 --> 01:16:21,785
You cut to feel alive.

1509
01:16:22,828 --> 01:16:23,662
I cut to kill!

1510
01:16:25,038 --> 01:16:28,041
I used to try to cut to feel
alive, I,

1511
01:16:28,625 --> 01:16:31,753
I would cut, and I'd cut, and
I'd

1512
01:16:31,837 --> 01:16:34,464
cut and I would cut,

1513
01:16:34,506 --> 01:16:38,093
but it never felt good

1514
01:16:38,135 --> 01:16:39,261
till I met you.

1515
01:16:41,346 --> 01:16:42,389
And I watched how you

1516
01:16:42,431 --> 01:16:44,850
did yourself so lovingly.

1517
01:16:45,767 --> 01:16:48,312
You inspired me so.

1518
01:16:49,521 --> 01:16:53,275
And I grew to love you so much.

1519
01:16:55,360 --> 01:16:57,988
I had to have you be a part of
me.

1520
01:16:58,655 --> 01:17:00,449
To show my devotion.

1521
01:17:01,617 --> 01:17:02,784
My devotion.

1522
01:17:02,868 --> 01:17:04,453
My devotion.

1523
01:17:05,370 --> 01:17:07,414
The pleasure of pain, right?

1524
01:17:07,497 --> 01:17:12,669
The pleasure of pain,
the pleasure. I did this

1525
01:17:12,711 --> 01:17:13,670
for you, Claire!

1526
01:17:25,140 --> 01:17:26,224
- Claire?

1527
01:17:27,726 --> 01:17:28,727
- Not you!

1528
01:17:28,769 --> 01:17:29,853
Not you, Claire!

1529
01:17:29,936 --> 01:17:32,689
Don't be like all the rest
of them, a squealing pig!

1530
01:17:34,232 --> 01:17:36,902
Oh, Claire, don't be scared.

1531
01:17:36,943 --> 01:17:38,654
I'm here to fulfill your wish.

1532
01:17:38,737 --> 01:17:40,322
I'm going to take you away from
here.

1533
01:17:40,364 --> 01:17:42,866
And the best part, the best
part?

1534
01:17:42,949 --> 01:17:44,326
I'm coming with you!

1535
01:17:44,910 --> 01:17:47,204
Now that I've proven my
worthiness to you,

1536
01:17:47,287 --> 01:17:51,333
I need to do for you what you
could not do for yourself.

1537
01:17:51,917 --> 01:17:53,877
- Claire!
- Darryl!

1538
01:17:54,711 --> 01:17:55,796
- Claire!

1539
01:18:01,176 --> 01:18:06,264
- Now my darling, it is time
for me to drain you dry.

1540
01:18:08,141 --> 01:18:09,851
Claire!

1541
01:18:09,893 --> 01:18:12,229
- Then open my veins.

1542
01:18:12,270 --> 01:18:13,063
- Claire!

1543
01:18:16,942 --> 01:18:18,026
- Ahhhhh!

1544
01:18:18,485 --> 01:18:20,362
You're not a part of this!

1545
01:18:23,365 --> 01:18:29,162
And then we will live together
in the eternal orgy of hell!

1546
01:18:41,174 --> 01:18:42,050
- Claire!

1547
01:18:44,219 --> 01:18:46,012
I'll be right back.

1548
01:19:21,298 --> 01:19:22,215
Claire.

1549
01:19:41,067 --> 01:19:42,319
- Come here!

1550
01:20:15,393 --> 01:20:17,020
- Stupid.

1551
01:20:17,062 --> 01:20:18,104
Stupid.

1552
01:20:21,316 --> 01:20:22,359
Stupid!

1553
01:20:25,070 --> 01:20:27,280
You ruined everything!

1554
01:20:29,616 --> 01:20:31,743
You ruined my moment!

1555
01:20:36,581 --> 01:20:37,666
It's okay.

1556
01:20:40,210 --> 01:20:41,878
Don't worry.

1557
01:20:41,962 --> 01:20:42,712
I'll be sure to tell

1558
01:20:42,796 --> 01:20:44,381
Claire all about th-

1559
01:20:55,976 --> 01:20:57,602
- Oliver!

1560
01:20:57,644 --> 01:20:58,687
Oliver!

1561
01:21:06,319 --> 01:21:08,572
- God damn it!

1562
01:21:08,613 --> 01:21:09,656
Darryl!

1563
01:21:11,616 --> 01:21:13,743
- I'm okay, I'm okay.

1564
01:21:15,996 --> 01:21:17,247
- Was it just him?

1565
01:21:19,040 --> 01:21:21,585
- That thing was living back
there!

1566
01:21:21,668 --> 01:21:23,169
He killed, he killed Spider.

1567
01:21:23,211 --> 01:21:24,588
He killed all of them because of
me.

1568
01:21:25,589 --> 01:21:27,048
- It's okay, it's okay.

1569
01:21:28,466 --> 01:21:29,843
The police are here.

1570
01:21:29,885 --> 01:21:31,761
They're gonna sort everything
ou-

1571
01:21:36,600 --> 01:21:37,392
- No!

1572
01:21:37,475 --> 01:21:38,226
No!

1573
01:22:04,586 --> 01:22:07,881
- Excuse me, I'm looking for-
- Hey Darryl.

1574
01:22:13,261 --> 01:22:16,056
- Hey, how are you?

1575
01:22:16,097 --> 01:22:17,140
- Good.

1576
01:22:18,683 --> 01:22:20,060
Good.

1577
01:22:20,101 --> 01:22:21,311
- You look great.

1578
01:22:21,811 --> 01:22:23,897
- Still working on those demons.

1579
01:22:24,898 --> 01:22:26,983
- Sorry you had to come
back to work so soon.

1580
01:22:27,025 --> 01:22:28,151
- Oh, me too.

1581
01:22:28,193 --> 01:22:30,403
Therapy's expensive for a girl!

1582
01:22:30,445 --> 01:22:32,906
- Selfishly, I'm glad you're
back.

1583
01:22:33,490 --> 01:22:36,284
- God, Darryl, where
were you 10 years ago?

1584
01:22:37,786 --> 01:22:40,789
You know, my psychoanalysis
revealed

1585
01:22:40,830 --> 01:22:43,041
that I have a clinical "3M"
issue

1586
01:22:43,083 --> 01:22:44,376
when it comes to relationships.

1587
01:22:44,417 --> 01:22:47,337
Apparently I deeply believe
that all I can attract are

1588
01:22:47,379 --> 01:22:49,589
maniacs, molesters and monsters.

1589
01:22:51,883 --> 01:22:56,638
But hiding and disguising
myself didn't seem to help.

1590
01:22:56,721 --> 01:22:59,599
And, it's just going to take a
while

1591
01:22:59,641 --> 01:23:00,725
before I can shake the feeling

1592
01:23:00,767 --> 01:23:04,312
that I bring out the worst in
men.

1593
01:23:04,354 --> 01:23:05,480
- I understand.

1594
01:23:06,064 --> 01:23:07,190
Take your time.

1595
01:23:08,441 --> 01:23:10,860
When you're ready, give me call.

1596
01:23:14,489 --> 01:23:16,866
Merry Christmas, Claire.

1597
01:27:17,482 --> 01:27:18,608
- Get lost!

1598
01:27:18,650 --> 01:27:20,235
Except you in the back, the hot
one.

1599
01:27:20,276 --> 01:27:21,110
Come here.

1600
01:27:21,194 --> 01:27:22,737
A little bit closer.

1601
01:27:22,779 --> 01:27:23,905
That's right.
