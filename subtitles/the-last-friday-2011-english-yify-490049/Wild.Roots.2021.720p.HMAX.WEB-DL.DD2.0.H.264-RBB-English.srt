<i>And we begin our news tour
with the A! Jazeera channel</i>

00:03:21,375 --> 00:03:26,546
<i>which said that an extensive
investigation has been conducted</i>

4
00:03:28,708 --> 00:03:34,333
<i>by a team of international
independent technical experts</i>

5
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:41,254
<i>who confirmed the claim of interference
of an Al Jazeera Sports Channel</i>

6
00:03:45,417 --> 00:03:50,335
<i>during the broadcast
of the FIFA World Cup,</i>

7
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:56,047
<i>and the experts were able
to identify the site</i>

8
00:03:56,208 --> 00:04:00,629
<i>from which the interference originated</i>

9
00:04:00,833 --> 00:04:05,301
<i>which is near the city of Salt, Jordan,</i>

10
00:04:05,458 --> 00:04:10,885

interfering with the broadcast</i>

<i>signal of A! Jazeera Sports</i>

12
00:04:17,458 --> 00:04:22,593
<i>resulting in interference of
the live broadcast of a number</i>

13
00:04:24,750 --> 00:04:27,298
<i>of World Cup matches.</i>

14
00:04:44,208 --> 00:04:45,500
<i>"The Guardian" newspaper</i>

15
00:04:45,667 --> 00:04:48,168
<i>confirms this hypothesis

16

<i>on the secret documents</i>

17
00:04:49,625 --> 00:04:53,465
<i>that refer to the site of interference
being in Jordan and more specifically</i>

18
00:04:53,625 --> 00:04:54,798
<i>near the city of Salt.</i>

19
00:04:54,958 --> 00:04:57,210
<i>which used in the process
advanced equipment</i>

20
00:04:57,375 --> 00:05:00,090
<i>that interrupts the origin
of the signal transmission</i>

21
00:05:00,250 --> 00:05:03,841
<i>and the British newspaper assured,
based on the experts' quotes that</i>

22
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:07,295
<i>this has occurred with the knowledge
of the Jordanian government</i>

23
00:05:07,458 --> 00:05:11,132
<i>in what appears to be linked to anger
in Jordan after failing to reach</i>

24

<i>an agreement with Al Jazeera Sports</i>

25
00:05:13,292 --> 00:05:16,752
<i>from banks and currencies to the
prices that are changing day after day...</i>

26
00:05:17,083 --> 00:05:19,667
Well... I need two hours
and I'll be back.

27
00:05:25,250 --> 00:05:27,881
Could you please turn it
down a little bit?

28
00:05:31,542 --> 00:05:34,588
Of course I'm by myself!
Who would I be with?

29
00:05:36,583 --> 00:05:40,293
No! Do not come by unless
you give me a call first.

30
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:45,083
Can I be honest with you?

31
00:05:45,250 --> 00:05:48,213
I don't want you in my life anymore.

32
00:12:09,750 --> 00:12:13,839
<i>In Amman, hundreds of
Jordanians protested against the</i>

33
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:17,211
<i>repression and intimidation
of journalists</i>

34
00:12:17,375 --> 00:12:22,009
<i>which took place when they organized
a protest under the name.</i>

35
00:12:22,167 --> 00:12:25,841
<i>The Friday for Dignity
and Freedom of Expression.</i>

36
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:29,094
<i>The demonstrators burned
an American flag</i>

37
00:12:29,292 --> 00:12:33,084
<i>to protest what they called
the U.S. intervention</i>

38
00:12:33,250 --> 00:12:36,426
<i>in the policies of
the Jordanian Government,</i>

39
00:12:36,583 --> 00:12:41,419
<i>and called for the resignation
of the Prime Minister as well as</i>

40
00:12:41,583 --> 00:12:43,966
<i>demanding freedom of the press.</i>

41
00:12:44,125 --> 00:12:47,052
<i>Last Friday, a violence fight broke out</i>

42
00:12:47,208 --> 00:12:50,669
<i>when police tried to
break up a demonstration</i>

43
00:12:50,833 --> 00:12:55,301
<i>that called for reform.
Many journalists were injured.</i>

44
00:12:55,458 --> 00:12:57,675
<i>From Amman, the bureau chief,</i>

45
00:12:57,833 --> 00:13:01,258
<i>Yasser Abu Hilal,
will report on the details.</i>

46
00:13:01,417 --> 00:13:06,501
<i>Yasser, what was the extent of
the fight and what will happen now?</i>

47
00:13:06,667 --> 00:13:11,632
<i>Demonstrations swept a number
of Jordanian cities south in Maan,</i>

48
00:13:11,792 --> 00:13:16,675
<i>and in the south, in Karak
and Tafieleh and Irbid in the north.</i>

49
00:13:16,833 --> 00:13:21,882
<i>This Friday called for reform
but brutal repression by the police</i>

50
00:13:22,042 --> 00:13:26,925
<i>resulted in many of journalists
being injured and hospitalized.</i>

51
00:13:27,083 --> 00:13:32,132
<i>Prior to the demonstration,
a meeting by King Abduflah II and the</i>

52
00:13:32,292 --> 00:13:36,510
<i>official representative
of the journalist, Tareq Momani</i>

53
00:13:36,667 --> 00:13:41,218
<i>took place yesterday,
and the message meeting was clear...</i>

54
00:16:27,958 --> 00:16:30,376
It will do for couple of days.

55
00:16:36,083 --> 00:16:38,086
Can you take me to the airport?

56
00:16:38,750 --> 00:16:39,841
What for?

57
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,003
I finally got my visa.

58
00:16:43,542 --> 00:16:45,343
So what about the money?

59
00:16:45,542 --> 00:16:47,177
Be patient with me.

60
00:16:47,750 --> 00:16:48,793
I need it now!

61
00:16:48,958 --> 00:16:50,131
What's the rush?

62
00:16:50,292 --> 00:16:51,678
I have to have surgery.

63
00:16:51,833 --> 00:16:52,876
Surgery for what?

64
00:16:53,667 --> 00:16:56,464
When was the last time
you checked the oil?

65
00:17:01,125 --> 00:17:03,294
No need... the engine
is the problem.

66
00:17:11,125 --> 00:17:13,424
The car keeps shutting off...

67
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:16,420
This isn't working...

68
00:17:16,833 --> 00:17:19,168
You want me to keep
going on like this?

69
00:17:19,333 --> 00:17:21,550
I don't get it... what do you want?

70
00:17:22,917 --> 00:17:24,801
Just fix the engine.

71
00:17:27,292 --> 00:17:30,835
Fouad, get me the notebook...
it's in the drawer.

72
00:17:58,500 --> 00:18:01,462
You've got 300 dinars worth
of fines since last year.

73
00:18:02,042 --> 00:18:05,420
When are you going to pay them?

74
00:18:05,583 --> 00:18:07,338
I'm going to be honest with you...

75
00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:09,669
In general, I'm unhappy
with your performance.

76
00:18:09,833 --> 00:18:14,089
If you don't shape up within a week,
you give me the cab back and go.

77
00:18:15,833 --> 00:18:17,255
What happened?

78
00:18:17,417 --> 00:18:19,336
The front part is totally wrecked.

79
00:18:19,750 --> 00:18:21,090
So, when will it be done?

80
00:18:21,417 --> 00:18:22,756
Half a day.

81
00:18:25,583 --> 00:18:28,261
So what are you waiting for?
Get back to work.

82
00:18:36,167 --> 00:18:39,296
You think you're the only one
with dignity in this world.

83
00:18:39,458 --> 00:18:41,343
And what if I told you
to buzz off?

84
00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:43,882
A couple of days ago
you called me a jackass!

85
00:18:44,042 --> 00:18:47,834
Or do you only use
etiquette when...

86
00:18:55,208 --> 00:18:56,630
What are you up to?

87
00:18:57,083 --> 00:18:59,051
I'm bored out of my mind.

88
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,050
Going to work.

89
00:19:12,250 --> 00:19:16,208
Mom, are you going out tonight?

90
00:19:23,667 --> 00:19:27,341
Then can you leave me your car keys...
I'm going out but I won't be late.

91
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:28,970
You're going out every day now?

92
00:19:29,125 --> 00:19:30,714
I'm going to a graduation party.

93
00:19:30,875 --> 00:19:32,713
Take a cab.

94
00:19:33,167 --> 00:19:38,381
You want me to step out of the hair salon
into the street and hail a cab?

95
00:19:38,833 --> 00:19:40,552
No way!

96
00:19:40,792 --> 00:19:46,670
The first time I ever went to a salon
was on my wedding day.

97
00:19:47,875 --> 00:19:50,127
Did you add your father on Facebook?

98
00:19:50,292 --> 00:19:51,501
I don't want to.

99
00:19:51,667 --> 00:19:52,709
Why?

100
00:19:52,875 --> 00:19:54,380
Because I don't want to.

101
00:19:54,542 --> 00:19:55,751
Add him!

102
00:19:55,917 --> 00:19:58,595
Mama, can you stop acting like a teenager.

103
00:19:58,750 --> 00:20:00,385
Let me know when you add him.

104
00:20:00,542 --> 00:20:05,093
What do you really want from all this?

105
00:20:06,167 --> 00:20:08,964
Will you give me the keys or not?

106
00:20:10,167 --> 00:20:12,798
Didn't your dad say he'd buy you a car?

107
00:20:12,958 --> 00:20:14,713
Talk to him...

108
00:20:23,667 --> 00:20:24,840
Message?

109
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:26,126
Call him!

110
00:20:26,292 --> 00:20:27,714
I don't feel like it.

111
00:20:27,875 --> 00:20:29,960
And, anyway, I don't have credit.

112
00:20:30,125 --> 00:20:32,342
Your father doesn't answer messages.

113
00:20:32,500 --> 00:20:37,300
You'll see...
I'll keep sending until he answers.

114
00:20:40,792 --> 00:20:43,636
How's your boyfriend, the mechanic?

115
00:20:43,792 --> 00:20:46,209
Mom, he's not a "mechanic".

116
00:20:46,375 --> 00:20:50,677
Jaber is a mechanical engineer.

117
00:20:52,375 --> 00:20:55,421
Darling, men are stupid creatures.

118
00:20:55,958 --> 00:20:59,419
Don't comfort him,
don't ever let him feel safe.

119
00:20:59,583 --> 00:21:03,127
You have to always
keep him worried... afraid.

120
00:21:03,292 --> 00:21:05,709
Don't you dare tell him that you love him.

121
00:21:05,875 --> 00:21:08,590
No! He told me loves me.

122
00:21:08,917 --> 00:21:13,717
Don't say it until he loses
hope from waiting.

123
00:21:35,917 --> 00:21:37,671
Jaber...

124
00:21:41,042 --> 00:21:44,420
I've been a taxi driver for a while now...

125
00:21:44,750 --> 00:21:47,049
When will you give me my old job back?

126
00:21:47,292 --> 00:21:49,544
We still don't have any openings.

127
00:21:49,833 --> 00:21:51,671
It's been 5 years.

128
00:21:53,208 --> 00:21:56,752
You know more than anyone what
I can do for the showroom sales.

129
00:21:57,375 --> 00:22:01,215
You're the one who left
to go work in the Gulf.

130
00:24:09,750 --> 00:24:11,883
Imad, what were you doing
on their roof?

131
00:24:12,167 --> 00:24:15,011
Do you want us to get
in trouble with the neighbors?

132
00:24:15,167 --> 00:24:18,426
<i>"After a women has found
her way into a man's heart,</i>

133
00:24:18,583 --> 00:24:20,254
<i>she will seek to control him,</i>

134
00:24:20,417 --> 00:24:23,462
<i>and there are many ways
she can keep that control</i>

135
00:24:23,625 --> 00:24:27,003
<i>like, for example, if he has
a submissive personality,</i>

136
00:24:27,167 --> 00:24:29,170
<i>or h' he is poor and she is not.</i>

137
00:24:29,333 --> 00:24:33,719
<i>She could also be sadistic and
he could be unable to stand up for himself</i>

138
00:24:33,875 --> 00:24:38,047
<i>Moreover, the women's family is
could be wealthy and have power in</i>

139
00:24:38,208 --> 00:24:41,135
<i>society increasing
the psychological pressure.</i>

140
00:24:41,292 --> 00:24:44,835
<i>AH of these things could cause
the husband to surrender</i>

141
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:47,466
<i>and remain silent in the face of abuse.</i>

142
00:24:47,625 --> 00:24:51,133
<i>In fact, in the Arab world
today in only 7% of cases do</i>

143
00:24:51,292 --> 00:24:54,219
<i>men started to admit to
the violence they face</i>

144
00:24:54,375 --> 00:24:58,168
<i>and they do not fully recognized it
until they have reached</i>

145
00:24:58,333 --> 00:25:00,799
<i>a severe stage of depression and abuse.</i>

146
00:25:00,958 --> 00:25:03,542
<i>And so when we try
to know and understand</i>

147
00:25:03,708 --> 00:25:05,676
<i>the reason for their depression</i>

148
00:25:05,833 --> 00:25:08,216
<i>we uncover the truth of the violence.</i>

149
00:25:09,167 --> 00:25:11,466
I've missed you, kid.

150
00:25:15,042 --> 00:25:17,459
Pretty soon you'll be as tall as me.

151
00:25:19,042 --> 00:25:21,127
I might be taller.

152
00:25:28,167 --> 00:25:30,798
So why weren't you two talking?

153
00:25:31,583 --> 00:25:33,135
She was upset.

154
00:25:33,292 --> 00:25:34,548
Why?

155
00:25:36,750 --> 00:25:39,381
I was supposed
to wait for her outside.

156
00:25:39,750 --> 00:25:43,507
Maybe she was afraid that
her mom would see her with you.

157
00:25:45,750 --> 00:25:48,168
Is that why you went up?

158
00:25:48,792 --> 00:25:51,209
I waited but she didn't come out.

159
00:26:04,583 --> 00:26:07,298
No... this goes here.

160
00:26:09,792 --> 00:26:14,461
Dad, I need a new wheel for my bike.

161
00:26:26,292 --> 00:26:28,709
Don't, don't.

162
00:27:55,125 --> 00:27:57,922
And the money?

163
00:27:59,250 --> 00:28:03,208
Didn't you say it's ready?
Come pick it up?

164
00:28:03,958 --> 00:28:05,713
What's wrong with you, man?

165
00:28:05,875 --> 00:28:09,335
Do I have to tell you I don't have
more than 20 dinars in my account?

166
00:28:09,500 --> 00:28:13,672
If you are so in need,
why don't you take from Imad's savings?

167
00:28:13,833 --> 00:28:17,342
He's still young, and when you have
money again you put it back.

168
00:28:20,375 --> 00:28:23,919
So, why don't you
go back to the Gulf?

169
00:28:25,917 --> 00:28:29,460
When my mother was dying
and I wanted to come visit.

170
00:28:29,625 --> 00:28:34,211
My fucking employer wouldn't
give me my passport back.

171
00:28:34,375 --> 00:28:36,841
So I went to the police
and reported.

172
00:28:37,875 --> 00:28:43,251
They threw me in their jeep with criminals
and asked him to follow in his car!

173
00:28:45,125 --> 00:28:50,715
I stayed there waiting for
that motherfucker for half a day.

174
00:28:52,208 --> 00:28:54,128
And what was the response?

175
00:28:54,292 --> 00:28:56,757
Sort it out yourself".

176
00:28:58,500 --> 00:29:01,676
Well, all you can do is play
and try your luck again.

177
00:29:01,958 --> 00:29:04,506
Luck? What luck?

178
00:29:05,875 --> 00:29:09,751
I lost two years of work in one night.

179
00:29:12,833 --> 00:29:16,543
Good thing I registered under
her name before I...

180
00:29:17,333 --> 00:29:21,505
The apartment she didn't like because
it didn't have the garden she wanted!

181
00:29:22,167 --> 00:29:26,552
By the way, does she still
rent it out fully furnished?

182
00:29:32,875 --> 00:29:34,676
I still don't get it, Fouad.

183
00:29:34,833 --> 00:29:37,417
You've got your family and a good job.

184
00:29:37,583 --> 00:29:40,298
You're supposed to be doing well.

185
00:29:42,250 --> 00:29:44,668
So why do you want to leave?

186
00:29:45,833 --> 00:29:48,678
Man, it's been three months
with no salary.

187
00:29:48,833 --> 00:29:51,417
And you say I'm doing well.

188
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:55,501
And the last time I asked
Jaber to pay me.

189
00:29:55,667 --> 00:29:59,506
He acted like a beggar with no money.

190
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:07,460
What's the story with this operation?

191
00:30:13,625 --> 00:30:17,133
Today, I felt this strong
pain come and go.

192
00:30:20,208 --> 00:30:22,342
It turns out I have a twisted testicle.

193
00:30:22,500 --> 00:30:24,834
So now I need surgery.

194
00:30:28,250 --> 00:30:31,047
The doctor say it's a simple procedure.

195
00:30:31,208 --> 00:30:34,882
It's going to take 15 minutes
and it's over.

196
00:30:37,875 --> 00:30:40,921
But I have a bad feeling about it.

197
00:30:42,208 --> 00:30:45,254
Man, the pain will go on its own.

198
00:30:47,042 --> 00:30:52,217
The thing is, the doctor says
if I don't do it before Friday

199
00:30:53,875 --> 00:30:57,004
it will get worse
and they might cut it off.

200
00:30:59,042 --> 00:31:04,043
So what... if they cut it off,
you still have the other one.

201
00:32:28,333 --> 00:32:31,545
Do you know which one is yours?

202
00:32:48,333 --> 00:32:49,590
Which apartment?

203
00:32:49,750 --> 00:32:51,753
Number 7.

204
00:33:01,042 --> 00:33:02,333
Do YOU pay the bill?

205
00:33:02,500 --> 00:33:04,005
I always pay-

206
00:33:06,458 --> 00:33:10,714
Seems some bastard stole your plug.

207
00:33:15,958 --> 00:33:20,011
I think I have one
at my place somewhere.

208
00:33:32,958 --> 00:33:36,134
If you're looking for a meter plug,

209
00:33:36,958 --> 00:33:40,881
there's an extra one...

210
00:33:53,292 --> 00:33:56,551
Do you know which meter is yours?

211
00:33:56,792 --> 00:33:58,178
Which apartment?

212
00:33:58,333 --> 00:34:01,296
Number 7.

213
00:34:09,167 --> 00:34:12,841
<i>...did not reveal is identity for

<i>only days before the start of...</i>

231
00:35:09,125 --> 00:35:11,922
Yusef, it's Jaber.

232
00:35:12,083 --> 00:35:14,584
I tried to call you but haven't
heard back yet.

233
00:35:15,208 --> 00:35:16,381
There's a deal.

234
00:35:16,542 --> 00:35:21,377
If you close it, you'll get 500 dinars
and not a penny more.

235
00:35:21,667 --> 00:35:24,428
The client will be waiting
at the showroom at 8.

236
00:35:24,625 --> 00:35:26,509
Don't be late.

237
00:37:01,292 --> 00:37:02,927
Yes, Mom.

238
00:37:05,167 --> 00:37:06,755
Studying-

239
00:37:09,583 --> 00:37:11,717
I don't know.

240
00:37:13,250 --> 00:37:14,885
I can't hear you.

241
00:37:18,333 --> 00:37:20,301
I can't hear you.

242
00:37:22,958 --> 00:37:26,134
Hush him up or go somewhere
else so I can hear.

243
00:37:28,750 --> 00:37:30,835
Yes, much better.

244
00:37:34,542 --> 00:37:37,303
I was alone, he wasn't home.

245
00:37:38,667 --> 00:37:40,919
He went to see a friend.

246
00:37:42,208 --> 00:37:44,591
Fouad, maybe.

247
00:37:48,958 --> 00:37:53,095
No, I'm not going to say anything.
He should know by himself.

248
00:37:53,625 --> 00:37:55,344
Don't say anything, OK?

249
00:38:06,542 --> 00:38:10,500
Thank you for making coffee.

250
00:38:11,375 --> 00:38:13,876
You still haven't finished the book?

251
00:38:14,042 --> 00:38:16,803
I have but I'm just reviewing.

252
00:38:36,417 --> 00:38:39,877
Where do they sell bike wheels?

253
00:38:40,042 --> 00:38:43,502
<i>...the Jordanian parliament

254
00:38:43,667 --> 00:38:45,835
<i>investigation committee's decision</i>

<i>of the former minister of tourism.</i>

264
00:39:26,125 --> 00:39:28,009
We've got two brands for this model.

265
00:39:28,167 --> 00:39:31,260
A Chinese one for 7 dinars,
and an Italian for 25 dinars.

266
00:39:31,417 --> 00:39:33,669
Unfortunately, we're out
of the Chinese one.

267
00:39:33,833 --> 00:39:36,796
Well, bring us the Italian. - Sure.

268
00:41:45,958 --> 00:41:50,924
Imad, I'm leaving the country.

269
00:41:59,417 --> 00:42:03,635
Dad, the school principle
wants to see you.

270
00:42:07,750 --> 00:42:11,922
What did you do? - Nothing.

271
00:42:13,667 --> 00:42:16,132
So what does he want?

272
00:42:16,292 --> 00:42:17,382
I don't know.

273
00:42:22,667 --> 00:42:25,594
Tell him I'm busy.

274
00:42:26,458 --> 00:42:31,175
He said that if he doesn't see you
he won't let me take the exam.

275
00:42:54,458 --> 00:42:58,381
Take the first right and then
the second street on your left.

276
00:49:10,792 --> 00:49:13,008
The electricity at my place got cut off.

277
00:49:13,167 --> 00:49:15,881
Can I charge my phone here?

278
00:49:34,542 --> 00:49:36,509
Don't look at your watch the client

279
00:49:36,667 --> 00:49:38,255
postponed the appointment.

280
00:49:38,417 --> 00:49:40,502
And you don't have a cell phone.

281
00:49:40,667 --> 00:49:43,168
You should know that
we've showed her the car already.

282
00:49:43,333 --> 00:49:45,301
But she's still not convinced.

283
00:49:45,458 --> 00:49:49,760
Be careful, she's got a dirty mouth
especially when it comes to men.

284
00:49:49,917 --> 00:49:51,422
Do you know her?

285
00:49:51,583 --> 00:49:53,302
She might become my mother-in-law.

286
00:49:53,458 --> 00:49:57,417
But don't mention it.
She doesn't know yet the showroom is ours.

287
00:49:58,375 --> 00:49:59,631
Why?

288
00:49:59,792 --> 00:50:03,003
I don't want her to get greedy.

289
00:50:04,083 --> 00:50:05,672
So which car does she want to buy.

290
00:50:05,833 --> 00:50:07,125
The Toyota Jeep.

291
00:50:07,292 --> 00:50:10,254
And which car would you like her to buy?
- The Range Rover.

292
00:50:11,042 --> 00:50:13,175
So how is this car?

293
00:50:14,375 --> 00:50:16,544
It's your call ma'am.

294
00:50:16,708 --> 00:50:20,797
But if you want to hear my honest opinion,
I recommend the Range Rover.

295
00:50:20,958 --> 00:50:22,250
Why's that?

296
00:50:22,417 --> 00:50:26,423
It's got more room,
it's true that it's two years older...

297
00:50:26,583 --> 00:50:30,293
but I guarantee you that in three years
you wouldn't have to change a single part.

298
00:50:30,458 --> 00:50:32,296
I want the Range.

299
00:50:33,542 --> 00:50:35,794
And how's this car when
it comes to steep roads.

300
00:50:35,958 --> 00:50:38,885
It's a fine.

301
00:50:39,042 --> 00:50:42,502
But the options the Range Rover has
are better for all roads.

302
00:50:42,667 --> 00:50:47,711
Whether you drive around town or outside,
off-road, hills, mountains.

303
00:50:49,167 --> 00:50:51,549
Slow down ma'am.

304
00:50:52,042 --> 00:50:54,720
Slowly. - Okay.

305
00:50:54,875 --> 00:50:58,715
By the way, the Range Rover
has lights on the outside mirrors.

306
00:50:58,875 --> 00:51:04,339
When a car gets too close
the lights turn red with an alarm tone.

307
00:51:05,375 --> 00:51:09,084
So you drive in full control and vision.

308
00:51:09,833 --> 00:51:14,669
Also ma'am, here you'd have buttons
to control almost everything in the car.

309
00:51:14,875 --> 00:51:20,671
Stereo levels, the dvd player,
speed and cruise control.

310
00:51:21,458 --> 00:51:24,220
Are you talking about this car
or the Range Rover?

311
00:51:24,375 --> 00:51:25,584
To be clear with you ma'am,

312
00:51:25,750 --> 00:51:27,718
that Range Rover was ordered specifically

313
00:51:27,875 --> 00:51:30,127
for a client that couldn't
fully pay its price.

314
00:51:30,292 --> 00:51:33,468
That's why it has all those
special additions

315
00:51:33,625 --> 00:51:36,303
that you won't find in any other car.

316
00:51:41,167 --> 00:51:43,798
Have you got any grandchildren ma'am.

317
00:51:43,958 --> 00:51:47,218
I'm sorry. The reason I asked was
to tell you about the special feature

318
00:51:47,375 --> 00:51:49,592
the Range Rover has that
no other car does.

319
00:51:49,750 --> 00:51:52,547
You can separate the front
seat from the back seat.

320
00:51:52,708 --> 00:51:56,003
With one click,
right from the steering over there.

321
00:51:56,167 --> 00:51:59,296
A glass barrier would appear here.

322
00:51:59,917 --> 00:52:03,211
You won't hear a single thing.

323
00:52:03,958 --> 00:52:07,419
And from over here ma'am
there's a sound recorder

324
00:52:07,583 --> 00:52:09,800
of whatever goes on in the back.

325
00:52:10,667 --> 00:52:14,969
Be careful ma'am... give me the phone.

326
00:52:30,792 --> 00:52:33,802
If you want to be with me
the way I want then fine...

327
00:52:33,958 --> 00:52:37,881
If not, stay at home with
your father the doctor.

328
00:52:43,958 --> 00:52:45,677
By the way ma'am, the mirror.

329
00:52:45,833 --> 00:52:49,342
When are you going to understand
that all men are the same?

330
00:52:49,708 --> 00:52:51,628
You just don't listen, do you?

331
00:52:51,792 --> 00:52:53,960
Now he wants you to do things his way.

332
00:52:54,333 --> 00:52:57,628
You've always been this stubborn.

333
00:52:57,792 --> 00:53:00,968
You deserve it...
Now he wants you to do things his way

334
00:53:01,125 --> 00:53:04,965
and if you want to stoop to
his level, it's your own fault.

335
00:53:05,125 --> 00:53:08,336
By the way, ma'am, the Range Rover
has a very special advantage.

336
00:53:08,500 --> 00:53:11,215
It's got this calm reaction,
you would hardly feel these

337
00:53:11,375 --> 00:53:13,094
small jumps we're feeling right now.

338
00:54:15,583 --> 00:54:19,839
Whose signature is this?

339
00:54:26,792 --> 00:54:31,793
When you don't go to school,
where do you go?

340
00:54:32,833 --> 00:54:36,128
I'm asking you.

341
00:54:39,375 --> 00:54:44,258
You were absent for 17 days.
Where do you go?

342
00:54:56,542 --> 00:54:58,627
Read.

343
00:55:11,750 --> 00:55:16,502
What's that? I can't hear you.

344
00:55:17,542 --> 00:55:20,043
She...

345
00:55:23,417 --> 00:55:27,968
makes the things...

346
00:57:50,542 --> 00:57:54,927
I'm sorry the cab broke down
and I couldn't give you a ride.

347
00:57:56,292 --> 00:57:59,551
Don't worry about it.

348
00:57:59,708 --> 00:58:02,968
I was having a bad day anyway.

349
00:58:03,125 --> 00:58:06,384
Why, what happened?

350
00:58:07,750 --> 00:58:09,835
My fiancé.

351
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:12,466
I've been trying for 3 months to tell him

352
00:58:12,625 --> 00:58:15,754
that it's not working out
and he's not getting it.

353
00:58:17,083 --> 00:58:20,841
Me too, I just got out
of a relationship that

354
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:24,709
has been suffocating me
for the past 5 years.

355
00:58:27,583 --> 00:58:30,713
Now seriously, isn't the engagement
period the time

356
00:58:30,875 --> 00:58:34,004
when you decide if someone
is right for you or not.

357
00:58:34,833 --> 00:58:37,381
Of course.

358
00:58:40,167 --> 00:58:42,086
I feel like there's something wrong.

359
00:58:42,250 --> 00:58:45,213
This isn't the person that
I want to spend my life with.

360
00:58:45,542 --> 00:58:46,751
Ever since we got engaged,

361
00:58:46,917 --> 00:58:50,211
I'm not allowed to go outwith
my girlfriends without his permission.

362
00:58:50,417 --> 00:58:56,302
I'm not allowed to talk to the neighbours
or even open the door if he isn't around.

363
00:58:57,833 --> 00:59:00,511
I'm sick of it.

364
00:59:07,167 --> 00:59:09,798
The best thing to do is to ignore him.

365
00:59:10,125 --> 00:59:12,342
Eventually he'll get it.

366
00:59:13,958 --> 00:59:15,049
I don't think so.

367
00:59:15,208 --> 00:59:18,254
I've been trying that for
the last 3 months.

368
00:59:28,458 --> 00:59:31,385
That's him knocking on the door.

369
00:59:32,792 --> 00:59:33,799
Who?

370
00:59:36,250 --> 00:59:37,376
My fiancé.

371
00:59:37,542 --> 00:59:40,339
Who else have I been talking about?

372
00:59:42,875 --> 00:59:45,506
What is he doing here?

373
00:59:45,667 --> 00:59:50,585
I told him a hundred times
not to come without calling first.

374
01:01:22,792 --> 01:01:27,710
Where is the extra electrical plug
you told me about?

375
01:04:23,792 --> 01:04:26,091
No, this is not Youssef.

376
01:04:26,250 --> 01:04:28,335
Who's this?

377
01:04:28,542 --> 01:04:32,844
Man, how many times did I tell you
not to give my number out?

378
01:04:33,000 --> 01:04:36,591
It's the accountant from the hospital.

379
01:04:37,458 --> 01:04:38,715
<i>Yes p</i>

380
01:04:39,917 --> 01:04:41,884
Yes, it's ready.

381
01:04:43,542 --> 01:04:46,836
Sorry for being a bit late.

382
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:50,299
So when does the cashier close?

383
01:04:51,375 --> 01:04:54,718
Don't worry, I'll be there before that.

384
01:04:56,583 --> 01:04:59,878
What do you mean I'll lose my appointment?

385
01:05:01,125 --> 01:05:04,918
I said I'll be there in a bit.

386
01:05:07,583 --> 01:05:11,293
Wow, you were able to get
500 Dinars that quickly!

387
01:05:12,167 --> 01:05:14,549
I sold a jeep for 120 thousand dinars.

388
01:05:14,750 --> 01:05:17,879
After it was sitting there
getting old for 6 months.

389
01:05:21,333 --> 01:05:24,296
I'm sure they'll take me back after this.

390
01:05:24,542 --> 01:05:26,710
I feel like things are getting better.

391
01:05:26,875 --> 01:05:28,676
I can feel it.

392
01:05:29,167 --> 01:05:30,589
That's good.

393
01:05:31,083 --> 01:05:33,466
How's Imad?

394
01:05:36,500 --> 01:05:39,215
Imad doesn't know how to read.

395
01:05:39,375 --> 01:05:43,713
So why don't you go see
Dalal and sort it out?

396
01:05:44,167 --> 01:05:49,381
Didn't you say a year ago that you
wouldn't really care if you see her.

397
01:05:51,208 --> 01:05:55,380
Or maybe you're afraid of getting weak
like you used to during college days.

398
01:05:56,917 --> 01:05:59,251
Enough man! It's been 5 years.

399
01:05:59,417 --> 01:06:01,633
After this surgery,
you should start a new life.

400
01:06:01,792 --> 01:06:04,126
Don't forget that you're still free.

401
01:06:04,292 --> 01:06:09,257
Unlike me. I've been married twice already
and not once did my heart skip a beat.

402
01:07:17,833 --> 01:07:20,879
Where have you been all this time?

403
01:07:21,042 --> 01:07:24,834
You don't want to buy a cell phone?

404
01:07:39,833 --> 01:07:42,927
Congratulations on the garden.

405
01:07:43,208 --> 01:07:46,503
It's really nice.

406
01:07:53,542 --> 01:07:58,009
Are you here to congratulate
me on the garden?

407
01:08:00,292 --> 01:08:05,257
No. I'm not here for that.

408
01:08:11,625 --> 01:08:14,173
Imad is...

409
01:08:30,167 --> 01:08:35,468
Yes, my love. No, he's still working
on it, but I told him.

410
01:08:37,625 --> 01:08:40,422
<i>He's playing.</i>

411
01:08:44,625 --> 01:08:47,091
<i>Imad's father is here.</i>

412
01:08:47,250 --> 01:08:48,921
<i>No, no. Don't worry I'm ready.</i>

413
01:08:49,083 --> 01:08:50,719
<i>The minute you get home we'll leave.</i>

414
01:08:50,875 --> 01:08:52,713
<i>OK, bye.</i>

415
01:09:21,042 --> 01:09:24,087
Imad wants a dog for
his birthday this year.

416
01:09:25,000 --> 01:09:26,884
Do you want share the cost?

417
01:09:28,375 --> 01:09:30,544
How much is it?

418
01:09:31,250 --> 01:09:32,672
500 dinars.

419
01:09:32,833 --> 01:09:36,176
What kind of a dog costs 500 dinars?

420
01:09:38,458 --> 01:09:40,924
That's the price,
do you want to help or not?

421
01:09:48,917 --> 01:09:50,920
I don't have the money.

422
01:09:51,208 --> 01:09:52,548
Of course, you don't.

423
01:09:52,708 --> 01:09:55,386
Dalal, don't talk to me like that.

424
01:10:34,875 --> 01:10:38,632
Do you have the time to raise the boy?

425
01:10:47,708 --> 01:10:49,628
Are you coming here
to place blame?

426
01:10:50,208 --> 01:10:52,294
Your son has failed 6 subjects.

427
01:10:52,458 --> 01:10:56,168
How many times have I said we should
put him in a private school...

428
01:10:56,333 --> 01:10:57,969
I've told you a thousand times,

429
01:10:58,125 --> 01:11:00,840
a stranger is not paying
for my son! Understood?

430
01:11:14,208 --> 01:11:17,717
As you like, you are free to decide.

431
01:11:21,208 --> 01:11:24,420
But if I ever hear that you took Imad

432
01:11:24,583 --> 01:11:28,044
to a single one of your poker games...

433
01:11:28,208 --> 01:11:31,089
it will be the last time you see him.

434
01:11:31,500 --> 01:11:36,300
Dalal, have you forgotten
how I bought you the apartment?

435
01:11:36,458 --> 01:11:39,006
And have you forgotten
how you lost everything?

436
01:11:39,167 --> 01:11:42,876
Dalal, I didn't come here
to get upset and fight.

437
01:11:45,208 --> 01:11:47,543
And I'm not here to blame anyone.

438
01:11:47,708 --> 01:11:52,592
My only concern now is my son's future.

439
01:12:04,458 --> 01:12:07,883
Are you okay? - It's nothing.

440
01:12:16,583 --> 01:12:19,298
What's this?

441
01:12:21,417 --> 01:12:26,086
This is the money I've been
saving for his university.

442
01:12:34,792 --> 01:12:38,300
Youssef, what's wrong? Sit down.

443
01:12:44,333 --> 01:12:46,834
Do you need a doctor? - No I don't

444
01:12:47,250 --> 01:12:48,720
No need.

445
01:12:49,625 --> 01:12:52,505
Tomorrow, I have a small surgery.

446
01:12:52,667 --> 01:12:56,045
Why didn't you say anything?

447
01:12:58,958 --> 01:13:02,585
Put him in a private school nearby.

448
01:13:03,792 --> 01:13:08,378
With the money left,
hire a private teacher.

449
01:13:09,458 --> 01:13:12,836
To teach him how to read
so he can go to high school.

450
01:14:46,667 --> 01:14:47,923
Here is 200 dinars.

451
01:14:48,083 --> 01:14:50,584
And these are the 300 dinars
of fines from last year.

452
01:14:50,750 --> 01:14:53,713
Now we're even.

453
01:18:19,900 --> 01:18:23,627
<i>The youth of Egypt, are very precise</i>

454
01:18:23,792 --> 01:18:29,136
<i>and the country depends
on them to make its future</i>

455
01:18:29,292 --> 01:18:34,924
<i>and not accepting to be infiltrated
with those who seek to spread chaos</i>

456
01:18:37,083 --> 01:18:41,634
<i>looting public
and private property, arson</i>

457
01:18:41,792 --> 01:18:46,010
<i>and causing destruction
of the country.</i>

458
01:18:46,167 --> 01:18:50,552
<i>My conviction is unshakable,
to continue</i>

459
01:18:50,708 --> 01:18:56,469
<i>with the political, social
and economical reformation</i>

460
01:18:56,625 --> 01:18:59,801
<i>for a better Egyptian society</i>

461
01:18:59,958 --> 01:19:04,968
<i>free and democratic society,
embracing the best values.</i>

462
01:19:06,125 --> 01:19:11,470
<i>I took the side of the
poor people in our country</i>

463
01:19:11,625 --> 01:19:16,129
<i>convinced that the economy is the largest</i>

464
01:19:16,292 --> 01:19:21,424
<i>and most dangerous to be left
to economists only</i>

465
01:19:21,583 --> 01:19:25,008
<i>and was keen to set into action</i>

466
01:19:25,167 --> 01:19:30,050
<i>the government's policies
of economic reform.</i>

467
01:24:54,208 --> 01:24:57,089
Hi, my son.. how are you?

468
01:24:58,125 --> 01:25:01,005
No... it's not my number.

469
01:25:01,333 --> 01:25:04,676
It doesn't matter now whose number it is.

470
01:25:05,542 --> 01:25:08,422
Did you study?

471
01:25:10,333 --> 01:25:13,379
What time is your exam?

472
01:25:19,625 --> 01:25:23,085
I'm traveling, my son, as I told you.

473
01:25:26,458 --> 01:25:29,718
I need you to take care of yourself.

474
01:25:30,958 --> 01:25:33,755
And your mother, of course.

475
01:25:35,333 --> 01:25:39,589
Don't make any trouble for her...
listen to her - every word she says.

476
01:25:40,500 --> 01:25:44,376
Otherwise I'll be upset with you.
