1
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:24,280
In the name of the Father,
the Son and the Holy Spirit.

2
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:25,960
Amen.

3
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:33,320
We are gathered here
in memory of...

4
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:38,560
Jacqueline Jeantina Eugenia
Gerarda Wittenberg-Willemen.

5
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:41,959
Widow of Willem Cornelis Wittenberg.

6
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:47,248
A memory of an intensely involved
and caring person...

7
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:51,404
and to an almost
incomprehensible event.

8
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:53,200
A murder.

9
00:02:04,395 --> 00:02:08,520
Mr Louwes, what
do you expect from today?

10
00:02:09,320 --> 00:02:10,320
Sure.

11
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:17,680
- What do you expect from the verdict?
- Do you still believe in it?

12
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:20,160
Mr Louwes, are you nervous?

13
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:24,600
Mr Louwes.

14
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:29,520
- What will you hear today?
- Eh, acquittal of course.

15
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:33,600
I still can't believe it.
- No.

16
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:36,040
She was such a sweet person. -Yes.

17
00:02:39,166 --> 00:02:44,200
- Michael must be having a hard time.
- Yes, she was like a mother to him.

18
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:48,000
Ladies and gentlemen, the court.

19
00:02:56,880 --> 00:03:01,720
Then you ask yourself: are the police
doing anything? I live opposite her.

20
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:05,960
No one has been at the door.
- The family also doesn't know anything.

21
00:03:06,559 --> 00:03:10,137
She was killed on Thursday and
they didn't find her until Saturday.

22
00:03:10,262 --> 00:03:11,582
In the living room.

23
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:16,520
The court finds proven...

24
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:22,240
that the accused intentionally and
premeditatedly assaulted the victim...

25
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:26,040
No, I haven't, ma'am.
- Let me finish.

26
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:28,117
...deprived of life.

27
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:29,600
Sorry for your loss.

28
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:36,720
- My condolences to you too...
- We are friends of the family.

29
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:43,320
Who was that?

30
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:47,960
Jaqueline's
financial advisor, Louwes.

31
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:54,880
The verdict therefore reads: the court
maintains, with improvement of grounds..

32
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:59,560
the judgment of the Court of Appeal
in Arnhem of 22 December 2000.

33
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:02,280
The court orders the arrest of
the accused.

34
00:04:02,399 --> 00:04:06,239
You just continue with all the
falsified arguments of the police.

35
00:04:06,367 --> 00:04:07,719
Mister Louwes...

36
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,469
You wipe everything away.

37
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:15,120
I understand your emotion,
but I haven't finished speaking yet.

38
00:04:15,357 --> 00:04:21,333
You have two weeks to appeal to
the Supreme Court of the Netherlands.

39
00:04:21,520 --> 00:04:24,680
- You know you are wrong.
- Are you coming with me?

40
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:28,720
No, I'm not coming. No, I'm going...

41
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:30,040
I'm not going. Damn.

42
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:34,040
The photos and the cameras
are now stopped.

43
00:04:38,749 --> 00:04:42,140
The Judgement

44
00:04:45,359 --> 00:04:47,636
2 years earlier

45
00:04:50,838 --> 00:04:53,520
Yes, but could you please
put me through?

46
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:58,041
How so? I didn't come up with it.

47
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:02,000
I'm just stating the facts.
The facts, yes.

48
00:05:03,942 --> 00:05:06,600
Haan, could it be a little quieter?

49
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:13,152
How do I get that information?
I'm not going to tell you that

50
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:16,161
Never heard of source protection?

51
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:17,960
Hello?

52
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:19,280
Hello?

53
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:23,920
Dicknose

54
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:31,680
- Did you catch that guy yet?
- No, the same all the time.

55
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:34,280
I ask for comments,
they tell me how I got that information.

56
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:38,000
I can't say that and so on.
They don't even put me through.

57
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:40,240
- And your source has nothing on paper?
- No.

58
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:43,240
Do you like soup? -No thanks.

59
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:45,480
Bas, do you like soup? -Delicious.

60
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:49,640
Maybe a colleague can confirm? -Hey.

61
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:53,903
Do you really think he will be
Prime Minister?

62
00:05:54,552 --> 00:05:56,825
I'd be surprised if he doesn't.

63
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:00,482
But with whom can he form a coalition?

64
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:03,779
Melkert and Dijkstal can
drink his blood.

65
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:07,646
Rosenmöller and De Graaf
cannot sell it to their supporters.

66
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:12,800
- Balkenende?
- Yes, the CDA would be an option.

67
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:17,000
And what do you think, Bas?

68
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:22,240
Bizarre.

69
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:23,560
What?

70
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:26,640
Do you have something nice for me?

71
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:38,901
Who are those people,
that Waisvisz couple?

72
00:06:38,995 --> 00:06:40,240
Involved citizens.

73
00:06:40,638 --> 00:06:45,400
That attorney will file a review request
based on their investigation.

74
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:46,887
They are handwriting experts.

75
00:06:46,938 --> 00:06:49,617
They work a lot for the judiciary,
but they do this themselves.

76
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:52,400
Yes.
And now you want...

77
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:56,120
Find out if it's correct.
If it is true...

78
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:58,680
If that knife cannot
be the murder weapon

79
00:06:58,984 --> 00:07:00,800
then L. is
innocently imprisoned.

80
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:03,640
Yes, but that story
is already in Trouw.

81
00:07:03,774 --> 00:07:05,160
Do you hear anything?

82
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:07,786
Have you read
anything else about it?

83
00:07:07,836 --> 00:07:09,349
Apparently it wasn't picked up.

84
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:11,714
Because everyone is
busy with those polls.

85
00:07:11,780 --> 00:07:14,896
If true, someone
innocent is incarcerated.

86
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,546
- You already said that.
- Yes, but...

87
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:19,080
It is well. It's okay.

88
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:21,960
You may.

89
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:33,320
According to Maurice de Hond,
the LPF will be the largest...

90
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:35,360
in the parliamentary elections.

91
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:41,400
<i>Our question today: is Pim Fortuyn a
good prime minister? Good afternoon...</i>

92
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:43,840
- Good day.
- Hello, Ed Waisvisz.

93
00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:45,960
- I'm Wanda.
- Bas Haan.

94
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:52,720
See what you can do with it.
Our report is on top.

95
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:03,960
This is from the criminal file.
How did you get that?

96
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:07,569
Van Louwes' lawyer.
We are working with him now.

97
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:11,560
Do you also have this digitally?
- Uh-uh.

98
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:14,400
We are not into modern frills.

99
00:08:16,280 --> 00:08:19,600
Can I copy it and show it
to someone else?

100
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:22,600
Okay.

101
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:27,600
And...

102
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:32,320
There was also another suspect.

103
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:37,440
Michaël de Jong, the widow's handyman.
He lied about his alibi.

104
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:40,080
And he had knowledge about the
perpetrator.

105
00:08:40,457 --> 00:08:45,600
He knew the body was in the living room
and told people that...

106
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:47,440
at her own funeral.

107
00:08:56,440 --> 00:09:00,640
He's building a case
against the suspect...

108
00:09:00,760 --> 00:09:04,280
which he eventually brings to court.

109
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:10,345
Yet the public prosecutor is not a
crime fighter, as in American films.

110
00:09:11,564 --> 00:09:15,480
In the Dutch legal system,
the Public Prosecution Service is…

111
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:18,760
unlike in most neighboring countries...

112
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:22,360
both truth finder and crook catcher.

113
00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:28,040
Ladies and gentlemen,
in the back someone has just joined us.

114
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:32,720
Network Editor, Bas Haan.
Specialized in our rule of law.

115
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:36,800
And not so very long ago student,
as yourself.

116
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:44,640
- Hey, Bas.
- Peter.

117
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:48,287
What did you bring again?

118
00:09:48,337 --> 00:09:51,390
I'm not saying anything,
you have to look at it cleanly.

119
00:09:52,506 --> 00:09:55,480
It's a box,
that's as far as I dare go.

120
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:57,600
That's why I always ask you.

121
00:10:10,672 --> 00:10:12,160
You don't believe that, do you?

122
00:10:12,250 --> 00:10:13,293
Look here.

123
00:10:13,344 --> 00:10:18,040
Short time after the robbery
and at a short distance from the house.

124
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:22,640
In fact, three days later
and a mile away.

125
00:10:22,760 --> 00:10:26,600
The knife is not properly secured,
has been in the rain for days...

126
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:30,720
and is linked to Louwes
via a very dubious odor test.

127
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:34,520
In addition, the blade does not
match the depth of the stab wounds.

128
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:38,240
In nine sentences they explained in
Arnhem why Louwes is the perpetrator.

129
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:41,194
And everything is
linked to that knife.

130
00:10:41,244 --> 00:10:42,400
And that telephone tower.

131
00:10:42,520 --> 00:10:46,055
- I'm going after that too.
- And the other suspect?

132
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:49,840
- The handyman?
- Yes, are you going after that?

133
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:51,000
No

134
00:10:51,640 --> 00:10:54,000
But that's a suspect, right?

135
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:57,960
We shouldn't play judge

136
00:10:58,374 --> 00:11:01,960
let alone make some
handyman a suspect.

137
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:08,840
Louwes has been convicted.
There is a verdict. I can test that.

138
00:11:08,959 --> 00:11:10,742
If that doesn't work,
we can say something

139
00:11:10,792 --> 00:11:12,559
about the way the
justice system works.

140
00:11:12,680 --> 00:11:15,440
Hmm, okay. How long do you need?

141
00:11:15,560 --> 00:11:19,055
Come on, broadcast schedule, budget...
How long?

142
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:23,480
Fortuyn was shot.

143
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:28,880
He's laying back here, neatly dressed.

144
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:33,960
<i>He's been shot in the head
and he's laying with his feet crossed...</i>

145
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:37,480
<i>He dropped to his knees
and fell backwards.</i>

146
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:39,640
- Where is it?
- That's here.

147
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:42,280
<i>A parking space at 3FM. No idea who...</i>

148
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:48,275
<i>I meet upset employees of Ruud de Wild..
They are shaken...</i>

149
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:10,240
- Bas Haan.
- Ernest Louwes.

150
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:14,712
- Thank you for welcoming me.
- Wanda said you can be trusted.

151
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:17,440
Hopefully Wanda is too.

152
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:37,600
The third house from the right.

153
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:39,000
I live there.

154
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:46,760
- Your house is opposite?
- With that green door.

155
00:12:52,760 --> 00:12:53,960
Bizarre.

156
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:06,240
Among the items I received from
Mrs. Waisvisz was this.

157
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:12,080
That's my diary.
Yes, I typed everything out.

158
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:16,280
- Could I read it?
- Yes of course.

159
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:19,480
You have to if you believe in my cause.

160
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:25,080
Everything is in there. I wrote
everything down, from the beginning.

161
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:29,480
Good.

162
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:32,400
I want to start with the court's
assessment of the facts.

163
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:34,245
The most important
evidence piece: the knife

164
00:13:34,295 --> 00:13:36,480
has already been disproved
by the Waisvisz family.

165
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:38,320
- That leaves...
- The telephone tower.

166
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:42,040
Yes.
Can you tell me more about that?

167
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:13,600
Louwes says he was at Het Harde
when he called Mrs Wittenberg.

168
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:15,920
Thirty kilometers from Deventer.

169
00:14:16,280 --> 00:14:18,680
He was with her that morning.

170
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:22,040
She asked how much she could donate
to the church tax-free.

171
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:25,400
He reported that from the car
at 8:36 pm that evening.

172
00:14:25,880 --> 00:14:27,400
In 16 seconds?

173
00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:33,800
With Ernest. You wanted to know how
much you could donate. 1750 guilders.

174
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:38,600
Yes, 1750.
Sorry, I'm in the car, so I'll be brief.

175
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:41,320
Yes. See you soon.

176
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:42,640
14 seconds.

177
00:14:43,880 --> 00:14:46,480
- No.
- Come on, Rein. It's possible right?

178
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:48,920
No one believes that
the knife is the weapon.

179
00:14:49,023 --> 00:14:52,000
It is possible, but it
doesn't have to.

180
00:14:52,279 --> 00:14:56,146
That telephone mast is almost
in that woman's backyard.

181
00:14:56,286 --> 00:14:57,429
How do you explain that?

182
00:14:57,480 --> 00:14:59,360
Increased radio propagation.

183
00:14:59,960 --> 00:15:02,200
- Increased what?
- Radio propagation.

184
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:05,840
Sometimes a signal drifts.
I spoke to an expert...

185
00:15:05,960 --> 00:15:07,920
It's okay, Bas.

186
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:24,880
- Coffee?
- Please.

187
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:43,040
You have never seen this?

188
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,000
Nee.

189
00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:48,240
Here it is.

190
00:15:57,680 --> 00:16:00,741
The police in Deventer
questioned me about

191
00:16:00,791 --> 00:16:03,080
the smell identification
test of the knife.

192
00:16:03,476 --> 00:16:06,280
They asked me for a kind of
second opinion.

193
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:12,360
And I then indicated by letter what was
unclear about the test execution.

194
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:14,304
Don't look into the camera

195
00:16:14,354 --> 00:16:16,680
and try to incorporate the questions
into your answers.

196
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:20,000
First the smell test and then
point by point.

197
00:16:20,120 --> 00:16:24,120
But in court you stated that you found
the smell test strong evidence.

198
00:16:24,840 --> 00:16:29,600
Yes, because the reports
I saw then were in order.

199
00:16:31,095 --> 00:16:32,880
- Ready?
- Er, yes.

200
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:36,280
It looks like they used that letter...

201
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:40,320
to improve the original reports.

202
00:16:41,320 --> 00:16:43,480
- Did they cheat?
- Yes.

203
00:16:45,519 --> 00:16:48,979
Mister van Koppen, as an expert in the
field of miscarriages of justice

204
00:16:49,198 --> 00:16:53,160
how do you view
the conviction of Ernest L.?

205
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:58,520
If you put the reports side by side,
the numbers don't match.

206
00:16:58,640 --> 00:17:02,880
There are weird dates.
Subsequent reports were drawn up.

207
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:06,304
<i>It is unclear where
the knife was kept and stored.</i>

208
00:17:06,354 --> 00:17:08,920
<i>And then you are not
allowed to do a sorting test.</i>

209
00:17:09,840 --> 00:17:15,160
<i>Dog handlers are expected
to check this. That didn't happen.</i>

210
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:16,600
Nice.

211
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:21,120
Just a voice-over and the presentation
text for Aart and we're good to go.

212
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:26,880
Good job, Haan.
This is going to cause quite a stir.

213
00:17:45,884 --> 00:17:51,766
Ernest L. was sentenced to 12 years in
prison for murder in Deventer.

214
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:55,320
It now appears with
very questionable evidence.

215
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:57,329
After his conviction on appeal

216
00:17:57,379 --> 00:17:59,520
an independent agency conducted
an investigation...

217
00:17:59,669 --> 00:18:03,629
and came with damning conclusions about…

218
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:17,280
If the bookkeeper didn't do it,
then who did?

219
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:19,680
Didn't that widow have a butler?

220
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:21,960
Ah, there he is. Louwes?

221
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:25,000
Louwes? Mister Louwes?

222
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:32,960
Are you happy that your
case is being reviewed?

223
00:18:40,680 --> 00:18:46,280
Come on. Watch your head.
Watch out guys. Watch out, watch out.

224
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:48,400
Watch your fingers.

225
00:18:48,520 --> 00:18:51,920
Bas, what are you doing man?

226
00:18:56,280 --> 00:18:58,640
Goddamn.

227
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,480
Here it is.

228
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:23,400
Papa.

229
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:26,680
Hey honey.

230
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:30,320
- I missed you so much.
- Oh, baby.

231
00:19:30,440 --> 00:19:33,366
Oh, honey, how
glad I am to see you.

232
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:35,920
Oh, honey. You're out, honey.

233
00:19:36,040 --> 00:19:39,680
- Honey. We won.
- Ernest.

234
00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:43,520
- I'll see you later.
- Yes, I'll see you later.

235
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:45,880
Bye, honey.

236
00:20:01,560 --> 00:20:02,920
Sorry.

237
00:20:04,760 --> 00:20:09,040
A deal is a deal.
You have every right to the scoop.

238
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:12,400
I wouldn't be here without you.

239
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:47,603
How did you pass the time,
those three years?

240
00:20:48,627 --> 00:20:54,495
It was fine at first, but I haven't done
anything in the last few months.

241
00:20:55,800 --> 00:20:57,916
Also unable to do anything.

242
00:20:58,560 --> 00:21:02,480
- One, close.
- Attention, title Louwes.

243
00:21:02,600 --> 00:21:05,200
<i>I wrote a little, I read a lot.</i>

244
00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:10,088
<i>But at some point that
doesn't work anymore.</i>

245
00:21:10,138 --> 00:21:12,229
<i>Interesting, I would expect it the
other way around</i>

246
00:21:12,280 --> 00:21:16,800
<i>At first you think: I'm innocent,
I'll never get out of here, but...</i>

247
00:21:16,920 --> 00:21:20,630
<i>Well, I've always believed it would
turn out alright.</i>

248
00:21:21,040 --> 00:21:23,654
That might sound strange
considering it took that long

249
00:21:24,159 --> 00:21:27,000
but I've always believed that.

250
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:33,156
Perhaps a strange thought, because it
isn't my fault, but someone else's.

251
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:37,440
And that I happen to be
sitting here today.

252
00:21:57,567 --> 00:21:59,800
- Enjoy your meal.
- Thank you.

253
00:22:10,600 --> 00:22:11,600
Thank you.

254
00:22:16,560 --> 00:22:17,560
Proud?

255
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:22,440
Don't act like you don't understand me,
asshole.

256
00:22:34,052 --> 00:22:35,411
First day of review

257
00:23:04,680 --> 00:23:05,680
Good luck.

258
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:22,480
Ladies and gentlemen, the court.

259
00:23:36,913 --> 00:23:38,320
Welcome, ladies and gentlemen.

260
00:23:38,393 --> 00:23:39,600
You can sit down.

261
00:23:44,624 --> 00:23:48,360
Mr. Louwes, we are here to
review your case.

262
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:53,097
A case that is now known in the media
as the Deventer murder case.

263
00:23:53,734 --> 00:23:59,717
After the knife evidence fell apart,
supporting evidence also lost its power.

264
00:24:00,520 --> 00:24:04,988
Like the telephone conversation via the
mobile phone mast in Deventer...

265
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:10,184
that made probable that the suspect was
in Deventer around the murder.

266
00:24:10,560 --> 00:24:15,720
The court in Arnhem could therefore not
have come to proven statement...

267
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:17,840
on the present evidence.

268
00:24:17,960 --> 00:24:23,168
Also not if the evidence is considered
in conjunction with other clues.

269
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:28,640
However, another NFI report came to my
attention this morning.

270
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:32,467
And it concerns the
result of a DNA test.

271
00:24:33,320 --> 00:24:35,000
This research shows...

272
00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:40,480
that Mr. Louwes' DNA was found
on the victim's clothing.

273
00:24:40,600 --> 00:24:45,280
Namely on the blouse Mrs. Wittenberg
was wearing when she was murdered.

274
00:24:46,006 --> 00:24:50,840
I can't say exactly what the situation
is with the DNA. I just received it.

275
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:54,412
And I still have to dig into
its consequences.

276
00:24:58,680 --> 00:25:00,327
New DNA Evidence?

277
00:25:00,377 --> 00:25:02,240
The details will come
the next session day.

278
00:25:02,360 --> 00:25:04,280
In a month and a half.

279
00:25:04,330 --> 00:25:07,400
That interview with
Louwes at home is tonight.

280
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:09,729
Louwes visited the widow
on the morning of the murder

281
00:25:09,779 --> 00:25:11,229
the OM knows that.

282
00:25:11,280 --> 00:25:15,480
If he put a hand on her shoulder,
there's already DNA.

283
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:17,840
- So just broadcast?
- Sure.

284
00:25:17,960 --> 00:25:20,146
The interview is only about
Louwes' experience

285
00:25:20,196 --> 00:25:21,960
what it is like to be free again.

286
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:25,880
- Really very touching.
- I'll get the tissues ready.

287
00:25:39,920 --> 00:25:44,920
<i>Today the revision case against
Ernest Louwes started in Den Bosch.</i>

288
00:25:45,040 --> 00:25:49,640
<i>Before the trial started, we spoke with
Louwes about this special case...</i>

289
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:54,320
<i>and his bizarre years in prison.
Bas Haan reports.</i>

290
00:25:54,446 --> 00:25:56,188
<i>You are free, of course</i>

291
00:25:56,499 --> 00:26:02,054
<i>But your life has basically
become miserable.</i>

292
00:26:02,800 --> 00:26:06,520
<i>And that often feels very awful.</i>

293
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:08,108
Mich?

294
00:26:09,320 --> 00:26:11,720
<i>And that is sometimes difficult.</i>

295
00:26:12,760 --> 00:26:16,680
Mich, come. Louwes is on TV.

296
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:24,886
<i>It would be best if the perpetrator
is quickly arrested.</i>

297
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:28,331
<i>So everyone knows I have
nothing to do with it.</i>

298
00:26:28,800 --> 00:26:33,920
<i>Of course that would be the...
the most, most beautiful thing.</i>

299
00:26:34,040 --> 00:26:36,314
That man gives me the creeps.

300
00:26:45,280 --> 00:26:49,040
I would very much
like to have that, yes.

301
00:26:51,680 --> 00:26:54,800
Okay, then we'll talk about that.

302
00:26:57,840 --> 00:27:00,440
- Yes.
- Peter R. de Vries.

303
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:11,160
Um, oh no, sorry. I'll call you
back in a minute.

304
00:27:19,160 --> 00:27:22,253
- What's that?
- A fax from Peter R. de Vries.

305
00:27:23,160 --> 00:27:28,120
He also watched last night.
And how annoyed he got...

306
00:27:29,136 --> 00:27:31,768
that I didn't mention

307
00:27:32,278 --> 00:27:35,003
the pretty spectacular news...

308
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:39,840
that Louwes' DNA was found
on the blouse of the widow.

309
00:27:41,232 --> 00:27:45,849
Yes, he's right, isn't he?
You didn't report it, did you?

310
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:49,200
Vanity, Bas.

311
00:27:57,520 --> 00:27:58,520
Fuck.

312
00:28:02,137 --> 00:28:05,520
We found DNA from Mr. Louwes...

313
00:28:05,640 --> 00:28:10,560
in places that correspond with
how the victim was killed.

314
00:28:10,680 --> 00:28:15,760
Mrs. Wittenberg was not only stabbed,
but also strangled.

315
00:28:20,600 --> 00:28:26,560
It involves material near the
broken ribs. The killer used force.

316
00:28:26,680 --> 00:28:29,999
And these red-pink spots

317
00:28:30,049 --> 00:28:32,828
eventually turned out to be
facial foundation.

318
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:38,705
Which was reasonably spread by the
killer during the strangling.

319
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:43,285
Apart from these contact traces

320
00:28:43,627 --> 00:28:48,080
we also found this
stain in the collar...

321
00:28:49,160 --> 00:28:52,840
with the DNA of Mr. Louwes.
And this is blood.

322
00:28:56,480 --> 00:28:59,720
Except that it takes liquid blood...

323
00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:05,276
we cannot determine with 100%
certainty how that blood got there.

324
00:29:05,981 --> 00:29:09,073
But all these traces support
the hypothesis that

325
00:29:09,123 --> 00:29:12,426
the DNA was transferred
during the crime.

326
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:18,120
And again: all this DNA
comes from Mr. Louwes.

327
00:30:00,520 --> 00:30:04,840
Mr. Louwes.
Are you nervous for today?

328
00:30:10,160 --> 00:30:15,026
Mr Louwes, are you nervous?
What do you expect from the verdict?

329
00:30:19,957 --> 00:30:20,989
Mr Louwes,

330
00:30:21,246 --> 00:30:23,013
what are you
going to hear today?

331
00:30:23,098 --> 00:30:25,799
Er, acquittal of course.

332
00:30:25,920 --> 00:30:27,560
Are you sure?

333
00:30:29,090 --> 00:30:33,800
Yes. Yeah, I've always assumed that,
so uh... that's for sure, yes.

334
00:30:34,246 --> 00:30:37,960
Yet last week the judiciary
made many people doubt.

335
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:41,120
You would be a top actor
who makes everything up.

336
00:30:41,880 --> 00:30:45,872
Yes, but well, the only top actor
is the OM itself.

337
00:30:46,600 --> 00:30:50,960
They did get me convicted once, so...

338
00:30:51,380 --> 00:30:54,840
What if
the verdict today reads: guilty?

339
00:30:55,280 --> 00:30:56,880
But it's not like that.

340
00:30:59,520 --> 00:31:02,080
I have to go. Will I see you later?

341
00:31:10,520 --> 00:31:14,080
This means that the court finds proven..

342
00:31:14,200 --> 00:31:19,720
that the accused intentionally and
premeditatedly assaulted the victim...

343
00:31:20,120 --> 00:31:24,000
- I haven't, ma'am.
- Let me finish.

344
00:31:24,377 --> 00:31:29,160
...deprived of life. The court orders
the arrest of the accused.

345
00:31:29,280 --> 00:31:31,760
- No no no.
- The ruling...

346
00:31:31,880 --> 00:31:35,640
<i>- I'm not getting picked up again.
- The court rules...</i>

347
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:39,360
The court maintains,
under improvement of grounds...

348
00:31:39,480 --> 00:31:43,880
the judgment of the Court of Appeal
in Arnhem of 22 December 2000.

349
00:31:43,995 --> 00:31:45,920
The court orders imprisonment.

350
00:31:46,040 --> 00:31:50,640
You just continue with all the
falsified arguments of the police.

351
00:31:50,760 --> 00:31:54,080
You just wipe everything away.

352
00:31:54,200 --> 00:31:56,000
You are wiping everything away.

353
00:31:56,120 --> 00:31:59,320
I understand your emotion,
but I haven't finished speaking yet.

354
00:31:59,564 --> 00:32:02,118
If you disagree with the ruling

355
00:32:02,399 --> 00:32:05,853
you have two weeks to appeal to the
Supreme Court of the Netherlands.

356
00:32:06,200 --> 00:32:09,320
<i>- You know you are wrong.
- Are you coming with me?</i>

357
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:13,360
<i>No, I'm not coming. No, I'm going...</i>

358
00:32:14,280 --> 00:32:16,960
I'm not... Damn it.

359
00:32:17,080 --> 00:32:19,000
The cameras are now…

360
00:32:20,360 --> 00:32:23,520
<i>The photos and the cameras
are now stopped.</i>

361
00:33:03,320 --> 00:33:08,120
You can't just act that.
Right, Bas?

362
00:33:08,921 --> 00:33:11,480
Oh come on, man.
You have eyes in your head, right?

363
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:14,480
He didn't do it,
can't you feel it?

364
00:33:14,669 --> 00:33:17,731
His blood was in the collar,
but we feel he didn't do it.

365
00:33:17,781 --> 00:33:19,069
This was the news, good evening.

366
00:33:19,120 --> 00:33:20,520
Come on.

367
00:33:22,080 --> 00:33:26,360
So, folks. You know there's a
broadcast tonight, right?

368
00:33:29,080 --> 00:33:30,640
See you later.

369
00:33:35,760 --> 00:33:36,840
So...

370
00:33:38,080 --> 00:33:39,400
No acquittal.

371
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:42,880
That's too bad.

372
00:33:44,200 --> 00:33:47,040
- Better luck next time.
- What do you mean?

373
00:33:47,680 --> 00:33:49,960
- Well, it's done.
- Finished?

374
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:53,560
I think someone just said that the
blood in the collar can't be ignored.

375
00:33:54,376 --> 00:33:56,960
Rein only said that
a feeling isn't news.

376
00:33:57,080 --> 00:33:59,520
Well, we can't go on feeling.

377
00:33:59,845 --> 00:34:02,720
Whoa, wait. There are still
plenty of questions, aren't there?

378
00:34:02,840 --> 00:34:04,560
- Real questions.
- Bas...

379
00:34:04,680 --> 00:34:06,786
One: they tampered
with the evidence before

380
00:34:06,836 --> 00:34:08,840
with the reporting
on the knife earlier

381
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:12,880
And that blouse was
administratively lost for a while.

382
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:17,280
Two: there is no DNA from Louwes
under the nails of the widow.

383
00:34:17,400 --> 00:34:21,880
While Knoops rightly argued that
this would be the case in a struggle.

384
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:23,908
Three: new facts have come to light.

385
00:34:23,958 --> 00:34:27,800
But nobody knows enough about
DNA to judge them.

386
00:34:27,920 --> 00:34:30,400
- Bas...
- It's our job as journalists...

387
00:34:30,520 --> 00:34:35,320
It's my job to make a
whole program every night.

388
00:34:35,880 --> 00:34:40,960
I can't allow more time and budget with
those facts and the conviction.

389
00:34:41,080 --> 00:34:42,960
I can't justify it!

390
00:34:43,240 --> 00:34:45,480
Management won't have it.

391
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:49,000
Until new developments come around,
Deventer is on the back burner.

392
00:34:49,767 --> 00:34:54,080
- There is also other news.
- You mean that stranded sperm whale.

393
00:34:54,200 --> 00:34:58,680
Bas... Take off the afternoon.
Cool down.

394
00:34:59,800 --> 00:35:01,776
But after that it's over.

395
00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:03,550
Finished.

396
00:35:06,440 --> 00:35:07,840
Boy oh boy.

397
00:36:54,240 --> 00:36:55,800
Evelien?

398
00:36:56,200 --> 00:36:57,200
Bas.

399
00:36:58,280 --> 00:37:00,240
Glad you wanted to come.

400
00:37:01,360 --> 00:37:04,760
Yeah, I didn't know
it was so public here.

401
00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:08,080
Top criminals also meet
in roadside restaurants.

402
00:37:09,480 --> 00:37:13,581
Don't worry, I'm not going to
ask any difficult questions.

403
00:37:14,040 --> 00:37:15,571
I just wanted to know
more about that

404
00:37:15,622 --> 00:37:18,040
DNA course you followed
at the Justice Department.

405
00:37:18,160 --> 00:37:19,800
They don't invite me.

406
00:37:20,720 --> 00:37:24,640
If I tell everything I heard,
I'll violate my duty of confidentiality.

407
00:37:25,470 --> 00:37:29,760
But isn't it a general course,
the use of DNA in criminal cases?

408
00:37:29,880 --> 00:37:33,840
- Would you like to order something?
- A regular coffee, please.

409
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:35,280
A cappuccino.

410
00:37:40,440 --> 00:37:44,360
- I want absolute anonymity.
- I guarantee it.

411
00:37:44,928 --> 00:37:47,603
No one will ever find out
that you talked to me

412
00:37:48,114 --> 00:37:49,840
no matter what you say.

413
00:37:52,020 --> 00:37:57,120
The Public Prosecution Service and the
NFI have withheld DNA evidence.

414
00:37:57,762 --> 00:38:00,320
As a result, an innocent man
is now incarcerated.

415
00:38:02,447 --> 00:38:03,720
Ernest Louwes?

416
00:38:04,680 --> 00:38:05,969
Kees B.

417
00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:08,160
Schiedam park murder.

418
00:38:16,720 --> 00:38:17,720
Succes.

419
00:38:25,400 --> 00:38:28,120
Five, four, three...

420
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:33,840
Four past eight. This is Network.

421
00:38:33,960 --> 00:38:38,698
Incriminating evidence was withheld in
the Schiedam park murder

422
00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:43,240
How the judiciary wanted to keep an
innocent prisoner locked up for life.

423
00:38:43,360 --> 00:38:45,680
A report by Bas Haan.

424
00:38:55,157 --> 00:38:56,360
Hey, man, good day.

425
00:39:00,560 --> 00:39:02,000
A package for you.

426
00:39:02,120 --> 00:39:03,800
Thank you.

427
00:39:36,240 --> 00:39:37,240
Hey

428
00:39:38,360 --> 00:39:40,440
Bad conscience?

429
00:39:48,600 --> 00:39:50,280
Make some room.

430
00:39:54,200 --> 00:39:56,201
Guys what...

431
00:39:57,080 --> 00:40:01,040
Congratulations on your first scoop
as a reporter.

432
00:40:01,160 --> 00:40:02,600
Thank you.

433
00:40:02,720 --> 00:40:03,920
Guys...

434
00:40:04,040 --> 00:40:05,600
Well, blow, Haan.

435
00:40:10,360 --> 00:40:11,560
Speech.

436
00:40:13,240 --> 00:40:15,080
Cake?

437
00:40:15,200 --> 00:40:16,520
Well, please.

438
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:21,840
I was at a meeting of Maurice de Hond
this morning.

439
00:40:21,960 --> 00:40:23,880
- More seats for Wilders?
- No.

440
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:28,600
He had polled the effect of Schiedam on
our confidence in the rule of law.

441
00:40:28,720 --> 00:40:31,560
- I'm guessing it had dropped.
- Dramatic.

442
00:40:31,680 --> 00:40:33,810
But the OM is working on improvement.

443
00:40:33,861 --> 00:40:34,869
Yes

444
00:40:34,920 --> 00:40:38,240
Schiedam was only the start,
he is know looking at Deventer.

445
00:40:38,720 --> 00:40:40,440
- Maurice?
- Hmhm.

446
00:40:40,560 --> 00:40:42,000
- At Deventer?
- Yes.

447
00:40:42,390 --> 00:40:46,400
He claims to have a lot of new evidence
that exonerates Louwes.

448
00:40:46,680 --> 00:40:48,280
Seriously?

449
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:50,671
Did he mention what he found?

450
00:40:51,640 --> 00:40:53,600
Do you know who his source is?

451
00:40:53,720 --> 00:40:57,024
- Does he have a new witness?
- I didn't ask.

452
00:40:57,640 --> 00:40:59,560
Tonight he will sit at Matthijs.

453
00:41:06,320 --> 00:41:08,000
<i>Maurice de Hond, welcome.</i>

454
00:41:08,105 --> 00:41:09,960
<i>Polls are your business.</i>

455
00:41:10,195 --> 00:41:13,360
<i>- Yes.
- You started another campaign today.</i>

456
00:41:13,480 --> 00:41:19,198
<i>You would like to review and reopen the
Deventer murder case of 1999.</i>

457
00:41:19,730 --> 00:41:21,072
<i>Why?</i>

458
00:41:21,122 --> 00:41:22,840
<i>Well, I'm just a civilian too.</i>

459
00:41:22,960 --> 00:41:26,400
<i>And as a citizen,
I am interested in the rule of law.</i>

460
00:41:26,957 --> 00:41:32,863
<i>And in 2003 or 2004, Ernest Louwes
was convicted in the third instance...</i>

461
00:41:33,480 --> 00:41:36,120
<i>after he was first released
by the Supreme Court</i>

462
00:41:36,456 --> 00:41:40,467
<i>and when I saw that on TV,
my stomach turned.</i>

463
00:41:40,841 --> 00:41:46,600
<i>After that I received all sorts of
information from people close to Louwes.</i>

464
00:41:46,651 --> 00:41:49,627
<i>I couldn't believe what I read. This
couldn't happen in this country.</i>

465
00:41:49,893 --> 00:41:52,800
<i>The Netherlands has a constitution.
I couldn't believe it.</i>

466
00:41:53,401 --> 00:41:57,440
<i>Only until the Schiedam park murder
came on TV earlier this year</i>

467
00:41:57,560 --> 00:42:02,400
<i>First on Netwerk, but more importantly
later in the report of OM.</i>

468
00:42:02,515 --> 00:42:05,680
<i>Kees B. was unjustly
imprisoned for murder.</i>

469
00:42:05,800 --> 00:42:09,015
<i>It's kind of a mix between
"Keystone Cops"...</i>

470
00:42:09,065 --> 00:42:12,280
<i>with Inspector Clouseau from "The
Pink Panther" and Mr Bean.</i>

471
00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:15,760
<i>Isn't that part of the excitement?</i>

472
00:42:15,880 --> 00:42:18,360
<i>With the Schiedam case you see
how many mistakes...</i>

473
00:42:18,480 --> 00:42:21,080
He just keeps linking those cases.

474
00:42:22,920 --> 00:42:24,320
Also on his site.

475
00:42:25,960 --> 00:42:27,194
Here.

476
00:42:27,835 --> 00:42:30,160
Schiedam, Deventer.

477
00:42:30,381 --> 00:42:34,920
And here. But that in itself
isn't so illogical, is it?

478
00:42:35,440 --> 00:42:39,440
Because they messed up in Schiedam,
they also screwed up Deventer?

479
00:42:39,551 --> 00:42:41,440
That is no argument,
that's bullshit.

480
00:42:41,660 --> 00:42:46,200
Besides, in Schiedam the withheld DNA
proved Kees B.'s innocence...

481
00:42:46,320 --> 00:42:49,600
while in Deventer the found
DNA proves Louwes' guilt.

482
00:42:49,996 --> 00:42:53,760
But many people doubt
whether Louwes did it.

483
00:42:54,183 --> 00:42:57,880
With all due respect, Gerda, those
people don't know fuck all, don't they?

484
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:00,364
Well, Maurice
is not just anyone.

485
00:43:00,718 --> 00:43:03,600
This isn't a poll,
it's a murder case.

486
00:43:06,760 --> 00:43:07,947
What?

487
00:43:08,088 --> 00:43:10,560
Second chances are
rare in our business.

488
00:43:11,800 --> 00:43:15,640
Not so long ago you also
had doubts about Louwes.

489
00:43:16,080 --> 00:43:17,634
That's right.

490
00:43:17,736 --> 00:43:22,840
Schiedam was a crash course in DNA.
Conclusion: DNA, no way around it.

491
00:43:23,040 --> 00:43:26,800
That blood in that collar is a fact,
and that blood belongs to Louwes.

492
00:43:27,120 --> 00:43:29,198
Unless the blood is fraudulent.

493
00:43:30,080 --> 00:43:33,013
According to Louwes
the evidence has been faked.

494
00:43:33,063 --> 00:43:35,070
But Maurice has no hard proof of that.

495
00:43:35,121 --> 00:43:36,560
I took a good look.

496
00:43:36,880 --> 00:43:37,883
So?

497
00:43:38,750 --> 00:43:40,920
- No news?
- Gerda.

498
00:43:41,641 --> 00:43:44,560
Maurice is just a celebrity
with an opinion.

499
00:43:47,360 --> 00:43:48,360
Okay.

500
00:43:57,409 --> 00:44:00,960
On principle, you shouldn't
prune in winter.

501
00:44:01,080 --> 00:44:03,160
The plant needs to lose moisture.

502
00:44:03,280 --> 00:44:05,960
If you prune too much,
you will get fungus.

503
00:44:06,840 --> 00:44:08,200
Good afternoon.

504
00:44:08,320 --> 00:44:10,440
Good afternoon.

505
00:44:10,560 --> 00:44:13,080
- Hello?
- Are you Meike Wittermans?

506
00:44:13,200 --> 00:44:16,240
- The handyman's girlfriend?
- Handyman?

507
00:44:16,360 --> 00:44:18,520
Yes, from Widow Wittenberg.

508
00:44:42,840 --> 00:44:46,320
Did you see this, man?
They are calling you the handyman.

509
00:44:58,520 --> 00:45:00,000
What is this all about?

510
00:45:06,600 --> 00:45:11,160
- I don't quite understand...
- We just want to ask some questions.

511
00:45:11,280 --> 00:45:13,396
Things that are unclear.

512
00:45:13,615 --> 00:45:16,568
At the time, you and your husband
were questioned by the police

513
00:45:16,664 --> 00:45:20,320
And made contradictory statements about
the time at which Michael came home.

514
00:45:20,575 --> 00:45:23,400
- Right?
- Yes, that was a mistake, yes.

515
00:45:27,156 --> 00:45:28,160
A mistake?

516
00:45:28,445 --> 00:45:30,172
Yes, a mistake, yes.

517
00:45:30,617 --> 00:45:34,640
Can you precisely remember where
you wife was last Tuesday at 20:30?

518
00:45:34,760 --> 00:45:37,467
There was no murder that night.

519
00:45:37,720 --> 00:45:39,094
No, exactly.

520
00:45:39,260 --> 00:45:44,280
And we had nothing to do with
that murder, so why would I remember?

521
00:45:46,076 --> 00:45:48,280
I've already explained all this.

522
00:45:49,889 --> 00:45:53,960
You do not have to be scared.
We can take you to a safe place.

523
00:45:56,960 --> 00:45:58,240
Who are you?

524
00:45:58,680 --> 00:46:00,742
Can you identify yourself?

525
00:46:01,191 --> 00:46:02,440
Be honest.

526
00:46:02,686 --> 00:46:07,280
Wouldn't it be nice if you could throw
that burden off your shoulders?

527
00:46:07,475 --> 00:46:10,800
- Come clean
- You can't just show up at my work.

528
00:46:11,514 --> 00:46:13,459
That was the whole plan.

529
00:46:13,592 --> 00:46:16,047
If he's not here,
you can talk freely.

530
00:46:16,232 --> 00:46:19,247
Ma'am, come with us.

531
00:46:19,480 --> 00:46:21,120
We can protect you.

532
00:46:21,372 --> 00:46:23,960
- He can't touch you.
- What do you think?

533
00:46:24,080 --> 00:46:27,240
We have nothing to do with this case.
Can you get out of here now?

534
00:46:28,629 --> 00:46:31,680
I'm calling the police.
The real police.

535
00:46:39,520 --> 00:46:40,520
Okay.

536
00:46:48,680 --> 00:46:50,920
Who do you actually work for?

537
00:47:18,400 --> 00:47:23,853
Maurice has been invited by the
President of the Board of Attorneys...

538
00:47:24,360 --> 00:47:30,000
to personally explain his actions and
doubts in the Deventer murder case.

539
00:47:30,211 --> 00:47:31,611
What?

540
00:47:32,024 --> 00:47:33,760
How did he manage that?

541
00:47:34,920 --> 00:47:37,107
I also don't understand.

542
00:47:41,091 --> 00:47:44,880
Do you think I can talk to Brouwer
about my parking tickets?

543
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:48,080
Then you first have to appear
on 'De Wereld Draait Door'

544
00:47:48,468 --> 00:47:53,200
It's all PR. Restore the trust in the
law; citizens speak up.

545
00:47:53,320 --> 00:47:55,593
But preferably a citizen
who works in media, please.

546
00:47:55,851 --> 00:47:58,257
Thanks to us, huh.
Thanks to us.

547
00:47:58,920 --> 00:48:01,255
It's news... by now.

548
00:48:03,560 --> 00:48:05,920
And the news just came out.

549
00:48:22,120 --> 00:48:23,829
Good morning, mister De Hond.

550
00:48:23,879 --> 00:48:28,040
You have just come from a meeting with
the boss of the judiciary. About what?

551
00:48:28,160 --> 00:48:30,627
Yes, about the Deventer
murder case...

552
00:48:30,677 --> 00:48:33,560
and the fact that the wrong
perpetrator is incarcerated.

553
00:48:33,680 --> 00:48:38,320
And that we now know, at least we do,
who the real perpetrator is.

554
00:48:38,577 --> 00:48:40,360
You know it.
Does he know it too?

555
00:48:40,573 --> 00:48:42,628
Well, he knows what I know.

556
00:48:42,920 --> 00:48:47,880
Of course it isn't easy to
immediately come out and say: it is so.

557
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:51,310
The fact that the research
is reopened indicates...

558
00:48:51,615 --> 00:48:53,669
that they have
sufficient doubts...

559
00:48:53,720 --> 00:48:57,120
about whether they have done the right
thing in the past.

560
00:49:06,330 --> 00:49:09,600
- He is quite confident in himself.
- Quite?

561
00:49:10,634 --> 00:49:12,120
He already has
the fucking culprit.

562
00:49:13,278 --> 00:49:14,280
What now?

563
00:49:14,920 --> 00:49:16,640
On to casa 'De Hond'.

564
00:49:20,154 --> 00:49:23,320
Mr. De Hond.
What do you expect law enforcement to do

565
00:49:23,440 --> 00:49:26,760
with the incriminating information
you unearthed about the handyman?

566
00:49:27,013 --> 00:49:32,720
I only ask for a proper investigation.
I'm not condemning that man yet.

567
00:49:32,840 --> 00:49:37,840
I think for 99.99% if not a
100% that he did it...

568
00:49:38,082 --> 00:49:39,880
but I'm not a judge.

569
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:43,280
My only responsibility with
the information is to say:

570
00:49:43,465 --> 00:49:46,880
Anyone who
reads this information...

571
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:50,200
thinks more research should be done.

572
00:49:50,320 --> 00:49:56,280
Because if only two of my fifteen
hypotheses are true, he's the culprit.

573
00:49:57,600 --> 00:49:58,990
Is it him?

574
00:49:59,480 --> 00:50:00,800
Yes, 100% sure.

575
00:50:01,840 --> 00:50:03,760
- That's tunnel vision.
- No.

576
00:50:03,880 --> 00:50:05,360
He has not yet been convicted.

577
00:50:05,538 --> 00:50:06,920
But I'm not a judge.

578
00:50:07,040 --> 00:50:10,480
You are also not a detective. And can't
read the pieces as a detective.

579
00:50:10,739 --> 00:50:16,120
Your are convinced. Are you allowed to
determine that it is him?

580
00:50:16,240 --> 00:50:19,840
No, I can't say to him:
You get twelve years.

581
00:50:19,960 --> 00:50:25,120
I may say, That's my... I mean, why not?
He's it, 100% sure.

582
00:50:25,240 --> 00:50:26,640
100%.

583
00:50:28,440 --> 00:50:30,240
100%?

584
00:50:31,840 --> 00:50:33,720
- That's what he said?
- Yes.

585
00:50:36,060 --> 00:50:38,560
- And we have that exclusively?
- Yes but...

586
00:50:38,680 --> 00:50:40,760
Yes, but under embargo?

587
00:50:40,832 --> 00:50:42,996
As soon as the OM comes
up with something, we can go.

588
00:50:43,047 --> 00:50:44,800
So we have agreed
with Maurice... But...

589
00:50:45,160 --> 00:50:46,600
But?

590
00:50:47,212 --> 00:50:49,332
It's quite an accusation.

591
00:50:51,080 --> 00:50:53,280
Er, press release from the OM.

592
00:50:54,080 --> 00:50:57,760
At the request of the
Board of Attorneys...

593
00:50:57,880 --> 00:51:02,680
an exploratory investigation has started
into the Deventer murder case.

594
00:51:02,909 --> 00:51:03,949
What?

595
00:51:05,840 --> 00:51:09,524
An exploratory investigation?
There is no such thing.

596
00:51:09,574 --> 00:51:11,440
Well, yes, now there is.

597
00:51:11,560 --> 00:51:13,745
And it's the OM,
so we're allowed.

598
00:51:14,232 --> 00:51:17,320
Yes, but without that
quote about the handyman.

599
00:51:17,440 --> 00:51:18,841
Sorry?

600
00:51:19,400 --> 00:51:21,641
Someone is accused of murder

601
00:51:22,076 --> 00:51:24,440
without any hard evidence.

602
00:51:24,560 --> 00:51:27,385
You elicited that
statement from him yourself.

603
00:51:27,435 --> 00:51:29,497
That's why I'm
going to block it.

604
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:32,040
Bas, this is news.

605
00:51:32,591 --> 00:51:35,642
You can't just accuse someone of
murder on TV. Maurice...

606
00:51:35,693 --> 00:51:38,360
Maurice is just a celebrity
with an opinion, yes.

607
00:51:38,480 --> 00:51:41,169
But if the judicial system
takes him seriously...

608
00:51:41,325 --> 00:51:44,973
and even starts an
exploratory investigation...

609
00:51:45,320 --> 00:51:48,560
Something which, according to you,
has never happened yet.

610
00:51:49,840 --> 00:51:51,520
...then that's news.

611
00:51:57,160 --> 00:52:00,198
<i>I'm only asking for a
proper investigation.</i>

612
00:52:00,248 --> 00:52:02,360
<i>I'm not judging that man today.</i>

613
00:52:02,480 --> 00:52:07,480
<i>I think 99.99% if not 100%
that he did it...</i>

614
00:52:07,785 --> 00:52:09,520
<i>but I'm not a judge.</i>

615
00:52:09,640 --> 00:52:14,295
<i>My only job with
the information is to say:</i>

616
00:52:14,382 --> 00:52:16,480
<i>Anyone who
reads the information...</i>

617
00:52:16,600 --> 00:52:19,840
<i>thinks more research should be done.</i>

618
00:52:19,960 --> 00:52:25,853
<i>Because if only two of my fifteen
hypotheses are true, he's the culprit.</i>

619
00:52:26,400 --> 00:52:28,480
<i>Is it him?</i>

620
00:52:28,599 --> 00:52:30,799
<i>Yes, 100% sure.</i>

621
00:52:30,920 --> 00:52:32,600
<i>That's tunnel vision.</i>

622
00:52:57,720 --> 00:53:01,298
Come here. Hey, come here.

623
00:53:07,735 --> 00:53:10,829
<i>Hello, this is Michaël and
Meike's answering machine.</i>

624
00:53:10,985 --> 00:53:14,800
<i>We aren't in at the moment, but leave
a message after the beep. Thank you.</i>

625
00:53:16,080 --> 00:53:19,280
<i>Hey, Michael, pick up then,
you filthy retard.</i>

626
00:53:19,400 --> 00:53:20,968
<i>I hope they also strangle you...</i>

627
00:53:21,054 --> 00:53:22,682
<i>like you strangled
that old woman.</i>

628
00:53:22,737 --> 00:53:23,905
<i>You cowardly bastard.</i>

629
00:53:23,956 --> 00:53:26,840
<i>You too, Meike, you dirty whore.</i>

630
00:53:37,661 --> 00:53:39,840
<i>Hello, this is the answering machine...</i>

631
00:54:03,480 --> 00:54:04,800
Bas.

632
00:54:04,920 --> 00:54:06,200
Did you read it?

633
00:54:08,360 --> 00:54:12,339
De Telegraaf, Volkskrant, AD,
all on the front page.

634
00:54:13,120 --> 00:54:14,560
Congratulations man.

635
00:54:20,800 --> 00:54:22,520
Goddamnit.

636
00:54:27,995 --> 00:54:33,032
<i>He says Michael van J. probably did it.</i>

637
00:54:33,160 --> 00:54:38,440
<i>That man has a letter in which the
judiciary says: You are not a suspect.</i>

638
00:54:38,560 --> 00:54:40,360
<i>Can a citizen actually do that?</i>

639
00:54:40,480 --> 00:54:43,744
<i>Shouldn't you be
happy that the judiciary investigates</i>

640
00:54:43,794 --> 00:54:46,040
<i>and just leave it them?</i>

641
00:54:46,160 --> 00:54:50,160
<i>No, the point is: why did the
judiciary start to investigate?</i>

642
00:54:50,280 --> 00:54:53,240
<i>Why have they never investigated
it in Schiedam?</i>

643
00:54:53,360 --> 00:54:57,680
<i>Apparently the judiciary only
moves under hard pressure.</i>

644
00:54:57,800 --> 00:55:02,040
<i>- But they are moving now.
- The point is why...</i>

645
00:55:02,160 --> 00:55:08,074
<i>because the piece on my website
has been sent to the OM.</i>

646
00:55:08,360 --> 00:55:12,480
<i>We said: This is our proof,
go do something.</i>

647
00:55:12,600 --> 00:55:18,303
<i>But they are busy now. Why don't you
keep a low profile for now?</i>

648
00:55:18,800 --> 00:55:23,640
<i>It is of course not in the interest
of the judges, the OM, the judiciary...</i>

649
00:55:23,760 --> 00:55:28,640
<i>to say now: Louwes is not it
and the other one might be.</i>

650
00:55:28,760 --> 00:55:32,400
<i>Because then it will be a
bigger scandal than Schiedam.</i>

651
00:55:32,520 --> 00:55:36,800
Mich... Maybe we should consider what
that lawyer said: give an interview.

652
00:55:39,480 --> 00:55:40,480
No.

653
00:55:41,800 --> 00:55:43,240
I'm not going to do that.

654
00:55:46,240 --> 00:55:47,560
Really.

655
00:55:48,357 --> 00:55:53,080
<i>But there's also the 1% chance,
which you mention yourself...</i>

656
00:55:53,302 --> 00:55:56,920
<i>that Michael didn't do it.
Then you caused quite something</i>.

657
00:55:57,040 --> 00:56:01,640
<i>- Then I will bear the consequences.
- They can go very far.</i>

658
00:56:01,760 --> 00:56:02,861
<i>We'll see.</i>

659
00:56:02,987 --> 00:56:04,682
What's the matter with that guy?

660
00:56:06,720 --> 00:56:10,520
Maurice is on campaign.
It's not about the content.

661
00:56:10,640 --> 00:56:12,480
It's about the PR.

662
00:56:13,139 --> 00:56:15,840
Not to be right,
but to get his right.

663
00:56:16,146 --> 00:56:21,560
Last month Brouwer was his best friend,
now he is part of the plot.

664
00:56:21,810 --> 00:56:24,520
Brouwer actually hoisted
him on the shield.

665
00:56:24,640 --> 00:56:26,616
Not just Brouwer, right?

666
00:56:27,163 --> 00:56:30,007
If I remember correctly,
Maurice also got a lot...

667
00:56:30,165 --> 00:56:33,120
of airtime on a certain
current affairs program.

668
00:56:33,920 --> 00:56:35,701
"It's the handyman."

669
00:56:36,568 --> 00:56:37,920
'100% sure.'

670
00:56:50,800 --> 00:56:54,360
Okay. Second chance, very good,
one more time then.

671
00:56:54,480 --> 00:56:56,960
This time all the way.
Everything and everyone.

672
00:56:57,080 --> 00:57:01,240
Not just what Maurice does.
Every fart from that man is covered.

673
00:57:01,360 --> 00:57:04,840
I was just looking for you.
Press release OM, just came in.

674
00:57:05,381 --> 00:57:08,294
Interim conclusion
exploratory investigation:

675
00:57:08,608 --> 00:57:10,080
five additional contact traces...

676
00:57:10,200 --> 00:57:12,983
and a trail of blood, all from Louwes.

677
00:57:15,400 --> 00:57:17,520
- Do you have to go?
- No, I'm going to smoke.

678
00:57:17,640 --> 00:57:19,920
- Outside?
- Some bore has complained.

679
00:57:20,040 --> 00:57:22,040
That bloody smoking ban...

680
00:57:25,892 --> 00:57:28,520
So it says nothing about
Michael de Jong.

681
00:57:31,280 --> 00:57:34,120
I can already hear Maurice calling it:
cover up.

682
00:57:35,960 --> 00:57:38,886
Can I conclude from
this that you are now...

683
00:57:38,936 --> 00:57:42,600
investigating the handyman,
and not just Louwes?

684
00:57:42,944 --> 00:57:46,240
That's what I said.
The whole story, everything.

685
00:57:49,600 --> 00:57:51,810
And how long do you need for that?

686
00:57:53,662 --> 00:57:57,400
The whole story, checking everything
from Maurice about the handyman...

687
00:57:57,718 --> 00:57:59,092
Louwes one more time...

688
00:57:59,400 --> 00:58:01,160
- Two, three...
- ...weeks.

689
00:58:01,280 --> 00:58:02,400
...months.

690
00:58:09,600 --> 00:58:12,514
But what if Maurice
turns out to be right?

691
00:58:13,475 --> 00:58:17,631
If he has the facts on his side, I'll
carry him around on a silver shield.

692
00:58:17,880 --> 00:58:19,080
100% sure.

693
00:58:20,419 --> 00:58:23,640
I'll ignore the cynicism for now.
But we don't have broadcast.

694
00:58:23,760 --> 00:58:26,600
Of course. You must also dare
to broadcast your faults.

695
00:58:26,720 --> 00:58:29,095
Bas, it is not
a question of daring.

696
00:58:29,716 --> 00:58:31,220
It is journalistic suicide.

697
00:58:31,294 --> 00:58:34,680
So it's open road for circus
De Hond then? I believe it's our job...

698
00:58:34,800 --> 00:58:36,800
Oh my gosh, not again.

699
00:58:39,880 --> 00:58:41,240
Saint Bas.

700
00:58:44,960 --> 00:58:47,080
Do you think
that the handyman did it?

701
00:58:49,280 --> 00:58:52,160
Don't know. I don't think so.

702
00:58:57,360 --> 00:58:58,440
Two months.

703
00:59:04,800 --> 00:59:06,160
Drug addict.

704
00:59:10,400 --> 00:59:12,120
Benefit fraudster.

705
00:59:19,800 --> 00:59:21,760
Hit rock bottom.

706
00:59:25,400 --> 00:59:30,196
Debts as a result of
very high spending patterns.

707
00:59:30,720 --> 00:59:31,960
Perpetrator knowledge.

708
00:59:33,920 --> 00:59:38,021
He and his girlfriend would have
lied about their alibis.

709
00:59:38,720 --> 00:59:40,000
And then this one.

710
00:59:41,600 --> 00:59:47,040
Michael was a patient of psychiatrist
Wittenberg, the husband of the widow.

711
00:59:47,160 --> 00:59:49,560
Because of tantrums.

712
00:59:50,760 --> 00:59:54,560
- How did he get all this information?
- From witnesses.

713
00:59:54,680 --> 00:59:57,600
Because of the publicity,
everyone approaches him.

714
00:59:57,720 --> 01:00:01,960
People who suddenly remember everything
after seven years, often anonymously.

715
01:00:02,080 --> 01:00:06,600
Lots of facts, but no sources.
It cannot be checked directly.

716
01:00:06,720 --> 01:00:10,600
It's a lot.
There must be some truth to it, right?

717
01:00:11,040 --> 01:00:12,440
Yes but what?

718
01:00:12,560 --> 01:00:15,141
There's nothing in it that
makes him a murderer.

719
01:00:16,040 --> 01:00:17,040
But okay.

720
01:00:18,600 --> 01:00:22,560
The handyman did have a motive,
according to Maurice.

721
01:00:22,779 --> 01:00:25,600
Louwes not according to the judges.
Here.

722
01:00:26,373 --> 01:00:30,280
"The handyman was in the
widow's original will...

723
01:00:30,400 --> 01:00:34,130
with a tax-free legacy
of 50,000 guilders...

724
01:00:34,607 --> 01:00:39,200
which was lowered in the new will
ten days before the murder...

725
01:00:39,320 --> 01:00:41,148
to 25,000 guilders.

726
01:00:41,519 --> 01:00:43,993
That's why, and
because of debts...

727
01:00:44,210 --> 01:00:46,759
he would have killed her
in a drunken brawl.'

728
01:00:46,880 --> 01:00:48,280
According to Maurice.

729
01:00:52,280 --> 01:00:54,920
Not known to you? In no registry?

730
01:00:55,320 --> 01:00:59,389
No theft, benefit fraud,
drunk driving, whatever?

731
01:00:59,720 --> 01:01:02,360
Can I quote you on that? Super.

732
01:01:20,560 --> 01:01:22,120
- Here.
- Ah, thank you.

733
01:01:32,120 --> 01:01:33,600
What is that?

734
01:01:33,720 --> 01:01:36,960
- You know that, right?
- Ah, that adoption thingy.

735
01:01:37,080 --> 01:01:38,080
Yes.

736
01:01:46,280 --> 01:01:47,920
Can you picture it?

737
01:01:50,334 --> 01:01:52,360
And can I get that woman too, hm?

738
01:01:54,400 --> 01:01:56,560
If I get that man too.

739
01:02:19,320 --> 01:02:20,800
Come here.

740
01:02:39,600 --> 01:02:41,480
- Are you OK?
- Yes.

741
01:02:56,080 --> 01:02:59,840
- Shall I go to the girls?
- No, I'm coming.

742
01:03:13,280 --> 01:03:15,795
Hey, come here.
Well done.

743
01:03:16,639 --> 01:03:20,040
There's nothing wrong. Yes, good, good.

744
01:03:20,160 --> 01:03:21,440
Well done.

745
01:03:23,320 --> 01:03:26,280
Very good, very good.

746
01:03:26,827 --> 01:03:28,920
Hey, hey, sst.

747
01:03:30,960 --> 01:03:32,840
- Mich?
- Yes, what?

748
01:03:34,600 --> 01:03:37,360
- We have to do something.
- Yes, what then?

749
01:03:37,480 --> 01:03:40,135
I think we need to
talk to that journalist.

750
01:03:40,529 --> 01:03:42,840
But then I have to go
on TV to defend myself.

751
01:03:42,960 --> 01:03:45,360
That man sends private investigators
to my work.

752
01:03:52,120 --> 01:03:55,480
Then I have to tell on TV
how I got that perpetrator knowledge.

753
01:04:15,400 --> 01:04:18,200
- Jan Vlug.
- Good afternoon, Mr Vlug.

754
01:04:18,320 --> 01:04:21,240
- Who am I speaking to?
- With Bas Haan.

755
01:04:21,560 --> 01:04:22,395
Bas Haan.

756
01:04:22,445 --> 01:04:25,600
I would like to speak with a
client of you, Michael de Jong.

757
01:04:25,900 --> 01:04:27,400
I can not reach him.

758
01:04:27,520 --> 01:04:31,113
Oh, so you thought,
let me call his lawyer?

759
01:04:31,754 --> 01:04:36,080
- I assume you can reach him.
- He doesn't want to speak to you.

760
01:04:40,080 --> 01:04:41,080
Hello.

761
01:04:43,619 --> 01:04:45,699
Did anything happen today?

762
01:04:52,753 --> 01:04:55,040
Mr Haan, let me be clear.

763
01:04:55,300 --> 01:05:00,535
According to me and my client,
you are part of the Mr. De Hond group.

764
01:05:01,058 --> 01:05:03,880
You have made more than
ten broadcasts about this case.

765
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:08,089
And in the last one, Mr. De Hond
got to call my client a murderer...

766
01:05:08,236 --> 01:05:10,160
in front of the whole nation.

767
01:05:10,280 --> 01:05:12,080
'100% sure.'

768
01:05:13,377 --> 01:05:16,880
I understand your reaction,
but I only care about the facts.

769
01:05:17,000 --> 01:05:20,880
I can't investigate a lot,
without his explanation.

770
01:05:23,752 --> 01:05:26,040
You wanted to speak to me?

771
01:05:27,400 --> 01:05:28,680
Sit down.

772
01:05:29,587 --> 01:05:33,400
I'm not judging anyone,
but given all the media attention...

773
01:05:33,520 --> 01:05:38,240
it may be in your client's interest
to highlight his side of the story.

774
01:05:40,066 --> 01:05:45,440
First you make his life hell
and now he has to tell his story...

775
01:05:45,560 --> 01:05:47,640
so that you have your next broadcast.

776
01:05:49,011 --> 01:05:53,080
It must be weird, huh,
all that stuff in the media.

777
01:05:53,200 --> 01:05:55,793
Pf. It's a nightmare.

778
01:05:56,428 --> 01:05:58,228
And especially for Meike.

779
01:05:59,520 --> 01:06:03,270
Maurice's accusations about you
are not nothing...

780
01:06:03,785 --> 01:06:07,000
No, but that man is insane you know.

781
01:06:09,760 --> 01:06:13,634
I would like to point out that
Michael and his girlfriend...

782
01:06:13,684 --> 01:06:15,840
are very fond of their privacy.

783
01:06:16,103 --> 01:06:19,680
These are people who don't need
or want to be in the picture.

784
01:06:19,800 --> 01:06:21,580
Unlike some others.

785
01:06:21,630 --> 01:06:23,720
Those people exist, Mr. Haan.

786
01:06:23,840 --> 01:06:28,059
Personally, I understand them very
well. Better than you probably think.

787
01:06:28,400 --> 01:06:31,290
But as long as they don't defend
themselves, Maurice can shoot freely.

788
01:06:34,110 --> 01:06:35,480
For the last time...

789
01:06:35,673 --> 01:06:41,118
My clients don't want to answer for
something they have no part in.

790
01:06:41,639 --> 01:06:45,487
And for Mr. De Hond, he will
soon have to answer for himself...

791
01:06:45,538 --> 01:06:47,200
when I sue him for libel.

792
01:06:47,396 --> 01:06:48,760
Bye Mr. Haan.

793
01:06:50,160 --> 01:06:51,320
Shit.

794
01:06:51,440 --> 01:06:52,960
Shit, shit, shit.

795
01:06:54,480 --> 01:06:58,512
There are customers of
ours who would rather...

796
01:06:58,562 --> 01:07:00,815
not have you come
to them anymore.

797
01:07:01,920 --> 01:07:02,920
Who?

798
01:07:04,360 --> 01:07:05,520
Customers.

799
01:07:13,640 --> 01:07:15,257
Have I lost my job?

800
01:07:40,920 --> 01:07:42,480
Who are you?

801
01:07:43,680 --> 01:07:45,000
Who are you?

802
01:07:47,330 --> 01:07:48,529
Who are you?

803
01:07:51,920 --> 01:07:53,400
Leave us alone.

804
01:07:55,240 --> 01:07:56,640
Leave me alone.

805
01:08:11,000 --> 01:08:12,200
How is it going?

806
01:08:12,952 --> 01:08:14,406
It has been a long time.

807
01:08:15,109 --> 01:08:16,680
Long time, indeed.

808
01:08:18,000 --> 01:08:19,600
Good to have you here.

809
01:08:19,921 --> 01:08:22,880
A lot of people are sticking up
for me now...

810
01:08:23,210 --> 01:08:27,080
but you were one of the first
to believe and stand up for me.

811
01:08:41,203 --> 01:08:43,390
I've dived into the matter again.

812
01:08:44,257 --> 01:08:46,555
I've put everything back together.

813
01:08:47,711 --> 01:08:50,960
You were with Mrs. Wittenberg
the morning of the murder.

814
01:08:52,880 --> 01:08:56,481
In your diary you write
that she was wearing something red.

815
01:08:57,419 --> 01:09:03,080
"I can't remember whether it was a dress
or a suit, but the color was red."

816
01:09:06,336 --> 01:09:09,520
But the blouse she wore when she
was killed, was white.

817
01:09:09,880 --> 01:09:11,211
Yes...

818
01:09:15,520 --> 01:09:21,238
You always said the DNA got on her
blouse during your visit that morning.

819
01:09:22,520 --> 01:09:26,600
What I don't understand,
is how it got on that white blouse.

820
01:09:27,280 --> 01:09:29,280
Wasn't she wearing something red?

821
01:09:40,402 --> 01:09:43,418
And speaking of that white blouse...

822
01:09:44,360 --> 01:09:48,090
That blood in the collar,
how did they get it?

823
01:09:49,894 --> 01:09:53,080
Um, I donated blood in 1999.

824
01:09:53,200 --> 01:09:57,320
- In my cell, for a DNA profile.
- Where is that written down?

825
01:09:57,440 --> 01:09:59,158
I must have read over it.

826
01:09:59,534 --> 01:10:02,120
I could hardly have
written everything down.

827
01:10:02,533 --> 01:10:05,455
123 typed pages...

828
01:10:05,706 --> 01:10:09,182
of literally every detail
since your arrest.

829
01:10:09,880 --> 01:10:13,270
And then they come into
your cell, take your blood,

830
01:10:13,643 --> 01:10:15,480
and you don't write that down?

831
01:10:34,016 --> 01:10:38,484
In '99 they put my DNA profile
in the database.

832
01:10:39,758 --> 01:10:44,200
That profile required blood.
Then they must have taken it, right?

833
01:10:44,320 --> 01:10:48,640
It wasn't until 2003 that a DNA profile
was made of you, for your review.

834
01:10:48,760 --> 01:10:52,240
- With a cotton swab, in your cheek.
- You're not listening.

835
01:10:52,360 --> 01:10:57,360
I am listening. You say that
blood was drawn in 1999...

836
01:10:57,480 --> 01:11:00,080
to commit fraud with in 2003.

837
01:11:01,414 --> 01:11:06,515
Do they always hold back some blood in
case someone's first conviction fails?

838
01:11:17,629 --> 01:11:21,320
How can you be sure that no
blood has been drawn?

839
01:11:21,440 --> 01:11:24,640
Everything in my case is counterfeit.
Bas!

840
01:11:24,760 --> 01:11:26,360
Everything.

841
01:11:26,480 --> 01:11:28,240
Bas, everything!

842
01:11:30,240 --> 01:11:31,720
Bas!

843
01:11:55,010 --> 01:11:57,120
- Hi.
- I do not have that much time.

844
01:11:57,480 --> 01:11:59,685
It's lunch break
and my boss is strict.

845
01:11:59,893 --> 01:12:01,920
I just have a few questions.

846
01:12:02,040 --> 01:12:03,523
You're not
recording it, are you?

847
01:12:04,299 --> 01:12:07,158
This is as off the
record as it gets.

848
01:12:07,440 --> 01:12:08,440
Really?

849
01:12:13,920 --> 01:12:17,040
Yes, okay. Shall we
just stand there for a while?

850
01:12:17,160 --> 01:12:18,160
Yes.

851
01:12:33,731 --> 01:12:35,789
Actually, I already know a lot.

852
01:12:36,067 --> 01:12:39,285
I'm mainly looking for confirmation
of two things.

853
01:12:40,668 --> 01:12:43,720
A new will was drawn up
ten days before the murder...

854
01:12:43,840 --> 01:12:47,964
in which Louwes becomes
executor of the widow...

855
01:12:48,360 --> 01:12:53,400
and president of a foundation that
manages her millions after her death.

856
01:12:54,440 --> 01:12:56,549
Sorry, I really can't do this.

857
01:12:56,960 --> 01:13:00,360
I thought it would be more about
what I thought of Louwes.

858
01:13:00,565 --> 01:13:05,541
Don't worry, no one will ever
find out about this, I guarantee it.

859
01:13:05,840 --> 01:13:08,680
My word is everything, otherwise
no one will ever talk to me again.

860
01:13:08,940 --> 01:13:12,440
Everything is so specific.
It can only come from me.

861
01:13:12,560 --> 01:13:16,640
It can come from a variety of sources.
No one knows if you work for justice...

862
01:13:16,760 --> 01:13:21,783
or with an involved lawyer,
notary, insurer or Louwes' office.

863
01:13:22,160 --> 01:13:25,360
- Or that you know someone there.
- When you have so much choice...

864
01:13:27,440 --> 01:13:28,480
Listen.

865
01:13:29,049 --> 01:13:33,240
You agreed to this meeting because
things don't sit well with you, right?

866
01:13:34,480 --> 01:13:38,320
Sorry, I shouldn't have...
I shouldn't have come.

867
01:13:42,932 --> 01:13:47,280
You don't necessarily have to talk.
There are also other ways to…

868
01:13:48,320 --> 01:13:51,280
Maybe you know someone
who would like to talk.

869
01:14:06,840 --> 01:14:10,880
<i>This is the knife with which
Michael de Jong stabbed the widow.</i>

870
01:14:11,000 --> 01:14:13,520
<i>With a blade of ten centimeters.</i>

871
01:14:14,520 --> 01:14:17,949
<i>I'll show it here. Ten centimeters.</i>

872
01:14:18,520 --> 01:14:22,457
<i>Michael de Jong killed
the widow with five stabs.</i>

873
01:14:41,840 --> 01:14:44,600
<i>According to expert research...</i>

874
01:14:47,800 --> 01:14:49,840
I uh... found this one.

875
01:14:54,880 --> 01:14:55,960
Get rid of it.

876
01:15:09,240 --> 01:15:11,720
Mr. Vlug, Bas Haan.

877
01:15:13,280 --> 01:15:14,760
Again, yes.

878
01:15:15,599 --> 01:15:19,145
No, I understand that, but you
can propose it to them, can't you?

879
01:15:19,224 --> 01:15:23,000
In a place they choose, without a
camera, in your presence.

880
01:15:26,080 --> 01:15:27,320
I understand.

881
01:15:28,520 --> 01:15:29,520
Yes.

882
01:15:31,400 --> 01:15:32,400
Okay.

883
01:16:00,880 --> 01:16:02,600
Thank you, Maurice.

884
01:17:51,880 --> 01:17:52,960
Michael?

885
01:17:55,480 --> 01:17:56,800
This is Bas Haan.

886
01:17:58,880 --> 01:18:03,247
I know you know my name and
you don't want to talk to me.

887
01:18:05,520 --> 01:18:07,000
And I understand that.

888
01:18:12,480 --> 01:18:13,480
Michael?

889
01:18:20,440 --> 01:18:21,840
Give me a chance.

890
01:18:23,600 --> 01:18:26,800
You get to tell your whole story,
primetime.

891
01:18:30,280 --> 01:18:31,280
Michael.

892
01:18:44,367 --> 01:18:46,515
I'll leave my card here for you.

893
01:19:13,410 --> 01:19:14,770
No sender.

894
01:19:33,230 --> 01:19:35,120
You know whose it is?

895
01:19:35,240 --> 01:19:36,879
I can't say that.

896
01:19:37,410 --> 01:19:40,520
Only that
it left me with a proper cold.

897
01:19:48,760 --> 01:19:50,480
Holy shit.

898
01:19:58,400 --> 01:20:00,800
- Are we shooting?
- Just a moment.

899
01:20:01,978 --> 01:20:03,520
Professor Van Mourik.

900
01:20:03,840 --> 01:20:05,608
As an inheritance
law specialist...

901
01:20:05,658 --> 01:20:08,640
what do you think about
Louwes' letter to the notary...

902
01:20:08,760 --> 01:20:10,400
two months prior to the murder?

903
01:20:11,280 --> 01:20:15,680
Louwes asks the notary to
put in the draft will...

904
01:20:15,800 --> 01:20:18,960
that he becomes the sole director
of a foundation...

905
01:20:19,080 --> 01:20:21,960
which manages all assets
after her death.

906
01:20:22,080 --> 01:20:25,720
And that he does not have to
appoint fellow directors.

907
01:20:25,840 --> 01:20:29,720
In short: that he is the sole ruler
of the wealth...

908
01:20:29,840 --> 01:20:32,360
and can do with it
whatever he pleases.

909
01:20:32,480 --> 01:20:35,400
And he was already working on that
two months before the murder.

910
01:20:35,520 --> 01:20:37,200
Apparently, yes.

911
01:20:37,320 --> 01:20:41,400
But that is not how it turned out
in the final will.

912
01:20:41,840 --> 01:20:46,680
That notary probably smelled a fuse
and thought: we're not going to do that.

913
01:20:47,200 --> 01:20:50,353
That is why Louwes
is ultimately forced

914
01:20:50,832 --> 01:20:53,278
to appoint two
fellow directors?

915
01:20:53,440 --> 01:20:55,280
It strongly resembles that.

916
01:20:55,621 --> 01:21:00,320
But he then chose two colleagues
from his office...

917
01:21:00,440 --> 01:21:03,771
whom he made excited with money
and goods from the foundation...

918
01:21:03,822 --> 01:21:05,986
at least this is what they
declared to the police.

919
01:21:06,104 --> 01:21:07,480
What do you think of that?

920
01:21:09,440 --> 01:21:11,385
The combination of facts...

921
01:21:11,680 --> 01:21:15,840
also that he was trying to
transfer money to a private account...

922
01:21:16,320 --> 01:21:19,280
that leads very clearly in the
direction of Louwes.

923
01:21:19,400 --> 01:21:24,680
You targeted the widow's money,
but you handled it stupidly.

924
01:21:36,200 --> 01:21:37,200
Hey, Meike.

925
01:21:39,056 --> 01:21:43,600
- You better leave that curtain closed.
- It's still there, though.

926
01:21:46,800 --> 01:21:49,520
- I'm going to call the police.
- And then?

927
01:21:52,108 --> 01:21:54,788
You already know what they're
going to say, right?

928
01:21:55,600 --> 01:21:58,810
Well, ma'am, what does he do?

929
01:21:59,960 --> 01:22:04,560
Yes, if he doesn't do anything, then
uh... then we can't do anything either.

930
01:22:04,680 --> 01:22:07,160
Because you can just stand there.

931
01:22:08,640 --> 01:22:10,400
Yeah, no, it's uh...

932
01:22:11,030 --> 01:22:13,640
We can maybe drive by later...

933
01:22:14,160 --> 01:22:18,320
But we are not a private police,
we have to guard the whole city.

934
01:22:18,440 --> 01:22:21,120
Pickpockets, terrorists...

935
01:22:21,240 --> 01:22:23,800
car thefts...

936
01:22:23,920 --> 01:22:24,960
squatters.

937
01:22:47,480 --> 01:22:48,640
Come here.

938
01:22:59,320 --> 01:23:00,400
Jesus.

939
01:23:07,304 --> 01:23:09,840
Oh no.

940
01:23:09,960 --> 01:23:13,077
No, No. Stop, stop, stop, stop.

941
01:23:15,640 --> 01:23:16,913
Out.

942
01:23:17,440 --> 01:23:19,960
- No no no.
- I'm going to get the car.

943
01:23:21,840 --> 01:23:25,800
Come on, come on. It's okay, it's okay.

944
01:23:25,920 --> 01:23:27,120
Hey baby.

945
01:23:27,240 --> 01:23:30,520
We're going to take good care of you,
poopie, aren't we?

946
01:23:41,680 --> 01:23:44,480
It's okay, it's okay.

947
01:24:19,920 --> 01:24:24,560
- Mich, let's talk to that reporter.
- Ah, Mei... Meike, that...

948
01:24:29,480 --> 01:24:30,480
Mich.

949
01:24:34,080 --> 01:24:35,080
No.

950
01:24:39,720 --> 01:24:41,000
Um...

951
01:24:41,548 --> 01:24:45,805
We had to cut open her neck to
remove the skewers, but...

952
01:24:47,680 --> 01:24:50,520
But it looks like she will survive.

953
01:24:55,162 --> 01:24:57,762
- Can we...
- You can see her later.

954
01:25:03,840 --> 01:25:04,840
Hey girl.

955
01:25:10,560 --> 01:25:16,360
And yes, the only conclusion is...
Or the strong suspicion then arises...

956
01:25:16,480 --> 01:25:19,040
He wanted the money for himself.

957
01:25:20,840 --> 01:25:22,449
Press release OM.

958
01:25:23,277 --> 01:25:25,560
- New DNA research.
- What now?

959
01:25:25,680 --> 01:25:28,851
Y-chromosomal DNA research.

960
01:25:29,601 --> 01:25:31,200
It's a new technique.

961
01:25:31,742 --> 01:25:34,120
Performed on the nails of the widow.

962
01:25:35,080 --> 01:25:36,320
Gerda.

963
01:25:36,440 --> 01:25:38,800
It is a match with Louwes.

964
01:25:42,440 --> 01:25:44,881
This technique does not produce
a unique profile.

965
01:25:44,932 --> 01:25:49,978
3 to 4% of men have the profile
found on the nails.

966
01:25:50,502 --> 01:25:52,000
But Louwes has it.

967
01:25:53,440 --> 01:25:54,440
Wow.

968
01:25:55,920 --> 01:26:00,200
- There go Knoops' fingernails.
- Yes, plus Louwes' motive.

969
01:26:00,865 --> 01:26:04,920
- And he lied about drawing blood.
- It looks like it.

970
01:26:05,360 --> 01:26:08,680
Check that nail news,
also from an expert.

971
01:26:08,800 --> 01:26:11,960
If it's right, than it's going
to be broadcast.

972
01:26:13,960 --> 01:26:16,280
<i>And now they come with nails.</i>

973
01:26:16,400 --> 01:26:20,680
<i>They were also investigated in 2004
and then there was nothing on it.</i>

974
01:26:20,800 --> 01:26:26,080
<i>But Maurice, there is now a
technique that can now find something...</i>

975
01:26:26,200 --> 01:26:28,616
Yes, but that's the
misunderstanding.

976
01:26:28,666 --> 01:26:31,760
And that is also neat
PR trick from the OM...

977
01:27:04,764 --> 01:27:07,280
I thought of something last night.
Those nails.

978
01:27:07,514 --> 01:27:12,120
What if the handyman has the same
profile as those 3 to 4% of men?

979
01:27:12,240 --> 01:27:14,278
If not, then the broadcast
becomes difficult.

980
01:27:14,328 --> 01:27:15,760
Everyone will start speculating.

981
01:27:15,880 --> 01:27:17,800
That man never does.

982
01:27:18,762 --> 01:27:21,640
Even if he didn't,
there may be a match.

983
01:27:21,760 --> 01:27:24,760
But if there is no match,
he is 100% innocent.

984
01:27:24,880 --> 01:27:26,095
Yes.

985
01:27:26,333 --> 01:27:29,840
Just make sure you get to talk
to that handyman at all.

986
01:27:55,600 --> 01:27:56,709
Hey.

987
01:27:57,240 --> 01:27:58,400
That's mommy.

988
01:28:09,760 --> 01:28:10,800
Hey.

989
01:28:10,920 --> 01:28:13,200
Eggs. Aaah.

990
01:28:19,760 --> 01:28:21,040
How was your day?

991
01:28:23,960 --> 01:28:25,720
Yes, fantastic.

992
01:29:12,463 --> 01:29:13,503
What?

993
01:29:13,963 --> 01:29:18,480
That he wants to help me get rid of you.
They're ready for me.

994
01:29:21,190 --> 01:29:22,880
What bullshit.

995
01:29:24,263 --> 01:29:26,160
So now they know where we live.

996
01:29:27,800 --> 01:29:31,240
There's no stamp on it,
someone just delivers this.

997
01:29:58,880 --> 01:30:00,464
I can't do this anymore.

998
01:30:00,653 --> 01:30:02,097
I can't do this anymore.

999
01:30:02,317 --> 01:30:04,160
I can't take this anymore.

1000
01:30:04,473 --> 01:30:06,320
I can't.

1001
01:30:06,440 --> 01:30:11,520
You destroy everything.
You destroy everything. Goddamnit.

1002
01:30:13,680 --> 01:30:14,720
Hey.

1003
01:30:15,086 --> 01:30:19,160
Hey, hey, hey.

1004
01:30:19,280 --> 01:30:22,960
I'm going to talk to that journalist.
I'm going to talk to him.

1005
01:30:23,080 --> 01:30:24,120
Yes?

1006
01:30:24,240 --> 01:30:25,240
Yes?

1007
01:30:50,960 --> 01:30:51,960
Mr. Vlug?

1008
01:30:54,280 --> 01:30:55,280
Yes>

1009
01:30:56,640 --> 01:30:58,440
No, of course.

1010
01:30:58,560 --> 01:30:59,960
Tuesday is fine.

1011
01:31:01,200 --> 01:31:02,200
Yes.

1012
01:31:12,550 --> 01:31:13,680
Yes!

1013
01:31:16,160 --> 01:31:17,160
Yes!

1014
01:31:36,960 --> 01:31:37,960
Mr Haan.

1015
01:31:47,840 --> 01:31:49,720
Meet Michael and Meike.

1016
01:31:51,400 --> 01:31:52,579
Bas.

1017
01:31:53,200 --> 01:31:54,280
Hallo.

1018
01:31:55,430 --> 01:31:56,870
Let's sit down.

1019
01:32:10,980 --> 01:32:12,600
Go ahead, Mr Haan.

1020
01:32:12,915 --> 01:32:14,882
My clients are ready.

1021
01:32:17,760 --> 01:32:23,025
First of all thank you very much
for being willing to meet me.

1022
01:32:28,040 --> 01:32:29,586
I understand...

1023
01:32:32,040 --> 01:32:35,600
I understand that you would
rather not be here.

1024
01:32:37,774 --> 01:32:41,480
But if you don't respond
to what Maurice writes...

1025
01:32:41,960 --> 01:32:44,857
then I fear that in the
eyes of the general public...

1026
01:32:45,006 --> 01:32:47,960
the handyman is the killer.

1027
01:32:49,731 --> 01:32:55,599
I'd like to check some things from
Maurice's website one by one.

1028
01:32:56,231 --> 01:32:58,400
- Is that okay?
- Yes.

1029
01:33:06,320 --> 01:33:10,120
Have you ever been a patient
of Dr. Wittenberg?

1030
01:33:12,240 --> 01:33:13,240
No.

1031
01:33:14,280 --> 01:33:18,905
No, I knew the doctor from the
antique store where I worked.

1032
01:33:19,120 --> 01:33:21,480
Mrs Wittenberg too.

1033
01:33:22,030 --> 01:33:25,600
But I had nothing to do
with the doctor's profession.

1034
01:33:25,720 --> 01:33:29,120
I am not a psychiatric patient.

1035
01:33:29,240 --> 01:33:31,912
Not from him
and not from anyone else.

1036
01:33:37,877 --> 01:33:40,440
You would have hit rock bottom...

1037
01:33:41,252 --> 01:33:43,767
and lack of money because
you didn't have a job.

1038
01:33:43,845 --> 01:33:48,800
Michaël worked from 1993 to 2002
through and for a job placement company.

1039
01:33:49,884 --> 01:33:55,105
As a supervisor, manager, quality
controller and security officer...

1040
01:33:55,720 --> 01:33:58,673
for about 36 hours a week. Here.

1041
01:33:59,196 --> 01:34:00,400
'Michaël de Jong

1042
01:34:00,798 --> 01:34:04,891
is a very reliable,
extremely knowledgeable employee.'

1043
01:34:05,329 --> 01:34:06,493
And here:

1044
01:34:06,760 --> 01:34:10,947
'Welcome to provide
references about Mr. MC de Jong.'

1045
01:34:11,494 --> 01:34:13,760
The murder was in 1999...

1046
01:34:13,880 --> 01:34:18,575
so Michael was working at that company
from long before until long after.

1047
01:34:20,240 --> 01:34:24,680
So no unemployment and no decline.

1048
01:34:24,800 --> 01:34:30,596
And I'm not a handyman at all. I did
odd jobs at her house sometimes, but...

1049
01:34:31,300 --> 01:34:32,360
nothing more.

1050
01:34:34,069 --> 01:34:35,640
The bookkeeper
is not a bookkeeper.

1051
01:34:36,569 --> 01:34:38,600
and the handyman
is not a handyman.

1052
01:34:39,600 --> 01:34:40,800
And drugs?

1053
01:34:41,120 --> 01:34:45,480
Yes, that's quite a nice one.
I can't even do drugs.

1054
01:34:45,643 --> 01:34:48,040
I have an allergy, uh...

1055
01:34:48,160 --> 01:34:51,534
- Quincke's edema.
- Doctor's statement.

1056
01:34:52,440 --> 01:34:55,721
I can drop dead if I do drugs.

1057
01:34:56,680 --> 01:35:00,760
Luckily I don't have an alcohol
allergy. I can drink beer in peace.

1058
01:35:00,880 --> 01:35:03,240
And I've been drunk sometimes.

1059
01:35:05,024 --> 01:35:07,377
I've never ran somebody over as well.

1060
01:35:07,480 --> 01:35:09,840
- Well... No, sorry.
- Do not.

1061
01:35:09,960 --> 01:35:12,280
No, sorry, sorry.

1062
01:35:15,283 --> 01:35:17,200
What about that alibi?

1063
01:35:17,548 --> 01:35:20,840
It doesn't matter what we
say about it, right?

1064
01:35:21,344 --> 01:35:25,280
Yes, we said different things.
You can't change that

1065
01:35:25,400 --> 01:35:31,320
When we say we are mistaken,
De Hond calls us pathological liars.

1066
01:35:31,493 --> 01:35:35,480
Then everyone runs after it. But if
Louwes and his wife are mistaken...

1067
01:35:35,531 --> 01:35:36,541
That's true.

1068
01:35:36,592 --> 01:35:40,520
Louwes and his wife also contradicted
each other on this same point.

1069
01:35:40,640 --> 01:35:41,680
I know.

1070
01:35:41,800 --> 01:35:46,948
...Louwes and mister De Hond. But when
we say something, we are the liars

1071
01:35:50,120 --> 01:35:53,320
But then there is the point of
knowing the perpetrator.

1072
01:35:56,520 --> 01:35:57,520
Yes but...

1073
01:36:00,000 --> 01:36:02,000
I don't want to say anything about that.

1074
01:36:02,120 --> 01:36:04,937
At that time the police
questioned Michael about it

1075
01:36:05,609 --> 01:36:07,680
and decided not to prosecute him.

1076
01:36:09,101 --> 01:36:12,440
It doesn't make my story
any more credible, but...

1077
01:36:12,560 --> 01:36:14,480
But a DNA test will.

1078
01:36:14,835 --> 01:36:17,102
I presume you know
about the nail dirt?

1079
01:36:17,152 --> 01:36:19,720
Mr. Haan, my
client is not crazy.

1080
01:36:19,987 --> 01:36:25,360
I understand the risk,
but it could end all discussion.

1081
01:36:25,480 --> 01:36:30,040
Oh, just when I was beginning to believe
that your opportunism had limits.

1082
01:36:30,160 --> 01:36:32,640
It's definitely not that, but...

1083
01:36:32,760 --> 01:36:36,158
Look, if you do it
and you don't like the results

1084
01:36:36,208 --> 01:36:40,120
you can keep
sweep it under the rug.

1085
01:36:40,240 --> 01:36:41,560
Says the journalist.

1086
01:36:41,680 --> 01:36:44,240
You don't have to tell me anything.

1087
01:36:44,360 --> 01:36:46,624
Such a test can probably
be done anonymously.

1088
01:36:46,674 --> 01:36:50,560
Independently
and with a notary...

1089
01:36:50,680 --> 01:36:51,880
No, we'll do it.

1090
01:36:52,000 --> 01:36:55,773
- Michael.
- No, and I want Mr. Haan to film that.

1091
01:36:57,773 --> 01:37:00,640
So everyone can see,
huh, that there's...

1092
01:37:01,992 --> 01:37:04,040
- that it is clear.
- Michael.

1093
01:37:04,160 --> 01:37:06,360
One in 25 men has that profile.

1094
01:37:06,570 --> 01:37:08,854
And then I got it, so what?

1095
01:37:09,242 --> 01:37:13,240
Then everyone will think I did it.
What's the difference with now?

1096
01:37:16,720 --> 01:37:18,480
We're already dead anyway.

1097
01:37:36,760 --> 01:37:38,480
Don't make it too late...

1098
01:37:39,127 --> 01:37:41,630
The final report of Brouwer's
exploratory investigation

1099
01:37:41,680 --> 01:37:42,960
has been leaked.

1100
01:37:43,080 --> 01:37:44,205
Of course.

1101
01:37:44,760 --> 01:37:47,040
And? Any news?

1102
01:37:50,080 --> 01:37:51,212
No.

1103
01:37:51,462 --> 01:37:54,320
Then the motive and knowledge
of the perpetrator remain.

1104
01:37:58,880 --> 01:38:01,080
What did Michael himself say about it?

1105
01:38:01,629 --> 01:38:03,789
He doesn't want to
say anything about that.

1106
01:38:03,840 --> 01:38:05,367
I didn't ask about the motive.

1107
01:38:05,418 --> 01:38:09,003
- That wouldn't prove anything.
- What was it again?

1108
01:38:09,400 --> 01:38:12,960
Mrs Wittenberg would have
cut his bequest in half...

1109
01:38:13,080 --> 01:38:16,680
and he allegedly killed her
in a drunken brawl.

1110
01:38:18,080 --> 01:38:21,556
Well, that remains a point
for Maurice then.

1111
01:38:22,400 --> 01:38:24,480
If we assume that.

1112
01:38:53,812 --> 01:38:58,460
If Maurice and the judiciary have
determined that halving of the bequest..

1113
01:38:59,236 --> 01:39:01,413
then you have to explain me how.

1114
01:39:02,677 --> 01:39:03,917
This is the old one.

1115
01:39:06,385 --> 01:39:09,440
'To Mr. MC de Jong, free of duties
and costs...

1116
01:39:09,560 --> 01:39:13,560
an amount in cash of 25,000 guilders.'

1117
01:39:13,680 --> 01:39:15,200
This is the new one.

1118
01:39:15,986 --> 01:39:18,655
'To Mr. MC de Jong,
free of duties and costs...

1119
01:39:18,760 --> 01:39:21,720
an amount in cash
of 25,000 guilders.'

1120
01:39:21,840 --> 01:39:22,840
- No.
- Yes.

1121
01:39:24,828 --> 01:39:28,628
- And no one has ever checked this?
- No one. Yes, me now.

1122
01:39:38,320 --> 01:39:39,874
One more to go.

1123
01:39:40,320 --> 01:39:41,593
Yes.

1124
01:39:42,171 --> 01:39:45,554
But he doesn't want
to say anything about that. Anyway.

1125
01:39:46,530 --> 01:39:50,475
If the DNA test shows it isn't him,
then it isn't him.

1126
01:39:55,760 --> 01:39:57,440
Maybe he doesn't dare.

1127
01:39:58,440 --> 01:40:01,760
It's kind of like Russian roulette,
right?

1128
01:40:04,840 --> 01:40:06,000
Do you already have that one?

1129
01:40:07,680 --> 01:40:09,680
- With the door?
- Yes.

1130
01:40:17,758 --> 01:40:20,320
No, that's not going to work.
It's too dark.

1131
01:40:21,920 --> 01:40:22,960
Shit.

1132
01:40:23,080 --> 01:40:28,412
Sorry, we weren't ready yet.
Would you like to step out again?

1133
01:40:43,959 --> 01:40:45,799
- How is it going?
- Yes...

1134
01:40:46,720 --> 01:40:48,360
What are you doing, man?

1135
01:40:49,040 --> 01:40:51,240
Yeah, uh, I had to report myself.

1136
01:40:51,532 --> 01:40:52,612
For what?

1137
01:41:01,371 --> 01:41:04,080
Mr De Jong, come on in.

1138
01:41:07,120 --> 01:41:08,200
Hello.

1139
01:41:09,012 --> 01:41:10,080
Michael de Jong.

1140
01:41:10,200 --> 01:41:11,400
- Frans.
- Hi.

1141
01:41:21,558 --> 01:41:26,600
Several people stated that you had said
at Mrs Wittenberg's funeral...

1142
01:41:26,720 --> 01:41:30,600
that her body was found in the living
room and the time of the finding.

1143
01:41:31,400 --> 01:41:32,400
That's right?

1144
01:41:33,440 --> 01:41:35,455
Yes, everyone had questions.

1145
01:41:36,160 --> 01:41:38,040
And you had answers?

1146
01:41:40,600 --> 01:41:44,680
So unreal.
Last Wednesday I was still with her.

1147
01:41:46,572 --> 01:41:48,052
That's bizarre.

1148
01:41:50,160 --> 01:41:52,440
No one says or knows anything.

1149
01:41:59,373 --> 01:42:03,490
But how? That information was only
known to the police.

1150
01:42:04,357 --> 01:42:06,160
Oh that uh...

1151
01:42:06,280 --> 01:42:07,920
I did not know that.

1152
01:42:08,209 --> 01:42:10,320
Do you know what that means?

1153
01:42:11,618 --> 01:42:14,640
This means that you have
perpetrator knowledge.

1154
01:42:21,587 --> 01:42:23,640
Do you understand what I just said?

1155
01:42:24,120 --> 01:42:27,719
Yes, but it sounds so absurd.
Perpetrator knowledge.

1156
01:42:29,440 --> 01:42:31,720
How did you know she was laying there?

1157
01:42:34,000 --> 01:42:36,520
- I had heard that.
- From whom?

1158
01:42:39,040 --> 01:42:40,320
From someone.

1159
01:42:40,760 --> 01:42:42,000
Someone?

1160
01:42:44,210 --> 01:42:46,186
Come on, it's coming out anyway.

1161
01:42:48,811 --> 01:42:51,522
It must have been
a real massacre.

1162
01:42:51,774 --> 01:42:54,360
I overheard a
detective talking about it.

1163
01:42:54,480 --> 01:42:56,760
Five stabs to her chest.

1164
01:43:09,150 --> 01:43:11,158
So you protect the perpetrator?

1165
01:43:11,320 --> 01:43:13,600
I don't want
to get anyone in trouble.

1166
01:43:14,830 --> 01:43:17,840
If you continue like this,
you will be in trouble.

1167
01:43:19,289 --> 01:43:23,200
She didn't show up for a
hairdressing appointment on Saturday.

1168
01:43:23,320 --> 01:43:26,108
Her regular hairdresser
called the police.

1169
01:43:26,273 --> 01:43:28,200
The card said Thursday.

1170
01:43:28,320 --> 01:43:31,920
Then she was murdered.
They didn't find her until Saturday.

1171
01:43:32,040 --> 01:43:33,360
In the living room.

1172
01:43:35,240 --> 01:43:36,280
Well, hey.

1173
01:43:54,160 --> 01:43:55,920
Sst. Yes.

1174
01:44:01,800 --> 01:44:04,448
Well, has it been recorded?

1175
01:44:04,839 --> 01:44:06,640
Otherwise we'll do it again.

1176
01:44:06,760 --> 01:44:08,760
Then we are just as happy.

1177
01:44:14,423 --> 01:44:17,640
It's golden, Bas.
How many minutes do you need?

1178
01:44:17,760 --> 01:44:21,640
The exclusion of Michael on the
basis of the DNA test...

1179
01:44:21,760 --> 01:44:25,320
the new DNA evidence against Louwes,
his possible motive...

1180
01:44:25,440 --> 01:44:29,360
the interview with Professor Van Mourik
about this, the De Hond method...

1181
01:44:30,400 --> 01:44:31,760
The whole broadcast.

1182
01:44:32,291 --> 01:44:33,560
Well, you're in luck.

1183
01:44:33,680 --> 01:44:37,040
Rein needs more time for that
special on campaign finance,

1184
01:44:37,617 --> 01:44:38,832
so Wednesday.

1185
01:44:38,883 --> 01:44:40,520
- In two days?
- Yes.

1186
01:44:40,640 --> 01:44:43,200
I can't make it. There are
hours of material.

1187
01:44:43,320 --> 01:44:45,080
No, I understand.

1188
01:44:45,332 --> 01:44:49,200
Let's see. Well, then... yes, then
Tuesday. Next week. Can you manage that?

1189
01:44:50,200 --> 01:44:51,200
Yes.

1190
01:44:55,000 --> 01:44:59,319
It is absolutely
impossible that the...

1191
01:44:59,369 --> 01:45:03,280
handyman left the
DNA on the nails.

1192
01:45:03,400 --> 01:45:08,840
Eh, title of Eikelenboom. Then I would
do the microscope shot now.

1193
01:45:14,400 --> 01:45:16,080
Oh no, wait. uh...

1194
01:45:17,080 --> 01:45:20,454
Just put the quote from Vlug here,
that's better.

1195
01:45:21,095 --> 01:45:23,640
This is rock solid technical proof...

1196
01:45:23,760 --> 01:45:28,322
that Michael de Jong cannot be linked to
the murder in any way.

1197
01:45:37,880 --> 01:45:38,880
Yes.

1198
01:45:40,880 --> 01:45:43,560
Mireille, do you have those recordings
of Van Koppen?

1199
01:45:45,364 --> 01:45:48,040
- What is this?
- Maurice's weblog.

1200
01:45:48,755 --> 01:45:53,680
"Murder weapon in Deventer murder case
may be under the widow's tombstone."

1201
01:45:53,800 --> 01:45:58,400
"A metal object has been found that
strongly resembles a knife."

1202
01:45:58,520 --> 01:46:01,600
"I call on the judiciary to
open the grave."

1203
01:46:01,902 --> 01:46:05,800
- How does he get this?
- From the manager of the cemetery.

1204
01:46:05,920 --> 01:46:08,160
And he comes with this after
seven years?

1205
01:46:08,280 --> 01:46:11,160
He says the police didn't write
everything down at the time.

1206
01:46:11,280 --> 01:46:12,840
Bas, it's Vlug.

1207
01:46:14,920 --> 01:46:18,360
- Hello?
- Have you seen Maurice's website yet?

1208
01:46:18,740 --> 01:46:22,440
- Yes, I just saw it.
- When do you think you can broadcast?

1209
01:46:23,560 --> 01:46:26,760
- Next Tuesday.
- Only then?

1210
01:46:26,880 --> 01:46:27,888
Yes.

1211
01:46:28,263 --> 01:46:30,080
Then De Hond
can shoot for a week.

1212
01:46:30,200 --> 01:46:31,355
Yes.

1213
01:46:31,405 --> 01:46:34,080
This evening, Plasman is sitting
at 'Pauw & Witteman'.

1214
01:46:34,200 --> 01:46:37,128
How do I explain this
to Michael and Meike?

1215
01:46:37,380 --> 01:46:40,080
Yes, I know, but
it can't be sooner.

1216
01:46:40,200 --> 01:46:44,240
<i>Why didn't the cemetery manager
raise alarm sooner?</i>

1217
01:46:44,590 --> 01:46:49,680
<i>Eh, he did, he says. He was then
questioned by the police at the time.</i>

1218
01:46:50,064 --> 01:46:56,049
<i>Eh, there is also a mutation to
be found in the journal of the research.</i>

1219
01:46:56,960 --> 01:47:02,760
<i>Only he says: What I said then does not
correspond to what it says now.</i>

1220
01:47:02,880 --> 01:47:04,926
<i>He had given very
specific information.</i>

1221
01:47:05,059 --> 01:47:06,080
<i>What then?</i>

1222
01:47:06,200 --> 01:47:10,840
<i>That he spoke to the widow
on the morning of the murder.</i>

1223
01:47:10,960 --> 01:47:14,228
<i>And that she said, I'm going
to tell the handyman today...</i>

1224
01:47:14,278 --> 01:47:16,160
<i>that he is going out of my will.</i>

1225
01:47:16,381 --> 01:47:18,840
She couldn't do that at all, asshole.

1226
01:47:21,760 --> 01:47:25,880
<i>Maurice de Hond has put
together a German team.</i>

1227
01:47:26,000 --> 01:47:31,879
<i>They specialize in detecting
metal objects underground.</i>

1228
01:47:33,600 --> 01:47:34,600
With Bas.

1229
01:47:35,545 --> 01:47:36,360
Yes.

1230
01:47:37,800 --> 01:47:39,235
Yes I know.

1231
01:47:39,620 --> 01:47:41,055
I've seen it.

1232
01:47:42,200 --> 01:47:43,975
I'm going as fast as I can.

1233
01:47:44,760 --> 01:47:47,978
If everyone didn't disturb me all day...
Yes.

1234
01:47:48,440 --> 01:47:50,160
Okay. Yes.

1235
01:47:52,033 --> 01:47:54,885
<i>I cannot tell you what kind of
metal, but there is something.</i>

1236
01:47:55,252 --> 01:47:56,800
What now?

1237
01:47:56,920 --> 01:47:58,521
Oh sorry, it's you.

1238
01:47:58,840 --> 01:48:01,960
- The broadcast is moved to Monday.
- What?

1239
01:48:02,440 --> 01:48:05,157
A week later. Yes, sorry,
extra party leader debate...

1240
01:48:05,207 --> 01:48:06,680
and Wilders will also come.

1241
01:48:07,000 --> 01:48:08,788
Damn it Gerda,
you can't do that.

1242
01:48:08,838 --> 01:48:11,080
Do you know
how many times Vlug called?

1243
01:48:11,218 --> 01:48:14,800
Then you say that if we
don't broadcast that debate, RTL will.

1244
01:48:14,920 --> 01:48:18,834
At the same time. And then no one
will watch your report.

1245
01:48:20,010 --> 01:48:21,210
Sorry, Bas.

1246
01:48:26,160 --> 01:48:28,714
I thought you could use a shot.

1247
01:48:29,247 --> 01:48:30,287
Thank you.

1248
01:48:40,431 --> 01:48:43,120
<i>Is the grave now guarded?</i>

1249
01:48:43,240 --> 01:48:46,080
<i>- Of course.
- By who?</i>

1250
01:48:46,200 --> 01:48:49,520
<i>- By people.
- Yes, but is that police?</i>

1251
01:48:49,800 --> 01:48:52,800
<i>So not police,
it could be police now.</i>

1252
01:48:52,940 --> 01:48:55,600
Where does he pay it all from?

1253
01:48:55,720 --> 01:48:56,773
What do you mean?

1254
01:48:57,457 --> 01:48:59,840
How much do you think
such a Plasman costs?

1255
01:49:01,240 --> 01:49:04,880
- He's just there for the publicity.
- Even still.

1256
01:49:05,000 --> 01:49:10,880
Private detectives, a team of German
tomb investigators, 24/7 surveillance..

1257
01:49:15,900 --> 01:49:20,040
- I don't think that Gerda...
- Ah, Gerda. Just a few phone calls.

1258
01:49:21,360 --> 01:49:23,920
- Follow the money.
- Yes, indeed.

1259
01:49:33,960 --> 01:49:38,040
<i>It's 10 past 1. Good afternoon
and welcome to Stand.nl.</i>

1260
01:49:38,160 --> 01:49:43,800
<i>Our position: Maurice de Hond must
stop insinuating. Call 0800-1101.</i>

1261
01:49:43,920 --> 01:49:47,800
<i>- Good afternoon, this is Truus.
- Hello, Truus.</i>

1262
01:49:48,320 --> 01:49:54,200
<i>- I absolutely disagree. That
gentleman is absolutely innocent.</i>

1263
01:49:54,320 --> 01:49:58,693
<i>As he reacted on
TV to the statement...</i>

1264
01:49:58,743 --> 01:50:02,800
<i>Well, go on. Maurice de Hond, go on.</i>

1265
01:50:02,920 --> 01:50:04,960
<i>Thank you. Good afternoon.</i>

1266
01:50:05,509 --> 01:50:11,400
<i>Michael de J., that handyman,
is obviously not right in his head.</i>

1267
01:50:11,880 --> 01:50:15,960
<i>And the Deventer police force is
blackmailable as I'm concerned.</i>

1268
01:50:16,080 --> 01:50:19,040
<i>That handyman is completely stuck.
What do you think of that?</i>

1269
01:50:19,160 --> 01:50:22,908
<i>Let's stay away
from that lawsuit.</i>

1270
01:50:22,958 --> 01:50:26,200
<i>He's accusing an unconvicted.</i>

1271
01:50:26,320 --> 01:50:30,400
<i>Lady Justice has long since lost her
blindfold a long time ago.</i>

1272
01:50:30,520 --> 01:50:32,720
<i>He knows what he is doing.</i>

1273
01:50:33,240 --> 01:50:38,160
<i>6 a clock. The NOS Radio 1 Journal with
Karin van den Boogaert.</i>

1274
01:50:38,280 --> 01:50:42,280
<i>Because of growing social unrest,
the judge has decided...</i>

1275
01:50:42,400 --> 01:50:45,760
<i>to open the grave of the
widow Wittenberg.</i>

1276
01:50:47,520 --> 01:50:51,720
Unbelievable, what a circus!

1277
01:50:51,840 --> 01:50:53,960
<i>At 3:00 PM the grave has been lifted.</i>

1278
01:50:54,080 --> 01:50:57,720
<i>The stone is from the tomb and
is being examined for traces.</i>

1279
01:50:57,840 --> 01:51:03,400
<i>And much more importantly:
the knife can finally be searched for.</i>

1280
01:51:03,840 --> 01:51:08,240
<i>Each layer of sand is sieved.
Not an inch is looked over.</i>

1281
01:51:08,360 --> 01:51:14,164
<i>You always leave behind DNA...</i>

1282
01:51:15,440 --> 01:51:20,440
It was just announced that no knife
was found in the grave.

1283
01:51:20,560 --> 01:51:22,995
<i>The grave was opened
after Maurice de Hond...</i>

1284
01:51:23,045 --> 01:51:25,480
<i>suggested the murder
weapon might lay in the grave.</i>

1285
01:51:32,303 --> 01:51:34,520
I'm so glad we're airing on Monday.

1286
01:52:03,400 --> 01:52:07,280
- I made some more phone calls.
- What?

1287
01:52:07,586 --> 01:52:10,080
Don't you remember:
who pays for all this?

1288
01:52:23,040 --> 01:52:24,160
Holy fuck.

1289
01:52:25,880 --> 01:52:29,840
- Who is De Lange?
- What is De Lange is a better question.

1290
01:52:29,960 --> 01:52:31,040
OK, what?

1291
01:52:31,160 --> 01:52:36,000
He's rich. It's an entrepreneur
with parking garages, call centers...

1292
01:52:36,120 --> 01:52:38,884
And what does he have
to do with Maurice De Hond?

1293
01:52:38,934 --> 01:52:40,531
It's in this contract.

1294
01:52:42,279 --> 01:52:46,600
'...that the collaboration aside
from the Deventer murder case...

1295
01:52:46,720 --> 01:52:50,720
will consist of the establishment of a
socio-political organization...

1296
01:52:50,840 --> 01:52:54,440
with the provisional name Wij 21.'

1297
01:52:56,736 --> 01:53:00,240
So Deventer as the starting shot
of a political movement?

1298
01:53:00,360 --> 01:53:05,040
It says 'Maurice de Hond will take on
the role of eye-catcher.'

1299
01:53:05,160 --> 01:53:07,040
Handy, then he can poll himself.

1300
01:53:08,520 --> 01:53:10,040
This is really sick.

1301
01:53:10,900 --> 01:53:14,320
And then point three:
De Lange also wants his money back.

1302
01:53:14,440 --> 01:53:18,360
Maurice must then conduct a damage
procedure against the OM or the state.

1303
01:53:18,800 --> 01:53:23,640
In other words: Maurice has to litigate
all the way. No choice.

1304
01:53:23,936 --> 01:53:25,480
This should be on the air.

1305
01:53:26,011 --> 01:53:27,560
Do we have this exclusive?

1306
01:53:27,829 --> 01:53:30,520
Joep Dohmen beat me.
It is in the NRC this afternoon.

1307
01:53:30,640 --> 01:53:33,917
- Will you manage before tonight?
- No, impossible.

1308
01:53:35,220 --> 01:53:36,520
Okay, then Thursday.

1309
01:53:36,837 --> 01:53:38,480
That broadcast is almost done.

1310
01:53:38,600 --> 01:53:42,206
Then I'll ask Ellen to start
and we turn it around

1311
01:53:44,316 --> 01:53:48,543
No, sorry, no more delay.
I can't do that, not again.

1312
01:53:57,160 --> 01:53:58,960
Yes that's OK. Yes.

1313
01:54:06,080 --> 01:54:07,360
Get out, Haan.

1314
01:54:07,480 --> 01:54:09,840
- Good luck, huh.
- Come on, let's start.

1315
01:54:12,120 --> 01:54:15,840
Live in five, four, three...

1316
01:54:18,600 --> 01:54:22,880
Exculpatory DNA evidence in the
Deventer murder case. This is Network.

1317
01:54:23,000 --> 01:54:26,400
Oh, Meike, it's starting.

1318
01:54:41,480 --> 01:54:44,160
<i>Hello, ladies and gentlemen.
Good evening.</i>

1319
01:54:44,280 --> 01:54:47,680
<i>New facts in the controversial
Deventer murder case.</i>

1320
01:54:47,908 --> 01:54:53,000
<i>A case that has grown into a battle
with supporters and opponents.</i>

1321
01:54:53,640 --> 01:54:58,160
<i>One is convinced that Ernest Louwes
has been rightly convicted.</i>

1322
01:54:58,280 --> 01:55:03,338
<i>The other thinks the murdered widow's
handyman must have done it.</i>

1323
01:55:03,920 --> 01:55:06,280
<i>What is the truth in this murder case?</i>

1324
01:55:06,605 --> 01:55:11,320
<i>Reporter Bas Haan investigated the case
and uncovered new facts...</i>

1325
01:55:11,440 --> 01:55:16,600
<i>about exculpatory DNA evidence
and a possible motive.</i>

1326
01:55:16,720 --> 01:55:20,120
<i>Seven years ago, the widow was murdered.</i>

1327
01:55:20,240 --> 01:55:23,800
<i>The Deventer murder case is now one
of the most sensational...</i>

1328
01:55:23,920 --> 01:55:26,760
<i>criminal cases, thanks to the
actions of Maurice de Hond.</i>

1329
01:55:26,880 --> 01:55:29,720
<i>Last week the widow's grave
was opened...</i>

1330
01:55:29,840 --> 01:55:33,520
<i>in search of the handyman's
murder weapon.</i>

1331
01:55:33,640 --> 01:55:38,720
<i>In vain. The handyman's lawyer is now
demanding a gag order against De Hond.</i>

1332
01:55:38,840 --> 01:55:44,087
<i>Just try defend yourself against
De Hond and such press offensive.</i>

1333
01:55:44,138 --> 01:55:45,320
<i>That's almost impossible.</i>

1334
01:55:45,422 --> 01:55:46,927
<i>I've done everything...</i>

1335
01:55:47,006 --> 01:55:51,878
<i>to update the Dutch
people via my website.</i>

1336
01:55:52,560 --> 01:55:55,919
<i>De Hond is convinced that the
DNA evidence is worthless.</i>

1337
01:55:56,160 --> 01:56:00,520
<i>But this story is not about
conspiracy theories, but about facts.</i>

1338
01:56:00,640 --> 01:56:06,120
<i>The DNA in this case is crucial.
And now comes another revelation.</i>

1339
01:56:06,240 --> 01:56:10,200
<i>Additional DNA testing
relieves the handyman.</i>

1340
01:56:10,320 --> 01:56:16,200
<i>It is absolutely impossible that the
handyman left the DNA on the nails.</i>

1341
01:56:16,320 --> 01:56:19,320
<i>This is rock solid technical proof...</i>

1342
01:56:19,920 --> 01:56:24,182
<i>that Michael de Jong cannot be
linked to the murder in any way.</i>

1343
01:56:58,735 --> 01:57:00,440
Well.

1344
01:57:00,840 --> 01:57:02,017
Yes.

1345
01:57:02,640 --> 01:57:03,708
Basje.

1346
01:57:04,120 --> 01:57:05,120
Gerda.

1347
01:57:06,506 --> 01:57:08,400
- Well done.
- Thank you.

1348
01:57:08,748 --> 01:57:11,120
- Hey, hoppakee.
- Nice man.

1349
01:57:11,454 --> 01:57:13,480
- Top.
- Thanks to you, huh.

1350
01:57:13,600 --> 01:57:16,640
- Let's go have a drink somewhere.
- Good plan.

1351
01:57:16,760 --> 01:57:19,240
Well done.

1352
01:57:24,320 --> 01:57:25,320
Come on.

1353
01:57:32,000 --> 01:57:33,520
Good? -Ja.

1354
01:57:33,640 --> 01:57:34,640
All right.

1355
01:57:49,600 --> 01:57:52,280
Sorry, are you perhaps Bas Haan?

1356
01:57:52,400 --> 01:57:53,560
Certainly.

1357
01:57:53,680 --> 01:57:57,080
Do you have
Richard Eikelenboom's number?

1358
01:57:58,842 --> 01:58:00,360
What do you need that for?

1359
01:58:01,122 --> 01:58:05,160
'Reporter' is going to make an hour and
a half special about the Deventer case.

1360
01:58:05,720 --> 01:58:07,040
Is there any news then?

1361
01:58:07,244 --> 01:58:13,080
An American DNA expert declares that
the evidence against Louwes is nothing.

1362
01:58:16,216 --> 01:58:19,250
So what does the expert say
about the combination...

1363
01:58:19,300 --> 01:58:22,080
of saliva, touch marks,
blood and nail dirt?

1364
01:58:22,880 --> 01:58:24,120
Which nail dirt?

1365
01:58:24,240 --> 01:58:26,113
Have you seen my report?

1366
01:58:26,654 --> 01:58:29,080
Or are you going to
say: Which report?

1367
01:58:33,361 --> 01:58:35,040
Do you still have
that number for me?

1368
01:58:35,679 --> 01:58:37,094
What do you think?

1369
01:58:42,800 --> 01:58:45,240
Better look at my report first, fool!

1370
01:58:46,600 --> 01:58:50,640
<i>Thank God it's Friday.</i>

1371
01:58:50,908 --> 01:58:53,914
<i>Tonight, Yolanthe Cabau van Kasbergen..</i>

1372
01:58:53,964 --> 01:58:56,861
<i>Arthur Japin, Javier Guzman...</i>

1373
01:58:57,119 --> 01:59:00,603
<i>Bastiaan Geleijnse,
Don Diego Powder...</i>

1374
01:59:00,653 --> 01:59:03,119
<i>Pieter Jan Hagens,
Maurice de Hond...</i>

1375
01:59:03,240 --> 01:59:05,640
<i>and Claudia de Breij.</i>

1376
01:59:06,640 --> 01:59:09,752
They didn't take anything away
from my broadcast.

1377
01:59:10,837 --> 01:59:12,799
They didn't even see it.

1378
01:59:15,448 --> 01:59:18,000
Like it never fucking aired.

1379
01:59:30,160 --> 01:59:33,471
<i>- Here is Maurice the Hond.</i>
- What the fuck.

1380
01:59:54,920 --> 01:59:57,960
<i>Maurice, yesterday sentenced to
two months conditional</i>

1381
01:59:58,080 --> 02:00:03,480
<i>Does his mean you can never say
again: the handyman did it?</i>

1382
02:00:03,600 --> 02:00:09,560
<i>If I don't comply with the ruling,
I will be jailed for two months.</i>

1383
02:00:09,680 --> 02:00:13,840
<i>Are you never going to say again:
Michael de Jong did it?</i>

1384
02:00:13,960 --> 02:00:17,640
<i>I am prepared to do a lot for
this program...</i>

1385
02:00:17,760 --> 02:00:20,485
<i>but not prison for two months.</i>

1386
02:00:20,535 --> 02:00:23,463
<i>No, but I was
wondering because you...</i>

1387
02:00:23,920 --> 02:00:29,280
<i>I admire your fanaticism in this case.
And your sense of justice.</i>

1388
02:00:29,400 --> 02:00:33,880
<i>If you can't say it, can you sing it?</i>

1389
02:00:34,000 --> 02:00:37,240
<i>- I think only Jan Smit.
- Only Jan Smit.</i>

1390
02:00:37,360 --> 02:00:41,360
<i>Because I was thinking about…</i>

1391
02:00:41,480 --> 02:00:42,480
<i>about...</i>

1392
02:00:43,920 --> 02:00:47,920
<i>thinking about 'the Deventer
murder case: the musical'.</i>

1393
02:02:03,760 --> 02:02:05,288
Fucking circus.

1394
02:02:06,446 --> 02:02:10,840
If more than 200,000 people have
watched that crap, I'll write a book.

1395
02:02:10,960 --> 02:02:12,360
- A book?
- A book.

1396
02:02:12,980 --> 02:02:16,760
No broadcast schedule, budget,
so few minutes to cram it all into.

1397
02:02:16,880 --> 02:02:20,800
Just a book. With all the facts about
the case. All the facts.

1398
02:02:20,920 --> 02:02:22,740
Do you think people
are waiting for that?

1399
02:02:22,790 --> 02:02:25,440
Yes, people want to know
what's really going on.

1400
02:02:25,560 --> 02:02:27,237
I firmly believe that.

1401
02:02:27,819 --> 02:02:32,360
But it is made them incredibly difficult
by people who throw sand in their eyes.

1402
02:02:32,480 --> 02:02:36,880
I want to be able to say: Do you want
the facts? There they are, in that book.

1403
02:02:37,000 --> 02:02:42,160
Researched, checked and checked again.
And if you want to ignore them...

1404
02:02:42,280 --> 02:02:44,995
they are still there.
Those facts exist...

1405
02:02:45,045 --> 02:02:47,360
are real, and are not going away.

1406
02:02:48,540 --> 02:02:49,569
What?

1407
02:02:49,620 --> 02:02:52,960
Do you know how many books are
published per year?

1408
02:02:53,080 --> 02:02:56,440
I'll make sure people know it's there.

1409
02:02:56,560 --> 02:02:58,473
If necessary, I will
enter the circus myself.

1410
02:02:59,035 --> 02:03:00,400
The circus?

1411
02:03:00,486 --> 02:03:02,698
January 2009

1412
02:03:35,680 --> 02:03:39,160
It is one of the most talked
about lawsuits of all time.

1413
02:03:39,280 --> 02:03:42,200
Who killed the wealthy widow
Wittenberg in 1999?

1414
02:03:42,320 --> 02:03:47,040
Ernest Louwes was convicted, acquitted
and then through DNA testing...

1415
02:03:47,160 --> 02:03:50,960
sentenced to 12 years.
29 judges were involved in the case.

1416
02:03:51,079 --> 02:03:53,524
But in the press, a campaign
led by Maurice de Hond

1417
02:03:53,574 --> 02:03:55,199
questioned
the course of justice.

1418
02:03:55,320 --> 02:03:57,400
The grave has even been opened.

1419
02:03:57,457 --> 02:04:00,691
Journalist Bas Haan wrote <i>'De Deventer
murder case: the conspiracy unraveled'</i>

1420
02:04:00,793 --> 02:04:01,817
Welcome

1421
02:04:01,920 --> 02:04:04,240
You have been on this case
for a long time.

1422
02:04:04,302 --> 02:04:08,184
Tonight I will ask you the question you
surely get asked all the time:

1423
02:04:08,917 --> 02:04:12,080
Who did it?
The handyman, or Ernest Louwes?

1424
02:04:15,357 --> 02:04:18,243
Maurice de Hond
was sentenced for libel,

1425
02:04:18,293 --> 02:04:21,639
and ordered to pay
35.000 Euro in compensation

1426
02:04:21,689 --> 02:04:24,962
to Michael de Jong
and his girlfriend Meike.

1427
02:04:25,048 --> 02:04:30,271
A, for Dutch standards,
exceptionally high figure.

1428
02:04:30,321 --> 02:04:36,196
He never retracted any of
his accusations against Michael de Jong.

1429
02:04:36,782 --> 02:04:39,383
Michael de Jong could
never find a job again.

1430
02:04:39,433 --> 02:04:41,496
Michael has an autoimmune disease.

1431
02:04:41,547 --> 02:04:45,731
Medical research has shown that
the chance of getting this disease

1432
02:04:45,781 --> 02:04:48,434
is greatly increased
by chronical stress.

1433
02:04:48,547 --> 02:04:54,120
The financial compensation of 35.000
Euro was entirely spend on legal costs.

1434
02:04:54,785 --> 02:04:59,213
Ernest Louwes served his sentence and
is currently an employed citizen again.

1435
02:04:59,263 --> 02:05:03,342
He still fights for his acquittal
through his lawyer Knoops.

1436
02:05:03,397 --> 02:05:10,626
In 2014 the Supreme court started researching
a possible re-opening of the case.

1437
02:05:10,889 --> 02:05:13,013
In consultation with Knoops,

1438
02:05:13,063 --> 02:05:17,708
an English DNA expert
has been appointed for a third opinion".

1439
02:05:17,758 --> 02:05:19,553
In 2019, the expert also confirmed

1440
02:05:19,603 --> 02:05:23,112
the most important conclusions
of the NFI about the DNA evidence,

1441
02:05:23,162 --> 02:05:25,289
the basis for
the conviction of Louwes.

1442
02:05:25,844 --> 02:05:31,063
Bas Haan is currently
a research journalist for Nieuwsuur.

1443
02:05:31,118 --> 02:05:34,143
His reporting
has received numerous awards

1444
02:05:34,193 --> 02:05:39,978
Among them "De Tegel" three times, the
most important Dutch journalistic prize.

1445
02:05:40,028 --> 02:05:43,738
In 2015 he was chosen
as journalist of the year.

1446
02:05:44,238 --> 02:05:48,463
Nothing has been heard anymore
from the political movement "Wij 21",

1447
02:05:48,513 --> 02:05:51,113
which was founded by
de Hond en de Lange.
