1
00:00:27,543 --> 00:00:33,125
SMALL TOWN KILLERS

2
00:00:46,584 --> 00:00:47,708
Well...

3
00:00:47,834 --> 00:00:50,750
So, all you think about is sex?

4
00:00:50,876 --> 00:00:53,375
His head is bursting with sex thoughts.

5
00:00:53,501 --> 00:00:58,875
Gritt, let's let Ib answer for himself.
I think Ib is able to.

6
00:00:59,001 --> 00:01:03,708
Well, answer for yourself, Ib. Tell
Aniannani that your head is full of sex.

7
00:01:03,834 --> 00:01:08,375
No, no, I do sometimes have
other thoughts in my head.

8
00:01:08,501 --> 00:01:11,541
If I ask him to water the plants,
he gets a hard-on.

9
00:01:11,667 --> 00:01:15,125
- Oh?
- He can't even reach the window sill.

10
00:01:15,251 --> 00:01:17,541
Oh my.

11
00:01:17,667 --> 00:01:20,875
It's only because
I think she's so gorgeous.

12
00:01:21,001 --> 00:01:25,666
Well, that's great, Gritt.
Isn't it?

13
00:01:25,792 --> 00:01:30,708
You have a man who wants you.
I'm sure many women would envy you that.

14
00:01:30,834 --> 00:01:34,375
Sure, but does everything have
to be about sex all the time?

15
00:01:34,501 --> 00:01:37,375
The public domain is crammed with sex.

16
00:01:37,501 --> 00:01:40,208
- You can't even open a magazine.
- No...

17
00:01:40,334 --> 00:01:44,708
If I go online to find a good offer,
I get a picture of a wiener.

18
00:01:45,834 --> 00:01:46,916
Yuckie.

19
00:01:47,042 --> 00:01:50,291
And if you can't even
go to your own house -

20
00:01:50,417 --> 00:01:54,041
- and lie down in your own bed without
being confronted with sex there, too...

21
00:01:54,167 --> 00:01:57,791
Where the devil will it end?

22
00:01:58,501 --> 00:02:02,625
Hi there, you hot piece of ass.

23
00:02:02,751 --> 00:02:05,291
Hi.

24
00:02:05,417 --> 00:02:07,666
So, who are you then?

25
00:02:07,792 --> 00:02:10,666
Oh, I'm just Ingrid's ass.

26
00:02:10,792 --> 00:02:12,583
Oh, I see.

27
00:02:12,709 --> 00:02:16,791
How would you like me to grope you?

28
00:02:16,917 --> 00:02:18,458
Well, go ahead.

29
00:02:18,584 --> 00:02:23,916
Stop talking to my butt as if
it's a pet. You'll confuse Little Per.

30
00:02:24,042 --> 00:02:27,041
You're making me nervous.
It's sick, Edward.

31
00:02:27,167 --> 00:02:29,477
Why do you have to rehearse
that fancy-pants dance every night?

32
00:02:29,501 --> 00:02:33,083
Fancy-pants dance?
Salsa is an art form.

33
00:02:33,209 --> 00:02:37,458
But then again, your head isn't filled
with art but stone wool, more like it.

34
00:02:37,584 --> 00:02:41,791
When was the last time we fucked?
When was it?

35
00:02:41,917 --> 00:02:46,000
- Do you know your Danish history?
- Sure. I live with the Grauballe Man.

36
00:02:46,084 --> 00:02:49,916
- That bog body gets more sex than me.
- Call Ib.

37
00:02:50,042 --> 00:02:54,625
- I'm not in the mood for sex with Ib.
- Don't you have to go to work?

38
00:02:54,751 --> 00:02:58,125
You and Ib and your wieners.

39
00:02:58,251 --> 00:03:01,833
Maybe they'll let you
have a go after work.

40
00:04:20,251 --> 00:04:22,916
Don't be embarrassed about being a man.

41
00:04:23,042 --> 00:04:26,833
But I think about sex all the time.

42
00:04:29,042 --> 00:04:31,625
It's because you never get laid.

43
00:04:31,751 --> 00:04:35,250
If you did, you wouldn't
think about it all the time.

44
00:04:35,376 --> 00:04:36,500
It's like breathing.

45
00:04:36,626 --> 00:04:40,791
If you were sitting in a submarine
running out of oxygen -

46
00:04:40,917 --> 00:04:43,000
- you'd think about breathing
all the time.

47
00:04:43,126 --> 00:04:46,541
Women don't understand
that sex is our way of breathing.

48
00:04:46,667 --> 00:04:49,000
Our dick is kinda like our third lung.

49
00:04:50,417 --> 00:04:54,250
Gritt still wants to have kids,
but I'm not keen on it.

50
00:04:54,376 --> 00:04:58,500
Of course not. They climb into bed
and lie in the crack.

51
00:04:58,626 --> 00:05:04,333
Kids are crap.
There's no upside to it. None at all.

52
00:05:04,459 --> 00:05:07,458
There's nothing doing with Ingrid.
She doesn't want to have sex.

53
00:05:07,584 --> 00:05:10,416
Even if I promise
it'll only take 15 seconds.

54
00:05:10,542 --> 00:05:14,791
So, problems at home?

55
00:05:14,917 --> 00:05:18,500
The bricks are on back order,
Mrs. Hansen. It's a load of bull.

56
00:05:18,626 --> 00:05:21,250
But aren't bricks always available?

57
00:05:21,376 --> 00:05:25,416
Bricks aren't just bricks,
as I've told you once before.

58
00:05:25,542 --> 00:05:30,916
- I just need a new wall.
- Right, and Rome was built in a day.

59
00:05:31,042 --> 00:05:35,541
I clean forgot.
Thanks for reminding me, Mrs. Hansen.

60
00:05:35,667 --> 00:05:37,125
Thanks a lot.

61
00:05:37,251 --> 00:05:40,125
There are two kinds of customers.

62
00:05:40,251 --> 00:05:43,041
With one kind,
you're only in it for the cool cash.

63
00:05:43,167 --> 00:05:46,250
With the other kind, like you,
you put your heart into it.

64
00:05:46,376 --> 00:05:49,833
- And finish the job!
- Yes, absolutely.

65
00:05:50,001 --> 00:05:53,583
Van Gogh didn't paint for the money.
He painted with his heart.

66
00:05:53,709 --> 00:05:57,875
Are you quite sure
you've got time for this?

67
00:05:59,792 --> 00:06:02,000
Hey, there's our radio and stuff.

68
00:06:02,084 --> 00:06:05,916
We wouldn't leave our radio and stuff
here if we weren't working here.

69
00:06:06,042 --> 00:06:09,416
Ib has been on the phone all morning
about those bricks.

70
00:06:09,542 --> 00:06:13,000
We almost gave up on you,
but then, your radio and stuff are here.

71
00:06:13,834 --> 00:06:17,458
- Honestly, have you got time for this?
- No...

72
00:06:17,584 --> 00:06:20,041
- Look, Steen.
- Henrik.

73
00:06:20,167 --> 00:06:24,916
There are two kinds of customers. With
one kind, you're in it for the cash.

74
00:06:25,042 --> 00:06:27,875
- With the other, you put this into it.
- Your heart.

75
00:06:28,001 --> 00:06:30,250
That's what you said a month ago.

76
00:06:36,042 --> 00:06:40,625
I thought you wanted the bill dealt with
under the table.

77
00:06:44,001 --> 00:06:48,833
Didn't they want the bill dealt with
under the table? I thought so.

78
00:06:49,001 --> 00:06:55,125
But, Steen,
we'll do it by the book. No worries.

79
00:06:55,251 --> 00:06:59,166
It's gonna cost you, but if you want
to upgrade to Business Class -

80
00:06:59,292 --> 00:07:03,416
- we'll do it. We can upgrade Steen
and Pernille to Business Class, right?

81
00:07:03,542 --> 00:07:09,916
Sure. You get to sit up front with
champagne and silverware everywhere.

82
00:07:10,042 --> 00:07:13,500
No, no, that's not
what we want, right, Henrik?

83
00:07:13,626 --> 00:07:16,083
No, no.

84
00:07:16,209 --> 00:07:21,083
- We'll just wait.
- Or we can wait. Whatever you want.

85
00:07:22,834 --> 00:07:27,000
We've filled the book for the next six
months. How manyjobs are undeclared?

86
00:07:27,126 --> 00:07:29,541
Just about half a million kroner.

87
00:07:33,709 --> 00:07:37,583
Ingrid is faking it the other way round.

88
00:07:37,709 --> 00:07:41,000
- The few times I get to sneak it in.
- The other way round?

89
00:07:41,126 --> 00:07:46,208
She pretends not to come, but she does.
I can tell that she's coming, Ib.

90
00:07:46,334 --> 00:07:50,250
She stuffs her hand in her mouth
and thinks I don't notice.

91
00:07:53,042 --> 00:07:57,625
But she's coming alright.
She's coming hard.

92
00:07:57,751 --> 00:08:01,041
- But why does she do that?
- So I won't see I give her pleasure.

93
00:08:01,167 --> 00:08:03,750
Oh no, Heinz.

94
00:08:07,876 --> 00:08:11,041
Hey there, Laurel and Hardy.
Hans and Fritz.

95
00:08:11,167 --> 00:08:14,500
Or what are the names of
the two guys from Dumb and Dumber?

96
00:08:14,626 --> 00:08:19,000
- Harry and Lloyd.
- Exactly. How's life, Harry and Lloyd?

97
00:08:19,084 --> 00:08:23,708
Careful or you might shoot yourself
in the thigh with that thing.

98
00:08:23,834 --> 00:08:27,750
This thing...
is a Korth Combat. 357 Magnum.

99
00:08:27,876 --> 00:08:31,500
It goes by another name, too.
"Responsibility".

100
00:08:31,626 --> 00:08:34,106
The responsibility for making sure
citizens can sleep at night.

101
00:08:34,209 --> 00:08:37,750
- Do you tuck in?
- Terrorists don't sleep at night.

102
00:08:37,876 --> 00:08:40,458
Some people have to be vigilant, 24-7.

103
00:08:40,584 --> 00:08:44,750
You may very well ask:
What's gonna happen in Nibe?

104
00:08:45,626 --> 00:08:50,458
We go to work, watch X Factor, drive
scummy cars and eat humid sandwiches.

105
00:08:50,584 --> 00:08:53,000
Peace and quiet everywhere.

106
00:08:53,126 --> 00:08:55,458
But that's just
what they want us to believe.

107
00:08:55,584 --> 00:08:58,916
Nibe doesn't even show up
on Google Earth.

108
00:08:59,042 --> 00:09:03,208
It's one big grey pixel. The little
yellow man can't move an inch.

109
00:09:04,084 --> 00:09:08,833
Anyway, what would the terrorists
blow up? The local bus stop?

110
00:09:12,126 --> 00:09:16,750
- What do you need all those radios for?
- You can learn a lot from the radio.

111
00:09:16,876 --> 00:09:20,083
I just checked up on your tax returns.

112
00:09:20,209 --> 00:09:25,000
Your little juggernaut of a company
sure rakes in money.

113
00:09:25,084 --> 00:09:28,000
- 125,000 kroner a year.
- That much?

114
00:09:28,126 --> 00:09:30,458
Not bad.

115
00:09:30,584 --> 00:09:33,083
You're frigging pathetic.

116
00:09:33,209 --> 00:09:37,000
Your wives drive Mercedes
and dance in high heels with Malte -

117
00:09:37,126 --> 00:09:41,041
- while you sit here looking like a
couple of early retirees from Bulgaria.

118
00:09:41,167 --> 00:09:45,125
Dumb and Dumber.
Don't make me laugh.

119
00:09:50,209 --> 00:09:53,791
Your right tail light is out.
Have a nice day.

120
00:09:55,751 --> 00:09:59,791
Come here, my angels.
Come.

121
00:10:00,709 --> 00:10:06,583
We may be in a small town,
but we don't think small -

122
00:10:06,709 --> 00:10:10,166
- because salsa is in-ter-na-tio-nal.

123
00:10:10,292 --> 00:10:14,583
Understand? When we shake
our booties to salsa in Nibe -

124
00:10:14,709 --> 00:10:18,666
- they shake their booties
to salsa in Cuba or Rio -

125
00:10:18,792 --> 00:10:21,000
- in exactly the same way.

126
00:10:21,126 --> 00:10:25,250
We're one big family.
One big pulse -

127
00:10:25,376 --> 00:10:29,083
- beating away inside of us -

128
00:10:29,209 --> 00:10:32,416
- men and women.

129
00:10:33,209 --> 00:10:37,916
We started this class
when fate brought me to Nibe.

130
00:10:38,042 --> 00:10:44,291
And I saw all these withered Danes
under the grey sky.

131
00:10:45,417 --> 00:10:47,208
Then something happened.

132
00:10:47,334 --> 00:10:52,208
Suddenly you grew
into goddamn towering tulips.

133
00:10:52,334 --> 00:10:56,166
Up through the frozen earth,
and you blossomed -

134
00:10:56,292 --> 00:11:00,791
- and tasted
the sweet pain of the salsa.

135
00:11:02,084 --> 00:11:05,708
Desire and sensuality.

136
00:11:07,001 --> 00:11:12,791
And now, dear friends,
it's time to "haul ass", as you say.

137
00:11:12,917 --> 00:11:16,000
- Are you ready to haul ass?
- Yes!

138
00:11:16,667 --> 00:11:19,375
Five, six, seven, eight.

139
00:11:28,751 --> 00:11:32,250
Come to Papa!

140
00:11:42,876 --> 00:11:45,166
Salsa for Papi!

141
00:11:54,292 --> 00:11:57,708
Malte is such a breath offresh air.

142
00:11:57,834 --> 00:12:01,500
It doesn't matter if you're from
Nibe or Hollywood.

143
00:12:01,626 --> 00:12:04,916
You grow with him.
I feel I've grown.

144
00:12:05,042 --> 00:12:07,791
Malte has helped us grow, hasn't he?

145
00:12:07,917 --> 00:12:12,291
If Malte wasn't gay,
I bet he'd be a fantastic lover.

146
00:12:12,417 --> 00:12:13,291
Hey!

147
00:12:13,417 --> 00:12:16,083
You can be a good lover
even though you're abnormal.

148
00:12:16,209 --> 00:12:19,875
- Got anything against gays?
- Edward's afraid of gays.

149
00:12:20,001 --> 00:12:24,500
I just don't get gay sex.
Two little bald men headbutting away.

150
00:12:24,626 --> 00:12:28,000
- Men have a hole too.
- Made for something else.

151
00:12:28,084 --> 00:12:31,125
Oh, I don't know.
Ib often circles around that hole.

152
00:12:31,251 --> 00:12:34,583
- Come on, Gritt!
- Like a hungry cat around a pâté.

153
00:12:34,709 --> 00:12:37,625
But that's one way
to avoid having children.

154
00:12:37,751 --> 00:12:41,000
When Edward and I loved each other,
we talked about children, too -

155
00:12:41,084 --> 00:12:43,041
- but then we got Little Per.

156
00:12:43,167 --> 00:12:47,583
- Little Per is your surrogate child.
- Hell no!

157
00:12:47,709 --> 00:12:52,916
Is it wrong, if your husband's sperm
quality is okay, to look for a donor?

158
00:12:53,042 --> 00:12:58,583
Women should be free to use the sperm
they want. And Ib doesn't want kids.

159
00:12:58,709 --> 00:13:02,458
Try talking a bit louder.
Table 5 can't hear you.

160
00:13:02,584 --> 00:13:06,000
- It must be hard with a guy his size.
- For fuck's sake!

161
00:13:06,126 --> 00:13:11,625
I often think about it when I see you
side by side. He's huge and you're tiny.

162
00:13:11,751 --> 00:13:14,250
- How does he...
- Get it in?

163
00:13:14,376 --> 00:13:18,833
- Yes, technically.
- Well, he only manages to peek in.

164
00:13:19,001 --> 00:13:23,208
- Kinda like the Little Match Girl.
- "Hullo!"

165
00:13:26,251 --> 00:13:29,125
In a little turtleneck.

166
00:13:30,626 --> 00:13:35,375
It's all down to position. No guy can
get in from all corners of the world.

167
00:13:35,501 --> 00:13:38,875
And it's down to how wide
the woman can spread her legs.

168
00:13:39,001 --> 00:13:42,333
- What do you mean, Edward?
- Is this wine sour?

169
00:13:42,459 --> 00:13:48,000
It's sour!
Bent, what kind of red wine is this?

170
00:13:50,167 --> 00:13:53,083
It is...

171
00:13:53,209 --> 00:13:56,500
It is...

172
00:13:58,334 --> 00:14:00,500
It is -

173
00:14:00,626 --> 00:14:03,208
- a red wine.

174
00:14:03,334 --> 00:14:07,583
- Well, I can see that. It's red.
- Leave Bent alone.

175
00:14:07,709 --> 00:14:11,250
- Fine, Bent. Thanks.
- You're welcome.

176
00:14:11,376 --> 00:14:15,333
Who the hell hires a spazz as a waiter?
How does he serve soup?

177
00:14:15,459 --> 00:14:20,250
- I'd like to announce to the table...
- Good thing he isn't a brain surgeon.

178
00:14:20,376 --> 00:14:25,583
I have no problem spreading my legs.
I could do the splits until recently.

179
00:14:25,709 --> 00:14:30,166
Gritt's parents thought for a long time
that Gritt would become a model -

180
00:14:30,292 --> 00:14:34,791
- but then she stopped growing
at the age of 12.

181
00:14:37,292 --> 00:14:39,333
Right!

182
00:14:39,459 --> 00:14:44,000
I guess five-foot tall models
aren't in huge demand -

183
00:14:44,084 --> 00:14:47,875
- unless it's for a hobbit movie.

184
00:14:49,459 --> 00:14:54,500
But hey, good for fairy Malte
that he makes you grow and grow -

185
00:14:54,626 --> 00:14:58,458
- and believe that Hollywood
is located in the church -

186
00:14:58,584 --> 00:15:02,083
- every day between 8 and 10 p. m.

187
00:15:13,709 --> 00:15:18,208
- Ib, we're done with this shit.
- What do you mean?

188
00:15:19,376 --> 00:15:23,666
Heinz is right.
We are Dumb and Dumber.

189
00:15:25,001 --> 00:15:29,375
But we're still young, Ib.
We've got money -

190
00:15:29,501 --> 00:15:34,333
- and we've worked our asses off
ever since we got kicked out of school.

191
00:15:34,459 --> 00:15:38,166
Let's go to Phuket.
We can live like kings there.

192
00:15:38,292 --> 00:15:40,500
We deserve better.

193
00:15:40,626 --> 00:15:45,666
I didn't like the atmosphere in there.
It got a little embarrassing.

194
00:15:45,792 --> 00:15:50,041
Yeah, just a little perhaps.
You're right, Ib.

195
00:15:50,167 --> 00:15:54,250
And we won't get any pussy tonight,
anyway.

196
00:15:57,501 --> 00:15:59,666
Precisely.

197
00:16:01,251 --> 00:16:05,000
We lead an empty and pussy-less life.

198
00:16:09,376 --> 00:16:12,250
- Let's get a divorce.
- You mean that?

199
00:16:12,376 --> 00:16:14,333
I sure as hell do!

200
00:16:19,167 --> 00:16:22,250
- Who recommended me to you?
- No one.

201
00:16:22,376 --> 00:16:25,083
You were the cheapest hit
on PriceRunner.

202
00:16:26,376 --> 00:16:31,041
- You want a divorce?
- Yes. It's gone all Bulgarian on us.

203
00:16:31,167 --> 00:16:34,750
- It's gotten boring.
- Any infidelity?

204
00:16:34,876 --> 00:16:39,000
Not unless dancing with a sissy Swede
qualifies as infidelity.

205
00:16:39,084 --> 00:16:42,375
- So is that you?
- Me?

206
00:16:42,501 --> 00:16:45,000
Who dances around
with a sissy Swede?

207
00:16:45,084 --> 00:16:48,000
We're not the ones getting a divorce.
Hell no.

208
00:16:48,126 --> 00:16:53,208
- No, we're married to our wife.
- To the same woman? But you can't!

209
00:16:53,334 --> 00:16:56,083
- No, we've got one each.
- I see.

210
00:16:56,209 --> 00:17:00,208
So you want to divorce your wives
so you two can get married?

211
00:17:00,334 --> 00:17:03,000
No, we just want to divorce them.

212
00:17:03,084 --> 00:17:06,666
We thought we'd save money
if we chipped in.

213
00:17:06,792 --> 00:17:10,833
- Chipped in?
- Yeah, for you.

214
00:17:12,001 --> 00:17:16,833
- Yes, well, the divorce rules...
- Let me just say one thing.

215
00:17:17,001 --> 00:17:21,375
We want to take good care of the girls.
They must never want for anything.

216
00:17:21,501 --> 00:17:24,500
They haven't lifted a finger
in ten years -

217
00:17:24,626 --> 00:17:28,625
- but we won't leave them in the ditch
without a penny.

218
00:17:28,751 --> 00:17:32,500
- I agree.
- The rules are simple.

219
00:17:32,626 --> 00:17:37,333
- You share everything.
- Sure. They should have their share.

220
00:17:37,459 --> 00:17:41,250
When I look at your assets -

221
00:17:41,376 --> 00:17:46,250
- it all looks pretty good.
Two cars...

222
00:17:46,376 --> 00:17:49,333
Houses...

223
00:17:50,459 --> 00:17:54,791
Property valuation, bills -

224
00:17:54,917 --> 00:17:59,833
- and all of that. You have
pretty large pension savings, huh?

225
00:18:00,792 --> 00:18:03,333
And... Oh, not bad.

226
00:18:03,459 --> 00:18:05,291
All in all...

227
00:18:06,334 --> 00:18:07,625
Yes!

228
00:18:08,917 --> 00:18:12,541
- 2.5 for each.
- Thousand?

229
00:18:12,667 --> 00:18:16,833
- But that's not a whole lot.
- Million.

230
00:18:17,001 --> 00:18:20,750
You have a large equity in your houses
seeing as you built them yourselves.

231
00:18:20,876 --> 00:18:27,333
Add to that alimony amounting
to 4-5,000 kroner a month, minimum.

232
00:18:28,792 --> 00:18:33,625
I hope you feel it was worth it.
On the other hand...

233
00:18:37,001 --> 00:18:40,416
...you got the lawyer cheaper.

234
00:18:42,334 --> 00:18:43,833
Well, I have a meeting now.

235
00:18:44,001 --> 00:18:48,875
Feel free to hang around
and recover from the blow.

236
00:18:49,001 --> 00:18:52,041
Kleenex.
Chipped in...!

237
00:18:52,751 --> 00:18:56,000
- Edward...
- I think I'm going to be sick, Ib.

238
00:18:56,084 --> 00:19:00,458
We've got the undeclared money.
Nobody knows about that.

239
00:19:04,001 --> 00:19:07,666
Of course!
Ib, we've got the undeclared money.

240
00:19:16,626 --> 00:19:18,916
What the hell is going on?

241
00:19:19,042 --> 00:19:22,041
Oh my lord!

242
00:19:24,001 --> 00:19:27,041
She's on her knees.

243
00:19:30,667 --> 00:19:33,916
That's fucking disgusting.
It's not fair.

244
00:19:34,042 --> 00:19:36,750
He's not even handsome.

245
00:19:36,876 --> 00:19:41,458
- Please repeat that.
- Well, that's the lie of the land.

246
00:19:41,584 --> 00:19:44,916
We've reached the end-station.
You'll get some hard cash -

247
00:19:45,042 --> 00:19:49,625
- and we'll skip the lawyer crap
that only serves to confuse you.

248
00:19:49,751 --> 00:19:54,791
- Please say it one more time.
- Well, we've reached the end-station.

249
00:19:54,917 --> 00:20:00,000
You'll get some hard cash and we'll skip
the lawyer crap that only confuses you.

250
00:20:00,126 --> 00:20:05,125
- It what?
- Confuses you. All that paperwork...

251
00:20:05,251 --> 00:20:08,125
Do I look like an idiot?
Huh?

252
00:20:08,251 --> 00:20:11,916
We have assets worth
five million kroner.

253
00:20:12,042 --> 00:20:16,291
Add to that maximum alimony,
not to mention all the undeclared money.

254
00:20:16,417 --> 00:20:19,833
- What undeclared money do you mean?
- What undeclared money?

255
00:20:20,001 --> 00:20:24,166
- There isn't any undeclared money.
- It's in the fridge in the cellar.

256
00:20:25,209 --> 00:20:27,708
What cellar?

257
00:20:30,709 --> 00:20:32,916
Well, that...

258
00:20:34,251 --> 00:20:38,083
That's the fridge in the cellar.
You're spying on us?

259
00:20:38,209 --> 00:20:41,791
As you said,
we've reached the end-station -

260
00:20:41,917 --> 00:20:45,250
- so one of us has to get off
and walk back -

261
00:20:45,376 --> 00:20:50,708
- and it's only fair that it's you.
You always wear sensible work shoes.

262
00:20:50,834 --> 00:20:53,250
I'm more of a stiletto girl.

263
00:20:56,751 --> 00:21:00,000
- Piglet.
- Yes?

264
00:21:10,417 --> 00:21:13,291
I know this may come as a shock.

265
00:21:13,417 --> 00:21:17,583
How odd!
Ingrid's getting divorced today, too.

266
00:21:20,376 --> 00:21:24,000
Our money. All our money!

267
00:21:26,292 --> 00:21:29,625
We had it all!

268
00:21:29,751 --> 00:21:35,291
Let's just drop the whole idea
and get a sex life online.

269
00:21:35,417 --> 00:21:36,625
- No!
- Yes!

270
00:21:36,751 --> 00:21:40,708
Sex involves both hands.

271
00:21:41,667 --> 00:21:43,750
Both hands!

272
00:21:46,709 --> 00:21:49,083
Both hands!

273
00:21:49,209 --> 00:21:53,250
If only they'd never existed.

274
00:21:53,376 --> 00:21:57,708
It would be so much easier to get
divorced if they weren't there.

275
00:21:57,834 --> 00:22:02,166
You don't have to give half
of everything to someone -

276
00:22:02,292 --> 00:22:07,208
- if they aren't there. If none of us
existed, we wouldn't have a problem.

277
00:22:11,001 --> 00:22:15,666
- Do you know what you're saying?
- Yes! No...

278
00:22:15,792 --> 00:22:18,375
If they weren't here...

279
00:22:18,501 --> 00:22:24,000
- How about we hire a hitman?
- Yes.

280
00:22:24,084 --> 00:22:27,250
- From the east. From Russia.
- Yes!

281
00:22:27,376 --> 00:22:31,833
They're sick in the head.
And they're broke.

282
00:22:32,001 --> 00:22:33,916
We'll send for one.

283
00:22:34,042 --> 00:22:36,291
Bang bang.

284
00:22:36,417 --> 00:22:40,666
Wham bang thank you ma'am.

285
00:22:49,292 --> 00:22:51,750
Edward...

286
00:23:12,876 --> 00:23:16,125
Yeah, a guy from the East.

287
00:25:33,751 --> 00:25:38,916
Hello.
Hi, Edward. So you're awake?

288
00:25:39,042 --> 00:25:44,125
No, he's been asleep for 48 hours.
Or maybe he's dead. I didn't check.

289
00:25:46,084 --> 00:25:48,625
Are you dead?

290
00:25:51,084 --> 00:25:54,541
- You hired a Russian hitman!
- I was drunk!

291
00:25:54,667 --> 00:25:59,041
So was I, but I didn't hire
a goddamn Russian hitman!

292
00:25:59,167 --> 00:26:01,916
A Russian hitman.
I'm going insane!

293
00:26:02,042 --> 00:26:04,083
Stupid, stupid Edward!

294
00:26:04,209 --> 00:26:06,000
Gritt, I'm sorry!

295
00:26:06,084 --> 00:26:08,000
Stupid, stupid Edward!

296
00:26:08,126 --> 00:26:12,541
Shit! You're gonna have
to call it off. It's as simple as that.

297
00:26:12,667 --> 00:26:15,000
Write and call the whole thing off.

298
00:26:15,084 --> 00:26:18,916
I told you already, I tried.
The link expired.

299
00:26:19,042 --> 00:26:24,000
You pay half, and the link expires.
That's the deal when you hire a hitman.

300
00:26:24,084 --> 00:26:28,000
All that's left is this.
Igor Lad... whatever.

301
00:26:28,126 --> 00:26:31,291
Arrival from Kiev 2:45 p. m.

302
00:26:31,417 --> 00:26:34,750
He's on his way?!

303
00:26:34,876 --> 00:26:39,000
Maybe he won't recognize us.
All he knows is that we live in Nibe -

304
00:26:39,084 --> 00:26:43,541
- and there are lots of people in Nibe.
A whole lot.

305
00:26:43,667 --> 00:26:46,833
There are people living in Nibe
in all kinds of houses.

306
00:26:47,001 --> 00:26:50,041
But he's got the email address
and the name.

307
00:26:50,167 --> 00:26:55,000
He knows exactly where to go.
He's a professional killer, Ib.

308
00:26:55,126 --> 00:26:58,583
I've got it. Let's go to the airport
and tell him it's a misunderstanding.

309
00:26:58,709 --> 00:27:03,708
Good idea. We'll give him a decent tip
and say it's all a misunderstanding.

310
00:27:04,459 --> 00:27:06,250
How hard can it be?

311
00:27:25,126 --> 00:27:30,041
- What if 100 dollars isn't enough?
- Hell, it's a year's income in Russia.

312
00:27:30,167 --> 00:27:34,000
- Got the return ticket?
- Yup. Moscow 6:45 p. m.

313
00:27:34,084 --> 00:27:38,666
- Good. And then this never happened.
- It already never happened.

314
00:27:38,792 --> 00:27:42,458
We'll treat him to a steak
and a couple of bottles of Rioja -

315
00:27:42,584 --> 00:27:45,250
- and there you have it.

316
00:27:59,042 --> 00:28:01,458
Oh my...

317
00:28:04,792 --> 00:28:07,375
He sure is drunk.

318
00:28:07,501 --> 00:28:11,166
I'll give him that.
Impressive.

319
00:28:34,459 --> 00:28:38,416
My friends...
My friends.

320
00:28:56,167 --> 00:28:57,167
Hi.

321
00:28:57,292 --> 00:29:01,583
- Is he a friend of yours?
- Nah, we don't really know him.

322
00:29:01,709 --> 00:29:05,083
- Then why are you holding his name?
- Well...

323
00:29:05,209 --> 00:29:08,625
- What's his business here?
- We're builders.

324
00:29:08,751 --> 00:29:14,250
- Igor's here to help us... build.
- Nothing illegal.

325
00:29:14,376 --> 00:29:19,208
But we don't need him after all,
so we've bought him a return ticket.

326
00:29:19,334 --> 00:29:22,750
No way.
He's not flying in that state.

327
00:29:22,876 --> 00:29:26,000
Get him out of here.
Immediately!

328
00:29:31,126 --> 00:29:36,833
We'll take a taxi to the Scandic.
We won't draw attention in a taxi.

329
00:29:37,001 --> 00:29:40,291
We'll get him a room, pour
some coffee on him to sober him up -

330
00:29:40,417 --> 00:29:43,291
- and then we go back here,
he flies back home -

331
00:29:43,417 --> 00:29:46,166
- we go home.
It never happened.

332
00:30:05,251 --> 00:30:09,583
Your friend is okay, right?
He can't puke in my taxi...

333
00:30:09,709 --> 00:30:11,916
I'm gonna get really mad.

334
00:30:12,042 --> 00:30:16,250
He's from Russia.
They hardly ever puke.

335
00:30:16,376 --> 00:30:18,208
Infidel Russian.

336
00:30:18,334 --> 00:30:21,750
Godless pig eater,
drunk, foolish dog!

337
00:30:21,876 --> 00:30:25,375
I curse you to hell -

338
00:30:25,501 --> 00:30:29,708
- and I'm going to take a long,
expensive detour to steal your money!

339
00:30:31,001 --> 00:30:33,791
You damn Taliban bastard.

340
00:30:33,917 --> 00:30:37,833
I curse you and your family
and hope you burn in hell.

341
00:30:38,001 --> 00:30:41,000
You talking to me,
you Russian son of a bitch?

342
00:30:41,126 --> 00:30:45,333
I'm going to pull out your intestines
through your filthy throat -

343
00:30:45,459 --> 00:30:48,208
- and hang you in the nearest tree!

344
00:30:48,334 --> 00:30:52,583
Damn you! I'm going to do that to you,
you filthy shit-for-brains!

345
00:30:52,709 --> 00:30:54,666
Stop... stop.

346
00:30:54,792 --> 00:30:57,875
You son of a bitch! I'm going
to kill you, you crazy bastard!

347
00:30:58,001 --> 00:31:01,666
- Stop the car!
- What stop?! Where stop?!

348
00:31:01,792 --> 00:31:04,125
You crazy Russian!

349
00:31:04,251 --> 00:31:08,666
I'll kill you good! We kicked
your entire family out of your country!

350
00:31:10,876 --> 00:31:12,208
Come here, you...!

351
00:31:21,876 --> 00:31:27,125
I can't deal with all that negative
energy in such a confined space.

352
00:31:27,251 --> 00:31:31,083
So much... hatred
between people, Edward.

353
00:31:31,209 --> 00:31:36,458
We're going to sober him up,
and then we're going home.

354
00:31:44,126 --> 00:31:47,250
Well, let's get... going.

355
00:31:48,209 --> 00:31:50,875
Taliban monkey not so loud anymore.

356
00:31:51,001 --> 00:31:53,791
But you don't worry, you my friends.
Igor kill for free.

357
00:31:53,917 --> 00:31:57,333
Besides, he don't care.
He wasn't happy.

358
00:31:57,459 --> 00:32:02,791
Now, I promise he's much happier now
with his 72 fucking virgins.

359
00:32:02,917 --> 00:32:07,208
Now he's happier.
Now he's with his virgins. I'm sorry.

360
00:32:13,251 --> 00:32:16,750
For fuck's sake.
Ib, this isn't happening, is it?

361
00:32:16,876 --> 00:32:20,625
We're going to jail on account of a
drunk Russian that we don't even know.

362
00:32:20,751 --> 00:32:25,791
Edward, we have to take him home with
us. And we can't just leave the body.

363
00:32:25,917 --> 00:32:29,250
- Someone's gonna find him.
- Someone?

364
00:32:29,376 --> 00:32:33,083
That poor immigrant guy and his
immigrant kids who are now fatherless.

365
00:32:33,209 --> 00:32:37,000
Maybe he's a fucking ISIS who whips
his family with the Quran every night.

366
00:32:37,084 --> 00:32:41,083
But you don't know that!
Prejudice... bah!

367
00:32:41,209 --> 00:32:44,500
Well, Igor, let's go.

368
00:33:11,542 --> 00:33:14,916
- Let's go get a beer at the inn.
- But what if the girls come home?

369
00:33:15,042 --> 00:33:18,000
Gritt said they were sleeping at your
place. It's just you and me tonight.

370
00:33:27,459 --> 00:33:30,750
Are there any real men left?

371
00:33:31,709 --> 00:33:34,916
I really want a child.

372
00:33:35,042 --> 00:33:38,375
I'm going on 40, and my ovaries
are beginning to look like prunes.

373
00:33:41,626 --> 00:33:44,500
Soon I can only have kids
with nuchal folds.

374
00:33:44,626 --> 00:33:45,791
Yuck!

375
00:33:54,042 --> 00:33:59,583
- I thought we were going to my place.
- You never have any wine.

376
00:34:02,042 --> 00:34:04,375
Will we be happy without them?

377
00:34:04,501 --> 00:34:07,875
Oh, come on.
We're gonna have a ball!

378
00:34:08,001 --> 00:34:11,291
You'll meet other men who look you
in the eye instead of ogling your ass.

379
00:34:11,417 --> 00:34:16,291
Who can dance, think and go
to the art museum and watch PBS -

380
00:34:16,417 --> 00:34:20,416
- and who talk about other stuff
than stone wool.

381
00:34:30,459 --> 00:34:33,625
- Is this the reception?
- Is he one of their Poles?

382
00:34:34,792 --> 00:34:38,208
- Where is the mini bar?
- How dare he prance in like that?

383
00:34:38,334 --> 00:34:42,875
They stay in the cellar from time
to time, but they never come upstairs.

384
00:34:48,084 --> 00:34:53,000
Life is nothing without beauty and love.
Love is what makes you happy -

385
00:34:53,084 --> 00:34:55,916
- and if you're not happy,
there is no reason to live.

386
00:34:56,042 --> 00:34:59,875
So when Igor meets two beautiful women,
he sees lots of love -

387
00:35:00,001 --> 00:35:03,750
- and that makes him very happy.

388
00:35:03,876 --> 00:35:07,000
And I do not say that because I'm drunk.

389
00:35:07,084 --> 00:35:10,791
Igor is always drunk
and sees ugly women all the time.

390
00:35:10,917 --> 00:35:16,041
But you are very, very,
very beautiful.

391
00:35:17,084 --> 00:35:20,083
Who says you can leave your cellar?

392
00:35:21,126 --> 00:35:24,458
Who says you can leave your cellar?

393
00:35:26,292 --> 00:35:28,541
You are so hungry woman.

394
00:35:28,667 --> 00:35:34,000
You are like a juicy wet oasis. An oasis
just waiting to feed a thirsty man -

395
00:35:34,126 --> 00:35:39,000
- but you, so beautiful, where is your
thirsty man? No one drinks from you.

396
00:35:39,084 --> 00:35:42,791
And you, beautiful.
Like a painting by Da Vinci.

397
00:35:42,917 --> 00:35:45,875
Please come. Please.

398
00:35:46,001 --> 00:35:48,000
Please!

399
00:35:48,084 --> 00:35:52,750
Where is your man to see
your secret smile, beautiful lips?

400
00:35:52,876 --> 00:35:56,583
I like it very much.
Beautiful.

401
00:35:57,251 --> 00:35:59,750
Thank you.

402
00:35:59,876 --> 00:36:03,541
- Well, Malte, our dance teacher...
- Dance teacher?

403
00:36:03,667 --> 00:36:08,000
He thinks we are very passionate.
He's a Swede.

404
00:36:08,084 --> 00:36:12,750
Gay, of course, and sometimes
he compares us to two tulips.

405
00:36:12,876 --> 00:36:17,875
You tulips? But tulip is nothing
but the stupid vegetable.

406
00:36:18,001 --> 00:36:24,125
You are not vegetables!
You are women made offlesh and blood!

407
00:36:27,209 --> 00:36:30,916
- This is for every virgin I ever loved.
- Oh my.

408
00:36:31,042 --> 00:36:35,125
She feels a little pain
and I see the tear in her eye.

409
00:36:35,251 --> 00:36:39,750
And Igor says:
If she feels a little pain -

410
00:36:39,876 --> 00:36:43,375
- so Igor shall feel a little pain, too.

411
00:36:43,501 --> 00:36:47,541
So I stab myself every time with knife,
very painful.

412
00:36:47,667 --> 00:36:53,583
You know, guys from the Eastern bloc
can be very romantic.

413
00:36:53,709 --> 00:36:58,208
- You can say that again.
- Very.

414
00:37:00,459 --> 00:37:02,208
Can I...

415
00:37:04,626 --> 00:37:07,000
What's this?

416
00:37:07,084 --> 00:37:10,916
- It's also women you...?
- No.

417
00:37:11,042 --> 00:37:15,041
This is all the men I killed.

418
00:37:15,167 --> 00:37:19,541
- What?
- So you really tried to kill somebody?

419
00:37:19,667 --> 00:37:22,000
- Okay.
- How is it?

420
00:37:22,084 --> 00:37:24,916
- To kill somebody?
- Yes.

421
00:37:26,459 --> 00:37:28,375
Oh, it's nothing.

422
00:37:28,501 --> 00:37:31,875
First they breathe,
then they don't breathe.

423
00:37:32,751 --> 00:37:37,333
So, you stay long here in Nibe?

424
00:37:39,001 --> 00:37:41,833
As long as it takes.

425
00:37:42,001 --> 00:37:46,166
- Do you know Ib and Edward?
- Yes.

426
00:37:46,292 --> 00:37:48,500
They are my new friends.

427
00:37:48,626 --> 00:37:52,250
- You keep secrets with me?
- Of course.

428
00:37:52,376 --> 00:37:56,750
Wives not make them happy anymore.

429
00:37:58,084 --> 00:38:00,458
What do you precisely mean by that?

430
00:38:00,584 --> 00:38:04,625
Igor help them
not to be unhappy anymore.

431
00:38:04,751 --> 00:38:06,583
How?

432
00:38:06,709 --> 00:38:08,041
I kill them.

433
00:38:30,876 --> 00:38:33,208
You know where I can find them?

434
00:38:47,626 --> 00:38:49,708
Igor?

435
00:38:50,584 --> 00:38:56,625
You need something
stronger than wine, yes.

436
00:38:58,001 --> 00:39:00,833
- You need whisky.
- Okay.

437
00:39:01,001 --> 00:39:04,000
Where am I, by the way?
Is this hotel lobby?

438
00:39:04,084 --> 00:39:07,041
We go and we buy...

439
00:39:08,001 --> 00:39:10,208
...whisky.
Lots ofwhisky.

440
00:39:10,334 --> 00:39:14,041
And you can stay here in hotel lobby.

441
00:39:16,917 --> 00:39:19,750
- What are we gonna do?
- Get in the car!

442
00:39:19,876 --> 00:39:22,541
You're too drunk to drive.

443
00:39:29,251 --> 00:39:33,333
- I think I've peed my pants.
- Shit, Gritt!

444
00:39:33,459 --> 00:39:35,750
We're married to a couple of killers!

445
00:39:35,876 --> 00:39:39,375
I don't remember
when I last peed my pants.

446
00:39:39,501 --> 00:39:42,083
Fuck!
Ever heard anything that wild?

447
00:39:42,209 --> 00:39:46,625
Maybe it was at camp in '92...

448
00:39:46,751 --> 00:39:50,458
You don't chip in for a hitman.
If anyone's gonna kill me -

449
00:39:50,584 --> 00:39:54,208
- I want my own personal killer.

450
00:39:54,334 --> 00:39:56,416
I peed on my shoes... everywhere.

451
00:40:01,709 --> 00:40:05,083
- And then I saw...
- Have you been drinking?

452
00:40:05,209 --> 00:40:09,583
What the fuck do you think?
Do I seem sober or shitfaced?

453
00:40:09,709 --> 00:40:13,708
Down my legs and into my shoes...

454
00:40:13,834 --> 00:40:17,625
"What is this?
Did you pee your pants?"

455
00:40:18,667 --> 00:40:20,583
I peed my pants.

456
00:40:20,709 --> 00:40:24,666
Damn! It burst.
That's a first.

457
00:40:24,792 --> 00:40:26,833
Get out of the car.

458
00:40:27,001 --> 00:40:31,916
And the bitches can sleep on the couch
in a studio apartment on loser street.

459
00:40:32,042 --> 00:40:33,541
Loser street.

460
00:40:33,667 --> 00:40:37,750
They go see a lawyer only to find out
they're married to two strong women.

461
00:40:37,876 --> 00:40:41,500
Strong women
who knows their rights, Gritt.

462
00:40:41,626 --> 00:40:44,875
- Free women like you and me, Gritt.
- Yeah, we're totally free.

463
00:40:46,626 --> 00:40:49,208
We may very well be from Nibe -

464
00:40:49,334 --> 00:40:53,250
- but Malte says
this might as well be Hollywood -

465
00:40:53,376 --> 00:40:58,041
- and those women over there know how
to squeeze the last cent out of a man.

466
00:40:58,167 --> 00:41:02,625
- The last cunt?
- No, the last cent out of a man.

467
00:41:02,751 --> 00:41:04,666
We'll show them!

468
00:41:04,792 --> 00:41:08,375
We have a future, Gritt.
We can dance our way through life.

469
00:41:08,501 --> 00:41:11,916
- They can only sit on their fat asses.
- Hell, we'll convert Malte.

470
00:41:12,042 --> 00:41:16,458
- Yeah, why not?
- With our gigantic big balls.

471
00:41:17,376 --> 00:41:19,333
We rock!

472
00:41:19,459 --> 00:41:24,750
We'll be lucky to find a drop of blood
in your alcohol. What were you thinking?

473
00:41:24,876 --> 00:41:28,041
- You're looking at a minimum of...
- Where?

474
00:41:28,167 --> 00:41:31,000
- Where are you going?
- Where's the cell, Heinz?

475
00:41:31,084 --> 00:41:33,291
Down the end of the hall, 9 o'clock.

476
00:41:36,292 --> 00:41:39,041
He's been awake.

477
00:41:39,167 --> 00:41:42,833
No man can drink that much.

478
00:41:58,209 --> 00:42:02,000
Why don't we just tell the police?

479
00:42:02,084 --> 00:42:05,541
- The police?
- Yes.

480
00:42:05,667 --> 00:42:08,666
"Why don't we just tell the police?"

481
00:42:08,792 --> 00:42:13,375
- What can the police do?
- They can fix it.

482
00:42:13,501 --> 00:42:16,333
- Fix it? The police?
- Yes.

483
00:42:17,376 --> 00:42:21,083
No, they'll put them away for a couple
of years, and when they're released -

484
00:42:21,209 --> 00:42:24,500
- they'll rob us of everything anyway.

485
00:42:25,584 --> 00:42:28,416
The police!

486
00:42:38,709 --> 00:42:41,583
If they can hire a killer...

487
00:42:46,834 --> 00:42:49,291
...why can't we?

488
00:42:51,001 --> 00:42:54,333
Well, because it's against the law.

489
00:42:54,459 --> 00:42:56,916
- Against the law?
- Yes.

490
00:42:57,042 --> 00:43:00,000
No, it's equality!

491
00:43:04,126 --> 00:43:06,833
It's equality, Gritt. Hey!

492
00:43:07,001 --> 00:43:11,500
We have just as much right
to be bastards as men.

493
00:43:11,626 --> 00:43:13,500
Sure.

494
00:43:15,042 --> 00:43:18,875
- Okay.
- I'll tell you what we're gonna do...

495
00:43:33,334 --> 00:43:36,250
- Sure this is a good idea?
- We have to defend ourselves.

496
00:43:36,376 --> 00:43:42,708
- And Igor? Think she's a match for him?
- Wait and see. This girl is special.

497
00:43:42,834 --> 00:43:48,333
The British have got style. Downton
Abbey, Midsomer Murders and so on.

498
00:43:48,459 --> 00:43:52,916
The British are posh.
Discreet and soundless.

499
00:43:53,042 --> 00:43:56,458
When something is really complicated -

500
00:43:56,584 --> 00:43:59,291
- they just sweep it under the rug.

501
00:43:59,417 --> 00:44:02,541
- I need to go pee again.
- And I'm thirsty.

502
00:44:02,667 --> 00:44:05,666
- Shouldn't she have landed by now?
- I need some wine.

503
00:44:25,792 --> 00:44:29,000
Excuse me.
Where do you come from?

504
00:44:29,126 --> 00:44:32,000
Oh, I'm sorry, young man.

505
00:44:32,084 --> 00:44:35,083
I didn't think that
you'd be taking any interest -

506
00:44:35,209 --> 00:44:39,166
- in a silly old woman like me.
I'm flattered, dear.

507
00:44:39,292 --> 00:44:42,125
It's check-up day today,
so pure routine.

508
00:44:42,251 --> 00:44:44,000
I understand, dear.

509
00:44:44,084 --> 00:44:48,583
Now, what am I smuggling into this
lovely little country of yours today?

510
00:44:48,709 --> 00:44:53,041
Hard drugs, endangered species
or lethal weapons?

511
00:44:53,167 --> 00:44:57,041
- Can I check your bag?
- You most certainly may.

512
00:45:08,459 --> 00:45:11,000
Good God!

513
00:45:15,584 --> 00:45:19,666
Ingrid, I don't like this.

514
00:45:19,792 --> 00:45:25,541
No, but let's go to the summerhouse
and get acquainted, okay?

515
00:45:25,667 --> 00:45:29,250
Sure she's not crazy? I think
she's straight out of a horror movie.

516
00:45:29,376 --> 00:45:32,333
No, she's just an oddball.

517
00:45:32,459 --> 00:45:37,416
You can't get enough of oddballs.
They're just barmy.

518
00:45:37,542 --> 00:45:42,000
Mrs. Nipplesworthy, we are going now
to a very nice and cozy place.

519
00:45:42,084 --> 00:45:45,083
- Is there anything you need?
- Liver.

520
00:45:46,084 --> 00:45:47,833
- Liver?
- Liver?

521
00:45:48,001 --> 00:45:49,625
Raw liver.

522
00:45:49,751 --> 00:45:53,666
With a nice bottle of Chianti.

523
00:45:59,876 --> 00:46:02,833
Ladies... ladies!

524
00:46:03,001 --> 00:46:07,291
I'm only messing with you.

525
00:46:14,084 --> 00:46:16,625
So you want me to erase his memory?

526
00:46:16,751 --> 00:46:21,125
Not all of it.
Just the last couple of days maybe.

527
00:46:22,376 --> 00:46:25,250
- What is this all about?
- We'll give you 5,000 kroner.

528
00:46:25,376 --> 00:46:29,791
It's purely business. We brought him in
from the East to help us -

529
00:46:29,917 --> 00:46:33,916
- but he drinks too much.
He's Russian and more or less useless.

530
00:46:34,042 --> 00:46:37,625
Still, we felt bad
having dragged him all the way here -

531
00:46:37,751 --> 00:46:41,250
- only to fire him on the spot.

532
00:46:41,376 --> 00:46:45,458
So we thought it would be better
if he'd never had that experience.

533
00:46:50,834 --> 00:46:53,791
You're so full of crap.

534
00:46:53,917 --> 00:46:56,916
- 20,000.
- Done deal!

535
00:46:57,042 --> 00:46:59,833
- Wait outside.
- Deal.

536
00:47:00,001 --> 00:47:03,083
Ib... Where are you going?

537
00:47:08,251 --> 00:47:10,041
Poul?

538
00:47:13,084 --> 00:47:15,291
Poul!

539
00:47:18,626 --> 00:47:20,791
What the hell are you doing?

540
00:47:25,751 --> 00:47:29,041
- Where did you find her again?
- She had a website.

541
00:47:29,167 --> 00:47:33,541
- Awebsite?
- Yeah, to do with euthanasia.

542
00:47:33,667 --> 00:47:36,250
- Euthanasia?
- Yeah.

543
00:47:36,376 --> 00:47:41,125
She worked at a home for many years -

544
00:47:41,251 --> 00:47:45,583
- and was unjustly convicted of having
helped a lot of miserable old -

545
00:47:45,709 --> 00:47:50,041
- really broken old people,
who were dying anyway.

546
00:47:50,167 --> 00:47:55,916
She's dedicated her life to helping
people, who need to die, to die.

547
00:47:57,001 --> 00:48:01,625
And she also helps out
if you need help -

548
00:48:01,751 --> 00:48:06,541
- to make other people,
who need to die, die.

549
00:48:06,667 --> 00:48:10,375
People, who want to die...
but perhaps don't know it yet.

550
00:48:11,292 --> 00:48:13,291
What home did she work at?

551
00:48:13,417 --> 00:48:19,000
- I think it was Broadmoor Home...
- Home for what?

552
00:48:19,084 --> 00:48:22,458
Broadmoor Mental Institution is -

553
00:48:22,584 --> 00:48:26,708
- a well-reputed home
for psychopaths, sweethearts.

554
00:48:26,834 --> 00:48:29,541
Okay.

555
00:48:29,667 --> 00:48:34,041
- You worked there as a nurse, or...?
- Yes, of course.

556
00:48:34,167 --> 00:48:37,666
Yes, of course I was a nurse.

557
00:48:42,501 --> 00:48:46,541
"Now you travel back in your life, Igor.
Now you let yourself fall -

558
00:48:46,667 --> 00:48:48,833
- and see the job you should do."

559
00:48:49,001 --> 00:48:52,583
Igor says this is nuts,
but stupid woman says:

560
00:48:52,709 --> 00:48:56,041
"Yes, you see the job
you should do for Ib and Edward."

561
00:48:56,167 --> 00:48:58,833
"No, no," I say. "I don't see anyjob."

562
00:48:59,001 --> 00:49:01,916
"Oh yes," she says. "You will."

563
00:49:02,042 --> 00:49:04,916
And then she hypnotize.

564
00:49:05,042 --> 00:49:10,833
And then Igor sees all Igor's jobs!
They come to me, everyone of them!

565
00:49:11,001 --> 00:49:15,250
The Taliban swine, the three
horny midgets, the six Chinamen -

566
00:49:15,376 --> 00:49:18,166
- the stupid journalist,
who didn't like my friend Putin -

567
00:49:18,292 --> 00:49:22,208
- the woman with the big dick etc. etc.
So now she starts screaming.

568
00:49:22,334 --> 00:49:25,333
So Igor wake up.
"Why do you scream, stupid woman?"

569
00:49:25,459 --> 00:49:30,625
- So she screams: "Police! Police!"
- Yes, we heard. We heard.

570
00:49:31,542 --> 00:49:35,083
- She never should have locked the door.
- I asked her: "Why do you scream?"

571
00:49:35,209 --> 00:49:40,000
"Please stop screaming, you ugly woman
with ugly glasses. Please stop...!"

572
00:49:40,126 --> 00:49:43,083
Did you really have to...

573
00:49:44,417 --> 00:49:50,125
You know, Igor help.
Igor put her out of her misery.

574
00:49:50,251 --> 00:49:53,541
I could see she was not happy.

575
00:50:00,917 --> 00:50:05,125
Always look for the positive,
my mom always said.

576
00:50:05,251 --> 00:50:07,916
Like when my budgie died.

577
00:50:08,042 --> 00:50:12,125
"See, Ib. The good thing
about the budgie dying is -

578
00:50:12,251 --> 00:50:17,500
- that you can get a stuffed budgie now.
Not many people have that."

579
00:50:18,542 --> 00:50:21,916
Maybe all these horrific experiences
are good for us.

580
00:50:22,042 --> 00:50:26,541
I mean, right now we're parked right
in the middle of nature.

581
00:50:26,667 --> 00:50:30,916
Look! A live lark.
It gives you food for thought -

582
00:50:31,042 --> 00:50:35,166
- that in the middle of all this mess
there's still stuffto rejoice in.

583
00:50:35,292 --> 00:50:39,916
Hell, Ib, you're going crazy.
Pull yourself together, Ib.

584
00:50:41,417 --> 00:50:45,291
No... I didn't mean it like that.

585
00:50:48,042 --> 00:50:51,416
I miss my budgie.

586
00:50:55,167 --> 00:50:58,041
And here comes Heinz.

587
00:51:04,501 --> 00:51:06,625
Well...

588
00:51:15,042 --> 00:51:18,750
So, what's up, Dumb and Dumber?

589
00:51:18,876 --> 00:51:21,875
- Yeah, what's up, Heinz?
- Drunk bitches.

590
00:51:22,001 --> 00:51:25,916
Moonlighting.
What's next?

591
00:51:26,042 --> 00:51:30,125
Now that your missus
has lost her license -

592
00:51:30,251 --> 00:51:33,166
- her Mercedes is just collecting dust
in the garage.

593
00:51:33,292 --> 00:51:37,916
- What do you want, Heinz?
- Why, I want a Mercedes.

594
00:51:38,042 --> 00:51:41,666
- If you can moonlight, so can I.
- Why?

595
00:51:41,792 --> 00:51:43,625
Why?

596
00:51:43,751 --> 00:51:46,666
It's up to you whether I should drive
toward you with the tax man -

597
00:51:46,792 --> 00:51:50,250
- or drive off in a Mercedes.

598
00:51:54,292 --> 00:51:57,833
- Who's that guy?
- Just a friend of ours.

599
00:51:58,001 --> 00:52:01,541
- Yeah, he's just a friend.
- Oh. Does he have a work permit?

600
00:52:02,376 --> 00:52:05,333
Hey there.

601
00:52:05,459 --> 00:52:08,541
I'd like to see your passport,
papers and work permit.

602
00:52:08,667 --> 00:52:10,875
Right away.

603
00:52:11,001 --> 00:52:14,125
- Hello.
- Heinz, he doesn't speak Danish.

604
00:52:14,251 --> 00:52:17,916
- Heinz, you'd better not.
- Frigging Poles.

605
00:52:18,042 --> 00:52:22,333
Don't piss him off.
Igor's from Russia, not Poland.

606
00:52:22,459 --> 00:52:25,083
So what's he gonna do?
Blow on me?

607
00:52:26,876 --> 00:52:29,333
Hey, buster.

608
00:52:29,459 --> 00:52:32,750
Let me see your papers,
passport and work permit.

609
00:52:32,876 --> 00:52:37,000
It's a bad idea, Heinz.
You are a human being after all.

610
00:52:37,126 --> 00:52:39,625
- What?
- You've got a heart, too.

611
00:52:39,751 --> 00:52:43,375
- Haven't you got a wife and kids?
- Not on your life!

612
00:52:43,501 --> 00:52:47,000
- A dad or a mom?
- What the fuck are you talking about?

613
00:52:47,126 --> 00:52:51,750
All the people who love you
and who you love and go on picnics with.

614
00:52:51,876 --> 00:52:54,458
No, all that family crap just isn't me.

615
00:52:54,584 --> 00:52:59,041
So the day you pass away,
no one will mourn you -

616
00:52:59,167 --> 00:53:03,333
- with a cake buffet
and cousins singing country songs?

617
00:53:04,459 --> 00:53:09,083
You're losing it big time.
What the hell are you guys up to?

618
00:53:09,209 --> 00:53:11,583
- Is this your friend?
- No.

619
00:53:11,709 --> 00:53:16,916
I actually feel a bit sad for him,
because you know -

620
00:53:17,042 --> 00:53:20,041
- Heinz is not very happy.

621
00:53:20,167 --> 00:53:22,916
- Ib!
- Not happy?

622
00:53:23,042 --> 00:53:25,916
Not happy at all, Igor.

623
00:53:27,001 --> 00:53:29,708
No love, no family -

624
00:53:29,834 --> 00:53:32,416
- and not very happy.

625
00:53:32,542 --> 00:53:34,750
Ib, what the fuck are you up to?

626
00:53:34,876 --> 00:53:37,833
- You bet your ass I'm not very happy.
- Damn.

627
00:53:38,001 --> 00:53:41,708
Look, tell me what's going on.
Out of the way, buddy.

628
00:53:41,834 --> 00:53:46,416
You're digging a hole in the middle
of nowhere. What's going on?

629
00:53:46,542 --> 00:53:48,208
What is this?

630
00:53:48,334 --> 00:53:49,625
No!

631
00:53:52,834 --> 00:53:55,666
It's... No, never mind the time!

632
00:53:57,709 --> 00:54:00,000
You're under arrest
and you have the right to one...

633
00:54:00,126 --> 00:54:02,541
He doesn't speak Danish, Heinz.

634
00:54:02,667 --> 00:54:07,083
You have the right to maintain silence,
and according to law you can just...

635
00:54:07,209 --> 00:54:09,208
Okay.

636
00:54:21,042 --> 00:54:22,708
We have more drink?

637
00:54:24,917 --> 00:54:30,125
Well, Ib.
This is the end of the road.

638
00:54:30,251 --> 00:54:33,625
Heinz is going to get help.
It's all over -

639
00:54:33,751 --> 00:54:35,916
- and I will accept my punishment.

640
00:54:36,042 --> 00:54:39,125
- It'll ease my gut and my mind...
- Car keys... where are the keys?

641
00:54:39,251 --> 00:54:43,791
We'll get everything out in the open.
Don't worry, I'll take the rap.

642
00:54:43,917 --> 00:54:48,833
No need for both of us to spend 12 years
in the can getting buggered by goons.

643
00:54:49,001 --> 00:54:52,041
Don't get all worked up.
Igor's got a handle on it.

644
00:54:52,167 --> 00:54:57,458
Let's just be happy
that it can't possibly get any worse.

645
00:55:04,751 --> 00:55:07,916
- He missed.
- You're way too negative.

646
00:55:15,834 --> 00:55:20,625
No, we won't get away with this.
I've seen it too many times on TV, Ib.

647
00:55:20,751 --> 00:55:25,916
A man walks his dog, and the dog comes
back with a big bone wearing a sock.

648
00:55:26,834 --> 00:55:30,000
Next thing you know,
you're the star of a lame crime doc...

649
00:55:30,126 --> 00:55:34,416
We have to find a better place
where they won't be found.

650
00:55:39,917 --> 00:55:43,625
How slowly would you like it to happen?

651
00:55:43,751 --> 00:55:46,000
How slow?

652
00:56:03,459 --> 00:56:08,916
Now, this will leave them bleeding
for several hours -

653
00:56:09,042 --> 00:56:12,458
- before their eyes pop out
of their heads.

654
00:56:13,667 --> 00:56:16,416
It's quite painful, it must be said.

655
00:56:16,542 --> 00:56:20,250
Meanwhile, now this one...

656
00:56:21,667 --> 00:56:26,416
I call this Autumn Leaves.

657
00:56:27,584 --> 00:56:31,000
This will prolong the process
even further still -

658
00:56:31,126 --> 00:56:35,291
- causing to lose their hair and teeth
over a period of several weeks -

659
00:56:35,417 --> 00:56:42,125
- before finally their skin peels off
like leaves in autumn.

660
00:56:42,251 --> 00:56:45,666
Yes... yes.

661
00:56:45,792 --> 00:56:49,666
Anything tickle your fancy, ladies?

662
00:56:51,084 --> 00:56:53,458
First and foremost -

663
00:56:53,584 --> 00:56:58,291
- I personally don't think
their eyes should pop out.

664
00:56:58,417 --> 00:57:02,500
I think this eye-popping-out thing
sounds a little too much.

665
00:57:02,626 --> 00:57:07,541
What do you think, Ingrid?
Do you think their eyes should...

666
00:57:07,667 --> 00:57:09,416
No, no.

667
00:57:09,542 --> 00:57:13,583
No, personally,
I don't like the eye thing -

668
00:57:13,709 --> 00:57:17,791
- and also I don't know
about the Autumn Leaves.

669
00:57:17,917 --> 00:57:22,666
So difficult to decide.
Right, Gritt?

670
00:57:22,792 --> 00:57:28,375
Yes, it's very difficult.
So many things to choose among.

671
00:57:28,501 --> 00:57:34,125
Maybe it's all a little bit
too dramatic.

672
00:57:34,251 --> 00:57:38,791
Perhaps we could find something
a little more simple.

673
00:57:38,917 --> 00:57:42,375
- More Scandinavian style?
- Yes, more Scandinavian maybe.

674
00:57:42,501 --> 00:57:45,208
You mean dull and dark?

675
00:57:47,834 --> 00:57:52,291
Perhaps we could concentrate on Igor.

676
00:57:52,417 --> 00:57:57,375
And perhaps just give Ib and Edward -

677
00:57:57,501 --> 00:57:59,583
- perhaps just a little warning?

678
00:57:59,709 --> 00:58:03,041
A little warning?

679
00:58:03,167 --> 00:58:06,333
Maybe just... I dunno...

680
00:58:07,417 --> 00:58:10,458
Maybe just a little
unexpected diarrhea maybe.

681
00:58:10,584 --> 00:58:14,791
- Diarrhea?
- Just a little pooh-pooh in the pants.

682
00:58:19,876 --> 00:58:24,625
Pooh-pooh!
That would be hysterical.

683
00:58:25,417 --> 00:58:28,000
You asked me to come here.

684
00:58:28,084 --> 00:58:34,250
I packed my things. I put a great deal
of effort into my preparations.

685
00:58:34,376 --> 00:58:39,583
Because that is what we British
stand for. Discipline. Honor.

686
00:58:39,709 --> 00:58:44,833
And last, but not least, the renouncing
of the revolting human body.

687
00:58:45,001 --> 00:58:50,125
And what do I mean by that? Well,
the British do not like the human body.

688
00:58:50,251 --> 00:58:55,000
We live with it, it's true. Because we
have no option. We are forced to do so.

689
00:58:55,084 --> 00:59:01,708
And that is precisely why
I am skilled at what I do.

690
00:59:01,834 --> 00:59:07,625
I am an expert at helping people
vacate their bodies.

691
00:59:07,751 --> 00:59:12,166
That is my calling.
That is my life's work.

692
00:59:12,292 --> 00:59:18,291
I am here to save us all
from our human bodies!

693
00:59:27,542 --> 00:59:31,875
- She's utterly crazy.
- No, we're utterly nuts.

694
00:59:32,001 --> 00:59:35,708
- What the hell are we doing?
- Let's keep a cool head now.

695
00:59:38,001 --> 00:59:41,125
Why the hell didn't we buy more?

696
00:59:41,251 --> 00:59:44,833
I can't think without Chardonnay.
I'm going out for more.

697
00:59:45,001 --> 00:59:48,666
- Are you leaving me alone with that?
- Everything's going to be okay.

698
00:59:48,792 --> 00:59:51,000
I just need some wine.

699
00:59:55,417 --> 00:59:59,125
What a surprise.

700
00:59:59,251 --> 01:00:04,000
- When do you expect to finish it?
- We found a pile of bricks.

701
01:00:04,126 --> 01:00:07,291
And more are on the way from...

702
01:00:07,417 --> 01:00:09,625
From Krakow.

703
01:00:09,751 --> 01:00:15,333
- Isn't it quite wide?
- What do you mean, Mrs. Hansen?

704
01:00:16,501 --> 01:00:19,666
It's almost a meter wide.

705
01:00:21,292 --> 01:00:25,541
Yes, it's a solid wall
that no one can ever tear down again -

706
01:00:25,667 --> 01:00:30,791
- so that they'd find something
or someone inside it.

707
01:00:30,917 --> 01:00:34,375
- Not that there'd be that in a wall.
- Mrs. Hansen.

708
01:00:34,501 --> 01:00:36,666
Thanks, Ib.

709
01:00:36,792 --> 01:00:41,250
- Can we have a cup of coffee?
- You bet.

710
01:00:45,084 --> 01:00:46,084
There!

711
01:00:47,126 --> 01:00:48,916
Well, well...

712
01:00:51,417 --> 01:00:53,708
Maybe we should wall him up, too?

713
01:00:53,834 --> 01:00:56,791
I don't think Igor's very happy.

714
01:00:56,917 --> 01:01:01,125
No, it must be hard to sleep with
so many dead people on your conscience.

715
01:01:02,126 --> 01:01:05,416
Tell you what, Ib.

716
01:01:05,542 --> 01:01:08,375
- I'm going to tell it to him straight.
- No. Are you crazy?

717
01:01:08,501 --> 01:01:12,541
- I'll keep a civil tone.
- He's gonna kill us. You can't!

718
01:01:12,667 --> 01:01:15,166
Igor... Igor.

719
01:01:15,292 --> 01:01:20,000
It's all a big misunderstanding.
You don't need to kill our wives.

720
01:01:20,126 --> 01:01:25,125
It was just me and Ib...
a little crazy one night.

721
01:01:25,251 --> 01:01:29,291
- It's not because we don't like you.
- No, absolutely not.

722
01:01:29,417 --> 01:01:34,125
We like you a lot.
You have a great charisma and...

723
01:01:34,251 --> 01:01:40,083
We also want you to know that we
think you are a very, very good killer.

724
01:01:40,209 --> 01:01:42,583
Oh, absolutely.

725
01:01:42,709 --> 01:01:47,583
Truth is, Igor, we don't want you
to kill anyone anymore.

726
01:01:47,709 --> 01:01:51,541
- You are getting soft.
- Look, Igor.

727
01:01:51,667 --> 01:01:56,000
You don't have to kill your wife
or your husband -

728
01:01:56,126 --> 01:01:58,166
- because you don't make love anymore.

729
01:01:58,292 --> 01:02:01,875
Actually, it's very normal in this
country that you stop having sex -

730
01:02:02,001 --> 01:02:04,208
- when you get married.

731
01:02:04,334 --> 01:02:06,000
Then what do they do?

732
01:02:06,084 --> 01:02:10,125
They... they take care of the dog -

733
01:02:10,251 --> 01:02:12,500
- or the kids.

734
01:02:12,626 --> 01:02:16,416
You know, jog together and go
to Silvan Saturday morning -

735
01:02:16,542 --> 01:02:19,875
- and buy a have grill, for example.

736
01:02:20,001 --> 01:02:24,875
- Have grill?
- You know, cozy time with have grill.

737
01:02:25,917 --> 01:02:27,916
- No.
- No?

738
01:02:28,042 --> 01:02:32,500
You are my friends. I don't want you
to live unhappy lousy lives -

739
01:02:32,626 --> 01:02:35,000
- with your frigid wives.

740
01:02:35,126 --> 01:02:39,583
But wives love us again.
They're not frigid anymore, nope.

741
01:02:41,042 --> 01:02:45,291
Okay.
If they really love you again -

742
01:02:45,417 --> 01:02:49,000
- I want to hear it
from their own mouths.

743
01:02:49,084 --> 01:02:51,708
Not from you two soft chicken.

744
01:02:53,417 --> 01:02:55,458
Of course, Igor.
You're absolutely right.

745
01:02:55,584 --> 01:02:59,666
Of course you should hear it from their
mouths, and you should meet them -

746
01:02:59,792 --> 01:03:03,583
- and you should talk to them. Then they
will tell you how much they love us.

747
01:03:03,709 --> 01:03:06,708
And then you can go home.

748
01:03:06,834 --> 01:03:09,791
- Okay.
- But we'll never talk them into that!

749
01:03:11,667 --> 01:03:14,083
Ib, I've got a plan.

750
01:03:15,917 --> 01:03:19,291
How terrible.
The girls haven't said a word.

751
01:03:19,417 --> 01:03:22,916
Both of you at the same time?

752
01:03:23,042 --> 01:03:26,291
Where is God in all this?
Is it work-related?

753
01:03:26,417 --> 01:03:29,625
- I'm sure it is.
- All the stuff you inhale.

754
01:03:29,751 --> 01:03:33,875
I haven't got any wigs for men,
but I can cut these in shape.

755
01:03:34,001 --> 01:03:36,208
You haven't lost your hair yet.

756
01:03:36,334 --> 01:03:39,291
The chemo will make it
come off in giant tufts.

757
01:03:39,417 --> 01:03:41,750
Try them on.

758
01:03:43,542 --> 01:03:46,416
- Hi, Ib.
- Bent.

759
01:03:46,542 --> 01:03:48,416
Hi, Edward.

760
01:03:48,542 --> 01:03:53,875
What's up?
How come you look like that?

761
01:03:54,001 --> 01:03:59,541
- Ib and Edward have got cancer.
- Yeah, we're gonna be bald as eggs.

762
01:03:59,667 --> 01:04:02,000
Skinheads.

763
01:04:02,126 --> 01:04:04,375
You... you...

764
01:04:04,501 --> 01:04:08,625
You just ought to...

765
01:04:08,751 --> 01:04:11,583
...ought to go to...

766
01:04:11,709 --> 01:04:14,333
Bent thinks you should take up salsa.

767
01:04:15,251 --> 01:04:18,375
Salsa, Bent.
Hell, that's just what we need -

768
01:04:18,501 --> 01:04:21,541
- with a body full of cancer.
For fuck's sake!

769
01:04:21,667 --> 01:04:26,000
- Thank you, Bent.
- You're welcome, my friend.

770
01:04:38,792 --> 01:04:42,875
- Why do we always make fun of Bent?
- Because we always have.

771
01:04:43,001 --> 01:04:47,583
Not before the accident.
We used to look up to him.

772
01:04:47,709 --> 01:04:51,458
He was the best footballer on the team.

773
01:04:51,584 --> 01:04:56,708
And then the ball rolled out in front
of the car on the highway.

774
01:04:56,834 --> 01:05:00,875
He was gone for six months and when
he returned, he'd turned into a spazz.

775
01:05:01,001 --> 01:05:04,666
- I told you, kids are a load of crap.
- But why do we make fun of him?

776
01:05:04,792 --> 01:05:09,583
He never should have chased
that ball on to the goddamn highway.

777
01:05:11,292 --> 01:05:14,750
Because we're afraid
of Spazzy Bent, Edward.

778
01:05:14,876 --> 01:05:19,458
We're afraid of kids. We're afraid
they'll run out in front of the cars.

779
01:05:19,584 --> 01:05:23,083
- Yeah right.
- But he's happy.

780
01:05:23,209 --> 01:05:27,791
- He dances and he's got a sex life.
- And that's strange.

781
01:05:27,917 --> 01:05:30,250
And what have we got?

782
01:05:30,376 --> 01:05:33,916
You want me to throw myself in front
of a car to get laid? That's stupid.

783
01:05:34,042 --> 01:05:37,208
You're not making any goddamn sense.

784
01:05:53,667 --> 01:05:56,875
Gritt, what are you doing?

785
01:05:58,292 --> 01:06:00,750
I can't take it anymore.

786
01:06:00,876 --> 01:06:05,833
I've had it!
No more perverted psychos.

787
01:06:06,001 --> 01:06:09,000
Are you going to dump her in there?

788
01:06:09,084 --> 01:06:14,041
We're going to do like the British.
Sweep it under the rug. Gone!

789
01:06:16,834 --> 01:06:19,541
I want to be normal, Ingrid.

790
01:06:19,667 --> 01:06:22,541
I miss Ib and his potbelly.

791
01:06:22,667 --> 01:06:26,166
I don't want to go looking for men
who watch PBS -

792
01:06:26,292 --> 01:06:30,000
- because I know that Ib loves me -

793
01:06:30,084 --> 01:06:36,583
- and you're crazy if you can't see
that we've just got our lines crossed.

794
01:06:38,251 --> 01:06:43,375
We used to be happy.
Why can't we be happy again?

795
01:06:45,751 --> 01:06:50,583
I can't take you seriously
if I have to look down on you.

796
01:06:53,584 --> 01:06:56,583
Give me the shovel, quick!

797
01:06:56,709 --> 01:07:00,375
You fucking bitches!

798
01:07:12,126 --> 01:07:15,083
<i>- Hello.
- Igor, this is Edward.</i>

799
01:07:15,209 --> 01:07:17,458
<i>Can you see the house behind you?</i>

800
01:07:17,584 --> 01:07:22,041
<i>It's my house. Gritt and Ingrid are
both waiting for you inside, okay?</i>

801
01:07:22,167 --> 01:07:24,875
<i>- Okay, I kill them?
- No, no!</i>

802
01:07:25,001 --> 01:07:28,583
No, no, Igor. No kill.
They're happy now, very much.

803
01:07:28,709 --> 01:07:31,333
<i>You wanted to hear it
from themselves, right?</i>

804
01:07:33,876 --> 01:07:36,625
Hi, you must be Igor.
I'm Ingrid.

805
01:07:36,751 --> 01:07:39,708
I'm very happy I'm not frigid.
Come in.

806
01:07:44,167 --> 01:07:48,208
Igor, please sit down and have a drink.

807
01:07:48,334 --> 01:07:52,625
I'm Gritt, and I'm very happy
and not frigid.

808
01:07:52,751 --> 01:07:55,750
We are sorry that it's so dark -

809
01:07:55,876 --> 01:08:00,208
- but we forgot
to pay the electricity bill.

810
01:08:00,334 --> 01:08:03,791
Ib and Edward told us
about the little mistake.

811
01:08:03,917 --> 01:08:09,583
If you ask me, I don't think
you should kill us. Right, Ingrid?

812
01:08:12,084 --> 01:08:18,000
You see, Igor, we love our husbands
very, very, very much -

813
01:08:18,084 --> 01:08:22,625
- but sometimes marriage gets
a little bit tired, you know?

814
01:08:22,751 --> 01:08:27,583
It's a bit like tide water.
Sometimes the water is high -

815
01:08:27,709 --> 01:08:30,541
- and sometimes it's low.

816
01:08:30,667 --> 01:08:35,625
And for the last day,
the water has been very, very, very low.

817
01:08:35,751 --> 01:08:40,458
- I hate water.
- Yes, of course you hate water.

818
01:08:40,584 --> 01:08:43,458
Who doesn't?
Don't you hate water, Ingrid?

819
01:08:43,584 --> 01:08:46,833
Hate water! I hate water.

820
01:08:47,001 --> 01:08:50,250
But you see, Igor...

821
01:08:50,376 --> 01:08:54,666
Women have so many feelings.
Their heart is so big -

822
01:08:54,792 --> 01:08:57,666
- and sometimes it's like
there's a storm inside. A storm, Igor.

823
01:08:57,792 --> 01:09:01,750
- Shit, Ib!
- I remember my first date.

824
01:09:01,876 --> 01:09:06,166
I was only 15,
and Sofus his name was.

825
01:09:06,292 --> 01:09:10,375
I had a good eye to him.
He was in my parallel class.

826
01:09:10,501 --> 01:09:12,583
And after many, many, many months -

827
01:09:12,709 --> 01:09:16,541
- finally he asked if I would walk out
and eat pizza with him.

828
01:09:16,667 --> 01:09:18,166
Ib, what the hell are you doing?

829
01:09:18,292 --> 01:09:24,166
I was so nervous and also hungry,
so of course I said yes.

830
01:09:25,209 --> 01:09:28,833
When he kissed me outside
Pizzeria Milano...

831
01:09:29,001 --> 01:09:34,708
...I swear my knees were like rubber
and my heart missed a slag.

832
01:09:35,917 --> 01:09:41,500
You probably are the two ugliest
trannies I have ever laid my eyes on.

833
01:09:41,626 --> 01:09:45,333
I think I am gonna be sick.

834
01:09:45,459 --> 01:09:50,041
- I agree.
- What are you saying?

835
01:09:52,042 --> 01:09:57,750
I am saying you both look like retired
Ukrainian hookers in a car crash.

836
01:09:57,876 --> 01:10:00,208
I'm glad the lights are out.

837
01:10:00,334 --> 01:10:05,333
- How dare you talk to women like that?
- How dare I?

838
01:10:05,459 --> 01:10:08,083
- Ib, goddammit.
- You are very ugly.

839
01:10:08,209 --> 01:10:11,166
- Fuck you!
- Please don't.

840
01:10:15,834 --> 01:10:17,500
No!

841
01:10:18,292 --> 01:10:24,458
What the hell got into you, Ib?
What the hell got into you, man?!

842
01:10:24,584 --> 01:10:27,375
I won't have him talk
to Gritt like that.

843
01:10:27,501 --> 01:10:31,541
- You're not Gritt, you're Ib!
- Where am I? Is my hair okay?

844
01:10:31,667 --> 01:10:34,208
You're not Gritt, you're Ib.
You're a man!

845
01:10:34,334 --> 01:10:38,625
It was the woman inside me, Edward.
She came thundering out.

846
01:10:38,751 --> 01:10:42,583
Suddenly I felt breasts,
ovaries and everything.

847
01:10:42,709 --> 01:10:47,000
Suddenly I'd like to have kids.

848
01:10:49,584 --> 01:10:53,833
Give it to me. Give it to me.
Give it to me!

849
01:10:56,501 --> 01:11:00,041
Ib, stop looking at me like that.

850
01:11:00,167 --> 01:11:03,416
We have to get outta here!
We must find the girls.

851
01:11:03,542 --> 01:11:05,416
We have to put an end to this!

852
01:11:25,001 --> 01:11:28,625
- Pick up the goddamn phone, Ingrid.
- Ingrid speaking.

853
01:11:28,751 --> 01:11:32,666
<i>- Hi, Ingrid, it's me.
- Hi, Edward.</i>

854
01:11:32,792 --> 01:11:36,333
Look, we have to meet right away!

855
01:11:36,459 --> 01:11:41,541
- Don't you boss me around.
- Oh, I didn't mean to boss you around.

856
01:11:41,667 --> 01:11:45,000
You bet you didn't.
You sound so grumpy.

857
01:11:45,126 --> 01:11:49,625
- No, I'm just a bit stressed out.
- You sound grumpy.

858
01:11:49,751 --> 01:11:53,708
I know I'm grumpy.
We've been over it like 4,000 times.

859
01:11:53,834 --> 01:11:57,083
<i>- But it doesn't sink in, does it?
- We have to meet right away.</i>

860
01:11:57,209 --> 01:11:59,625
Let's meet at the inn, then.

861
01:11:59,751 --> 01:12:04,166
No, we can't meet there.

862
01:12:04,292 --> 01:12:06,083
- What's up?
- Be there.

863
01:12:06,209 --> 01:12:09,333
<i>- We'll meet there. No problem.
- Just be there.</i>

864
01:12:09,459 --> 01:12:12,625
Goddamn it, Ib,
We're meeting at the inn.

865
01:12:12,751 --> 01:12:15,166
I couldn't... shit.

866
01:12:15,292 --> 01:12:20,583
Let me out! Fucking bitches!

867
01:12:24,626 --> 01:12:27,875
- What the hell...?
- What the hell happened to you?

868
01:12:31,167 --> 01:12:36,750
- Look, we can't talk here.
- This is a fine place to talk.

869
01:12:36,876 --> 01:12:39,666
You can't hurt us here, you see.

870
01:12:39,792 --> 01:12:42,916
Well, what happened to your killer?

871
01:12:44,417 --> 01:12:47,000
Yes...

872
01:12:47,084 --> 01:12:51,250
- You know?
- We know everything.

873
01:12:51,376 --> 01:12:56,250
As a matter offact,
we've got Heinz on the phone.

874
01:12:56,376 --> 01:12:59,375
We told him we felt threatened -

875
01:12:59,501 --> 01:13:02,375
- so he's ready to move out
if you try anything.

876
01:13:02,501 --> 01:13:06,041
- Oh, Heinz?
- Right, Gritt?

877
01:13:22,334 --> 01:13:24,750
Why are you looking like that?

878
01:13:24,876 --> 01:13:28,375
Maybe you'd like to explain -

879
01:13:28,501 --> 01:13:34,291
- what the hell is going on
in your sick heads. A hitman?!

880
01:13:34,417 --> 01:13:39,458
This whole mess with the divorce
and the moneyjust really got to us -

881
01:13:39,584 --> 01:13:42,375
- and then we did a stupid thing.

882
01:13:42,501 --> 01:13:44,833
It's very human -

883
01:13:45,001 --> 01:13:50,291
- to mess up and live to regret it.

884
01:13:50,417 --> 01:13:55,458
Maybe it's subconscious.
You do something against your will.

885
01:13:55,584 --> 01:13:58,166
You want to do something -

886
01:13:58,292 --> 01:14:00,541
- but you don't want to after all.

887
01:14:00,667 --> 01:14:03,000
We know what subconscious means.

888
01:14:03,126 --> 01:14:07,833
We'd never kill you
on account of alimony.

889
01:14:08,001 --> 01:14:10,166
Nobody deserves to die. Not you either.

890
01:14:10,292 --> 01:14:14,250
- Do you want me to call the police?
- Mind your own business, will you?

891
01:14:14,376 --> 01:14:19,416
- Aren't they threatening to kill you?
- Do we look dead? No, right?

892
01:14:19,542 --> 01:14:24,333
- Ingrid, you'd better keep it down.
- You don't discuss killing your wife.

893
01:14:24,459 --> 01:14:28,250
- We're discussing them considering it.
- Well, you don't consider it either.

894
01:14:28,376 --> 01:14:33,000
So none of you have ever had
forbidden thoughts?

895
01:14:33,126 --> 01:14:36,625
If only you could blow the head off the
guy who cuts you off at the crossing -

896
01:14:36,751 --> 01:14:39,333
- or the guy blocking the escalator.

897
01:14:39,459 --> 01:14:43,833
Or your husband who always forgets your
anniversary and gives you a blender.

898
01:14:44,001 --> 01:14:49,458
Or when you're busy and stuck
in the line at the supermarket -

899
01:14:49,584 --> 01:14:52,875
- I'm just saying, that makes
some of us think certain thoughts.

900
01:14:53,001 --> 01:14:56,833
- But not you.
- That blender works like a dream.

901
01:14:57,001 --> 01:15:00,541
No, you're so polite and you've
got your head so far up your ass -

902
01:15:00,667 --> 01:15:03,000
- you can look out through your throat.

903
01:15:10,834 --> 01:15:13,500
Don't drink any more!

904
01:15:17,292 --> 01:15:19,166
- She's here.
- Get out!

905
01:15:24,876 --> 01:15:28,666
- It's flat! They're all flat!
- Run!

906
01:15:28,792 --> 01:15:33,166
- They're all flat.
- Taxi! Taxi!

907
01:15:39,251 --> 01:15:40,416
Go!

908
01:15:46,042 --> 01:15:49,208
I don't think
you look very happy tonight.

909
01:15:56,001 --> 01:15:58,041
What is wrong with you people?

910
01:16:00,334 --> 01:16:04,375
You have no problems.
You have no problems.

911
01:16:04,501 --> 01:16:08,625
My mother and father in Murmansk
far away, they have problems.

912
01:16:08,751 --> 01:16:12,291
They live together for 50 years.
They are married for 50 years -

913
01:16:12,417 --> 01:16:15,541
- but they still kiss.

914
01:16:15,667 --> 01:16:21,125
They have problems, they fight.
She hit him, he fall, she pick him up.

915
01:16:21,251 --> 01:16:26,708
But they love each other, they kiss
each other, they fuck each other.

916
01:16:26,834 --> 01:16:31,833
She's very, very big woman,
and he has a very, very small dick.

917
01:16:32,001 --> 01:16:37,416
But you know, a little tiny fuck
is always better than no fuck.

918
01:16:37,542 --> 01:16:43,375
And you have everything. You have
woman, man, car, house, money.

919
01:16:43,501 --> 01:16:46,500
You have everything,
but you have no fuck!

920
01:16:46,626 --> 01:16:51,000
Edward... Edward?
What are you doing, Edward?

921
01:16:51,751 --> 01:16:55,000
Sit.
Sit down, Edward.

922
01:17:01,292 --> 01:17:07,000
I really like you guys, but it just
makes me so sad when I see sad people.

923
01:17:07,126 --> 01:17:10,666
Hello, Igor?
You're alright, you're okay.

924
01:17:10,792 --> 01:17:15,875
You talk about being happy
all the time -

925
01:17:16,001 --> 01:17:20,000
- but are you happy, Igor?
Where is love in your life?

926
01:17:20,126 --> 01:17:25,708
I think you just kill people
because they're like you. Unhappy.

927
01:17:27,001 --> 01:17:30,791
You really think this is some kind
of stupid movie moment?

928
01:17:30,917 --> 01:17:36,041
Yes, Igor. This is where
the good guy talks to the bad guy -

929
01:17:36,167 --> 01:17:41,333
- and he makes him realize
that he's totally wrong.

930
01:17:41,459 --> 01:17:44,000
I haven't seen that work in a movie.

931
01:17:44,084 --> 01:17:47,541
Then you haven't seen many, many movies.

932
01:17:47,667 --> 01:17:51,041
- There's many, many, many movies...
- Name one.

933
01:17:54,584 --> 01:17:58,458
Okay, Igor, then try this one.

934
01:17:58,584 --> 01:18:03,041
Have you ever given it a thought
that maybe people are unhappy -

935
01:18:03,167 --> 01:18:07,708
- just before you're going to kill them,
because you are going to kill them?

936
01:18:08,584 --> 01:18:11,916
Maybe that makes them
just a tiny little bit unhappy.

937
01:18:12,042 --> 01:18:17,458
Think that might just play a tiny little
fucking role, huh, you stupid Russian?

938
01:18:18,876 --> 01:18:22,458
Okay, Edward, now you tell me -

939
01:18:22,584 --> 01:18:24,666
- or I will kill you.

940
01:18:24,792 --> 01:18:27,791
When was the last time
you made your woman happy?

941
01:18:27,917 --> 01:18:31,458
There's never any time! She's going to
her goddamn salsa lessons all the time.

942
01:18:31,584 --> 01:18:33,333
Oh, cut it out!

943
01:18:39,542 --> 01:18:42,041
- Now we have a little time.
- What?

944
01:18:42,167 --> 01:18:45,708
So try to make her happy, Edward.

945
01:18:49,876 --> 01:18:54,000
- Well, what do you want me to say?
- Christ, you're romantic!

946
01:18:54,126 --> 01:18:58,291
- Say something to her.
- Sure.

947
01:18:58,417 --> 01:19:00,458
Sure...

948
01:19:00,584 --> 01:19:03,250
Ingrid, I think you're hot.

949
01:19:03,376 --> 01:19:07,208
And I think
it's a waste of tits and ass...

950
01:19:07,334 --> 01:19:11,458
- Holy crap!
- At least pretend I'm making you happy!

951
01:19:11,584 --> 01:19:15,458
He doesn't understand Danish.
Or would you rather die?

952
01:19:15,584 --> 01:19:19,291
Edward, try to talk about her eyes.

953
01:19:22,126 --> 01:19:26,833
Yes, well... Your eyes are so...

954
01:19:27,001 --> 01:19:30,500
Sure, your eyes are...

955
01:19:31,251 --> 01:19:33,791
...round and blue.

956
01:19:33,917 --> 01:19:37,083
Grey, green, no, brown.

957
01:19:37,209 --> 01:19:39,583
- They're blue-grey, you idiot!
- Shit!

958
01:19:39,709 --> 01:19:44,625
Ingrid, you're always on my mind.
You're with me all the time.

959
01:19:46,834 --> 01:19:52,250
And it's not your ass I see, but your
eyes, because they're really special -

960
01:19:52,376 --> 01:19:57,791
- your eyes are.
Both deep and... naughty.

961
01:19:57,917 --> 01:20:00,791
You have very intense eyes.

962
01:20:00,917 --> 01:20:05,875
I don't understand
why you're with a grump like me.

963
01:20:06,001 --> 01:20:09,875
But then you aren't anymore.

964
01:20:11,167 --> 01:20:16,000
All I know is
that for the rest of my life -

965
01:20:16,126 --> 01:20:19,416
- I'll remember those eyes.

966
01:20:22,584 --> 01:20:26,291
But then that's only
a couple of minutes.

967
01:20:26,417 --> 01:20:29,375
I'm sorry, darling.

968
01:20:29,501 --> 01:20:33,916
Oh, Edward,
I don't want anybody else than you.

969
01:20:34,042 --> 01:20:37,541
If only you were someone else.

970
01:20:45,584 --> 01:20:47,875
That was beautiful.

971
01:20:48,001 --> 01:20:52,000
Edward, you make us happy.

972
01:20:59,042 --> 01:21:01,166
Igor?

973
01:21:04,209 --> 01:21:08,875
<i>Cyanide... 30 seconds.
And nothing...</i>

974
01:21:09,001 --> 01:21:12,416
Haven't tasted such shitty vodka
since I was eight.

975
01:21:40,542 --> 01:21:41,750
No!

976
01:21:55,376 --> 01:21:57,000
No!

977
01:22:16,751 --> 01:22:19,583
The word salsa!

978
01:22:19,709 --> 01:22:25,375
Some say it comes from the sound
the Cuban musicians made -

979
01:22:25,501 --> 01:22:28,583
- while they played.

980
01:22:28,709 --> 01:22:35,250
Others claim it's because
salsa is a blend of many styles.

981
01:22:35,376 --> 01:22:40,541
Like the salsa sauce.
A little bit of everything.

982
01:22:40,667 --> 01:22:46,083
A little soft, a little sweet,
a little spicy.

983
01:22:46,209 --> 01:22:51,458
Like life itself.
We love, we hate.

984
01:22:51,584 --> 01:22:54,875
We fight -

985
01:22:55,001 --> 01:22:56,500
- and we kiss.

986
01:23:56,126 --> 01:23:59,708
Shit, I hate this.
It just isn't me at all.

987
01:23:59,834 --> 01:24:03,208
It's a load of bull.
These clothes are too tight.

988
01:24:03,334 --> 01:24:07,041
They're not intended to be worn.
They make you look stupid.

989
01:24:07,167 --> 01:24:09,541
It's not me at all.

990
01:24:09,667 --> 01:24:13,458
- Well, Gritt and I are off now.
- Already?

991
01:24:13,584 --> 01:24:16,041
Gritt's ovaries hurt.

992
01:24:16,167 --> 01:24:19,041
You're brave.
What about nuchal folds?

993
01:24:19,167 --> 01:24:23,541
With or without nuchal folds.
Ovulation in an hour.

994
01:25:14,501 --> 01:25:19,041
So, you finally finished
the Great Wall of China, huh?

995
01:25:19,167 --> 01:25:21,458
No need for sarcasm.

996
01:25:21,584 --> 01:25:26,416
- How are things with the girls at home?
- Just fine, Mrs. Hansen.

997
01:25:26,542 --> 01:25:30,875
It sure sounds like
you're boring in bed.

998
01:25:31,001 --> 01:25:36,000
- But, Mrs. Hansen...
- Time for a screwdriver!

999
01:25:37,501 --> 01:25:41,708
Oh dear.
Give me a hand, will you?

1000
01:25:41,834 --> 01:25:44,666
As for your women...

1001
01:25:44,792 --> 01:25:49,041
Men don't understand
it's all about the clitoris.

1002
01:25:49,167 --> 01:25:51,416
Most can't even find it.

1003
01:25:51,542 --> 01:25:55,416
And not only my late Poul,
but all my lovers.

1004
01:25:55,542 --> 01:25:57,666
Couldn't find it.

1005
01:25:57,792 --> 01:26:03,041
Searched for it like
it was the Higgs Boson in Switzerland.

1006
01:26:03,167 --> 01:26:06,708
They kept licking away
in all the wrong places.

1007
01:26:06,834 --> 01:26:13,458
No, I won't climax
if you put my big toe in your mouth!

1008
01:26:13,584 --> 01:26:17,041
How about I show you how it's done?

1009
01:26:17,167 --> 01:26:20,458
We could all go lie on the sofa.

1010
01:26:20,584 --> 01:26:24,000
My crawl space could do
with a nice makeover.

1011
01:26:24,876 --> 01:26:28,166
Let's just settle the bill later,
Mrs. Hansen.

1012
