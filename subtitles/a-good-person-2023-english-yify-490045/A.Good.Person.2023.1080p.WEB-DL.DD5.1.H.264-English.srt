what the hell is all this?

346
00:15:16,049 --> 00:15:20,020
You have got to stop buying
all this crap.

347
00:15:21,321 --> 00:15:24,692
Yeah, well, one of them
is an acrylic nail set

348
00:15:24,759 --> 00:15:27,227
that I know you'll appreciate
more than I will.

349
00:15:27,294 --> 00:15:28,962
And the others
are ankle weights.

350
00:15:29,029 --> 00:15:30,998
Remember? We said we were
gonna get in shape?

351
00:15:31,699 --> 00:15:33,133
Oh, my God.

352
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:36,170
Allie, what the hell
did you do to your hair?

353
00:15:36,236 --> 00:15:37,772
What? It's makeover Monday.

354
00:15:37,839 --> 00:15:40,542
-It's Friday.
-Oh.

355
00:15:40,608 --> 00:15:42,811
-It's so dark in here.
-No, please, don't open that.

356
00:15:42,877 --> 00:15:44,378
Mama, that is so bright!

357
00:15:44,445 --> 00:15:46,146
[Diane] Did you go
to physical therapy today?

358
00:15:46,213 --> 00:15:48,115
Um, well, I tried to,

359
00:15:48,182 --> 00:15:50,150
-but I overslept.
-Allie...

360
00:15:50,217 --> 00:15:52,654
What? I don't need PT.
I don't.

361
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:54,221
Allie, your hair.

362
00:15:54,856 --> 00:15:56,558
You don't like it?

363
00:15:56,624 --> 00:15:58,392
I just don't understand why
you would cut your own hair.

364
00:15:58,459 --> 00:16:00,862
Well, the girl said
it was easy, and it was not.

365
00:16:00,929 --> 00:16:02,463
What girl?

366
00:16:02,530 --> 00:16:05,667
This girl on the Internet.
She's an influencer.

367
00:16:05,733 --> 00:16:07,334
She influenced me.

368
00:16:07,401 --> 00:16:11,639
Such a pigsty in here.
I am not happy about this.

369
00:16:11,706 --> 00:16:13,675
Hey, Mama, can you tell me
where my pills are?

370
00:16:13,741 --> 00:16:15,877
Which ones?

371
00:16:15,944 --> 00:16:19,814
We said we were going to
wean off of them. Remember?

372
00:16:19,881 --> 00:16:21,783
-Did we?
-Yes.

373
00:16:21,850 --> 00:16:24,552
Because "we" are in pain

374
00:16:24,619 --> 00:16:26,286
and "we" need more.

375
00:16:26,353 --> 00:16:27,522
They're not gonna
give you more, Allie.

376
00:16:27,589 --> 00:16:29,056
-They have to!
-No, they don't.

377
00:16:29,122 --> 00:16:30,692
I need them!

378
00:16:30,758 --> 00:16:32,192
Listen to me.

379
00:16:32,259 --> 00:16:34,294
You're not in physical pain
anymore.

380
00:16:34,361 --> 00:16:36,396
Have you been doing
the tapping thing

381
00:16:36,463 --> 00:16:37,932
that that one shrink
taught you?

382
00:16:37,998 --> 00:16:40,100
Remember?
For anxiety and stress,

383
00:16:40,167 --> 00:16:41,970
and it calms you down
on the...

384
00:16:42,035 --> 00:16:43,705
-eyes, and then the lips.
-Mom!

385
00:16:43,771 --> 00:16:45,372
[Diane] Or play your piano.
That always cheers you up.

386
00:16:45,439 --> 00:16:47,140
I don't wanna talk
about this, please.

387
00:16:47,207 --> 00:16:49,409
I have the worst headache!
Can you just stop?

388
00:16:49,476 --> 00:16:52,346
Can you call the doctors
and help me, please?

389
00:16:52,412 --> 00:16:54,181
Which one? Patel?
He said no more.

390
00:16:54,248 --> 00:16:56,651
Okay, well, fuck Patel.
Fuck Patel!

391
00:16:56,718 --> 00:16:58,485
How about Goldberg, or...

392
00:16:58,553 --> 00:17:00,187
or Fong?

393
00:17:00,254 --> 00:17:01,890
-Allie...
-Please, Mom.

394
00:17:01,956 --> 00:17:03,357
-Just call 'em. Just help me.
-You're being a little...

395
00:17:03,423 --> 00:17:04,926
-No.
-Just help me, please.

396
00:17:04,993 --> 00:17:06,159
Guess what?
They all said "no."

397
00:17:06,226 --> 00:17:08,061
Patel. Goldberg.
Fong. Rosenberg.

398
00:17:08,128 --> 00:17:09,998
Okay, well, I'll try Vromen.
He loves me.

399
00:17:10,063 --> 00:17:11,933
Vromen is an orthodontist.

400
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,601
Yeah, but he used to
flirt with me

401
00:17:13,668 --> 00:17:15,637
when his fingers were really
deep inside my mouth,

402
00:17:15,703 --> 00:17:18,006
and it was very inappropriate,
and so, he really owes me one.

403
00:17:18,071 --> 00:17:19,908
Allie, I don't like
how you're acting.

404
00:17:19,974 --> 00:17:21,308
You know what?
Enough is enough.

405
00:17:21,375 --> 00:17:22,911
You gotta get out
of this living room,

406
00:17:22,977 --> 00:17:24,378
take off your pajamas,

407
00:17:24,444 --> 00:17:26,280
and get your ass,
and go get a job.

408
00:17:26,346 --> 00:17:27,615
I'm sick of this crap.

409
00:17:27,682 --> 00:17:29,684
As if you have any right

410
00:17:29,751 --> 00:17:31,953
lecturing me
on medicating myself.

411
00:17:32,020 --> 00:17:33,588
What is that supposed to mean?

412
00:17:33,655 --> 00:17:36,390
It means, Mom, you're such
a fucking hypocrite!

413
00:17:36,456 --> 00:17:39,259
You don't think that I clock
how many Xanax you take?

414
00:17:39,326 --> 00:17:41,395
Or how many glasses of wine
you drink?

415
00:17:41,461 --> 00:17:43,397
You think I'm just a zombie
that doesn't notice anything,

416
00:17:43,463 --> 00:17:46,166
but I notice
fucking everything! I see you.

417
00:17:46,233 --> 00:17:49,604
So, can I have my pills,
please?

418
00:17:49,671 --> 00:17:52,040
You're not listening.
There's no more.

419
00:17:52,105 --> 00:17:53,675
[breathes heavily]

420
00:17:59,246 --> 00:18:01,148
[Diane] You get
right back here,

421
00:18:01,214 --> 00:18:02,717
-you little brat!
-No!

422
00:18:02,784 --> 00:18:05,185
What in the hell do you think
you are doing?

423
00:18:05,252 --> 00:18:06,721
Get out of there!

424
00:18:06,788 --> 00:18:08,155
-Get out of there!
-[Allison] Get off me!

425
00:18:08,221 --> 00:18:09,824
-No! Get out of there!
-Let go!

426
00:18:09,891 --> 00:18:11,693
-[Diane] What are you doing?
-No! Are they in here?

427
00:18:11,759 --> 00:18:14,161
-[Diane] Get back! Cut it out!
-You are hurting me!

428
00:18:14,227 --> 00:18:15,563
[Diane] Stop it!

429
00:18:15,630 --> 00:18:17,497
-Stop it! Put that back!
-[grunts] Mom!

430
00:18:18,566 --> 00:18:19,466
No.

431
00:18:19,534 --> 00:18:21,201
-Open the door.
-No.

432
00:18:21,268 --> 00:18:22,369
-Open the fucking door!
-Stop it! Stop it.

433
00:18:22,436 --> 00:18:23,871
-Mom, let me out.
-No.

434
00:18:23,938 --> 00:18:26,040
Let me out. Let me out!

435
00:18:26,106 --> 00:18:27,474
Mama!

436
00:18:27,542 --> 00:18:29,077
-No! Stop it!
-Give me those... Ow.

437
00:18:29,142 --> 00:18:31,211
-Stop it!
-[Diane] Ow! Ow, ow, ow, ow.

438
00:18:31,278 --> 00:18:33,548
-You fucking crazy little brat.
-[Allison] No!

439
00:18:34,481 --> 00:18:35,650
[groans]

440
00:18:36,084 --> 00:18:37,986
Shit!

441
00:18:38,052 --> 00:18:40,220
No, no, no, no, no, no.

442
00:18:40,287 --> 00:18:42,456
Mama, no! Please. No!

443
00:18:44,391 --> 00:18:46,594
Why the fuck did you do that?

444
00:18:46,661 --> 00:18:47,729
I'm in pain!

445
00:18:47,795 --> 00:18:49,097
I don't give a shit!

446
00:18:49,162 --> 00:18:50,230
Your daughter
is in actual pain!

447
00:18:50,297 --> 00:18:51,566
I don't give a shit!

448
00:18:51,633 --> 00:18:55,235
I fucking hate you so much!

449
00:18:55,302 --> 00:18:56,971
[Diane] You're bleeding!

450
00:18:57,038 --> 00:18:59,339
[panting]

451
00:19:01,141 --> 00:19:02,610
You get back here right now.

452
00:19:02,677 --> 00:19:04,411
-ALLISON: Leave me alone.
-You come back here.

453
00:19:04,478 --> 00:19:05,445
-ALLISON: Leave me alone.
-I'm gonna grab your...

454
00:19:05,513 --> 00:19:06,914
[arguing continues]

455
00:19:06,981 --> 00:19:08,549
[Allison]
Leave me the fuck alone!

456
00:19:08,616 --> 00:19:09,917
[Diane] I'm not gonna leave you
the fuck alone,

457
00:19:09,984 --> 00:19:10,918
-you little brat.
-Ugh!

458
00:19:11,819 --> 00:19:13,855
[mellow music playing]

459
00:19:15,790 --> 00:19:17,324
Allison!

460
00:19:17,391 --> 00:19:19,159
-Leave me alone!
-[Diane] Where are you going?

461
00:19:19,226 --> 00:19:21,294
Leave me alone!

462
00:19:22,997 --> 00:19:25,365
[panting]

463
00:19:30,404 --> 00:19:32,239
[crowd applauding and cheering]

464
00:19:32,305 --> 00:19:34,307
[Daniel] Let's go, Ryan!

465
00:19:35,342 --> 00:19:37,411
Attagirl! Attagirl!

466
00:19:41,348 --> 00:19:42,684
[crowd groans]

467
00:19:43,918 --> 00:19:45,687
Fuck! [sighs]

468
00:19:45,753 --> 00:19:47,487
So you're the Ryan
that's been talking to Damien?

469
00:19:47,555 --> 00:19:49,157
Get the fuck outta my face.

470
00:19:49,222 --> 00:19:50,658
See, you talk to people
like that, bitch,

471
00:19:50,725 --> 00:19:52,225
that's why you have
no fucking friends.

472
00:19:52,292 --> 00:19:53,628
Why are you
hitting on me, huh?

473
00:19:53,695 --> 00:19:55,328
Uh, I'm not the one
named "Ryan."

474
00:19:55,395 --> 00:19:57,165
It's a fucking dyke's name.
You a dyke?

475
00:19:57,230 --> 00:19:58,966
-Only when I fuck your mother.
-Oh, at least I have a mother.

476
00:20:02,335 --> 00:20:03,971
What the fuck
did you just say to me?

477
00:20:04,772 --> 00:20:06,206
Hey!

478
00:20:06,273 --> 00:20:09,409
Stay away from Damien,
you fucking whore.

479
00:20:10,178 --> 00:20:11,179
Hey!

480
00:20:11,244 --> 00:20:13,147
Break that up, Ref!

481
00:20:13,213 --> 00:20:14,549
-[Ryan grunts]
-[whistle blowing]

482
00:20:14,615 --> 00:20:15,750
[referee] Break it up.
Break it up!

483
00:20:16,184 --> 00:20:17,317
Hey!

484
00:20:18,086 --> 00:20:19,654
[whistle continues blowing]

485
00:20:19,721 --> 00:20:22,523
[referee] Hey! That's it!
You're both out. Red card.

486
00:20:22,590 --> 00:20:24,058
[Daniel] Ryan,
what the hell was that?

487
00:20:24,125 --> 00:20:25,593
[huffs] I quit.

488
00:20:25,660 --> 00:20:27,662
[tearfully] I quit.
I hate this fucking game.

489
00:20:27,729 --> 00:20:29,897
Why? Because you got
in a fight?

490
00:20:29,964 --> 00:20:31,733
Come on, that's not you.

491
00:20:31,799 --> 00:20:34,068
You're tough.
You're not a quitter.

492
00:20:34,135 --> 00:20:37,105
-She made fun of Mom.
-What?

493
00:20:37,171 --> 00:20:39,473
She said,
"At least I have a mom."

494
00:20:42,110 --> 00:20:43,745
Well, fuck her.

495
00:20:47,314 --> 00:20:48,583
Well...

496
00:20:49,650 --> 00:20:52,186
And what kind of a punch
was that?

497
00:20:52,252 --> 00:20:54,222
You throw this hard right hook

498
00:20:54,287 --> 00:20:57,357
and then you leave yourself
wide open for the jab.

499
00:20:58,226 --> 00:20:59,961
We're gonna have to work
on that.

500
00:21:01,461 --> 00:21:03,664
[mellow music playing]

501
00:21:10,972 --> 00:21:12,974
[breathing heavily]

502
00:21:17,745 --> 00:21:18,913
Hi.

503
00:21:18,980 --> 00:21:21,314
I'm here to get
a prescription refilled.

504
00:21:21,381 --> 00:21:24,185
Last name, Johnson.
Birthday, August 24th.

505
00:21:24,252 --> 00:21:26,154
Okay. For which medication?

506
00:21:26,220 --> 00:21:29,257
Uh... The Oxy. OxyContin.

507
00:21:29,322 --> 00:21:31,391
It says here
you are out of refills.

508
00:21:31,458 --> 00:21:33,861
I see you've been on them
for over a year now.

509
00:21:33,928 --> 00:21:35,963
Your doctor's probably trying
to wean you off of them.

510
00:21:36,030 --> 00:21:38,465
As I'm sure you know,
they can be very addictive.

511
00:21:38,533 --> 00:21:40,601
Oh, really?
I hadn't fucking heard that.

512
00:21:42,302 --> 00:21:43,370
Sorry.

513
00:21:43,436 --> 00:21:45,405
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

514
00:21:45,973 --> 00:21:47,875
Listen...

515
00:21:47,942 --> 00:21:49,811
I was in a really bad
car accident,

516
00:21:49,877 --> 00:21:53,114
and I need them,

517
00:21:53,181 --> 00:21:54,381
Just now?

518
00:21:55,348 --> 00:21:56,416
What? No.

519
00:21:56,483 --> 00:21:59,053
Your elbow is bleeding.

520
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:00,655
Oh, shit.
Look, it's fine.

521
00:22:00,721 --> 00:22:02,389
Let me go get you a bandage.

522
00:22:02,455 --> 00:22:04,457
I don't need
a fucking bandage. It's fine.

523
00:22:08,461 --> 00:22:09,730
Then take this.

524
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:14,735
Oh, my goodness.
Thank you so much. Thank you.

525
00:22:16,771 --> 00:22:19,707
I feel so much better now.
Thank you.

526
00:22:20,308 --> 00:22:21,609

-Ah, thank you! Um...

553

I, uh, got a new gal.

Okay.

Oh, I was so happy
that you reached out.

557
00:24:42,016 --> 00:24:44,919
Because you weren't responding
to any of my texts.

558
00:24:44,986 --> 00:24:47,021
Of course, I wanted
to give you your space,

-Hey!

00:24:50,224 --> 00:24:51,625
Can I get you anything?

00:24:51,692 --> 00:24:54,562
Uh, yeah. Can I please get
a Jack and Coke?

563
00:24:54,996 --> 00:24:56,731
Uh...

564
00:24:56,797 --> 00:24:59,300
Sorry, our bar doesn't
actually open until 11:00.

565
00:24:59,367 --> 00:25:00,868
Oh.

566
00:25:00,935 --> 00:25:03,938
Uh, okay. In that case,
I'll get a black coffee.

-You got it.

568
00:25:09,243 --> 00:25:11,545
So, how's, how's work?

569
00:25:11,612 --> 00:25:12,847
You're still at Purdue, right?

570
00:25:12,913 --> 00:25:14,548
-Still repping Purdue.
-Yeah.

571
00:25:14,615 --> 00:25:16,117
You'd think it would've been
a shit show

572
00:25:16,183 --> 00:25:17,585

have actually increased.

00:25:22,757 --> 00:25:25,793

When are you going back
to work?

[smacks lips] Listen,
I'm just gonna cut right to it

586
00:25:42,743 --> 00:25:44,011
because you're my friend

587
00:25:44,078 --> 00:25:45,613
and I know
you're gonna understand.

588
00:25:45,679 --> 00:25:46,981
Um...

589
00:25:47,882 --> 00:25:50,551
I'm still in a lot of pain.

590
00:25:50,618 --> 00:25:52,153
Oh, Allie...

591
00:25:52,219 --> 00:25:56,057
I know, and my docs
are cutting my Oxy scripts

592
00:25:56,123 --> 00:25:58,492
because everyone's
really freaked out

593
00:25:58,559 --> 00:26:00,061
about addiction these days.

594
00:26:00,127 --> 00:26:01,729
Uh... [hesitates]

595
00:26:01,796 --> 00:26:04,298
So, I was wondering
if it would be possible...

596
00:26:04,365 --> 00:26:06,200
Allie, please tell me
you didn't invite me

597
00:26:06,267 --> 00:26:08,836
to breakfast
to hit me up for pills.

598
00:26:09,236 --> 00:26:10,404
No.

599
00:26:10,471 --> 00:26:12,006
-No, no, no, no, no.
-[sighs]

600
00:26:12,073 --> 00:26:14,408
It's just until I can get in,
and see my docs.

601
00:26:14,475 --> 00:26:16,343
Um, because my fucking mother,

602
00:26:16,410 --> 00:26:19,613
she threw my last refill
into the toilet, so...

603
00:26:20,114 --> 00:26:21,248
No way.

604
00:26:21,315 --> 00:26:23,150
Are you fucking
with me right now?

605
00:26:23,217 --> 00:26:24,785
No.

606
00:26:24,852 --> 00:26:26,555
If you have a problem,
you need to get some help.

607
00:26:26,654 --> 00:26:28,889
I can help you
find the right rehab.

608
00:26:28,956 --> 00:26:31,125
Please don't hand me
a pamphlet.

609
00:26:31,192 --> 00:26:32,793
I already have one.

610
00:26:32,860 --> 00:26:34,795
Well, then find them
on the street if you have to.

611
00:26:34,862 --> 00:26:36,831
Every dive bar
in this town's got a guy

612
00:26:36,897 --> 00:26:39,166
with a pharmacy
in his front pocket.

613
00:26:39,233 --> 00:26:41,102
You know, Becka,

614
00:26:42,103 --> 00:26:44,371
I really didn't want
to do this.

615
00:26:46,207 --> 00:26:47,274
But...

616
00:26:49,009 --> 00:26:50,644
there's a handful of things

617
00:26:50,711 --> 00:26:53,781
that happened
at your bachelorette party

618
00:26:53,848 --> 00:26:57,251
that I'm pretty sure
you want to be kept private.

619
00:26:57,318 --> 00:27:00,988
Allison, are you trying
to blackmail me for OxyContin?

620
00:27:01,055 --> 00:27:03,057
I'm just asking you for help.

621
00:27:03,958 --> 00:27:06,327
Like, as a friend.

622
00:27:07,995 --> 00:27:10,331
But you did blow that dancer.
[chuckles]

623
00:27:11,298 --> 00:27:12,766
It happened for a second.

624
00:27:12,833 --> 00:27:15,836
I know, I know.
But you did it, and I saw.

625
00:27:16,637 --> 00:27:17,671
It never went in my mouth.

626
00:27:17,738 --> 00:27:19,406
It was in your mouth.

627
00:27:19,473 --> 00:27:21,308
It was in your mouth.

628
00:27:21,375 --> 00:27:22,776
Past the tip.

629
00:27:23,545 --> 00:27:26,147
Past the fucking tip.

630
00:27:26,947 --> 00:27:28,682
Allie, you need help.

631
00:27:29,683 --> 00:27:31,152
Destroy my life
if you have to.

632
00:27:31,218 --> 00:27:34,788
But for the love of God,
get some fucking help!

633
00:27:34,855 --> 00:27:36,357
Okay, bye.
Fuck you.

634
00:27:36,423 --> 00:27:37,958
Fuck you!

635

[grunts]

636
00:27:43,797 --> 00:27:46,100
Uh... I don't...
Oh, fuck.

637
00:27:46,167 --> 00:27:48,202
[sighs]

638
00:27:48,269 --> 00:27:49,970
I don't have any money.
I'm really sorry.

639
00:27:50,037 --> 00:27:51,472
I can't pay for those.

640
00:27:51,540 --> 00:27:53,841
That's okay. Take it.

641
00:27:53,908 --> 00:27:56,010
I mixed in a little tequila
for you.

642
00:28:00,515 --> 00:28:01,916
[slurps]

643
00:28:04,485 --> 00:28:05,986
That's disgusting.

644
00:28:07,388 --> 00:28:08,389
Thank you.

645
00:28:11,258 --> 00:28:14,061
[woman] <i>Mr. Adams,</i>
<i>we really wanna do</i>

646
00:28:14,128 --> 00:28:16,430
<i>everything we can</i>
<i>to help Ryan.</i>

647
00:28:18,465 --> 00:28:20,301
But she needs to take
some responsibility

648
00:28:20,367 --> 00:28:22,102
for her behavior.

649
00:28:22,169 --> 00:28:25,406
That girl does not listen
to a thing I say.

650
00:28:26,941 --> 00:28:28,375
To be honest,

651
00:28:28,442 --> 00:28:30,077
I was hoping
you were calling me in here

652
00:28:30,144 --> 00:28:32,079
to give me some advice.

653
00:28:33,682 --> 00:28:35,282
I need help.

654
00:28:35,349 --> 00:28:37,284
[man] It's just that
we're a public school.

655
00:28:37,351 --> 00:28:40,421
We have 2,000 kids
to look after.

656
00:28:40,487 --> 00:28:42,156
We don't have the bandwidth

657
00:28:42,223 --> 00:28:44,626
to micromanage her in ways
that she deserves and needs.

658
00:28:44,693 --> 00:28:46,427
So, what are you saying?

659
00:28:47,662 --> 00:28:48,963
I will give her
an extra strike

660
00:28:49,029 --> 00:28:51,298
because of the circumstances.

661
00:28:51,365 --> 00:28:53,234
But if she doesn't tone down
her language

662
00:28:53,300 --> 00:28:54,768
with her teachers

663
00:28:54,835 --> 00:28:56,904
and gets into one more fight,

664
00:28:57,672 --> 00:28:59,139
we'll have to expel her.

[chair scraps]

Hi, can I get
a double tequila, please?

667
00:29:31,539 --> 00:29:32,540
Allison.

668
00:29:33,508 --> 00:29:35,776
Yo, I know you.

669
00:29:36,711 --> 00:29:37,911
It's Mark.

670
00:29:38,680 --> 00:29:39,748
Yeah, hey.

671
00:29:39,813 --> 00:29:41,482
Yeah.

672
00:29:41,549 --> 00:29:44,184
I haven't seen you
since high school.

673
00:29:44,251 --> 00:29:46,755
This is Diego.
You remember Diego?

674
00:29:46,820 --> 00:29:48,122
-Hey.
-[Diego] Hey.

675
00:29:49,223 --> 00:29:50,759
You just having
a little breakfast?

676
00:29:50,824 --> 00:29:53,827
Uh... Um... I just...

677
00:29:55,095 --> 00:29:56,997
I just needed
to get out of the house.

678
00:29:57,064 --> 00:29:59,066
[chuckles] Yeah, I feel that.

679
00:29:59,133 --> 00:30:01,435
I heard what happened to you.
The accident.

680
00:30:01,503 --> 00:30:02,771
Saw it in the <i>Star Ledger.</i>
Sorry.

681
00:30:02,836 --> 00:30:04,371
What happened?

682
00:30:04,438 --> 00:30:05,472
[Diego] She was in that
accident on the turnpike.

683
00:30:05,540 --> 00:30:06,940
Two people died.

684
00:30:07,007 --> 00:30:08,842
Holy shit.

685
00:30:09,644 --> 00:30:11,178
That was you.

686
00:30:12,146 --> 00:30:13,914
Oh, bro.

687
00:30:13,981 --> 00:30:15,883
That would've fucked me up.

688
00:30:15,949 --> 00:30:17,318
It wasn't my fault.

689
00:30:17,384 --> 00:30:19,987
Yeah, I'm sure.
But, like, still...

690
00:30:25,660 --> 00:30:26,860
[Mark] Damn.

691
00:30:29,798 --> 00:30:33,200
[exhales sharply] Hey, can I
have another one, please?

692
00:30:34,234 --> 00:30:35,570
You having a tough day?

693
00:30:36,771 --> 00:30:38,238
Just a day.

694
00:30:39,541 --> 00:30:41,776
I just wanna get as far away
from here as possible.

695
00:30:41,842 --> 00:30:43,110
Yo, there's this app,

696
00:30:43,177 --> 00:30:44,345
it tells you
the exact opposite

697
00:30:44,411 --> 00:30:46,280
of where you are
on the globe is.

698
00:30:46,347 --> 00:30:48,349
That's where you should go.
I'll look it up for you.

699
00:30:48,415 --> 00:30:51,018
[Mark] Yo, that's how I feel
every fuckin' day of my life.

700
00:30:51,085 --> 00:30:53,354
I can't seem to escape
this town.

701
00:30:53,420 --> 00:30:55,289
It's like there's
a force field around it

702
00:30:55,356 --> 00:30:56,658
or something.

703
00:30:56,725 --> 00:30:59,561
Like, some people know
how to get outta here.

704
00:30:59,627 --> 00:31:01,261
But the rest of us,

705
00:31:01,328 --> 00:31:02,797
we just keep banging our heads
up against the glass.

706
00:31:02,863 --> 00:31:04,932
It's Perth. That's the city

707
00:31:04,998 --> 00:31:06,835
on the other side of the globe
from here.

708
00:31:06,900 --> 00:31:08,503
You should go to Perth.

709
00:31:08,570 --> 00:31:11,372
I don't have enough money
to get to Perth,

710
00:31:11,438 --> 00:31:12,774
but thank you.

711
00:31:12,841 --> 00:31:14,975
Aren't you engaged
to Nathan Adams?

712
00:31:15,943 --> 00:31:17,679
I was, yeah.

713
00:31:17,746 --> 00:31:20,314
He was an amazing running back
in high school.

714
00:31:20,381 --> 00:31:21,915
He used to run
every fucking play.

715
00:31:21,982 --> 00:31:23,083
-You remember him, Mark?
-[Mark] Yeah.

716
00:31:23,150 --> 00:31:24,485
[Diego] Every fucking play,

717
00:31:24,552 --> 00:31:25,986
they'd come
on the PA system like,

718
00:31:26,053 --> 00:31:27,354
"Nathan Adams,
the ball carrier.

719
00:31:27,421 --> 00:31:29,289
"Nathan Adams,
the ball carrier."

720
00:31:29,356 --> 00:31:31,024
He was the whole fucking team.
You remember him, Mark?

721
00:31:31,091 --> 00:31:32,926
Yeah, I remember him.

722
00:31:32,993 --> 00:31:34,361
Isn't he deaf?

723
00:31:34,428 --> 00:31:37,898
Uh... In one ear. Since birth.

724
00:31:37,965 --> 00:31:39,466
Wow, that's impressive

725
00:31:39,534 --> 00:31:40,835
that he could be, like,
that good, you know?

726
00:31:40,901 --> 00:31:42,537
And half deaf.

727
00:31:42,604 --> 00:31:44,037
So you're, like, single?

728
00:31:44,104 --> 00:31:46,641
[Mark chuckles] Yo.
Shut the fuck up, Diego.

729
00:31:46,708 --> 00:31:49,176
What? You think
she's gonna date you?

730
00:31:49,243 --> 00:31:50,944
Where are you gonna take her?
You live with your mom.

731
00:31:51,011 --> 00:31:53,815
[chuckles] God damn.

732
00:31:53,882 --> 00:31:55,215
Allison, I'm sorry.

733
00:31:55,282 --> 00:31:58,051
My fucking friend
has no tact at all.

734
00:31:58,118 --> 00:32:00,622
[chuckles]
We're not used to having

735
00:32:00,688 --> 00:32:03,558
pretty girls such as yourself
come in here.

736
00:32:03,625 --> 00:32:05,359
So, you gotta excuse his

737
00:32:05,426 --> 00:32:07,194
lack of decor.

738
00:32:09,396 --> 00:32:10,565
Decorum.

739
00:32:11,432 --> 00:32:12,499
What?

740
00:32:13,601 --> 00:32:15,804
"Decor" is

741
00:32:15,870 --> 00:32:20,107
the Bud Light lamp
above my head.

742
00:32:20,974 --> 00:32:23,678
"Decorum" is his behavior.

743
00:32:25,179 --> 00:32:27,615
Neither is currently ideal.

744
00:32:28,883 --> 00:32:31,151
[men cheering]

745
00:32:32,186 --> 00:32:34,254
Hey, can I ask you
something, like,

746
00:32:35,122 --> 00:32:36,658
between us old friends?

747
00:32:36,724 --> 00:32:39,059
You weren't our friend.
You were popular.

748
00:32:39,126 --> 00:32:41,428
-You were a bitch, actually.
-All right. Diego.

749
00:32:43,030 --> 00:32:45,834
That's old shit.
Right, Allison?

750
00:32:45,900 --> 00:32:48,202
We're past that.
We're grown-ups.

751
00:32:48,268 --> 00:32:51,138
Those of us stuck behind
this force field,

752
00:32:51,205 --> 00:32:54,107
-we gotta stick together.
-[Allison] Yeah.

753
00:32:54,174 --> 00:32:58,278
Um, do you know
where I could get some Oxy?

754
00:32:58,345 --> 00:32:59,914
[chuckling] God damn, girl.

755
00:32:59,980 --> 00:33:02,049
No foreplay. No nothing.

756
00:33:02,115 --> 00:33:05,219
No "How are you?
How's your family?"

757
00:33:05,285 --> 00:33:07,020
No, we don't fuck with pills.

758
00:33:07,755 --> 00:33:08,989
I remember in high school

759
00:33:09,056 --> 00:33:11,091
you were the guys
that could, like,

760
00:33:11,793 --> 00:33:13,093
get anything.

761
00:33:13,160 --> 00:33:15,162
And now you're just
buttering us up.

762
00:33:16,430 --> 00:33:18,465
I don't have any money.

763
00:33:18,533 --> 00:33:21,034
How are you gonna pay
for that tequila?

764
00:33:21,101 --> 00:33:23,571
I hadn't got that far yet.
[sighs]

765
00:33:23,638 --> 00:33:25,740
-Is that Rolex real?
-Wait a second.

766
00:33:26,641 --> 00:33:28,275
Wait. Allie Johnson.

767
00:33:28,342 --> 00:33:31,478
Miss lovely Allie Johnson.
[grunts]

768
00:33:32,379 --> 00:33:34,448
You just stroll in here.

769
00:33:34,516 --> 00:33:36,383
[chuckling] You got no money.

770
00:33:36,450 --> 00:33:38,786
And you expect us
to get you Oxy?

771
00:33:38,853 --> 00:33:41,756
For free, and then you want us
to pay for your drink.

772
00:33:43,190 --> 00:33:44,759
Why the fuck would we do that?

773
00:33:46,126 --> 00:33:47,695
Nostalgia?

774
00:33:48,730 --> 00:33:50,330
Old friends?

775
00:33:50,397 --> 00:33:51,833
You thought you were
such hot shit in high school.

776
00:33:51,900 --> 00:33:52,901
You're no
fucking different now.

777
00:33:52,967 --> 00:33:54,502
All right. Shut up.

778
00:33:54,969 --> 00:33:56,136
Sorry.

779
00:33:56,203 --> 00:33:59,607
This guy. No decorum.

780
00:33:59,674 --> 00:34:00,775
No, he's right.

781
00:34:02,242 --> 00:34:04,746
I didn't think I was better
than you. I knew it.

782
00:34:05,680 --> 00:34:07,515
I looked down
on guys like you.

783
00:34:08,917 --> 00:34:11,586
I thought
you were Jersey trash

784
00:34:11,653 --> 00:34:14,522
that would never be able
to make it out of town.

785
00:34:15,289 --> 00:34:17,090
[snorts, laughs]

786
00:34:17,792 --> 00:34:19,192
Fucking bitch.

787
00:34:19,259 --> 00:34:21,295
But now you're sitting here

788
00:34:21,896 --> 00:34:23,363
right beside us

789
00:34:23,430 --> 00:34:26,099
and you're looking for a fix.

790
00:34:26,166 --> 00:34:27,735
A favor.

791
00:34:27,802 --> 00:34:30,170
The favor is a fix.

792
00:34:31,405 --> 00:34:33,575
-You're a fucking junkie now.
-No, I'm not.

793
00:34:33,641 --> 00:34:35,643
-You're a fucking junkie.
-No.

794
00:34:35,710 --> 00:34:37,077
-[Mark] Yeah, you are.
-Yeah, you are.

795
00:34:37,144 --> 00:34:38,245
Come on.
You're a fuckin' junkie.

796
00:34:38,312 --> 00:34:39,681
No. I'm not like you.

797
00:34:39,747 --> 00:34:41,214
Allie Johnson,

798
00:34:41,281 --> 00:34:43,350
you're so much more
like who you think we are

799
00:34:43,417 --> 00:34:45,218
than we actually are.

800
00:34:46,688 --> 00:34:49,189
Come on.
Say it, say it, say it.

801
00:34:49,256 --> 00:34:51,025
"I'm a fucking junkie."
You might like it.

802
00:34:51,091 --> 00:34:52,627
Fuck you. It's a pill.

803
00:34:52,694 --> 00:34:55,997
It's heroin
in a pretty little dress.

804
00:34:56,064 --> 00:34:57,765
I thought you were
the nice one.

805
00:34:59,067 --> 00:35:01,736
Why don't you say it?
Say... Say,

806
00:35:02,469 --> 00:35:04,739
"I'm a fucking junkie,"

807
00:35:04,806 --> 00:35:07,609
and then I'll get you whatever
you want. Anything.

808
00:35:08,810 --> 00:35:12,212
Say it. Just, like,
just come out with it.

809
00:35:12,279 --> 00:35:13,615
I'm currently reliant...

810
00:35:13,681 --> 00:35:16,784
No, that's not
what I fucking said.

811
00:35:16,851 --> 00:35:19,654
You sneaky little bitch.
That's not what I fucking said.

812
00:35:19,721 --> 00:35:21,089
-Is that what I said?
-No.

813
00:35:21,188 --> 00:35:23,190
That is not what I said.

814
00:35:24,659 --> 00:35:27,227
Say you're a fuckin' junkie.
Look at me.

815
00:35:27,294 --> 00:35:28,596
Look at me!

816
00:35:29,429 --> 00:35:32,232
Look me in the eyes, and say,

817
00:35:32,299 --> 00:35:35,603
"I'm a fucking junkie."

818
00:35:35,670 --> 00:35:37,137
Say it!

819
00:35:41,042 --> 00:35:42,777
I'm a fucking junkie.

820
00:35:46,914 --> 00:35:48,181
Good girl.

821
00:35:50,384 --> 00:35:51,919
Beth, I got these tequilas.

822
00:35:53,186 --> 00:35:55,422
I'm sorry
for raising my voice.

823
00:35:55,489 --> 00:35:56,758
We're just catching up.

824
00:35:57,457 --> 00:35:58,960
Allie, this is Beth.

825
00:35:59,027 --> 00:36:00,995
She's divine. She's the best.

826
00:36:01,062 --> 00:36:03,397
[soft music playing]

827
00:36:08,335 --> 00:36:09,804
That's not Oxy.

828
00:36:10,605 --> 00:36:11,773
Same shit.

829
00:36:24,786 --> 00:36:26,821
[coughs hoarsely]

830
00:36:27,722 --> 00:36:28,723
[inhales sharply]

831
00:36:30,958 --> 00:36:32,060
[exhales]

832
00:36:32,126 --> 00:36:34,327
[breathing heavily]

833
00:36:37,131 --> 00:36:38,700
[vomits]

834
00:36:38,766 --> 00:36:40,333
[groaning]

835
00:36:50,745 --> 00:36:52,345
Thank you.
Ooh, she just walked in.

836
00:36:53,480 --> 00:36:54,916
Oh, my God.
I was so worried about you.

837
00:36:54,982 --> 00:36:56,216
Where were you?

838
00:36:56,283 --> 00:36:58,986
-I'm so sorry.
-Oh, babe, oh.

839
00:36:59,053 --> 00:37:00,922
-I'm sorry.
-Uh-huh. No...

840
00:37:00,988 --> 00:37:02,489
I need help.

841
00:37:02,557 --> 00:37:03,858
I know. I never should have

842
00:37:03,925 --> 00:37:05,760
flushed those pills
down the toilet.

843
00:37:05,827 --> 00:37:07,962
I had no right. I'm so sorry.
I was just so worried.

844
00:37:08,029 --> 00:37:09,163
Can you help me, please, Mama?

845
00:37:09,229 --> 00:37:10,965
Yes, yes, I already did.

846
00:37:11,032 --> 00:37:12,800
Here, I got these from Linda.

847
00:37:12,867 --> 00:37:14,502
She's the woman
who works next to me

848
00:37:14,569 --> 00:37:16,236
in the toy kiosk at the mall.

849
00:37:16,303 --> 00:37:17,905
Her doctor gave them to her

850
00:37:17,972 --> 00:37:19,507
after she got punched
in the face by a shoplifter,

851
00:37:19,574 --> 00:37:20,675
but she said
she didn't need them.

852
00:37:20,742 --> 00:37:22,110
She swore by the neck brace.

853
00:37:22,176 --> 00:37:23,678
But you need 'em, honey.
So here.

854
00:37:23,745 --> 00:37:26,413
That right there is a gift
from Linda, okay?

855
00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:28,082
And we can worry
about kicking it later.

856
00:37:28,149 --> 00:37:29,650
Let's not rush things.

857
00:37:29,717 --> 00:37:31,586
What matters the most
is that you're home safe.

858
00:37:31,652 --> 00:37:34,956
Oh, babe. [kisses]
Oh, my baby.

859
00:37:39,660 --> 00:37:40,828
Hey, Ry?

860
00:37:40,895 --> 00:37:42,730
[muffled music playing
on speaker]

861
00:37:42,797 --> 00:37:44,699
Got Chinese food!

862
00:37:45,533 --> 00:37:47,802
I got sweet and sour chicken,

863
00:37:47,869 --> 00:37:50,872
beef with broccoli,
steamed rice.

864
00:37:51,438 --> 00:37:52,640
Where are ya?

865
00:37:53,174 --> 00:37:54,609
Hey, Ry?

866

Daniel, get out!

-Hey. Hey!

gonna get me a wedding gift,

or, well, at least
he was gonna come, right?

of whatever it was

1016
00:46:07,502 --> 00:46:09,336
that he was gonna give me,

1017
00:46:10,572 --> 00:46:15,009
maybe he could help pay
for me to get help.

1018
00:46:15,075 --> 00:46:17,778
And so, I was wondering if you

1019
00:46:18,513 --> 00:46:20,147
would call him for me.

1020
00:46:20,214 --> 00:46:23,017

He packed his car up,
and he left us with nothing.

But it is what it is, okay?

1024
00:46:29,223 --> 00:46:32,960
So, you gotta pull yourself up
by your bootstraps, now.

00:47:24,178 --> 00:47:26,313
to move on
after the breakup...

1043
00:47:28,650 --> 00:47:29,883
but, hell, I never imagined

1044
00:47:29,950 --> 00:47:32,587
I'd be doing this
all by myself.

1045
00:47:32,654 --> 00:47:34,121
You raised two kids.

1046
00:47:34,188 --> 00:47:35,557
I had your mother.

1047
00:47:37,224 --> 00:47:40,127
And you and your sister were
much better behaved than Ry.

1048
00:47:40,762 --> 00:47:42,797
[Nathan scoffs]

1049
00:47:42,863 --> 00:47:45,032
What? Come on.
Speak your mind, son.

1050
00:47:45,099 --> 00:47:48,202
We were good because
we were terrified of you.

1051
00:47:49,771 --> 00:47:51,338
So, I'm not surprised

1052
00:47:51,405 --> 00:47:53,040
you don't have any tools
in your arsenal

1053
00:47:53,107 --> 00:47:55,275
since you lost
the only one that you had.

1054
00:47:55,342 --> 00:47:56,877
Fear.

1055
00:47:59,480 --> 00:48:05,352
I have apologized 100 times
to you for the way I was.

1056
00:48:07,555 --> 00:48:11,158
Your sister found a way
to give me another chance.

1057
00:48:11,225 --> 00:48:12,861
How come you can't?

1058
00:48:12,926 --> 00:48:16,263
'Cause Molly never really got
the brunt of it, did she?

1059
00:48:16,330 --> 00:48:19,299
I guarantee you that if
she was standing here now,

1060
00:48:19,366 --> 00:48:22,002
she would be begging you
to drop this shit,

1061
00:48:22,069 --> 00:48:23,638
and help me raise her child.

1062
00:48:23,705 --> 00:48:25,305
Well, she isn't.

1063
00:48:27,040 --> 00:48:28,610
No, she's not.

1064
00:48:32,647 --> 00:48:34,448
I have to catch the train.

1065
00:48:35,583 --> 00:48:37,151
I saw Allison.

1066
00:48:41,523 --> 00:48:42,590
Where?

1067
00:48:42,657 --> 00:48:44,692
Not supposed to say.

1068
00:48:45,760 --> 00:48:47,194
AA?

1069
00:48:47,261 --> 00:48:48,630
Not supposed to say.

1070
00:48:48,696 --> 00:48:50,130
What the hell
does she need AA for?

1071
00:48:50,197 --> 00:48:51,699
-I'm not supposed to...
-To say.

1072
00:48:54,301 --> 00:48:55,302
I got it.

1073
00:48:56,671 --> 00:48:59,139
Of all the meetings,
she ends up at yours?

1074
00:48:59,206 --> 00:49:01,776
She saw me,
she tried to run away,

1075
00:49:01,843 --> 00:49:03,944
but I pulled her back.

1076
00:49:04,011 --> 00:49:05,345
Why?

1077
00:49:06,246 --> 00:49:07,649
She's suffering, Nathan.

1078
00:49:09,116 --> 00:49:10,350
Broken.

1079
00:49:11,051 --> 00:49:12,186
Lost.

1080
00:49:12,252 --> 00:49:14,622
You're the one who blamed her!

1081
00:49:15,723 --> 00:49:17,024
I stood by her!

1082
00:49:17,090 --> 00:49:20,227
Yeah, until she left your ass.

1083
00:49:20,294 --> 00:49:23,832
Sorry. Sorry, that came out
harsher than I meant.

1084
00:49:23,898 --> 00:49:25,867
I have to catch the train.

1085
00:49:25,934 --> 00:49:27,367
[Daniel] Please, Nathan.

1086
00:49:28,035 --> 00:49:30,137
I need help.

1087
00:49:30,204 --> 00:49:33,207
Ryan asked me to come by
and say "hi" to you.

1088
00:49:34,041 --> 00:49:35,442
And I did.

1089
00:49:36,711 --> 00:49:37,712
Okay.

1090
00:49:40,481 --> 00:49:41,549
Hi.

1091
00:49:53,227 --> 00:49:55,563
[playing classical music]

1092
00:50:00,467 --> 00:50:03,370
<i>-Best first date ever.</i>
<i>-I heard that.</i>

1093
00:50:09,611 --> 00:50:11,044
[Allison laughing]

1094
00:50:16,985 --> 00:50:20,287
[Daniel] <i>I used to drink</i>
<i>whiskey until I blacked out.</i>

1095
00:50:21,421 --> 00:50:23,691
Wake up the next morning
to find out

1096
00:50:24,626 --> 00:50:27,261
what I had done,
who I had been.

1097
00:50:29,697 --> 00:50:30,765
[chuckles]

1098
00:50:33,001 --> 00:50:34,802
My father was a drunk.

1099
00:50:37,539 --> 00:50:42,042
He beat me
right up to the day he died.

1100
00:50:44,278 --> 00:50:48,081
And I vowed I would never
lay a hand on my children.

1101
00:50:50,117 --> 00:50:51,586
And I didn't...

1102
00:50:53,621 --> 00:50:55,255
while I was sober.

1103
00:50:57,992 --> 00:50:59,661
But in the blackness...

1104
00:51:03,096 --> 00:51:07,301
I always denied because
I really couldn't remember.

1105
00:51:08,870 --> 00:51:10,738
Sometimes there'd be a bruise.

1106
00:51:12,607 --> 00:51:16,109
"Oh, you must have
fallen down.

1107
00:51:16,176 --> 00:51:18,412
"I'm your daddy.
I would never hurt you."

1108
00:51:19,847 --> 00:51:22,482
August 11th, '99...

1109
00:51:25,520 --> 00:51:30,290
I woke up on my front porch to
the sound of church bells...

1110
00:51:33,027 --> 00:51:34,762
and an ice cream truck.

1111
00:51:35,797 --> 00:51:37,632
So, I knew it was Sunday.

1112
00:51:37,699 --> 00:51:42,235
First thing
I saw was my captain

1113
00:51:43,236 --> 00:51:45,607
standing over me,

1114
00:51:45,673 --> 00:51:48,543
poking me in the ribs
with his nightstick.

1115
00:51:51,779 --> 00:51:53,280
An ambulance.

1116
00:51:54,716 --> 00:51:58,720
My son, Nathan,
sitting in the back,

1117
00:52:00,054 --> 00:52:01,589
bleeding from the head.

1118
00:52:02,724 --> 00:52:05,627
Medics had bought him
a popsicle.

1119
00:52:07,862 --> 00:52:09,764
Turns out that... [sighs]

1120
00:52:11,766 --> 00:52:13,635
in the blackness...

1121
00:52:17,105 --> 00:52:20,173
I had beat him so bad

1122
00:52:20,240 --> 00:52:23,544
that he lost the hearing
in his right ear.

1123
00:52:23,611 --> 00:52:24,646
Forever.

1124
00:52:25,780 --> 00:52:29,216
And to this day,
every time I see him,

1125
00:52:29,282 --> 00:52:32,854
I beg for his forgiveness.

1126
00:52:34,221 --> 00:52:36,456
It's just a little dance
we do.

1127
00:52:37,692 --> 00:52:39,393
A mere formality.

1128
00:52:41,194 --> 00:52:42,864
Because we both know...

1129
00:52:45,533 --> 00:52:48,368
that there are some things
that are just

1130
00:52:49,871 --> 00:52:51,839
impossible to forgive.

1131
00:52:55,843 --> 00:53:01,248
I do believe
even God knows that.

1132
00:53:08,321 --> 00:53:10,858
When I was a cop,
I used to eat here every day.

1133
00:53:11,826 --> 00:53:13,594
Free coffee refills.

1134
00:53:16,263 --> 00:53:17,464
You hungry?

1135
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:20,200
No.

1136
00:53:20,802 --> 00:53:21,803
[Daniel] Hmm.

1137
00:53:24,204 --> 00:53:26,574
Funny, the things
we stop caring about.

1138
00:53:28,442 --> 00:53:30,410
I used to want to travel.

1139
00:53:31,713 --> 00:53:34,082
I would leaf through
<i>National Geographic</i>

1140
00:53:34,148 --> 00:53:36,084
and dog-ear
all of the exotic places

1141
00:53:36,150 --> 00:53:38,553
I would visit once I retired.

1142
00:53:41,189 --> 00:53:43,157
Never do that now.

1143
00:53:43,256 --> 00:53:45,960
-You still could.
-No, no. I couldn't.

1144
00:53:50,832 --> 00:53:56,771
I wasn't drunk,
or on anything, by the way.

1145
00:53:57,605 --> 00:53:58,606
What?

1146
00:53:59,841 --> 00:54:02,375
When I saw you the other day
at the meeting,

1147
00:54:03,711 --> 00:54:07,782
I instantly got worried
that you may have thought

1148
00:54:07,849 --> 00:54:10,952
that I was drinking
or on drugs

1149
00:54:11,018 --> 00:54:12,687
on the day of the accident,
and I wasn't.

1150
00:54:12,754 --> 00:54:15,489
I was sober.
It wasn't my fault.

1151
00:54:16,858 --> 00:54:19,259
I have every report
ever written

1152
00:54:19,326 --> 00:54:21,328
committed to memory.

1153
00:54:21,829 --> 00:54:22,897
Right.

1154
00:54:25,166 --> 00:54:26,333
So, you know that it was

1155
00:54:26,399 --> 00:54:27,902
the backhoe guy's fault,
Alvarez.

1156
00:54:27,969 --> 00:54:29,871
I don't wanna get
into that all right now.

1157
00:54:29,937 --> 00:54:31,539
Okay, yeah, you're right.

1158
00:54:36,110 --> 00:54:39,046
Nathan said that he was deaf
since birth.

1159
00:54:40,347 --> 00:54:41,816
He never told you?

1160
00:54:42,950 --> 00:54:45,485
Maybe he wanted me
to like you.

1161
00:54:46,921 --> 00:54:48,656
I doubt that.

1162
00:54:51,993 --> 00:54:56,230
I thought that raising Ryan
would offer me the chance

1163
00:54:56,296 --> 00:54:58,966
to be a better father
than I ever was.

1164
00:54:59,867 --> 00:55:01,434
Shit.

1165
00:55:01,502 --> 00:55:04,404
I'm in way over my head.

1166
00:55:04,471 --> 00:55:07,608
I got one of those audiobooks
from the library.

1167
00:55:07,675 --> 00:55:09,010
<i>How to Talk to a Teen.</i>

1168
00:55:09,076 --> 00:55:10,978
[chuckles] Oh, yeah?

1169
00:55:11,045 --> 00:55:12,513
How's that working out?

1170
00:55:12,580 --> 00:55:15,216
-Well, it's from the '80s...
-[laughs]

1171
00:55:15,283 --> 00:55:16,684
It's on a cassette.

1172
00:55:16,751 --> 00:55:17,752
Right.

1173
00:55:17,819 --> 00:55:19,486
Its advice is,

1174
00:55:20,555 --> 00:55:22,322
"Chaperone a dance."

1175
00:55:22,723 --> 00:55:24,457
[laughs]

1176
00:55:25,927 --> 00:55:28,129
"Chaperone a dance."

1177
00:55:28,196 --> 00:55:29,797
I just caught her having sex

1178
00:55:29,864 --> 00:55:32,499
with a boy
who looked like a man.

1179
00:55:34,602 --> 00:55:36,704
A dance would be delightful.

1180
00:55:37,805 --> 00:55:39,974
Can I give you some advice

1181
00:55:40,775 --> 00:55:42,977
from a former teenage girl?

1182
00:55:44,612 --> 00:55:46,413
She's gonna have sex.

1183
00:55:47,582 --> 00:55:50,718
And nothing you say
is gonna change that.

1184
00:55:52,887 --> 00:55:55,223
Just make sure
she's on birth control.

1185
00:55:55,289 --> 00:55:56,356
-Birth control?
-Yeah.

1186
00:55:56,423 --> 00:55:58,726
She's 16!

1187
00:55:58,793 --> 00:56:01,128
No, we'll be going
the abstinence route.

1188
00:56:02,196 --> 00:56:03,598
No offense, Daniel,

1189
00:56:03,664 --> 00:56:06,499
but, uh, there's a knot
in your logic.

1190
00:56:07,668 --> 00:56:09,003
You're trying to solve
a problem

1191
00:56:09,070 --> 00:56:11,038
by looking
in the other direction.

1192
00:56:14,407 --> 00:56:16,344
I could talk to her
if you want me to.

1193
00:56:16,409 --> 00:56:18,112
Oh, well, no thanks.

1194
00:56:18,179 --> 00:56:19,780
-It's okay. Of course.
-That's not appropriate.

1195
00:56:19,847 --> 00:56:21,349
I don't even know
why I just said that.

1196
00:56:21,414 --> 00:56:22,850
-I'm sorry.
-No, it's okay.

1197
00:56:22,917 --> 00:56:24,151
It's just that
I don't think that it's...

1198
00:56:24,218 --> 00:56:25,853
I just felt the need,

1199
00:56:27,021 --> 00:56:30,358
um, the instinct
to help in some way.

1200
00:56:31,158 --> 00:56:32,793
It's the least I could do.

1201
00:56:40,234 --> 00:56:42,169
I don't know how to do this.

1202
00:56:43,170 --> 00:56:44,138
What?

1203
00:56:44,972 --> 00:56:46,173
Start all over.

1204
00:56:48,009 --> 00:56:49,510
How do you do it?

1205
00:56:50,511 --> 00:56:52,013
[Daniel] Takes work.

1206
00:56:54,815 --> 00:56:57,985
-Can I tell you a secret?
-Sure.

1207
00:57:02,790 --> 00:57:05,159
I'm not sure I have the will.

1208
00:57:27,315 --> 00:57:29,917
What does <i>"amor fati"</i> mean?

1209
00:57:31,385 --> 00:57:32,653
[Daniel sighs]

1210
00:57:33,654 --> 00:57:35,556
Certain things are private.

1211
00:57:36,489 --> 00:57:38,559
Do you think I'm fucked up?

1212
00:57:39,694 --> 00:57:41,929
Are you high right now?

1213
00:57:43,164 --> 00:57:44,464
No.

1214
00:57:45,599 --> 00:57:47,568
I was a cop for 40 years.

1215
00:57:47,635 --> 00:57:49,570
I was an addict for 50.

1216
00:57:50,771 --> 00:57:53,040
So, I'm gonna ask you again.

1217
00:57:54,208 --> 00:57:55,843
Are you high right now?

1218
00:57:56,644 --> 00:57:58,012
Well, I...

1219
00:57:59,680 --> 00:58:01,382
I broke a pill in half.

1220
00:58:01,449 --> 00:58:02,950
So, half.

1221
00:58:04,618 --> 00:58:07,154
Yes, I think
you're fucked up, Allison.

1222
00:58:10,091 --> 00:58:11,559
Not half.

1223
00:58:12,226 --> 00:58:13,894
All fucked up.

1224
00:58:13,961 --> 00:58:16,063
Do you think
I'll ever pull out of this?

1225
00:58:17,531 --> 00:58:23,170
I mean, like, maybe one day
I might be the kind of person

1226
00:58:24,538 --> 00:58:26,073
that people want
their granddaughter

1227
00:58:26,140 --> 00:58:28,109
to hang out with?

1228
00:58:28,175 --> 00:58:29,910
I have no idea.

1229
00:58:31,545 --> 00:58:32,947
Me neither.

1230
00:58:35,616 --> 00:58:38,085
[soft country music playing]

1231
00:58:47,995 --> 00:58:50,965
Can I have
my phone back, please?

1232
00:58:51,032 --> 00:58:54,068
I'm running out of ideas
on how to handle you, Ryan.

1233
00:58:55,069 --> 00:58:56,570
Grandpa,
everybody at my age has sex.

1234
00:58:56,637 --> 00:58:58,239
It's, like, not a big deal.

1235
00:58:58,305 --> 00:59:00,007
I know it was different
when you were younger,

1236
00:59:00,074 --> 00:59:02,877
but that's just, like,
not how it is anymore.

1237
00:59:06,647 --> 00:59:09,116
[smacks lips] Well,
let me ask you something.

1238
00:59:15,289 --> 00:59:16,323
Are you...

1239
00:59:18,726 --> 00:59:20,995
Are you using

1240
00:59:21,662 --> 00:59:24,065
any protection?

1241
00:59:24,131 --> 00:59:25,733
Oh, my God!

1242
00:59:25,800 --> 00:59:28,102
I am so not gonna talk about
this with my grandfather.

1243
00:59:28,169 --> 00:59:30,337
How the hell
do you think I feel?

1244
00:59:32,606 --> 00:59:34,141
[both sigh]

1245
00:59:34,208 --> 00:59:36,777
-I know you're upset.
-I'm not upset.

1246
00:59:36,844 --> 00:59:38,212
Maybe you should go back

1247
00:59:39,080 --> 00:59:40,515
and see that therapist again.

1248
00:59:40,581 --> 00:59:41,982
No. I just

1249
00:59:42,850 --> 00:59:45,586
want my phone back.

1250
00:59:45,653 --> 00:59:48,756
I don't have any friends
at Columbia

1251
00:59:48,823 --> 00:59:51,025
and I want to

1252
00:59:51,092 --> 00:59:53,961
hang onto the few I still have
on Long Beach Island.

1253
00:59:55,029 --> 00:59:56,764
How come
you can't make friends?

1254
00:59:56,831 --> 00:59:58,732
I've been through a lot
this year.

1255
00:59:59,333 --> 01:00:00,334
[Daniel] Hmm.

1256
01:00:01,368 --> 01:00:03,904
And nobody really understands.

1257
01:00:04,872 --> 01:00:07,608
They try. Some, but...

1258
01:00:08,375 --> 01:00:09,844
I mean, it's fake.

1259
01:00:09,910 --> 01:00:11,946
Don't you think
most people are so fake?

1260
01:00:13,080 --> 01:00:15,983
I would probably say
"duplicitous."

1261
01:00:16,784 --> 01:00:18,052
What does that mean?

1262
01:00:18,719 --> 01:00:20,287
Fake.

1263
01:00:20,354 --> 01:00:21,655
[chuckles]

1264
01:00:23,390 --> 01:00:24,892
I'm on your side.

1265
01:00:26,660 --> 01:00:27,895
I know.

1266
01:00:28,462 --> 01:00:29,897
Tell you what.

1267
01:00:29,964 --> 01:00:32,800
You can have your phone back

1268
01:00:32,867 --> 01:00:36,704
if you promise to start taking
birth control pills.

1269
01:00:36,770 --> 01:00:38,906
Ugh! Oh, my God! Daniel!

1270
01:00:38,973 --> 01:00:40,040
Grandpa!

1271
01:00:40,741 --> 01:00:41,942
[sighs]

1272
01:00:42,676 --> 01:00:43,978
Grandpa.

1273
01:00:45,112 --> 01:00:48,215
Is it a deal?
I'll make the appointment.

1274
01:00:49,750 --> 01:00:52,119
Fine. Fine.

1275
01:00:52,186 --> 01:00:53,487
I just

1276
01:00:53,555 --> 01:00:56,790
never want to talk to you
about sex ever again.

1277
01:00:57,791 --> 01:01:00,060
Oh, really?

1278
01:01:00,928 --> 01:01:02,796
'Cause I just love this shit.

1279
01:01:09,336 --> 01:01:11,338
Have you ever been
on campus before?

1280
01:01:11,405 --> 01:01:12,907
Not since I was a kid.

1281
01:01:12,973 --> 01:01:14,643
I used to do swim meets here.

1282
01:01:14,708 --> 01:01:16,177
-Oh, yeah?
-Yeah.

1283
01:01:16,243 --> 01:01:17,878
-You were a swimmer?
-[chuckling] Uh, yeah.

1284
01:01:17,945 --> 01:01:20,281
Well, I was 12, but yeah,
I was pretty good.

1285
01:01:20,347 --> 01:01:22,617
I still have all the trophies
and the ribbons.

1286
01:01:22,683 --> 01:01:24,586
-That's cool.
-Mmm.

1287
01:01:24,653 --> 01:01:27,721
-What stroke?
-Mostly freestyle.

1288
01:01:28,822 --> 01:01:30,224
Why'd you stop?

1289
01:01:30,925 --> 01:01:34,061
Um, my dad left.

1290
01:01:34,128 --> 01:01:36,931
Yeah, it was kinda the thing
that we used to do together.

1291
01:01:36,997 --> 01:01:39,466
He would cheer so loud
I could hear him underwater.

1292
01:01:39,534 --> 01:01:41,001
[chuckles]

1293
01:01:41,068 --> 01:01:43,003
Seemed kind of pointless
to do it without him.

1294
01:01:44,071 --> 01:01:46,807
-Where'd he go?
-Ohio.

1295
01:01:47,875 --> 01:01:49,511
Started a whole new family
in Ohio.

1296
01:01:49,578 --> 01:01:50,945
Wow.

1297
01:01:51,011 --> 01:01:53,747
He has 10-year-old twins.
Yeah.

1298
01:01:53,814 --> 01:01:55,816
I don't know
if they swim or not, though.

1299
01:01:55,883 --> 01:01:58,252
Oh, man. I am always
just amazed at people

1300
01:01:58,319 --> 01:02:00,921
who can, like, up and leave
their kids like that.

1301
01:02:00,988 --> 01:02:02,223
[Allison] Mmm.

1302
01:02:02,289 --> 01:02:03,625
I just don't know
how you could,

1303
01:02:03,692 --> 01:02:06,393
like, fucking sleep at night.

1304
01:02:06,460 --> 01:02:10,464
For so long, I thought
that I'd done something wrong.

1305
01:02:10,532 --> 01:02:14,235
Like, it was my fault,
or I'd let him down.

1306
01:02:15,369 --> 01:02:18,038
And then I just realized,

1307
01:02:18,105 --> 01:02:21,475
I don't know, maybe
some people just aren't good.

1308
01:02:21,543 --> 01:02:22,843
[Simone] Hmm.

1309
01:02:24,044 --> 01:02:26,247
It's kinda like he, like,
restarted a level

1310
01:02:26,313 --> 01:02:28,816
in a video game
with a fresh life.

1311
01:02:28,882 --> 01:02:31,218
-[both laugh]
-That's exactly what he did!

1312
01:02:31,285 --> 01:02:35,222
He packed up the car,
and left his Rolex

1313
01:02:35,289 --> 01:02:37,958
in the attic of my dollhouse,

1314
01:02:38,025 --> 01:02:39,860
and he drove away.

1315
01:02:43,297 --> 01:02:44,666
Hey, let's sit
for a second, okay?

1316
01:02:44,733 --> 01:02:46,367
-Yeah, yeah.
-[clears throat]

1317
01:02:47,901 --> 01:02:51,539
Uh... So, I'll sponsor you.

1318
01:02:51,606 --> 01:02:54,475
-Okay.
-But, um,

1319
01:02:54,542 --> 01:02:56,844
you gotta start
taking this shit seriously.

1320
01:02:58,012 --> 01:03:00,515
You can't keep coming
to meetings high.

1321
01:03:00,582 --> 01:03:02,116
What? [chuckles]

1322
01:03:04,785 --> 01:03:06,521
How did you know?

1323
01:03:06,588 --> 01:03:07,821
[laughs]

1324
01:03:07,888 --> 01:03:10,457
Uh, because I was you.

1325
01:03:10,525 --> 01:03:13,794
And I've helped
dozens of women who were you.

1326
01:03:14,962 --> 01:03:18,999
And some beat it,
and some are dead.

1327
01:03:21,670 --> 01:03:23,070
But, you know,

1328
01:03:24,104 --> 01:03:26,307
if you want my time,
you gotta commit.

1329
01:03:26,373 --> 01:03:27,941
Because I have a toddler
so I just

1330
01:03:28,008 --> 01:03:29,511
-don't have time for bullshit.
-Yeah.

1331
01:03:29,577 --> 01:03:32,614
No, I do. I... I...
I really wanna beat it.

1332
01:03:32,681 --> 01:03:35,650
Then I want you to do
90 meetings in 90 days.

1333
01:03:35,717 --> 01:03:37,284
-Wow.
-Yeah.

1334
01:03:37,351 --> 01:03:40,187
And, um, we're gonna
get you started on step one.

1335
01:03:41,255 --> 01:03:42,222
Okay.

1336
01:03:43,424 --> 01:03:44,559
Okay.

1337
01:03:44,626 --> 01:03:48,128
Also, enough hiding out, man.

1338
01:03:48,195 --> 01:03:49,564
It's time you shared
with the group.

1339
01:03:51,633 --> 01:03:53,834
-All right.
-Uh...

1340
01:03:56,136 --> 01:04:02,376
[nervously] Hi, I'm Allison,
and I'm addicted to, uh,

1341
01:04:03,712 --> 01:04:05,079
pills.

1342
01:04:05,145 --> 01:04:07,414
[group] Hi, Allison.

1343
01:04:07,481 --> 01:04:08,550
[Allison] Uh...

1344
01:04:09,950 --> 01:04:12,052
Sorry. Can I start again?

1345
01:04:12,119 --> 01:04:14,421
I've never done this before,
and I'm nervous.

1346
01:04:14,488 --> 01:04:15,557
You got it.

1347
01:04:16,691 --> 01:04:18,425
[breathes deeply]

1348
01:04:20,094 --> 01:04:25,065
Hi, I'm Allison,
and I'm an addict.

1349
01:04:25,132 --> 01:04:27,234
[group] Hi, Allison.

1350
01:04:30,371 --> 01:04:31,506
I...

1351
01:04:33,708 --> 01:04:34,908
Um...

1352
01:04:37,846 --> 01:04:39,514
I was the driver

1353
01:04:40,881 --> 01:04:42,851
of a car

1354
01:04:42,916 --> 01:04:44,952
that was in
a really bad accident.

1355
01:04:47,955 --> 01:04:49,456
Two people died.

1356
01:04:52,960 --> 01:04:54,395
The woman was...

1357
01:04:57,998 --> 01:05:01,536
The woman was about to be
my sister-in-law.

1358
01:05:05,305 --> 01:05:08,208
We were on our way to try on
my wedding dresses.

1359
01:05:10,745 --> 01:05:12,446
[shudders]

1360
01:05:12,514 --> 01:05:13,581
And then we weren't.

1361
01:05:14,982 --> 01:05:16,383
It wasn't my fault. [sighs]

1362
01:05:17,719 --> 01:05:21,488
I wasn't on drugs or booze,
or drunk, or anything.

1363
01:05:23,558 --> 01:05:24,692
But, uh...

1364
01:05:35,035 --> 01:05:39,039
[voice breaking]
Surviving that day was, is...

1365
01:05:42,109 --> 01:05:44,011
the most painful thing

1366
01:05:44,077 --> 01:05:46,146
I will ever
have to live through.

1367
01:05:48,382 --> 01:05:51,051
[sniffles] I got hurt, too.

1368
01:05:51,853 --> 01:05:53,621
They put a hole in my head.

1369
01:05:54,656 --> 01:05:56,457
And, um, [sniffles]

1370
01:05:56,524 --> 01:05:58,225
that helped because
at least I had something

1371
01:05:58,292 --> 01:05:59,727
I could blame the pain on.

1372
01:06:02,329 --> 01:06:03,731
But then that healed...

1373
01:06:06,634 --> 01:06:08,202
and I was still hurting.

1374
01:06:09,970 --> 01:06:11,138
And I guess that's why
I didn't realize

1375
01:06:11,205 --> 01:06:13,140
how bad it was because to me...

1376
01:06:13,207 --> 01:06:15,643
[breathes shakily]

1377
01:06:15,710 --> 01:06:17,211
I was still in so much pain.

1378
01:06:17,277 --> 01:06:20,380
-[shuddering]
-[rubbing stomach]

1379
01:06:27,287 --> 01:06:30,457
I was, um, prescribed them
for physical pain,

1380
01:06:30,525 --> 01:06:32,993
and they really helped
with that. They really did.

1381
01:06:37,130 --> 01:06:39,734
But they made me numb.
Blissfully numb.

1382
01:06:45,205 --> 01:06:47,107
Without them I want to die.

1383
01:06:48,408 --> 01:06:50,310
[sniffles] Every day.

1384
01:06:53,715 --> 01:06:56,718
I've never said that
out loud before. [sobs]

1385
01:06:59,888 --> 01:07:01,021
Um...

1386
01:07:02,624 --> 01:07:05,660
I've never really faced
reality without them.

1387
01:07:06,493 --> 01:07:07,962
[sniffling]

1388
01:07:08,028 --> 01:07:10,097
And I don't know if I'll be
able to handle what I see,

1389
01:07:10,163 --> 01:07:13,601
but I'm here to try.

1390
01:07:18,238 --> 01:07:19,741

You made all of this?

1396
01:07:47,334 --> 01:07:51,039
Uh, I assembled it
and designed it.

1397
01:07:51,104 --> 01:07:52,840
Yeah.

1398
01:07:52,907 --> 01:07:56,578
You see,
the houses come as a kit.

1399

and paint them...

1404

behind the schoolhouse.

1407
01:08:26,239 --> 01:08:28,743
It was fall.
Tip of her nose was cold.

She stood on tiptoe.
Tasted like bubble gum.

[Allison] Is that
who you married?

1412
01:08:37,351 --> 01:08:39,286
No! No, no.

1413
01:08:39,353 --> 01:08:43,156
No, she dumped me the next day
for Charlie Cook.

-Oh.
-He smoked Camels.

1415

And drove
a Buick Riviera Roadmaster.

1416
01:08:50,163 --> 01:08:52,466
So, is this all inspired
by your life?

01:08:53,101 --> 01:08:54,301
Kinda.

1418

Supposed to be South Orange.

1419
01:08:58,238 --> 01:08:59,473
I grew up here.

1420
01:09:00,842 --> 01:09:02,543
I was a cop in Newark.

1421
01:09:03,377 --> 01:09:04,846
I've always lived here.

1422

1425

That other little figure there
is my father.

1426
01:09:16,356 --> 01:09:19,627
He came down to the station
to pick me up.

1427
01:09:19,694 --> 01:09:21,796
-This is incredible.
-Mm.

1428

How long did it take you?

1429
01:09:25,099 --> 01:09:27,035
Years.

1430
01:09:27,101 --> 01:09:29,403
I started
with a single figure-eight

1431
01:09:30,071 --> 01:09:31,906
and a two-car train.

1432
01:09:32,774 --> 01:09:34,474
I work on it when I can.

Ryan used to hang out with me
down here.

1436
01:09:43,818 --> 01:09:46,788
She liked the whistle
and the microphone.

1437
01:09:46,854 --> 01:09:48,089
There's a microphone?

1438
01:09:48,156 --> 01:09:49,590
Right over there.

1564
01:15:43,512 --> 01:15:44,912
Ever again!

1565
01:15:47,648 --> 01:15:49,483
Why'd you quit soccer?

1566
01:15:49,550 --> 01:15:51,018
-She got into a fight.
-'Cause I hate every girl
on the team.

1567
01:15:51,085 --> 01:15:52,086
Oh.

1568
01:15:53,454 --> 01:15:55,890
Your parents were telling me
how amazing you were.

1569
01:15:57,124 --> 01:15:58,893
-They were?
-[Allison] Mm-hmm.

1570
01:15:58,959 --> 01:16:00,895
Your dad actually was saying

1571
01:16:00,961 --> 01:16:03,030
how you were definitely
gonna get a scholarship.

1572
01:16:04,732 --> 01:16:06,567
I wanna go to Stanford.

1574
01:16:08,702 --> 01:16:10,271
Why are you laughing?

1575
01:16:12,139 --> 01:16:15,876
You quit the team,
you're mouthing off in school,

1576
01:16:15,943 --> 01:16:17,378
and you're not doing
your homework.

1577
01:16:17,445 --> 01:16:18,979
You're gonna get into Stanford?

1578
01:16:19,046 --> 01:16:20,714
I didn't say
I quit the team permanently.

1579
01:16:20,781 --> 01:16:22,683
I said I wanted
to take a break.

1580
01:16:22,750 --> 01:16:24,251
And I had a 4.0 down the shore.

1581
01:16:24,318 --> 01:16:26,287
I could get it back
in a second if I cared.

1582
01:16:26,353 --> 01:16:27,522
Why don't you care?

1583
01:16:27,588 --> 01:16:28,722
Why, do you think?

1584
01:16:30,091 --> 01:16:31,659
-[Daniel] Shit.
-[Allison] Okay.

1585
01:16:31,725 --> 01:16:33,094
Why don't we just
call it a night, okay?

1586
01:16:33,160 --> 01:16:34,261
[Allison] Yeah,
I'm gonna go home.

1587
01:16:39,100 --> 01:16:40,367
Hey, um...

[tears off page]

1589
01:16:43,771 --> 01:16:47,007
Um, just in case you,
I don't know,

1590
01:16:48,776 --> 01:16:50,311
wanna talk, need to talk...

1591
01:16:51,679 --> 01:16:53,013
This is me.

1592
01:16:53,080 --> 01:16:54,982
And it's up to you,
but I'm here.

1593
01:16:56,217 --> 01:16:57,318
Okay.

1595
01:17:01,655 --> 01:17:03,424
[Daniel] I'm sorry
about all that.

01:17:03,491 --> 01:17:04,825
[Allison] Uh, it's fine.

1597
01:17:06,494 --> 01:17:08,329
You see what I'm dealing with.

1598
01:17:08,395 --> 01:17:09,997
Honestly, it's okay.

1599
01:17:10,898 --> 01:17:12,266
Look. [sighs]

1600
01:17:13,367 --> 01:17:15,302
She's a very fragile kid.

1601
01:17:16,605 --> 01:17:20,941
So, I'd appreciate it
if you didn't contact her.

1602
01:17:22,676 --> 01:17:23,911
Oh.

1603
01:17:24,411 --> 01:17:25,412
Okay.

1604
01:17:26,847 --> 01:17:29,083
Yeah, I just...

1605
01:17:29,150 --> 01:17:32,286
[stuttering] I just wanted her
to know that I was available

1606
01:17:32,353 --> 01:17:34,855
if she wanted to talk
or anything.

1607
01:17:34,922 --> 01:17:37,191
I'm just asking if you will

1608
01:17:37,958 --> 01:17:39,760
please just let her be.

1609

No, that's Spock's

We Boy Scouts do this.

1612
01:17:46,267 --> 01:17:48,335
Oh. I prefer Spock.

1613
01:17:49,170 --> 01:17:51,038

1614

1642

I haven't been in a car
since the accident.

you were using your phone.

Yeah, well,
he has all the reports.

He's memorized them.

It's weird.

1652

Okay, well, I was there.

1653

those reports wasn't, so...

[Ryan] Tell me
why you ended it with Nate.

1655

My mom would want you guys
to be together still.

Ryan, I don't even know
what to say to that.

1657

My mom used to really, um...

1658

just, like, look out for him
and stuff, you know? Um...

1659

I've been thinking
maybe now I'm supposed to.

1661

Because she can't.

1662
01:21:48,175 --> 01:21:50,545
I bet that would make her
really proud.

1663
01:21:50,612 --> 01:21:52,179
I could tell you
about what's happening

-with him if you want.
-No, that's okay.

Thank you, though.

to avoid all of that...

<i>♪ So don't you</i>
<i>go away too long ♪</i>

02:07:04,526 --> 02:07:11,065
<i>♪ Oh don't you</i>
<i>go away too long ♪</i>

<i>♪ Oh don't you</i>

02:07:19,140 --> 02:07:23,244
<i>♪ Oh don't you go♪</i>

2431
02:07:23,310 --> 02:07:26,981
♪ <i>Away too long ♪</i>

2432
02:07:27,047 --> 02:07:29,518
<i>♪ You're on my mind ♪</i>

<i>♪ You're on my mind ♪</i>

2434
02:07:32,554 --> 02:07:34,589
<i>♪ You're on my mind ♪</i>

2435
02:07:34,655 --> 02:07:37,358
