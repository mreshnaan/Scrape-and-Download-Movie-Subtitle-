1
00:00:32,825 --> 00:00:39,074
<i> I'LL TAKE HER LIKE A FATHER </i>

2
00:01:54,851 --> 00:01:57,936
- A bunch of idiots, that's what you are! 
- What?

3
00:01:57,960 --> 00:02:00,802
You're a bunch of idiots,
blind and deaf!

4
00:02:00,826 --> 00:02:04,020
You're right! 
Counselor, I said you're right! I know!

5
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:07,803
This is like South African gold,
Rhur coal, Texas oil.

6
00:02:07,862 --> 00:02:11,401
- You should thank me.
- And we do, Counselor.

7
00:02:11,425 --> 00:02:13,560
- Thank you!
- You're welcome.

8
00:02:13,584 --> 00:02:16,498
Let the north bust
its balls with factories,

9
00:02:16,522 --> 00:02:19,027
strikes, oil that doesn't exist.

10
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:23,496
All of Europe must come here
to get drunk on real sun,

11
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:27,929
genuine wine, clean sea.
Take Mazzacolli's word for it!

12
00:02:28,131 --> 00:02:32,296
150 singles, 100 doubles,
50 apartments, a dock, a marina.

13
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:35,407
- Sailing, hiking, water skiing…
- A magnificent, grand project.

14
00:02:35,432 --> 00:02:38,635
Pools, tennis and sports courts,
saunas, mini zoos, mini safaris.

15
00:02:38,819 --> 00:02:40,759
Where do I find
the space for all that?

16
00:02:40,924 --> 00:02:43,235
Either make let me maximize this
or we'll take that.

17
00:02:43,259 --> 00:02:45,504
But Counselor Mazzacolli,
how can we?

18
00:02:45,528 --> 00:02:49,336
My lord, this is an agricultural area
and I'm not God Almighty!

19
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:52,441
This belongs to the Spina-Tommaselli
and who can touch it?

20
00:02:52,465 --> 00:02:55,035
Dear Di Corato, I'll touch it.
I'll pay in cash.

21
00:02:55,059 --> 00:02:56,825
And I will also buy them!

22
00:02:56,849 --> 00:03:01,216
Yes, the Spina-Tommaselli are like
a bone that sticks in your throat!

23
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:04,655
Spina! Spina! It's like all
the province belongs to them.

24
00:03:04,722 --> 00:03:07,696
- Not all but half of it.
- Can I drive, Counselor?

25
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:09,520
- Alright.
- Thank you.

26
00:03:12,684 --> 00:03:14,034
Be careful, eh?

27
00:03:18,450 --> 00:03:20,683
RIVA TOPAZIA S.p.A
DIRECTOR GENERAL

28
00:03:28,098 --> 00:03:30,542
You'll never touch
this steering wheel again.

29
00:03:30,566 --> 00:03:33,502
- It's not a bumper car.
- Here, Counselor!

30
00:03:33,793 --> 00:03:35,356
This way, Sir.

31
00:03:38,241 --> 00:03:41,536
I get it: You're quick, hold your own,
ambitious and rotten to the core.

32
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:43,704
If you listen and study,
I'll make something of you.

33
00:03:43,728 --> 00:03:46,200
- In 10 years, you'll be rich.
- 10 years?

34
00:03:46,224 --> 00:03:48,936
See that? You're in too
much of a rush, Surveyor.

35
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:50,602
You want it all right now. Study!

36
00:03:50,626 --> 00:03:52,897
- Hi, Concetta!
- Counselor!

37
00:03:52,961 --> 00:03:55,856
They wanted you from Rome.
From the Bregonzo Office.

38
00:03:55,880 --> 00:03:58,776
They said it's very urgent
and you must call back soon.

39
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:01,841
- Don Amilcare wanted you too.
- Well done, Concettina.

40
00:04:01,865 --> 00:04:03,561
He said it's urgent too.

41
00:04:04,582 --> 00:04:07,163
And if you don't mind,
this is urgent too.

42
00:04:07,187 --> 00:04:08,924
What's got into your head?

43
00:04:08,997 --> 00:04:10,997
Dear Guercioli, how are you?

44
00:04:11,464 --> 00:04:13,958
I'd like Bregonzo. He's not in?

45
00:04:14,273 --> 00:04:16,388
Then the list of the new ministry?

46
00:04:16,460 --> 00:04:18,923
Still not final? Christ!

47
00:04:19,009 --> 00:04:21,424
Tell me… Go on and tell me!

48
00:04:24,412 --> 00:04:26,636
Damn, I don't give
a shit about Healthcare!

49
00:04:26,660 --> 00:04:29,314
What can I do with Bregonzo
at the Ministry of Health?

50
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:32,960
No, Guerc… Guercioli, please,
call back in an hour, eh?

51
00:04:33,767 --> 00:04:35,089
Yeah, Healthcare…

52
00:04:35,113 --> 00:04:37,904
The Ministry of Health is
poorer than Fund for the South.

53
00:04:38,066 --> 00:04:42,136
Even if diseases are a good game.
I could turn it into a hospital complex:

54
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:45,301
Luxury clinics, check-ups,
total transplants, hormones,

55
00:04:45,518 --> 00:04:49,581
spas, rejuvenation, in short,
a brothel for old billionaires.

56
00:04:49,605 --> 00:04:51,543
- It's an idea.
- No, it's a fraud.

57
00:04:51,567 --> 00:04:52,909
Shut up and study!

58
00:04:56,640 --> 00:05:02,095
Blessed art thou among women and
blessed is the fruit of thy womb, Jesus.

59
00:05:02,119 --> 00:05:04,067
Holy Mary, mother of God,

60
00:05:04,091 --> 00:05:08,176
pray for us sinners, now
and at the hour of our death.

61
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:09,456
Amen.

62
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:14,576
Hail Mary, full of grace,
the Lord is with thee.

63
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:18,140
Blessed art thou among women and
blessed is the fruit of thy womb, Jesus.

64
00:05:18,164 --> 00:05:19,610
Holy Mary, mother of God,

65
00:05:19,634 --> 00:05:23,450
pray for us sinners, now
and at the hour of our death.

66
00:05:34,532 --> 00:05:36,104
Heal us, Lord.

67
00:05:36,128 --> 00:05:39,456
Let all the saints heal us:
Orontius, Justus, Fortunatus…

68
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:44,518
- Grace! Grace, Jesus!
- Lorè, what manners! Manners.

69
00:05:44,542 --> 00:05:46,965
With the heart, Lorè!
Pray with your heart!

70
00:05:46,989 --> 00:05:48,583
Yes, yes…

71
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:50,170
Useless fool!

72
00:05:51,594 --> 00:05:54,576
- The novena all together.
- Holy Mother of God.

73
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:56,162
Pray for us!

74
00:05:56,186 --> 00:05:59,509
- St Orontius, the Martyr.
- Pray for us.

75
00:06:02,637 --> 00:06:05,764
And so your wait is over,
dear Saverio.

76
00:06:05,818 --> 00:06:08,656
Soon you'll meet
Donna Raimonda Spina.

77
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:11,567
But if you want my advice,
just get to know her.

78
00:06:11,591 --> 00:06:15,737
Don't talk about business, please,
unless she starts the conversation.

79
00:06:15,899 --> 00:06:18,408
You need tact, Saverio. Tact!

80
00:06:19,298 --> 00:06:22,594
- And if she doesn't talk about it?
- Don't make any false moves.

81
00:06:22,618 --> 00:06:25,468
Once I've introduced you,
everything will be easier.

82
00:06:25,492 --> 00:06:28,153
Concetta, when you've done having
your ass fondled by the counselor,

83
00:06:28,177 --> 00:06:29,971
I'd like some more fish.

84
00:06:35,211 --> 00:06:37,565
And from Rome?
What news do we have?

85
00:06:37,589 --> 00:06:38,855
It's hard.

86
00:06:38,879 --> 00:06:41,650
They've made and unmade
the government list a dozen times,

87
00:06:41,674 --> 00:06:44,176
as if they were turning
their balls upside down…

88
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:46,476
- Ah, well…
- Sorry, Concetti'.

89
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:48,315
- The product's changed.
- It has.

90
00:06:48,339 --> 00:06:51,530
What do you do if Bregonzo
isn't confirmed in the South?

91
00:06:51,618 --> 00:06:53,945
- I'll cut off "my ministers".
- And spite me?

92
00:06:53,969 --> 00:06:56,096
Who has, respectfully speaking,
married you:

93
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:58,148
You and Emerald Shores.

94
00:06:58,172 --> 00:07:00,259
It was a love marriage,
Don Amilcare,

95
00:07:00,283 --> 00:07:03,816
because respectfully speaking,
what did you get me? Debts, mortgages…

96
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:06,167
And the Loyola name, dear Saverio.

97
00:07:06,191 --> 00:07:08,178
That's not yet mortgaged.

98
00:07:26,147 --> 00:07:29,970
Come, Clo, come on.
We must get dressed.

99
00:07:44,491 --> 00:07:47,444
Flower, my flower,
beautiful flower!

100
00:07:47,468 --> 00:07:48,768
Anna!

101
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:52,942
Haven't you got her ready yet?
Hurry, Anna, people are arriving.

102
00:07:52,967 --> 00:07:54,915
Yes, right away.

103
00:07:55,212 --> 00:07:56,478
Come here.

104
00:07:56,502 --> 00:07:58,374
Come, get up.

105
00:07:58,850 --> 00:08:00,516
Come now. Come.

106
00:08:00,540 --> 00:08:01,970
Just like that.

107
00:08:35,035 --> 00:08:38,386
That's Don Liguori, the canon
and that's the family doctor.

108
00:08:38,410 --> 00:08:40,862
- Countess Spina's notary.
- Does he have a price?

109
00:08:40,886 --> 00:08:42,790
The prefect with the mayor.

110
00:08:42,814 --> 00:08:46,008
The one who so gallantly
sees to the lady's necklace

111
00:08:46,032 --> 00:08:48,393
is the director of
the Salentine Credit,

112
00:08:48,417 --> 00:08:51,155
the president of which,
as you know, is Donna Raimonda.

113
00:08:51,179 --> 00:08:53,193
Of course, the bank is hers.

114
00:08:53,217 --> 00:08:55,830
- You already know the assessor
Di Corato. - He's mine.

115
00:08:55,854 --> 00:08:57,896
- Senator Palmieri.
- He will be.

116
00:08:57,920 --> 00:09:00,475
The one in the wheelchair is
Anastasia, a Russian princess,

117
00:09:00,499 --> 00:09:02,416
mother of the late
Count Emilio Spina,

118
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:05,056
that blonde gentleman
you see portrayed there.

119
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:08,090
They used to cross the street
in order to pay me homage

120
00:09:08,114 --> 00:09:09,776
but that's now ancient history.

121
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:13,734
Leave it to me, Don Amilcare and
they'll change palaces once again.

122
00:09:15,985 --> 00:09:18,879
- She's coming. - Don't move,
she'll come over to greet me.

123
00:09:18,903 --> 00:09:20,736
That is still owed to me at least.

124
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:22,962
- Don Amilcare!
- Dearest Raimonda!

125
00:09:22,986 --> 00:09:25,184
It took our patron saint
to perform this miracle.

126
00:09:25,208 --> 00:09:28,412
- If I may, Counselor Mazzacolli.
- <i>Enchanté</i>.

127
00:09:30,219 --> 00:09:34,136
Yes, Mazzacolli. Emerald Shores,
that's what it's called, right?

128
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:36,616
I've only heard talk
of your project.

129
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:39,800
If the countess would like the honor,
I'd be delighted to explain it.

130
00:09:39,824 --> 00:09:43,297
- It's a futuristic conception…
- With the greatest pleasure.

131
00:09:44,281 --> 00:09:47,777
<i>Comment vas-tu</i>, you old whore?

132
00:09:47,801 --> 00:09:49,650
I'm back in business!

133
00:09:50,695 --> 00:09:54,785
- <i>Maman</i>, may I introduce you
to the Counselor Mazzacolli? - <i>Oui</i>.

134
00:09:54,989 --> 00:09:57,131
<i>- Enchanté</i>.
- Come, Don Amilcare,

135
00:09:57,155 --> 00:10:00,799
Elisa and Lorè will be glad to see you.
They're in the living room.

136
00:10:00,924 --> 00:10:02,524
This way, Counselor.

137
00:10:04,464 --> 00:10:08,164
- Who is that man?
- Counselor Mazzacolli.

138
00:10:08,188 --> 00:10:09,585
Hmm. A man!

139
00:10:11,826 --> 00:10:13,806
Oh, dear Amilcare!

140
00:10:13,830 --> 00:10:18,936
Last night you made Emiliuccio
stay up late with those darn cards!

141
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:22,371
What are you saying, Lorè?
Emilio has been dead for 10 years!

142
00:10:23,275 --> 00:10:24,575
Dead?

143
00:10:25,144 --> 00:10:26,644
How did it happen?

144
00:10:27,132 --> 00:10:30,714
Jesus, they never tell me anything!

145
00:10:30,738 --> 00:10:33,393
What are you saying, Lorè?
How embarrassing!

146
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:36,651
And this is my daughter Clotilde.

147
00:10:36,675 --> 00:10:38,865
It's been a while
since you've seen her.

148
00:10:38,889 --> 00:10:41,910
How she has grown!
She has become a young lady.

149
00:10:41,934 --> 00:10:43,575
16 years old in May.

150
00:10:43,599 --> 00:10:46,136
Tonight she makes
her official debut into society.

151
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:48,607
- Right, Clo? Greet the duke.
- Raimonda!

152
00:10:50,484 --> 00:10:53,454
What a splendid daughter
you have, Donna Raimonda.

153
00:10:54,556 --> 00:10:57,855
Do you study, Little Countess?
What grade are you in?

154
00:10:58,520 --> 00:11:00,772
These things happen often.

155
00:11:00,796 --> 00:11:03,345
- Countess, about that request…
- Not now.

156
00:11:03,691 --> 00:11:06,164
I wanted to give an answer,
I see him tomorrow.

157
00:11:06,188 --> 00:11:09,282
Yes, but we've
already talked about it.

158
00:11:09,306 --> 00:11:11,350
But I'm not
convinced by that clause.

159
00:11:11,374 --> 00:11:13,759
Alright,
we'll talk about it tomorrow.

160
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:18,380
Anna!

161
00:11:18,859 --> 00:11:22,753
Come, Clo, don't do that.
Come with your nanny, come.

162
00:11:22,818 --> 00:11:25,664
You know, she's still a child.

163
00:11:25,729 --> 00:11:28,348
What a pleasure it was
to meet you, Counselor.

164
00:11:28,460 --> 00:11:32,312
Why don't you come with me tomorrow?
I'll give you a tour of my properties.

165
00:11:32,336 --> 00:11:33,636
Excuse me.

166
00:11:34,725 --> 00:11:38,681
We can calmly talk about your project.
I'd really like to know more.

167
00:11:38,748 --> 00:11:41,056
Yes, sure. Why not?
Tomorrow morning.

168
00:11:41,394 --> 00:11:42,694
Certainly.

169
00:11:43,959 --> 00:11:46,230
Yes, it smells like spring.

170
00:11:46,310 --> 00:11:49,244
Yes, forward. That's it.

171
00:11:49,269 --> 00:11:51,048
Jesus! Jesus! Jesus!

172
00:11:51,297 --> 00:11:54,297
Who would've thought
that poor Clotilde

173
00:11:54,321 --> 00:11:56,315
was making her debut in society?

174
00:11:56,339 --> 00:11:59,871
And the aunts? The grandmother?
Are they for real?

175
00:12:00,010 --> 00:12:03,925
It's obvious Donna Raimonda
is thinking of marrying her.

176
00:12:03,949 --> 00:12:05,790
A fool? Who would take her?

177
00:12:05,814 --> 00:12:09,331
Ah, dear Saverio, husbands are
bought like any other goods!

178
00:12:09,355 --> 00:12:13,256
- It's a matter of price.
- Yes, but a sick, demented girl…

179
00:12:13,280 --> 00:12:15,298
But upon that poor
demented little head

180
00:12:15,322 --> 00:12:17,768
there are houses, land, titles…

181
00:12:18,997 --> 00:12:21,709
and 20 kilometers of coastline.

182
00:12:22,032 --> 00:12:23,655
- 20?
- 20.

183
00:12:23,679 --> 00:12:26,896
15 minutes by car
from stake to stake.

184
00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:30,663
I know it well: it was all mine
before that cursed evening!

185
00:12:31,152 --> 00:12:35,406
Two pairs of aces and kings
which was, believe me, a jewel.

186
00:12:35,474 --> 00:12:40,286
And didn't that evil Count Spina have
a miserable trio of sevens in his hand?

187
00:12:40,311 --> 00:12:42,241
- Did he have it?
- He certainly did!

188
00:12:42,265 --> 00:12:44,896
May the devil take him to hell!

189
00:12:44,920 --> 00:12:48,536
He was a born bluffer but shit,
that night he had the points!

190
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:51,703
And he screwed me from a property
that's worth billions today.

191
00:12:52,197 --> 00:12:55,497
You play away billions
like that over a pair of aces?

192
00:12:56,055 --> 00:12:59,005
- Excuse me, couldn't you back out?
- Counselor,

193
00:13:00,063 --> 00:13:01,775
do you see that tree?

194
00:13:01,799 --> 00:13:04,347
There is more than
6 centuries of history there.

195
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:07,176
The Loyolas ruled at
the time of Ferrante of Aragon,

196
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:10,376
better than the Spinas,
lesser nobles of the Bourbon restoration.

197
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:14,027
I am the last without heirs.
The one on the top right.

198
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:18,062
- But a Loyola's word is as good as…
- As good as a king's.

199
00:13:21,165 --> 00:13:22,814
Why don't you adopt me?

200
00:13:22,902 --> 00:13:26,336
I gain a title and you a lineage.
I mean it. Why not think about it?

201
00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:27,836
Dear Mazzacolli,

202
00:13:27,860 --> 00:13:30,557
my name will serve
you better if I wear it myself.

203
00:13:30,876 --> 00:13:32,431
I don't know.

204
00:13:32,828 --> 00:13:35,300
Do me the favor
and not to say "enchanté"

205
00:13:35,324 --> 00:13:37,656
- when I introduce you to a lady.
- Isn't that done?

206
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:41,432
If the lady is French or you are.
Are you French?

207
00:13:42,066 --> 00:13:45,771
I am from the European
Economic Community.

208
00:13:46,103 --> 00:13:47,403
<i>Bonne nuit.</i>

209
00:13:48,262 --> 00:13:50,089
Behave!

210
00:13:54,069 --> 00:13:57,016
- Well done, Peppe!
- Remember we're not on your side.

211
00:13:57,076 --> 00:14:00,668
Greeks, Arabs, Spaniards have been
spilling our blood for centuries.

212
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:02,535
- You have the plan?
- Yes, Sir.

213
00:14:02,559 --> 00:14:06,736
When we say "yes or no", it might
mean yes or no but not necessarily.

214
00:14:06,760 --> 00:14:08,976
- The heliport project?
- All there, Sir. - Good.

215
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:12,744
But when we're silent, you must start
shitting yourself because it's a bad sign.

216
00:14:12,768 --> 00:14:14,528
- Understand?
- Sure!

217
00:14:14,552 --> 00:14:17,815
Business doesn't require calculation
but intuition, imagination, poetry!

218
00:14:17,839 --> 00:14:20,517
Poetry?
Meanwhile, you stink like a whore!

219
00:14:20,541 --> 00:14:22,511
- Monsieur de Givenchy.
- Penhaligon.

220
00:14:22,535 --> 00:14:25,536
There's only one cologne: Penhaligon.
Few know about it even in London.

221
00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:27,139
Here, a present for you.

222
00:14:27,336 --> 00:14:29,628
Can this cologne be ordered?

223
00:14:29,652 --> 00:14:31,536
Never mind that,
think of the countess.

224
00:14:31,560 --> 00:14:33,617
She's a son of a bitch.
Don't underestimate her.

225
00:14:33,641 --> 00:14:35,541
I'll take that. I need it.

226
00:14:36,232 --> 00:14:39,716
And this son of a bitch, who does…
sorry, Concetti, who does she screw?

227
00:14:39,740 --> 00:14:43,412
As the criminal records
would say: "No charges".

228
00:14:43,436 --> 00:14:47,351
Some trips now and then:
Paris, New York, Barletta.

229
00:14:47,375 --> 00:14:50,743
Shit! Nail yourself to the table
and wait for Guercioli's call.

230
00:14:50,767 --> 00:14:53,619
I'll call as soon as
I hear any news.

231
00:14:54,676 --> 00:14:56,426
I'm off to fix the South.

232
00:15:00,167 --> 00:15:04,425
I forgot to warn you it's going to
be quite a country day, Counselor.

233
00:15:04,449 --> 00:15:05,834
Oh, please!

234
00:15:05,858 --> 00:15:08,358
Sorry, rather,
if I kept you waiting.

235
00:15:08,568 --> 00:15:10,868
A long-distance…
an international call…

236
00:15:10,892 --> 00:15:12,342
I just came down.

237
00:15:25,326 --> 00:15:27,432
More than 80,000
attendees a year,

238
00:15:27,456 --> 00:15:29,746
for starters.
A business of several billions.

239
00:15:29,770 --> 00:15:32,856
Don't overlook the possibility of
an outlet for your production, Countess.

240
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:35,780
- I won't overlook it.
- Here: wine, cigarettes…

241
00:15:36,004 --> 00:15:39,256
In other words, the common market.
Oil! You also produce oil, right?

242
00:15:39,280 --> 00:15:41,180
A little: 10,000 quintals.

243
00:15:41,262 --> 00:15:43,571
Lovely plants. Ancestral.

244
00:15:45,617 --> 00:15:49,296
The entire cost of the project
doesn't exceed 30 billion.

245
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:53,009
This includes buying the needed land,
for which I have the contracts.

246
00:15:53,033 --> 00:15:55,298
- A transfer of ownership?
- No.

247
00:15:55,322 --> 00:15:58,422
- You see, as an option. It's as if…
- Ah, "as if".

248
00:15:59,880 --> 00:16:02,638
This vineyard is splendid!
Is all this yours?

249
00:16:03,288 --> 00:16:04,601
And how much…?

250
00:16:04,625 --> 00:16:07,182
260 hectares, 600,000 bottles.

251
00:16:07,960 --> 00:16:11,536
<i>Here's to the frothing wine,
sparkling in the glass,</i>

252
00:16:11,560 --> 00:16:14,284
<i>like the lover's smile…</i>

253
00:16:14,308 --> 00:16:19,352
<i>that makes every
thought a happy one!</i>

254
00:16:19,413 --> 00:16:24,191
<i>Here's to the wine that's sincere,</i>

255
00:16:24,280 --> 00:16:29,199
<i>that makes every
thought a happy one!</i>

256
00:16:38,877 --> 00:16:40,144
It's nice.

257
00:16:40,168 --> 00:16:42,216
It's my refuge in the hot hours.

258
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:44,490
Make yourself at home, Counselor.

259
00:16:45,008 --> 00:16:48,067
I always come here after I've made
my rounds. I grab a bite to eat

260
00:16:48,091 --> 00:16:50,632
and when I feel like it,
take a catnap.

261
00:16:50,656 --> 00:16:52,395
At home, I have no peace.

262
00:16:52,419 --> 00:16:55,216
Excuse me, I'll take
a shower and be right back.

263
00:16:55,240 --> 00:16:58,976
By all means. Countess,
while you shower, may I use the phone?

264
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,300
My house is your house, Counselor.

265
00:17:03,754 --> 00:17:05,054
Peppe, it's me.

266
00:17:05,835 --> 00:17:07,235
So, did he call?

267
00:17:08,671 --> 00:17:09,971
And?

268
00:17:17,005 --> 00:17:18,451
Holy fuck…

269
00:17:20,600 --> 00:17:21,900
Fuck…

270
00:17:25,152 --> 00:17:26,452
Counselor?

271
00:17:26,669 --> 00:17:28,019
Were you bored?

272
00:17:28,312 --> 00:17:30,000
I was thinking about you.

273
00:17:30,119 --> 00:17:31,869
- Want some help?
- Yes.

274
00:17:41,936 --> 00:17:43,586
You are so beautiful.

275
00:17:45,464 --> 00:17:47,496
How nice you smell.

276
00:17:47,784 --> 00:17:50,334
You smell of soap,
lily of the valley.

277
00:17:50,513 --> 00:17:52,075
Flowers.

278
00:17:52,199 --> 00:17:55,530
Why don't you tell me
you want to fuck me?

279
00:18:11,076 --> 00:18:12,626
You liked that, eh?

280
00:18:16,620 --> 00:18:19,776
We shall do great things together.
Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes!

281
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:22,480
Adding your forces to mine,
Emerald Shores is a done deal.

282
00:18:22,504 --> 00:18:25,848
But that's just for starters:
We'll parcel out the Amazon!

283
00:18:27,389 --> 00:18:28,820
Counselor!

284
00:18:30,717 --> 00:18:32,117
Why "counselor"?

285
00:18:34,243 --> 00:18:36,043
Did you say "counselor"?

286
00:18:37,472 --> 00:18:38,772
Come here.

287
00:18:43,881 --> 00:18:46,359
I don't want any misunderstandings.

288
00:18:47,720 --> 00:18:50,128
It was very pleasant but…

289
00:18:50,576 --> 00:18:52,852
- But?
- Just a small interlude.

290
00:18:52,876 --> 00:18:55,693
We'll end it just as we began it.

291
00:18:56,744 --> 00:18:59,540
And we'll forget
about it soon, OK?

292
00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:05,659
You're a fine slut, eh?

293
00:19:05,683 --> 00:19:09,136
I am a fine slut
but don't forget my title.

294
00:19:09,160 --> 00:19:11,236
You, Countess, are a fine slut.

295
00:19:11,260 --> 00:19:13,765
See? Much better. Thank you.

296
00:19:17,946 --> 00:19:20,252
I'm so hungry now!

297
00:19:20,342 --> 00:19:23,856
We can talk business while having
a bite to eat. Right, Counselor?

298
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:26,762
Very true. I'm very hungry now too.

299
00:19:27,165 --> 00:19:28,665
May I get dressed?

300
00:19:29,262 --> 00:19:30,562
Alright.

301
00:19:32,117 --> 00:19:34,310
You're too hungry, Counselor.

302
00:19:34,561 --> 00:19:36,081
You want my money.

303
00:19:36,158 --> 00:19:39,413
- I don't. I'm giving you a chance
to give it to me. - The same thing.

304
00:19:39,651 --> 00:19:41,201
No, it's different.

305
00:19:41,406 --> 00:19:43,306
Oops! Sorry, ladies first.

306
00:19:44,976 --> 00:19:46,233
Fine.

307
00:19:46,257 --> 00:19:50,936
You offer me the chance to give
you my money in exchange for 30%.

308
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:54,314
- Exactly. - And I offer
you the chance to take it

309
00:19:54,338 --> 00:19:57,136
and keep the 30% for yourself.

310
00:19:57,328 --> 00:19:59,205
You don't want the percentage?

311
00:19:59,229 --> 00:20:00,891
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

312
00:20:01,196 --> 00:20:02,646
I want the other.

313
00:20:03,848 --> 00:20:06,707
- I want 70%.
- Hey, Countess, no.

314
00:20:06,731 --> 00:20:10,139
Sorry. We're still friends
but see ya. I'll go it alone.

315
00:20:10,163 --> 00:20:13,298
- Counselor, you will not
go it alone. - Ah, no?

316
00:20:13,322 --> 00:20:16,072
I know your situation
as well as yourself.

317
00:20:16,671 --> 00:20:20,120
You're in the hole for 423 million.

318
00:20:20,144 --> 00:20:22,216
If you want,
I can tell you the change.

319
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:23,940
Isn't this cheese good?

320
00:20:25,104 --> 00:20:27,054
You even know the change?

321
00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:29,070
You are as dry…

322
00:20:29,917 --> 00:20:31,617
as a bunch of raisins!

323
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:36,685
And if you don't find half a billion
within about two or three weeks,

324
00:20:36,760 --> 00:20:39,068
you lose everything
and go back home.

325
00:20:40,465 --> 00:20:43,937
- The Fund for the South (Midday)…
- For you, Counselor, it's midnight.

326
00:20:43,992 --> 00:20:47,696
You were informed just now
that your friend, Mr Berg…

327
00:20:47,720 --> 00:20:49,254
- Bregonzo.
- Bregonzo.

328
00:20:49,317 --> 00:20:52,155
"He hasn't found a seat
in the government ship".

329
00:20:52,290 --> 00:20:53,846
Excuse me, how…?

330
00:20:53,870 --> 00:20:56,050
There's a line in the bedroom.

331
00:20:57,157 --> 00:21:01,004
Well done! How sumptuous,
how splendid, how sublime,

332
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:04,918
how celestial, how beatific
a son of a bitch you are!

333
00:21:05,040 --> 00:21:07,496
A son of a bitch and a bitch!
Whore! Slut!

334
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:09,620
A hooker is what you are!

335
00:21:09,644 --> 00:21:11,847
I did warn you.

336
00:21:14,715 --> 00:21:16,815
Hello? This is Emerald Shores!

337
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,442
Yes, one moment.
Counselor, the Senator!

338
00:21:22,072 --> 00:21:24,222
I've been saying this
to you since 3rd grade:

339
00:21:24,246 --> 00:21:26,177
"Bregonzo, you're an asshole"!

340
00:21:26,312 --> 00:21:27,790
It almost rhymes.

341
00:21:31,920 --> 00:21:33,844
Weak blood.

342
00:21:33,868 --> 00:21:36,736
And then the children pay for it.

343
00:21:38,372 --> 00:21:39,672
It's a shame.

344
00:21:39,820 --> 00:21:41,375
It's really a shame.

345
00:21:41,480 --> 00:21:42,780
Yes…

346
00:21:43,080 --> 00:21:44,532
Because…

347
00:21:44,556 --> 00:21:46,416
she would have everything.

348
00:21:46,930 --> 00:21:49,280
Just something missing in the head.

349
00:21:50,591 --> 00:21:53,891
- Here's the coffee, Excellency.
- Well done, Concetta!

350
00:21:54,658 --> 00:21:57,011
- Is she taking a bath?
- Shut up.

351
00:21:57,082 --> 00:21:59,186
- Mind your fucking business.
- Sorry, Concetta.

352
00:21:59,210 --> 00:22:01,710
- Thank you, Duke.
- Go to your kennel!

353
00:22:04,105 --> 00:22:05,824
<i>Punctum dolens.</i>

354
00:22:05,943 --> 00:22:07,163
The weak point.

355
00:22:07,187 --> 00:22:10,531
Everyone has one:
you, me, Donna Raimonda…

356
00:22:10,555 --> 00:22:13,256
But that's normal, Christ!
This Raimonda can't have it all!

357
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:16,788
The bank, olive trees, oil,
wine, tobacco! What the fuck?

358
00:22:16,920 --> 00:22:18,220
Clotilde.

359
00:22:19,553 --> 00:22:20,853
Clotilde?

360
00:22:38,160 --> 00:22:40,854
Why, Clotilde? Lie down.

361
00:22:42,272 --> 00:22:43,572
Like that.

362
00:22:48,040 --> 00:22:50,724
Sleep. Sleep, honey.

363
00:22:56,024 --> 00:22:59,214
Be good, good, my baby.

364
00:22:59,655 --> 00:23:01,205
Why are you crying?

365
00:23:02,840 --> 00:23:08,376
<i>Beautiful flower,
go to sleep in the castle.</i>

366
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:14,896
<i>In the castle there's a gentleman
who wants to eat the flower.</i>

367
00:23:14,920 --> 00:23:17,936
<i>Go beddy-bye in the castle.</i>

368
00:23:17,960 --> 00:23:25,171
<i>In the castle there's a gentleman
who wants to eat the flower.</i>

369
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:44,058
News has arrived from Palazzo Chigi
that the ministry assignments

370
00:23:44,082 --> 00:23:46,537
could be determined by tomorrow.

371
00:23:47,080 --> 00:23:48,730
The Finance Minister…

372
00:23:53,960 --> 00:23:55,706
- Hello?
- Counselor Mazzacolli?

373
00:23:55,730 --> 00:23:57,682
- In person. Who is it?
- Here's Dr Guercioli.

374
00:23:57,706 --> 00:24:00,845
- Dear counselor, unfortunately,
I must inform you… - One moment.

375
00:24:00,948 --> 00:24:02,585
- Stop.
- What? Are you busy?

376
00:24:02,609 --> 00:24:04,942
- No, go on! Heel.
- What did you say?

377
00:24:04,966 --> 00:24:06,938
Ah, you're talking to your dog.

378
00:24:07,208 --> 00:24:09,786
- Who? No, go on.
- I'm still inside arguing.

379
00:24:09,810 --> 00:24:13,498
According to the latest rumors
gathered by those in the know,

380
00:24:13,522 --> 00:24:16,340
Bregonzo goes to Transportation.
At least, it seems so.

381
00:24:16,556 --> 00:24:18,850
A funeral! Stay here.

382
00:24:18,956 --> 00:24:21,208
Well, first of all
it's not a sure thing

383
00:24:21,232 --> 00:24:23,539
and then it's not a ministry
to be sneezed at.

384
00:24:23,563 --> 00:24:27,096
Give me the other one, it's firm.
A hard boiled egg.

385
00:24:27,320 --> 00:24:30,202
- Hard? What do you mean?
- No, I mean the hard facts!

386
00:24:30,226 --> 00:24:32,248
Nothing else can be done.
Cheer up, eh?

387
00:24:32,272 --> 00:24:33,949
Yes, on a dick!
Where are you going?

388
00:24:33,973 --> 00:24:37,218
- To sleep!
- No, wait, come here. Sit down.

389
00:24:37,242 --> 00:24:40,980
You are a smart girl.
You must study, got it?

390
00:24:41,468 --> 00:24:45,242
Study languages: English, French,
Arabic. They are useful today.

391
00:24:45,266 --> 00:24:47,976
Study! You can do public
relations for Emerald Shores.

392
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:51,256
Study! Study and
you won't regret it! Study.

393
00:24:52,280 --> 00:24:53,940
Transportation…

394
00:24:54,448 --> 00:24:55,748
Healthcare…

395
00:24:56,813 --> 00:24:58,113
The Countess.

396
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,579
The Countess…

397
00:25:05,179 --> 00:25:07,830
Go to the post office and send
everything by express mail.

398
00:25:07,854 --> 00:25:09,704
Then come and pick me up.

399
00:25:18,533 --> 00:25:21,691
I'll accept, I'll sign
but I'd like to talk for a moment…

400
00:25:21,748 --> 00:25:23,748
It's something particular
but the notary…

401
00:25:23,772 --> 00:25:26,096
Notary, would you please
leave us for a moment?

402
00:25:26,120 --> 00:25:28,075
Of course, Countess.

403
00:25:31,575 --> 00:25:32,875
Go on.

404
00:25:36,026 --> 00:25:38,576
I want to marry
your daughter Clotilde.

405
00:25:39,709 --> 00:25:41,461
You want to marry Clotilde?

406
00:25:41,485 --> 00:25:44,038
I want to marry Clo.
I realize that it's…

407
00:25:44,062 --> 00:25:47,431
Counselor, I'm not disposed
to joke about that subject.

408
00:25:47,571 --> 00:25:50,987
I'm not joking at all, Countess.
I want to marry your daughter.

409
00:25:51,137 --> 00:25:55,313
Because it can be a guarantee
that's still missing from our pact.

410
00:25:57,258 --> 00:26:02,017
This way, I won't just be a partner
but join the Spina Family, become…

411
00:26:02,041 --> 00:26:05,291
But for that you don't need
to marry Clo, Counselor.

412
00:26:07,787 --> 00:26:09,733
Then why not you?

413
00:26:10,680 --> 00:26:13,902
There's already some sympathy
between us. You're a Spina…

414
00:26:14,658 --> 00:26:19,311
I am a Spina as long as
I remain Count Spina's widow.

415
00:26:19,427 --> 00:26:22,133
If I remarry, Counselor,
I am nothing.

416
00:26:22,157 --> 00:26:23,735
Nothing at all.

417
00:26:25,265 --> 00:26:26,565
Is the offer…

418
00:26:27,119 --> 00:26:28,502
still valid?

419
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:32,041
No… Never mind, Countess.
Never mind!

420
00:26:33,496 --> 00:26:36,206
Then I'll call
the notary so we can sign?

421
00:26:36,230 --> 00:26:40,023
No, Countess, I won't sign until
you sign the marriage contract.

422
00:26:40,047 --> 00:26:43,440
That is what's called
a fiduciary relationship!

423
00:26:44,355 --> 00:26:46,220
Of course! It's the minimum.

424
00:27:01,190 --> 00:27:03,136
Yes, the little snail. Yes.

425
00:27:03,160 --> 00:27:05,896
If you knew, dear Raimonda,
what joy this gives me.

426
00:27:05,920 --> 00:27:09,216
It's as if I were becoming
your relative too.

427
00:27:09,240 --> 00:27:12,528
As if something of myself
was entering this union.

428
00:27:12,811 --> 00:27:14,961
He's alluding to his mortgages!

429
00:27:16,594 --> 00:27:17,856
Oh, well…

430
00:27:17,880 --> 00:27:21,976
You'll do me the honor, dear Saverio.
Saturday my farmers are having a party.

431
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:25,256
- A yearly ancient festival.
- Sure, why not? Sure.

432
00:27:25,280 --> 00:27:27,567
- You too, I hope.
- Thank you, my friend,

433
00:27:27,591 --> 00:27:29,576
but you know I'd never go to it.

434
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:32,896
They burn the devil! But I bet
the lawyer doesn't believe in that.

435
00:27:32,920 --> 00:27:36,496
Why not? Even the Pope has recently
relaunched it, in grand style.

436
00:27:36,520 --> 00:27:40,489
In France, they say, "One candle
to God and two to the devil."

437
00:27:40,928 --> 00:27:44,970
The French are great diplomats.
You never know!

438
00:27:45,614 --> 00:27:49,399
What a beautiful bride you have,
Amilcare and at your age…

439
00:27:49,423 --> 00:27:51,307
What, Lorè? He's not the groom!

440
00:27:51,331 --> 00:27:53,231
It's Counselor Mazzacolli!

441
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:55,360
- Which one?
- Shh! Shut up!

442
00:27:55,880 --> 00:27:58,252
Madame Countess, I am ready.

443
00:27:59,006 --> 00:28:01,001
- Anna?
- Yes, immediately.

444
00:28:01,025 --> 00:28:02,772
Come, Clotilde.

445
00:28:04,312 --> 00:28:07,533
Come with me. Easy… easy…

446
00:28:08,080 --> 00:28:09,380
Easy…

447
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:13,161
Step down… Very good, like that.

448
00:28:13,272 --> 00:28:17,256
The San Gaudio estate,
96 hectares, as written in the registry,

449
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:21,456
the Suprammonte olive grove property,
36 hectares, as written in the registry,

450
00:28:21,480 --> 00:28:25,738
the 25% share of
the Apulian wine cellars property,

451
00:28:25,762 --> 00:28:29,896
the property of the plot of land
used for grazing and husbandry

452
00:28:29,920 --> 00:28:32,281
for a total area of

453
00:28:32,305 --> 00:28:37,148
1664 hectares denominated
the Duke's Springs.

454
00:28:39,001 --> 00:28:41,484
- Counselor Mazzacolli?
- Yes?

455
00:28:41,508 --> 00:28:43,300
- The size of this park…
- Yes?

456
00:28:43,324 --> 00:28:45,816
- It's around 10,000 heads.
- Yes.

457
00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:48,286
If you like,
I'll read you the details.

458
00:28:48,310 --> 00:28:51,343
For heaven's sake,
we have all the time in the world.

459
00:28:51,751 --> 00:28:54,896
Let's read the binding clause then.

460
00:28:54,920 --> 00:28:56,446
The what, notary?

461
00:28:57,040 --> 00:29:00,776
Countess Clotilde's
entire estate rests on,

462
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:04,416
by the express testamentary will
of the late Count Emilio…

463
00:29:04,440 --> 00:29:07,184
- Rests on what?
- The restriction of usufruct

464
00:29:07,208 --> 00:29:10,974
for Countess Raimonda
Spina-Tommaselli,

465
00:29:10,998 --> 00:29:15,265
appointed as trustee and
sole administrator of the assets.

466
00:29:15,289 --> 00:29:16,589
Rests on her?

467
00:29:16,877 --> 00:29:19,754
This is true even if
Clotilde gets married?

468
00:29:20,028 --> 00:29:23,969
That possibility, in truth, wasn't
foreseen by the late count.

469
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:27,336
The matter is in the hands
of Donna Raimonda.

470
00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:30,719
You won't care about
such a detail, dear Saverio.

471
00:29:30,777 --> 00:29:34,426
If I understood correctly, what matters
to you is joining the family, right?

472
00:29:34,450 --> 00:29:37,750
And a dowry is not needed.
Just Clotilde.

473
00:29:37,774 --> 00:29:41,154
A dowry? The thought never
passed my mind, dear Raimonda.

474
00:29:41,280 --> 00:29:42,680
Where do I sign?

475
00:29:43,689 --> 00:29:45,289
Next to the crosses.

476
00:29:46,069 --> 00:29:49,216
56 signatures, Counselor.

477
00:29:49,240 --> 00:29:51,639
Knowing that, I brought my stamp.

478
00:30:00,699 --> 00:30:02,128
I have to pay!

479
00:30:02,186 --> 00:30:03,750
It's the second time!

480
00:30:03,774 --> 00:30:06,808
It's the second time she fucked me!

481
00:30:07,036 --> 00:30:08,982
I have to pay! For everything!

482
00:30:09,058 --> 00:30:11,779
- The countess…
- Save'!

483
00:30:12,040 --> 00:30:14,877
What countess?
I told you, she was born badly.

484
00:30:14,901 --> 00:30:18,374
She doesn't have any true nobility!
She has no elegance.

485
00:30:18,398 --> 00:30:21,393
She doesn't give a fuck
about the noble and the elegant!

486
00:30:21,417 --> 00:30:22,664
And she's right!

487
00:30:22,688 --> 00:30:25,358
If the first Loyola had paid
attention to elegance and nobility,

488
00:30:25,382 --> 00:30:28,456
instead of killing and robbing,
you would not be a duke!

489
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:31,587
- Saverio, don't break my family tree.
- Yes, dream of your tree!

490
00:30:31,611 --> 00:30:34,543
Instead, by God,
I want to plant my tree here!

491
00:30:34,567 --> 00:30:37,696
I don't know what tree you refer to,
but if it's what I think it is,

492
00:30:37,720 --> 00:30:41,893
you've already planted it
but without any substantial results.

493
00:30:42,615 --> 00:30:43,915
I admit that.

494
00:30:44,289 --> 00:30:45,932
For the moment.

495
00:30:46,887 --> 00:30:50,317
And after all,
you're marrying a beautiful girl!

496
00:30:50,341 --> 00:30:53,550
Maybe she has no mind
but did you see those thighs?

497
00:30:53,574 --> 00:30:55,388
What do you mean?
Did you see her?

498
00:30:55,412 --> 00:30:57,319
She's lifeless. A thing.

499
00:30:57,440 --> 00:30:59,490
Can one make love to a thing?

500
00:31:00,098 --> 00:31:03,216
I do this crap because I must save
an exceptional venture, a great idea.

501
00:31:03,240 --> 00:31:05,684
But I won't touch
that girl even with a finger!

502
00:31:05,708 --> 00:31:07,799
I'll be a father to her.

503
00:31:07,920 --> 00:31:10,257
That's right.
I'll be just like a dad.

504
00:31:10,474 --> 00:31:14,934
A dad? In the sense that you'd
like to be the mother's husband.

505
00:31:14,959 --> 00:31:16,259
Stop!

506
00:31:19,776 --> 00:31:21,526
Here, a little present.

507
00:31:22,967 --> 00:31:24,467
What's the matter?

508
00:31:24,696 --> 00:31:28,143
- There, it's no longer a little gift!
- Yes, Sir.

509
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:31,153
- But when I'm done, not a word, eh?
- Yes, Sir.

510
00:31:31,177 --> 00:31:33,877
- I don't even want to hear you.
- You won't.

511
00:31:34,744 --> 00:31:37,750
"Yes, Sir. No, Sir…" Turn around.

512
00:31:40,118 --> 00:31:41,620
What are you doing?

513
00:31:41,644 --> 00:31:44,737
Excuse me, Concettina,
but that's my fucking business.

514
00:31:44,761 --> 00:31:48,213
And mine too, if you don't mind.
Counselor, please…

515
00:31:48,323 --> 00:31:50,273
Don't think about anything.

516
00:31:56,368 --> 00:31:57,835
I'll show you!

517
00:31:58,034 --> 00:32:00,559
You don't know me.
You'll know who I am!

518
00:32:00,631 --> 00:32:03,883
No! No! I know! I know! Oh, Jesus!

519
00:32:03,907 --> 00:32:06,872
- You're Counselor Mazzacolli!
- You shut up!

520
00:32:08,185 --> 00:32:10,428
Damn slut that you are!

521
00:32:10,641 --> 00:32:12,939
Why say those nasty things to me?

522
00:32:13,128 --> 00:32:15,764
- What did I do to you?
- I don't mean you.

523
00:32:15,788 --> 00:32:18,415
I'm talking about another,
that titled whore.

524
00:32:19,122 --> 00:32:20,888
Wait, wait…

525
00:32:21,226 --> 00:32:23,376
You'll see if I don't bend you!

526
00:32:24,231 --> 00:32:27,191
I'll break you! I'll smash you!

527
00:32:27,215 --> 00:32:28,815
I'll smash you! I'll…

528
00:32:32,379 --> 00:32:33,679
I got it!

529
00:32:34,538 --> 00:32:37,709
- I've done it!
- You're wrong, Counselor, not yet!

530
00:32:37,733 --> 00:32:41,014
You shut up! I got it!
I got it, Duke!

531
00:32:41,079 --> 00:32:42,641
Duke, an idea!

532
00:32:42,970 --> 00:32:45,143
But… Counselor?

533
00:32:45,234 --> 00:32:47,125
Duke! Duke!

534
00:32:47,659 --> 00:32:48,959
Duke!

535
00:32:49,028 --> 00:32:50,752
Duke, I got it because…

536
00:32:50,776 --> 00:32:52,076
Duke!

537
00:32:52,833 --> 00:32:54,133
Duke!

538
00:32:55,586 --> 00:32:56,886
Duke!

539
00:32:57,003 --> 00:32:58,955
Duke! Duke, I got it!

540
00:32:58,979 --> 00:33:00,479
What's the matter?

541
00:33:01,181 --> 00:33:03,686
Counselor, you almost
gave me a heart attack.

542
00:33:03,710 --> 00:33:05,831
- I've screwed the countess.
- Again?

543
00:33:05,855 --> 00:33:08,733
No, I'll take everything:
the dowry and the daughter.

544
00:33:08,757 --> 00:33:12,133
Don Amilcare, I'll take it all!
All! All! All! I'll take it all!

545
00:33:12,157 --> 00:33:14,029
- How?
- How?

546
00:33:15,376 --> 00:33:16,676
First…

547
00:33:18,886 --> 00:33:20,206
Hey!

548
00:33:20,709 --> 00:33:22,109
Can you hear me?

549
00:33:22,970 --> 00:33:24,270
First:

550
00:33:25,743 --> 00:33:27,438
I'll kidnap the girl.

551
00:33:27,531 --> 00:33:28,831
Kidnap her?

552
00:33:29,800 --> 00:33:31,500
You'll compromise her!

553
00:33:31,740 --> 00:33:35,119
Sure, so I'll go to jail, I'll have to
marry her and it begins again:

554
00:33:35,143 --> 00:33:38,673
courts, fees and all that bullshit!
Don Amilcare, someone, unknown,

555
00:33:38,697 --> 00:33:41,138
- someone who must remain unknown…
- Not me!

556
00:33:41,162 --> 00:33:43,810
Of course. An unknown
must kidnap, as you've said,

557
00:33:43,834 --> 00:33:45,878
Clotilde Spina. Period.

558
00:33:48,185 --> 00:33:49,958
Second:

559
00:33:50,545 --> 00:33:53,569
The girl is found:
prayers, tears, candles

560
00:33:53,593 --> 00:33:56,944
and the bad ordeal has left her,
how shall we say, stained…

561
00:33:57,223 --> 00:33:59,188
- Compromised.
- Compromised!

562
00:33:59,284 --> 00:34:01,332
Understand? Compromised.

563
00:34:01,526 --> 00:34:05,133
Third: as the betrothed,
I am offended in my dignity,

564
00:34:05,158 --> 00:34:07,300
- in my honor.
- Right!

565
00:34:07,325 --> 00:34:10,458
At that point, I might back off,
"I don't buy second-hand stuff!"

566
00:34:10,483 --> 00:34:12,891
But instead… Fourth:

567
00:34:14,396 --> 00:34:15,693
I am generous.

568
00:34:17,053 --> 00:34:19,265
I'll marry the girl anyway.

569
00:34:20,182 --> 00:34:21,482
But…

570
00:34:24,106 --> 00:34:27,675
You're fantastic!
What a brain you have!

571
00:34:27,828 --> 00:34:29,727
You reason like us!

572
00:34:29,944 --> 00:34:31,244
Drink.

573
00:34:31,385 --> 00:34:36,121
And you have the subtlety to take
her all the same, even damaged!

574
00:34:36,145 --> 00:34:39,826
And they can't deny you
either the girl or the dowry.

575
00:34:39,850 --> 00:34:42,481
Well, "damaged", so to speak.
It doesn't need to go that far.

576
00:34:42,505 --> 00:34:45,955
No, it's necessary, it is.
And the medical examination?

577
00:34:48,425 --> 00:34:51,519
- What medical examination?
- We always do a medical exam.

578
00:34:51,543 --> 00:34:53,143
We're no fools here!

579
00:34:54,843 --> 00:34:57,415
She must be damaged goods.

580
00:34:57,638 --> 00:35:00,665
If not, it won't work.
Have someone do it.

581
00:35:00,689 --> 00:35:02,321
Christ, not a cuckold!

582
00:35:02,345 --> 00:35:04,801
Save', it's either
cuckold or nothing!

583
00:35:04,825 --> 00:35:07,144
After all, what is a horn?

584
00:35:07,168 --> 00:35:10,289
A horn jewel,
payable to the bearer!

585
00:35:10,313 --> 00:35:12,829
A fine pile of billions!

586
00:35:13,185 --> 00:35:15,908
Or do the service yourself.

587
00:35:16,058 --> 00:35:17,582
Out of the question.

588
00:35:18,105 --> 00:35:19,555
I am a gentleman.

589
00:35:26,465 --> 00:35:27,765
Damaged!

590
00:35:30,456 --> 00:35:33,025
This is the Duke of Loyola's property,
the perfect place.

591
00:35:33,049 --> 00:35:34,793
A place above all suspicion.

592
00:35:34,817 --> 00:35:38,213
Hidden by the trees, out of the way…
Then look inside. Come!

593
00:35:40,474 --> 00:35:42,995
Seems the Loyola family's
misfortunes began here.

594
00:35:43,019 --> 00:35:45,137
- It was a famous fire.
- Bravo.

595
00:35:45,366 --> 00:35:47,367
A beautiful ceiling, classic.

596
00:35:47,783 --> 00:35:49,644
And if this works out…

597
00:35:50,139 --> 00:35:52,488
I'll let you restore it all. Come.

598
00:35:53,837 --> 00:35:55,487
The bedroom survived.

599
00:35:57,948 --> 00:36:01,270
- Ah, a wedding favor!
- A bed for three, eh?

600
00:36:02,315 --> 00:36:03,960
Hey! The van?

601
00:36:04,755 --> 00:36:06,125
Bravo.

602
00:36:06,299 --> 00:36:09,128
- And what's in there?
- The toilet. Go on.

603
00:36:13,377 --> 00:36:18,226
Who knows how many beautiful
aristocratic asses have washed in here!

604
00:36:25,635 --> 00:36:26,935
Mazzacolli,

605
00:36:30,835 --> 00:36:32,785
I want my share right away.

606
00:36:33,443 --> 00:36:35,008
I'm risking a lot.

607
00:36:38,710 --> 00:36:40,010
Millions.

608
00:36:41,675 --> 00:36:44,130
On the very evening
you bring her here.

609
00:36:44,504 --> 00:36:47,436
But let's not screw up, Peppe.

610
00:36:48,995 --> 00:36:50,395
The Spina House.

611
00:36:50,927 --> 00:36:52,277
The side door.

612
00:36:54,395 --> 00:36:55,695
The stairs.

613
00:37:10,795 --> 00:37:12,480
So we agree, dear Don Liguori?

614
00:37:12,504 --> 00:37:15,051
A private ceremony.
Maybe late afternoon.

615
00:37:15,075 --> 00:37:17,105
Even late at night, dear Saverio.

616
00:37:17,129 --> 00:37:19,451
Discretion is the golden rule
of Holy Mother Church.

617
00:37:19,475 --> 00:37:20,775
Excellent.

618
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:28,526
Our notary has quite the appetite?

619
00:37:28,550 --> 00:37:32,447
Yes but only at the table,
dear Saverio. Only at the table!

620
00:38:12,755 --> 00:38:15,345
He's coming! He's coming!

621
00:38:20,555 --> 00:38:23,749
Blessed Archangel Michael,
come and do justice!

622
00:38:23,773 --> 00:38:28,091
Blind him! Blind the devil!
The ugly beast!

623
00:38:28,115 --> 00:38:29,415
My flower…

624
00:38:30,600 --> 00:38:33,196
What is it? You can't sleep?

625
00:38:33,675 --> 00:38:36,525
You understand that
no one's there, right?

626
00:38:36,549 --> 00:38:41,022
But don't be afraid.
Your nanny's here who loves you.

627
00:38:53,755 --> 00:38:57,637
You want a drink?
Then you'll make a lake in your bed!

628
00:39:03,173 --> 00:39:04,877
Alright then.

629
00:39:07,075 --> 00:39:09,924
It doesn't matter.
It doesn't. It doesn't.

630
00:39:10,195 --> 00:39:12,485
Go pee pee, dear. Pee pee!

631
00:39:12,958 --> 00:39:14,408
Beautiful flower.

632
00:39:14,577 --> 00:39:16,008
Good!

633
00:39:21,143 --> 00:39:22,753
How beautiful!

634
00:39:37,357 --> 00:39:38,827
They're burning him!

635
00:39:38,851 --> 00:39:41,509
But the devil doesn't give a shit.

636
00:39:45,572 --> 00:39:46,872
Go to sleep.

637
00:40:08,188 --> 00:40:12,419
"The gentleman wants
to eat the flower".

638
00:40:13,486 --> 00:40:14,971
Come, go to sleep…

639
00:40:23,235 --> 00:40:26,293
Sleep, beautiful flower, come now.

640
00:40:46,875 --> 00:40:49,611
- Look! Look at that!
- Wonderful!

641
00:40:49,635 --> 00:40:53,005
It's over the top but satisfying.

642
00:40:54,043 --> 00:40:55,769
Extraordinary!

643
00:40:58,275 --> 00:41:01,891
- Is there anything wrong?
- A call from home.

644
00:41:17,435 --> 00:41:18,761
Barbarians!

645
00:41:18,785 --> 00:41:21,694
Barbarians! Uncivilized!
Cowards! Scoundrels!

646
00:41:21,795 --> 00:41:23,865
They would stop at nothing!

647
00:41:23,889 --> 00:41:26,211
And what the heck,
she's a poor sick baby!

648
00:41:26,235 --> 00:41:27,717
What does she have?

649
00:41:27,741 --> 00:41:30,010
- Shut up!
- And nobody heard a thing?

650
00:41:31,521 --> 00:41:33,609
- Go on, speak!
- I…

651
00:41:37,075 --> 00:41:41,411
At 9:00 Gaetano locked the door,
then came back to watch TV.

652
00:41:41,435 --> 00:41:44,763
We didn't hear anything.
The others didn't either,

653
00:41:44,787 --> 00:41:46,743
until Anna called me.

654
00:41:46,884 --> 00:41:49,851
- Was any door forced open?
- No, Ma'am.

655
00:41:49,875 --> 00:41:52,706
- Stop crying, you old crone!
- Yes…

656
00:41:52,875 --> 00:41:56,286
But if this monster, this assassin,
falls into my hands, I will…

657
00:41:56,310 --> 00:41:59,634
I'll break him! I'll break him in two!
I'll strangle, destroy him!

658
00:41:59,658 --> 00:42:02,159
Come, Lorè, come. Let's pray.

659
00:42:02,235 --> 00:42:04,260
- Come.
- Poor Clo…

660
00:42:04,284 --> 00:42:07,764
- Please, be calm, I beg you.
- Calm?

661
00:42:08,595 --> 00:42:11,451
Calm? But how can you be calm?

662
00:42:11,475 --> 00:42:15,071
- I marvel, you're the mother!
- That's right, I am! Got it?

663
00:42:15,197 --> 00:42:17,883
But don't you realize
they kidnapped her? Kidnapped!

664
00:42:17,907 --> 00:42:21,097
- She's in danger… - And why do
you think they kidnapped her?

665
00:42:21,217 --> 00:42:25,275
Because she's worth money.
And what's worth money is valuable.

666
00:42:25,640 --> 00:42:27,240
That's why I'm calm.

667
00:42:27,541 --> 00:42:28,891
I'm scared but…

668
00:42:30,460 --> 00:42:31,760
I'm calm.

669
00:42:31,892 --> 00:42:35,348
You have no choice but to pay.

670
00:42:35,875 --> 00:42:41,448
In this shitty region,
kidnapping has become big business!

671
00:42:42,355 --> 00:42:44,298
I can't take it anymore.

672
00:42:46,223 --> 00:42:48,172
- What are you doing?
- Calling the police.

673
00:42:48,196 --> 00:42:50,089
You're not calling anybody!

674
00:42:50,113 --> 00:42:52,788
- I don't agree.
- You still haven't got it, Saverio.

675
00:42:52,812 --> 00:42:55,611
Nothing has happened here. Got it?

676
00:42:55,635 --> 00:42:58,860
Clotilde's in there, in her room!
Everybody got that?

677
00:42:58,915 --> 00:43:02,038
- She's just sick with measles.
You got that, Anna? - Yes.

678
00:43:02,062 --> 00:43:03,930
And she must remain isolated!

679
00:43:03,954 --> 00:43:07,481
- Everybody got that? Do you two?
- Yes, yes!

680
00:43:07,595 --> 00:43:08,968
You too, Saverio.

681
00:43:08,992 --> 00:43:11,931
Remember that you're about to marry.
You're a happy man.

682
00:43:11,955 --> 00:43:14,497
So then smile. Smile!

683
00:43:14,915 --> 00:43:17,734
Everybody smile! Smile!

684
00:43:17,758 --> 00:43:20,669
Hurray! Long live the newlyweds!

685
00:43:27,515 --> 00:43:30,084
What are you doing here?
Did Peppe phone?

686
00:43:30,897 --> 00:43:32,597
- She's here.
- Peppe?

687
00:43:33,275 --> 00:43:36,111
- She. She's in the cellar.
- Clotilde!

688
00:43:42,319 --> 00:43:45,005
- Why didn't you take her to the cottage?
- It was impossible.

689
00:43:45,029 --> 00:43:46,863
You crazy?
We'll all get in trouble!

690
00:43:46,887 --> 00:43:49,771
I'm not crazy! I was about
to be taken by the carabinieri.

691
00:43:49,795 --> 00:43:52,390
So I came back and
chose to go somewhere safer.

692
00:43:52,414 --> 00:43:54,879
And I'm the only one taking risks!

693
00:43:55,435 --> 00:43:56,943
And now you…

694
00:43:57,226 --> 00:43:59,376
do your job and let me do mine.

695
00:44:00,115 --> 00:44:03,955
Now, if you take Concetta with you,
I'll do it and finish my part.

696
00:44:03,979 --> 00:44:07,211
- Get your hands off, Mazzacolli!
- Listen well, Surveyor!

697
00:44:07,235 --> 00:44:11,036
You take it down a notch and
get the fuck out of here! Got it?

698
00:44:11,195 --> 00:44:13,245
You'll do "it" when I say so.

699
00:44:16,275 --> 00:44:17,575
Alright.

700
00:44:18,355 --> 00:44:21,634
- If you want, tomorrow
I'll bring her to the cottage. - OK.

701
00:44:22,595 --> 00:44:26,825
But keep calling me "Sir",
because I can hear you better that way.

702
00:44:36,675 --> 00:44:39,291
What are you doing?
Have we all gone nuts?

703
00:44:39,315 --> 00:44:42,651
- I'm putting her to sleep.
- Is this a sleeping pill?

704
00:44:42,675 --> 00:44:45,336
Anna does this every night
to get her to sleep.

705
00:44:45,360 --> 00:44:47,571
- I saw her do it, I swear!
- Really?

706
00:44:47,595 --> 00:44:49,655
It's called fingering.

707
00:44:49,826 --> 00:44:52,978
Get out and make me a chamomile,
else my head will explode.

708
00:44:53,002 --> 00:44:55,252
- Get out!
- Yes, Sir, right away.

709
00:45:02,075 --> 00:45:03,798
Clotilde…

710
00:45:05,056 --> 00:45:06,356
Yes?

711
00:45:06,675 --> 00:45:08,255
Clotildina…

712
00:45:08,893 --> 00:45:10,283
Clotildina!

713
00:45:11,075 --> 00:45:13,194
Now, Clotildina,

714
00:45:13,218 --> 00:45:16,932
like a good little girl
goes beddy-bye.

715
00:45:23,515 --> 00:45:25,165
Hey, little countess.

716
00:45:27,515 --> 00:45:30,175
No, for heaven's sake!
Here, suck. Good.

717
00:45:30,875 --> 00:45:32,810
Just look what I…

718
00:45:32,834 --> 00:45:38,132
But tomorrow, Daddy will buy you
a nice bottle and you can suck that.

719
00:45:53,875 --> 00:45:56,012
No. No, stop, please.

720
00:45:56,036 --> 00:45:59,109
Clotilde, please stop. Oh, my god.

721
00:46:02,515 --> 00:46:04,237
Are you an idiot?

722
00:46:04,635 --> 00:46:05,935
I mean, sorry…

723
00:46:08,639 --> 00:46:11,417
Shut up! You'll wake up
the whole neighborhood!

724
00:46:11,474 --> 00:46:13,722
What are you doing? No! No!

725
00:46:13,746 --> 00:46:16,777
Pl… please!
Clo, what are you doing?

726
00:46:17,595 --> 00:46:19,164
Clo! No!

727
00:46:20,435 --> 00:46:22,659
Let go of me! What are you…?

728
00:46:22,715 --> 00:46:24,015
Please!

729
00:46:24,635 --> 00:46:27,711
No, Clo… Clo, please!

730
00:46:27,915 --> 00:46:29,817
Just stop it!

731
00:46:35,355 --> 00:46:36,655
Clotilde…

732
00:46:37,995 --> 00:46:40,671
Clo… No, Clotilde…

733
00:46:41,115 --> 00:46:42,415
Listen…

734
00:46:44,472 --> 00:46:47,388
Please, I beg you, Clo… Clotilde…

735
00:46:48,224 --> 00:46:50,263
No… my… no…

736
00:46:55,597 --> 00:46:57,845
I am flesh too.

737
00:47:06,955 --> 00:47:08,375
Clo…

738
00:47:09,955 --> 00:47:11,932
No… I…

739
00:47:14,035 --> 00:47:15,455
You…

740
00:47:16,115 --> 00:47:17,615
you are raping me!

741
00:48:10,115 --> 00:48:12,707
Counselor, damn it, it's cold.

742
00:48:12,782 --> 00:48:14,482
Want me to heat it up?

743
00:48:14,706 --> 00:48:16,156
What do you mean?

744
00:48:16,287 --> 00:48:17,587
The chamomile.

745
00:48:18,237 --> 00:48:20,565
Yes, I need more than chamomile.

746
00:48:27,795 --> 00:48:31,197
You stay down here tonight.
Watch her. Stay with her. Got it?

747
00:48:40,640 --> 00:48:41,940
There.

748
00:48:42,462 --> 00:48:43,864
That's enough.

749
00:48:56,494 --> 00:48:59,434
Just like she was inside it.
Got it?

750
00:48:59,458 --> 00:49:01,800
What do I do now?

751
00:49:01,824 --> 00:49:04,762
- What do I do now?
- Jesus, give me patience!

752
00:49:04,890 --> 00:49:09,011
What do you do every morning?
Open the blinds, idiot! Move it!

753
00:49:11,195 --> 00:49:14,077
Everything must look
normal from the outside.

754
00:49:16,614 --> 00:49:19,202
- And now?
- Sit down, stupid!

755
00:49:19,226 --> 00:49:22,197
Tell her fairy tales.
Do what you've always done!

756
00:49:22,882 --> 00:49:25,974
- Don't make me curse.
- Then the little girl

757
00:49:26,058 --> 00:49:28,302
looked out the window.

758
00:49:29,905 --> 00:49:32,758
- Hey, you must be up to this, got it?
- I can't…

759
00:49:33,026 --> 00:49:34,252
Come on.

760
00:49:34,276 --> 00:49:37,948
How come nobody woke me up?
Oh, Jesus, how I slept.

761
00:49:38,275 --> 00:49:41,190
Lisetta, did you like
the theater last night?

762
00:49:41,214 --> 00:49:44,576
- All that confusion!
- Yes.

763
00:49:44,640 --> 00:49:48,797
And she screamed
at her sister below,

764
00:49:48,821 --> 00:49:51,896
"Little sister! Little sister!

765
00:49:51,920 --> 00:49:54,296
If she doesn't come back
I'll go crazy!

766
00:49:55,395 --> 00:49:57,473
Shut up! Are you all crazy?

767
00:49:57,837 --> 00:50:00,429
I told you to shut up!
They can hear in the street!

768
00:50:00,453 --> 00:50:03,539
Enough! Calm down!
Go to Alfonsa!

769
00:50:03,933 --> 00:50:06,891
You want everyone to hear you?
Get out of there!

770
00:50:06,915 --> 00:50:08,920
No! Do what I tell you!

771
00:50:09,272 --> 00:50:11,916
We've supplies for at least a week.
Then we'll see.

772
00:50:11,940 --> 00:50:15,826
There's a stove over there.
Bring some underwear, shirts…

773
00:50:20,901 --> 00:50:22,201
Well?

774
00:50:23,437 --> 00:50:26,525
What? She's listening to music.
You don't move from here.

775
00:50:26,549 --> 00:50:29,716
When I'm not here, don't leave
her alone for even a second, OK?

776
00:50:29,800 --> 00:50:31,100
Yes, Sir.

777
00:51:06,090 --> 00:51:09,476
And don't spend it right away.
That's how fools get caught.

778
00:51:10,068 --> 00:51:11,368
By whom?

779
00:51:11,695 --> 00:51:13,845
No one's looking for me, right?

780
00:51:14,097 --> 00:51:15,397
For now.

781
00:51:19,944 --> 00:51:21,210
Well?

782
00:51:21,234 --> 00:51:22,934
What more do you want?

783
00:51:23,954 --> 00:51:25,254
To do that…

784
00:51:25,724 --> 00:51:27,124
which I must do.

785
00:51:28,781 --> 00:51:30,481
It's no longer needed.

786
00:51:30,557 --> 00:51:32,128
Are you disappointed?

787
00:51:32,231 --> 00:51:35,405
A bit. It was the only
appetizing side of this.

788
00:51:35,570 --> 00:51:38,307
- Why? Money doesn't amuse you?
- Yes.

789
00:51:40,738 --> 00:51:42,038
Hey…

790
00:51:42,255 --> 00:51:43,857
How was the girl?

791
00:51:44,425 --> 00:51:45,825
Was it worth it?

792
00:51:45,931 --> 00:51:49,220
Remember what you've left to do
and try not to do anything stupid.

793
00:51:49,244 --> 00:51:50,928
At 6:00 sharp!

794
00:51:52,225 --> 00:51:53,525
Alright?

795
00:51:54,587 --> 00:51:56,293
At 6:00 sharp!

796
00:51:56,317 --> 00:51:58,901
Always at Sir Counselor's orders!

797
00:51:59,039 --> 00:52:01,040
Hail, Queen, mother of mercy…

798
00:52:03,897 --> 00:52:06,782
We resort to you,
the exiled children of Eve.

799
00:52:08,882 --> 00:52:12,541
Moaning and weeping
in this vale of tears.

800
00:52:14,905 --> 00:52:17,203
Don't worry, dear Raimonda.

801
00:52:17,258 --> 00:52:21,230
I also sent Concettina to her village.
I gave her a holiday. You never know.

802
00:52:21,390 --> 00:52:22,845
The girl is quick.

803
00:52:22,869 --> 00:52:25,488
She would've ended up
sniffing out something.

804
00:52:36,082 --> 00:52:39,487
Donna Raimonda,
the clock is correct, right?

805
00:52:40,724 --> 00:52:44,114
Don Amilcare, why should you care
if the clock is fast or slow?

806
00:52:44,138 --> 00:52:45,964
Nothing. I was just asking.

807
00:52:46,130 --> 00:52:47,932
Saverio, please.

808
00:52:48,340 --> 00:52:49,719
I understand that…

809
00:52:49,743 --> 00:52:53,324
I can't take it anymore either.
My nerves are shot.

810
00:53:00,063 --> 00:53:03,637
- Hello?
- <i>Silence. Only I will speak</i>

811
00:53:03,661 --> 00:53:06,452
<i>and just once.</i>

812
00:53:06,507 --> 00:53:10,899
<i>Clotilde is fine.
You'll have her back soon.</i>

813
00:53:10,923 --> 00:53:15,474
<i>We will send the instructions
to Counselor Mazzacolli.</i>

814
00:53:15,498 --> 00:53:18,229
<i>We will deal only with him.</i>

815
00:53:19,863 --> 00:53:21,966
Hello? One moment! Hello?

816
00:53:28,631 --> 00:53:30,991
No, no, Raimonda. I can't!

817
00:53:31,092 --> 00:53:34,735
- It's a responsibility that I don't…
- Saverio, you heard him, right?

818
00:53:34,839 --> 00:53:37,939
- He only wants to deal with you.
- No, please. No!

819
00:53:38,663 --> 00:53:40,374
I'm afraid of messing up…

820
00:53:40,398 --> 00:53:44,025
I know myself. I'd have no control.
With animals like that I'd kill!

821
00:53:45,951 --> 00:53:47,171
Saverio…

822
00:53:47,195 --> 00:53:50,103
You've heard it all, right?
What should we do?

823
00:53:50,905 --> 00:53:54,713
Saverio, they spoke clearly.
They'll only show up for you.

824
00:53:54,825 --> 00:53:58,182
When they show up, I'll tell them
I don't want to be involved.

825
00:53:58,865 --> 00:54:01,945
And that they should go
directly to you, Donna Raimonda.

826
00:54:03,905 --> 00:54:05,555
Try to understand me…

827
00:54:05,789 --> 00:54:07,389
it's for Clo's sake.

828
00:54:28,945 --> 00:54:30,245
Saverio!

829
00:54:32,185 --> 00:54:33,485
Saverio…

830
00:54:36,905 --> 00:54:38,783
Thanks to the Madonna!

831
00:54:40,036 --> 00:54:42,757
Here, eat, my beauty! Eat.

832
00:54:43,985 --> 00:54:46,475
If you don't eat,
you'll starve, you know?

833
00:54:47,002 --> 00:54:49,668
- Eat, stupid!
- What's the matter?

834
00:54:49,896 --> 00:54:51,649
- Is that how you do it?
- She won't eat.

835
00:54:51,673 --> 00:54:53,924
She hasn't touched
anything all day.

836
00:54:54,065 --> 00:54:57,635
- Here, beauty. Eat, it's good!
- Go away.

837
00:54:58,105 --> 00:55:01,960
- Check that the shades are closed.
- I've closed them.

838
00:55:02,973 --> 00:55:04,569
And now…

839
00:55:05,069 --> 00:55:07,562
Papa will give you the good pap.

840
00:55:09,865 --> 00:55:11,615
Open your mouth, go on.

841
00:55:12,385 --> 00:55:13,685
Open…

842
00:55:18,465 --> 00:55:19,974
Very good.

843
00:55:21,825 --> 00:55:23,125
See?

844
00:55:27,865 --> 00:55:29,665
What? Don't you like it?

845
00:55:37,594 --> 00:55:38,894
Let me try it.

846
00:55:40,730 --> 00:55:43,561
She's right!
It's crap! It tastes like nothing!

847
00:55:43,585 --> 00:55:46,797
You forgot to bring salt, Counselor!
Is that my fault?

848
00:55:47,905 --> 00:55:50,839
I'll bring it tomorrow.
Give her something else to eat.

849
00:55:50,863 --> 00:55:52,841
- Is everything else fine?
- Yes.

850
00:55:52,865 --> 00:55:55,525
- Oh, sorry, Counselor.
- Stay still.

851
00:55:55,855 --> 00:55:58,106
I've already changed her
3 times since morning.

852
00:55:58,130 --> 00:56:00,156
She pees more than
a platoon of soldiers.

853
00:56:00,180 --> 00:56:01,480
Shut up.

854
00:56:06,630 --> 00:56:09,116
Eat, you asshole!

855
00:56:13,786 --> 00:56:17,787
The same voice. He said to look in
the trunk of the car and hung up.

856
00:56:17,811 --> 00:56:20,198
The lock was forced
and this was inside.

857
00:56:20,372 --> 00:56:23,263
"Prepare a billion
in small bills now."

858
00:56:28,585 --> 00:56:30,483
They won't go easy on us, eh?

859
00:56:33,652 --> 00:56:37,089
Are you really sure you don't want
to put this in the police's hands?

860
00:56:37,113 --> 00:56:39,378
No! Don't insist, please.

861
00:56:42,665 --> 00:56:44,153
It's not little.

862
00:56:44,177 --> 00:56:47,469
Not even for the Spina
but we'll cough up the billion

863
00:56:47,785 --> 00:56:49,985
Anything to save Clo.

864
00:56:50,705 --> 00:56:52,005
Anything.

865
00:57:09,545 --> 00:57:11,921
She gets messy so quickly.

866
00:57:13,225 --> 00:57:14,525
There we go.

867
00:57:37,225 --> 00:57:40,946
Now we'll put on a clean shirt,
all clean.

868
00:57:43,665 --> 00:57:45,639
Give me a clean shirt.

869
00:57:46,145 --> 00:57:48,166
Any will do. That one.

870
00:57:51,883 --> 00:57:53,407
The underwear?

871
00:57:53,431 --> 00:57:55,556
They're all hanging out to dry.

872
00:58:00,865 --> 00:58:03,354
Concettina, you do it.
I don't have time.

873
00:58:04,065 --> 00:58:05,565
And brush her hair!

874
00:58:17,865 --> 00:58:20,466
Hello, Emerald Springs.
Who's speaking?

875
00:58:20,490 --> 00:58:23,269
- This is Countess Spina.
- Is that you, Countess?

876
00:58:23,357 --> 00:58:26,594
Excuse me. I…
Yes, I'm Surveyor Colizzi.

877
00:58:26,945 --> 00:58:30,328
- You want Mazzacolli?
- Yes, Counselor Mazzacolli, please.

878
00:58:30,352 --> 00:58:33,238
He hasn't returned yet.
One moment!

879
00:58:34,545 --> 00:58:37,496
Sorry, I thought that was him
but I was wrong.

880
00:58:38,029 --> 00:58:41,533
Don't worry.
I'll report that you called.

881
00:58:41,557 --> 00:58:42,857
Three times!

882
00:58:44,811 --> 00:58:49,174
And Bregonzo called from Rome,
Di Corato and the assessor of Bari!

883
00:58:49,425 --> 00:58:50,725
Counselor!

884
00:59:09,401 --> 00:59:12,200
The widdle bath is bye-byes.
Bye-byes!

885
00:59:18,585 --> 00:59:22,155
All nice and clean! Perfumed!

886
00:59:24,105 --> 00:59:25,846
Splash!

887
00:59:26,745 --> 00:59:28,421
Let's dry off!

888
00:59:28,564 --> 00:59:29,914
The shoulders,

889
00:59:30,496 --> 00:59:32,641
the widdle titties,

890
00:59:34,812 --> 00:59:36,304
the tummy,

891
00:59:37,145 --> 00:59:39,634
and the lovely widdle pussy!

892
00:59:46,105 --> 00:59:47,405
Up!

893
00:59:50,265 --> 00:59:51,715
The widdle heiny…

894
01:00:06,545 --> 01:00:09,695
- Please give the suitcase
to the gentleman. - Here.

895
01:00:12,265 --> 01:00:14,276
Countess, if I may.

896
01:00:15,305 --> 01:00:17,786
Thank you, Countess. My respects.

897
01:00:41,745 --> 01:00:43,095
Do you have it?

898
01:00:48,065 --> 01:00:49,815
- If you want.
- Yes.

899
01:00:52,053 --> 01:00:53,353
Daddy!

900
01:00:53,705 --> 01:00:55,005
Daddy!

901
01:00:55,385 --> 01:00:58,037
You repeat it too: pa-pa.

902
01:00:58,649 --> 01:00:59,949
Pa-pa.

903
01:01:05,266 --> 01:01:07,330
Good. And now…

904
01:01:07,823 --> 01:01:10,121
Listen up, eh? Pay attention.

905
01:01:10,745 --> 01:01:12,045
Say…

906
01:01:12,687 --> 01:01:15,353
screw me.

907
01:01:15,745 --> 01:01:17,295
Did you understand?

908
01:01:17,350 --> 01:01:19,770
No, don't get distracted. Say it.

909
01:01:20,661 --> 01:01:23,210
Screw me.

910
01:01:28,945 --> 01:01:30,595
Well done! Well done!

911
01:01:44,717 --> 01:01:46,117
What's going on here?

912
01:01:46,141 --> 01:01:48,841
Am I teaching you
or are you teaching me?

913
01:01:55,849 --> 01:01:57,149
Hey!

914
01:01:58,625 --> 01:02:00,769
That's a slutty look, eh?

915
01:02:03,825 --> 01:02:07,494
Yes, there's nothing else to do.
My love…

916
01:02:07,945 --> 01:02:09,245
My love…

917
01:02:09,945 --> 01:02:11,245
Darling…

918
01:02:12,998 --> 01:02:14,960
Daddy's widdle slut.

919
01:02:16,705 --> 01:02:18,836
But I do want to, you know?

920
01:02:20,927 --> 01:02:22,589
I want it too.

921
01:02:22,613 --> 01:02:25,603
Yes, we've already done it,
haven't we?

922
01:02:30,545 --> 01:02:32,921
God, how beautiful you are.

923
01:02:34,265 --> 01:02:36,321
You are so beautiful.

924
01:02:57,575 --> 01:02:59,470
And I envy you, I swear!

925
01:02:59,581 --> 01:03:01,985
You have discovered
the feminine ideal.

926
01:03:02,009 --> 01:03:04,320
A pure object, dear Saverio.

927
01:03:04,381 --> 01:03:06,156
Pepper, please.

928
01:03:06,400 --> 01:03:08,668
All the benefits and no hassles.

929
01:03:08,692 --> 01:03:12,489
She screws and doesn't talk.
She doesn't think and doesn't bitch.

930
01:03:12,607 --> 01:03:14,740
The perfect sex slave!

931
01:03:15,825 --> 01:03:17,125
Oh, no.

932
01:03:17,406 --> 01:03:19,455
It's not like that, Don Amilcare.

933
01:03:19,824 --> 01:03:21,724
It's like I've discovered…

934
01:03:22,745 --> 01:03:26,361
It's as if Clotilde had taught me
a new way of making love.

935
01:03:26,385 --> 01:03:28,413
Without guilt, without sin…

936
01:03:28,437 --> 01:03:30,445
Now we're philosophizing.

937
01:03:30,469 --> 01:03:33,278
No, it's not philosophy, it's life!

938
01:03:36,705 --> 01:03:39,325
I'm in paradise with Clo.

939
01:03:39,665 --> 01:03:41,198
That paradise lost…

940
01:03:41,222 --> 01:03:43,395
- In monthly installments.
- I like it.

941
01:03:44,025 --> 01:03:47,391
I am happy.
Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes!

942
01:03:47,415 --> 01:03:49,816
Yes! Yes! Yes! I'm happy!

943
01:03:50,745 --> 01:03:52,045
Happy…

944
01:03:54,375 --> 01:03:55,675
Save'!

945
01:03:55,727 --> 01:03:57,475
You frighten me.

946
01:05:13,105 --> 01:05:14,405
Hi.

947
01:05:16,505 --> 01:05:18,105
Daddy's leaving now.

948
01:05:19,105 --> 01:05:20,405
Bye.

949
01:05:21,025 --> 01:05:22,325
Bye bye.

950
01:05:32,385 --> 01:05:34,931
No, hush. Be good, eh? Bye.

951
01:05:35,039 --> 01:05:36,339
Bye.

952
01:07:05,126 --> 01:07:06,576
Either I'm crazy…

953
01:07:07,339 --> 01:07:09,044
or everybody else is.

954
01:07:10,145 --> 01:07:12,761
Here's what you need for tomorrow.

955
01:07:12,785 --> 01:07:14,827
If the county calls again,
what do I say?

956
01:07:14,851 --> 01:07:17,475
To stop bitching.
And if they create difficulties,

957
01:07:17,499 --> 01:07:19,585
authorize Di Corato
to name Countess Spina.

958
01:07:19,609 --> 01:07:23,081
When they know she's in the deal,
they'll shit themselves.

959
01:07:23,105 --> 01:07:26,562
By the way, if Donna Raimonda calls,
tell her that…

960
01:07:26,907 --> 01:07:28,876
that I'm not back yet. Alright?

961
01:07:28,945 --> 01:07:31,027
- Counselor!
- What is it?

962
01:07:32,625 --> 01:07:35,976
Counselor, that billion,
seeing that it's there,

963
01:07:36,104 --> 01:07:39,659
why don't we settle for that
and go and enjoy it in peace?

964
01:07:39,683 --> 01:07:41,361
In peace? And after?

965
01:07:41,847 --> 01:07:45,797
I don't steal, Surveyor Colizzi!
I'm not a chicken thief like you.

966
01:07:45,821 --> 01:07:50,367
I'm a businessman and that's worth
way more than your measly billion.

967
01:07:50,391 --> 01:07:51,891
Do you understand?

968
01:07:52,102 --> 01:07:53,402
Very well.

969
01:07:53,829 --> 01:07:55,588
So what are we waiting for?

970
01:07:55,612 --> 01:07:58,124
Let's give her daughter back
and close this deal.

971
01:07:58,148 --> 01:08:01,322
What are we waiting for,
Counselor Mazzacolli?

972
01:08:02,438 --> 01:08:05,921
We're waiting for me to decide. OK?

973
01:08:06,748 --> 01:08:09,644
And turn that bullshit off,
because I pay the bills!

974
01:08:09,668 --> 01:08:10,968
I pay!

975
01:08:23,065 --> 01:08:24,365
Amen.

976
01:08:27,985 --> 01:08:30,942
And above all,
don't break my balls!

977
01:08:31,015 --> 01:08:32,315
There.

978
01:08:39,692 --> 01:08:41,192
Spanish style, eh?

979
01:08:46,985 --> 01:08:50,169
Fee, fi, fo, fum!
I smell the blood of an Englishman!

980
01:08:50,193 --> 01:08:54,115
There is or there has been,
I can smell it on their skin.

981
01:08:59,003 --> 01:09:00,863
Jump, little horse!

982
01:09:18,964 --> 01:09:22,013
Hey! Hey!

983
01:09:22,465 --> 01:09:24,203
Hey, but…

984
01:09:26,884 --> 01:09:29,122
But are you crazy?

985
01:09:31,025 --> 01:09:33,957
And yes you are crazy.
Look at this stuff.

986
01:09:33,981 --> 01:09:35,616
I'll let it dry.

987
01:09:42,265 --> 01:09:44,732
Well?
You not going to poo, are you?

988
01:09:44,865 --> 01:09:47,987
On the pillows… No, wait!
Concetta, the chamber pot!

989
01:09:48,105 --> 01:09:50,321
Wait. No, no, wait!

990
01:09:52,785 --> 01:09:55,086
Well, in for a penny,
in for a pound.

991
01:09:55,905 --> 01:09:59,444
Clo, now I like everything
about you. Everything!

992
01:10:01,345 --> 01:10:04,081
Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes!

993
01:10:04,105 --> 01:10:07,334
It is a good thing! Human!

994
01:10:07,865 --> 01:10:10,775
Right! Yes, gentle people, alright?

995
01:10:11,220 --> 01:10:13,776
And please, don't break my balls!

996
01:10:36,284 --> 01:10:37,584
Saverio!

997
01:10:37,867 --> 01:10:39,817
Where have you been hiding?

998
01:10:40,014 --> 01:10:42,807
You haven't been in touch
for 2 days or given any news!

999
01:10:42,831 --> 01:10:45,438
- Why?
- Where did you just come from?

1000
01:10:47,026 --> 01:10:49,125
- I don't have a shirt on.
- I see.

1001
01:10:52,745 --> 01:10:54,045
Saverio,

1002
01:10:54,453 --> 01:10:56,053
what does this mean?

1003
01:10:56,119 --> 01:10:57,419
What happened?

1004
01:10:57,665 --> 01:10:59,035
Nothing.

1005
01:10:59,109 --> 01:11:02,494
- Nothing happened.
- No, you must explain.

1006
01:11:02,575 --> 01:11:04,870
- Do you trust me or not?
- I don't know.

1007
01:11:04,894 --> 01:11:07,322
- Great! Have we come to this?
- We have!

1008
01:11:07,346 --> 01:11:09,435
- Then you want to know?
- I do.

1009
01:11:09,516 --> 01:11:12,046
You want to know the truth?
Want me to tell you all?

1010
01:11:12,070 --> 01:11:13,370
Yes.

1011
01:11:14,145 --> 01:11:15,595
I won't tell you.

1012
01:11:16,188 --> 01:11:17,638
I won't tell you!

1013
01:11:19,705 --> 01:11:21,005
Alright?

1014
01:11:43,905 --> 01:11:46,105
Promise me you'll never grow up.

1015
01:11:46,785 --> 01:11:48,485
My little, little one.

1016
01:11:50,385 --> 01:11:52,229
Don't come to this world.

1017
01:11:52,253 --> 01:11:53,953
They don't understand.

1018
01:11:56,980 --> 01:11:59,106
I want to come where you are.

1019
01:12:00,985 --> 01:12:02,685
I want to be with you.

1020
01:12:03,665 --> 01:12:05,682
You and me alone.

1021
01:12:08,465 --> 01:12:10,786
They will sign, Counselor,

1022
01:12:10,980 --> 01:12:14,461
but they want 20 to
25 million right away!

1023
01:12:14,485 --> 01:12:16,755
To plug up the most urgent holes!

1024
01:12:18,152 --> 01:12:19,441
Insist.

1025
01:12:19,465 --> 01:12:23,201
Counselor, you must give me
at least 10 million now

1026
01:12:23,225 --> 01:12:25,516
or I can't keep them at bay!

1027
01:12:27,930 --> 01:12:30,815
- Counselor!
- Bye-byes!

1028
01:12:33,825 --> 01:12:35,289
Bye-byes!

1029
01:12:38,345 --> 01:12:40,345
- Where are you going?
- Hey!

1030
01:12:41,705 --> 01:12:43,505
What are you doing here?

1031
01:12:46,545 --> 01:12:49,281
- Are you keeping watch?
- You can't enter.

1032
01:12:49,305 --> 01:12:51,612
The counselor doesn't
want to be disturbed.

1033
01:12:51,636 --> 01:12:54,394
- Who wants to enter?
- Leave me alone!

1034
01:12:55,389 --> 01:12:56,689
Look here…

1035
01:13:00,385 --> 01:13:03,116
- What do you want?
- To talk with you.

1036
01:13:03,896 --> 01:13:06,001
- Don't you believe me?
- No.

1037
01:13:06,968 --> 01:13:08,418
I really mean it.

1038
01:13:19,945 --> 01:13:22,908
The lawyer's having fun in there…

1039
01:13:23,599 --> 01:13:26,644
and you keep watch outside
like a dog.

1040
01:13:27,304 --> 01:13:29,201
- My fucking business.
- Not at all.

1041
01:13:29,225 --> 01:13:30,825
If you listen to me,

1042
01:13:31,567 --> 01:13:32,967
you'd be a lady.

1043
01:13:34,248 --> 01:13:35,598
Furs.

1044
01:13:37,696 --> 01:13:41,650
- Apartments, cars!
- Yeah, with a beggar like you.

1045
01:13:41,674 --> 01:13:43,124
What do you think?

1046
01:13:43,497 --> 01:13:46,025
I know tons of people with money.

1047
01:13:46,264 --> 01:13:47,564
And vices!

1048
01:13:54,105 --> 01:13:56,103
If you were better dressed,

1049
01:13:56,230 --> 01:13:59,215
- you'd be a fine…
- Asshole! You think I'd be a whore?

1050
01:13:59,606 --> 01:14:03,713
- What's that with the lawyer then?
- I love the counselor.

1051
01:14:03,737 --> 01:14:04,975
Love?

1052
01:14:04,999 --> 01:14:06,279
For how much?

1053
01:14:06,460 --> 01:14:07,760
For 20?

1054
01:14:08,175 --> 01:14:09,881
For 30,000 lire?

1055
01:14:11,465 --> 01:14:14,019
With all these lovely
things that you have,

1056
01:14:14,145 --> 01:14:15,897
you could get 100,

1057
01:14:15,921 --> 01:14:18,041
even 150,000 lire a hit.

1058
01:14:18,065 --> 01:14:20,312
Leave me.
What do you want to do?

1059
01:14:20,422 --> 01:14:23,151
If I have to sell the goods,

1060
01:14:23,981 --> 01:14:26,647
I must try it first, right?

1061
01:14:29,825 --> 01:14:31,325
A little more red.

1062
01:14:32,505 --> 01:14:33,805
There.

1063
01:14:36,145 --> 01:14:37,495
Just like that.

1064
01:15:25,392 --> 01:15:26,837
Hey!

1065
01:15:26,955 --> 01:15:30,251
No! No! No! No!
Clotilde, please. I beg you.

1066
01:15:30,275 --> 01:15:32,381
OK! OK! OK!

1067
01:15:32,475 --> 01:15:33,775
Easy…

1068
01:15:40,470 --> 01:15:41,770
Concetta!

1069
01:15:50,943 --> 01:15:53,057
Sir, what happened?
Did you cut yourself?

1070
01:15:53,081 --> 01:15:55,317
- What are you doing here?
- The duke sent me.

1071
01:15:55,341 --> 01:15:57,316
He says Donna Raimonda
is beside herself.

1072
01:15:57,340 --> 01:16:00,773
She says if she doesn't hear anything
by tomorrow, she's going to the police.

1073
01:16:00,797 --> 01:16:03,933
- The duke says…
- He says! She says! You wait.

1074
01:16:03,957 --> 01:16:05,338
- You whore.
- See?

1075
01:16:05,362 --> 01:16:07,876
- Even the lawyer say so.
- Shut up!

1076
01:16:17,155 --> 01:16:19,840
- Alright. Concetta…
- He's nervous.

1077
01:16:19,925 --> 01:16:21,392
When I'm gone,

1078
01:16:22,259 --> 01:16:24,074
clean up a bit, tidy up…

1079
01:16:24,321 --> 01:16:26,213
and throw it all in the woods.

1080
01:16:26,237 --> 01:16:28,097
- It's your fault.
- Got it?

1081
01:16:29,235 --> 01:16:31,927
Tomorrow morning,
Peppe comes here at 8 sharp.

1082
01:16:31,951 --> 01:16:33,324
You go to the town

1083
01:16:33,348 --> 01:16:36,492
and only come back when your
holidays are over, not a day before.

1084
01:16:36,516 --> 01:16:38,562
- OK?
- Yes, Sir. - Come on!

1085
01:16:41,864 --> 01:16:43,314
Tomorrow morning,

1086
01:16:44,092 --> 01:16:46,693
you stay here with
Clotilde and wait for me.

1087
01:16:46,915 --> 01:16:49,354
I'll come later and
we'll take her home.

1088
01:16:49,441 --> 01:16:52,509
Counselor, why do I need to come?

1089
01:16:53,091 --> 01:16:55,483
Can't you bring her
back by yourself?

1090
01:16:56,843 --> 01:16:58,210
Just look…

1091
01:16:58,310 --> 01:16:59,869
Look at this imbecile.

1092
01:16:59,893 --> 01:17:02,343
I want to make you
look like a hero.

1093
01:17:03,801 --> 01:17:08,047
When we bring the daughter back
to Donna Raimonda with the billion,

1094
01:17:08,253 --> 01:17:11,866
I'll say you helped me
in finding out where she was.

1095
01:17:12,292 --> 01:17:14,474
I'm not from here
and you're a local.

1096
01:17:14,498 --> 01:17:18,128
Donna Raimonda will be grateful.
You'll get double the prize money.

1097
01:17:18,152 --> 01:17:21,103
Legal money, which you can
use in the light of day.

1098
01:17:21,127 --> 01:17:23,952
Tomorrow is your day,
Surveyor Colizzi.

1099
01:17:29,225 --> 01:17:32,072
Alright. I'll be here
tomorrow morning at 8.

1100
01:17:32,191 --> 01:17:33,558
Good.

1101
01:17:34,545 --> 01:17:36,945
- See you tomorrow, Counselor.
- Bye.

1102
01:19:15,745 --> 01:19:18,280
All night there, like a fool.

1103
01:19:20,097 --> 01:19:21,847
Well, I'm leaving then.

1104
01:19:27,870 --> 01:19:29,270
Little countess…

1105
01:20:13,866 --> 01:20:17,244
An ingenious scoundrel.
Who would ever think of the cottage?

1106
01:20:18,032 --> 01:20:19,692
Did I make you suffer?

1107
01:20:20,011 --> 01:20:23,271
But I wanted to be careful.
To catch him in the act.

1108
01:20:23,805 --> 01:20:26,729
I also wanted to be sure
he acted on his own.

1109
01:20:27,102 --> 01:20:29,236
- And then…
- And then?

1110
01:20:30,189 --> 01:20:33,489
And then I made sure
you'd see it with your own eyes.

1111
01:20:34,136 --> 01:20:36,386
So there would be no more doubts.

1112
01:20:36,567 --> 01:20:38,801
Saverio, forgive me
for the other night but…

1113
01:20:38,825 --> 01:20:40,258
No, please.

1114
01:20:40,555 --> 01:20:42,598
Won't he be rash if he's trapped?

1115
01:20:42,622 --> 01:20:45,083
He'll run away.
He's very intelligent.

1116
01:20:46,151 --> 01:20:49,561
And then fleeing and keeping quiet
will suit him as well as us.

1117
01:20:49,585 --> 01:20:52,135
What matters is
that Clotilde is safe.

1118
01:20:52,700 --> 01:20:56,200
By the way, I've already put
your money back in the bank.

1119
01:21:26,665 --> 01:21:28,441
You're an idiot…

1120
01:21:28,704 --> 01:21:30,235
but not bad at all.

1121
01:21:31,758 --> 01:21:33,058
Not bad…

1122
01:21:34,343 --> 01:21:36,613
I can almost sign off on that too.

1123
01:21:37,706 --> 01:21:39,006
Besides…

1124
01:21:40,373 --> 01:21:42,642
Mazzacolli and I are partners.

1125
01:21:45,890 --> 01:21:48,594
Stay where you are! Don't move!

1126
01:21:58,745 --> 01:22:00,677
Shut up! Shut up!

1127
01:22:24,630 --> 01:22:26,702
That son of a bitch!

1128
01:22:41,565 --> 01:22:42,865
Raimonda!

1129
01:22:44,141 --> 01:22:47,089
Help, Countess! Help!

1130
01:22:49,082 --> 01:22:51,112
Clo! Clotilde!

1131
01:22:51,136 --> 01:22:53,122
- Get up.
- Clo!

1132
01:22:53,146 --> 01:22:56,161
My flower! Beautiful flower!

1133
01:22:56,986 --> 01:22:59,152
What did that bastard do?

1134
01:23:02,985 --> 01:23:04,285
Love!

1135
01:23:08,098 --> 01:23:10,652
- Get the blanket, Anna!
- Yes.

1136
01:23:10,676 --> 01:23:13,019
- She passed out.
- Clotilde!

1137
01:23:13,199 --> 01:23:15,795
Clo… Clo… My daughter…

1138
01:23:16,368 --> 01:23:17,668
Clo…

1139
01:23:17,864 --> 01:23:19,403
Bastard!

1140
01:23:24,502 --> 01:23:26,628
- Well, Doctor?
- Later.

1141
01:23:37,299 --> 01:23:39,509
Unfortunately, it was done.

1142
01:23:39,534 --> 01:23:41,941
Dirty coward, son of a bitch.

1143
01:23:42,828 --> 01:23:46,267
- But this is not the end. I'll…
- You must be strong, Counselor.

1144
01:23:46,689 --> 01:23:50,201
The good luck is that
the countess, in this misfortune,

1145
01:23:50,241 --> 01:23:52,521
in the mental condition
in which she is,

1146
01:23:52,545 --> 01:23:54,714
must not have even realized it.

1147
01:23:54,825 --> 01:23:57,428
All is saved except for honor.

1148
01:23:57,453 --> 01:24:00,253
- You take me to her!
- Right away, Princess.

1149
01:24:02,729 --> 01:24:04,029
Excuse me.

1150
01:24:07,402 --> 01:24:09,959
I realize that
the situation has changed.

1151
01:24:10,065 --> 01:24:12,595
Saverio, if you want to back out,
you may.

1152
01:24:12,619 --> 01:24:15,373
No, what does this matter?
Who cares about that?

1153
01:24:17,152 --> 01:24:18,808
Sure, this has made me…

1154
01:24:19,945 --> 01:24:21,441
It's understandable…

1155
01:24:21,465 --> 01:24:25,173
Saverio is upset.
These things, you know…

1156
01:24:25,425 --> 01:24:27,441
Maybe it's best that I speak.

1157
01:24:27,465 --> 01:24:30,190
Maybe this isn't the best time but…

1158
01:24:30,214 --> 01:24:33,134
since you brought it up,
I might as well.

1159
01:24:33,613 --> 01:24:38,257
Indeed, as you well said,
the situation has changed.

1160
01:24:38,545 --> 01:24:40,495
But Saverio is a gentleman.

1161
01:24:40,841 --> 01:24:44,360
Let's give him time to recover,
to digest the blow…

1162
01:24:44,510 --> 01:24:48,108
He'll marry Clotilde.
He'll marry her even…

1163
01:24:48,351 --> 01:24:49,641
as she is.

1164
01:24:49,665 --> 01:24:52,166
- Though at this juncture…
- This juncture?

1165
01:24:52,190 --> 01:24:55,550
Well, you're an intelligent woman,
Raimonda dear…

1166
01:24:55,625 --> 01:25:00,326
a small tweak to the nuptial
contract would seem right to me.

1167
01:25:01,586 --> 01:25:04,406
See, I knew it: You're reasonable.

1168
01:25:04,430 --> 01:25:06,407
And it's just a small thing:

1169
01:25:06,545 --> 01:25:10,353
You renounce some of the usufruct,
let him manage the properties…

1170
01:25:10,377 --> 01:25:13,035
Let's say instead
that I will back out.

1171
01:25:13,345 --> 01:25:14,645
Excuse me?

1172
01:25:18,437 --> 01:25:21,472
Let's give Saverio time
to digest the blow.

1173
01:25:21,496 --> 01:25:23,196
All the time he needs.

1174
01:25:23,425 --> 01:25:25,402
My daughter will not marry.

1175
01:25:26,105 --> 01:25:28,162
I'll keep her with me as she is.

1176
01:25:29,145 --> 01:25:31,345
She's fine to me the way she is.

1177
01:25:33,905 --> 01:25:35,405
Donna Raimonda, I…

1178
01:25:36,150 --> 01:25:39,281
- I don't understand.
- I understand, Don Amilcare.

1179
01:25:39,306 --> 01:25:41,737
Fine, if you understand…

1180
01:25:49,385 --> 01:25:50,685
Saverio!

1181
01:25:51,527 --> 01:25:53,685
We'll rip up the marriage contract,

1182
01:25:53,709 --> 01:25:56,500
but business is business,
Counselor Mazzacolli.

1183
01:25:56,585 --> 01:25:59,681
Not as a son-in-law,
but as a partner you may suit me.

1184
01:25:59,705 --> 01:26:01,592
- But I wanted…
- Saverio,

1185
01:26:01,616 --> 01:26:03,666
let's talk about it tomorrow.

1186
01:27:14,425 --> 01:27:17,986
Clo! Drink, Clo.
Come now, be good.

1187
01:27:19,145 --> 01:27:20,497
My goodness!

1188
01:27:27,254 --> 01:27:28,554
Clo!

1189
01:27:28,687 --> 01:27:29,987
Clotilde!

1190
01:27:35,140 --> 01:27:37,792
What are you doing there?
Get the doctor! Hurry!

1191
01:27:37,816 --> 01:27:39,320
I'm going!

1192
01:27:40,355 --> 01:27:42,474
Clo! Clo!

1193
01:27:53,300 --> 01:27:54,600
Saverio!

1194
01:28:01,206 --> 01:28:03,206
But why don't you go to bed?

1195
01:28:04,535 --> 01:28:06,400
It's one o'clock, Save'.

1196
01:28:06,424 --> 01:28:08,833
Tomorrow. Take it easy.

1197
01:28:37,973 --> 01:28:40,711
I can't keep doping
her with sedatives.

1198
01:28:40,735 --> 01:28:44,066
I'm worried about her mental state.
I would call a specialist.

1199
01:28:44,090 --> 01:28:47,023
- The tarantula stung her!
They bewitched her! - Hush.

1200
01:28:47,047 --> 01:28:51,191
If she doesn't eat for a week,
we can't continue with the drip.

1201
01:28:51,215 --> 01:28:53,265
I'm sorry, Countess. Goodbye.

1202
01:28:54,284 --> 01:28:56,513
My respects, Princess.

1203
01:29:03,895 --> 01:29:05,195
Clo?

1204
01:29:05,695 --> 01:29:06,995
Clotilde?

1205
01:29:12,255 --> 01:29:13,604
Clo?

1206
01:29:14,331 --> 01:29:15,631
Little one…

1207
01:29:20,095 --> 01:29:21,395
Little one…

1208
01:29:24,015 --> 01:29:25,315
Raimonda!

1209
01:29:30,295 --> 01:29:32,575
She needs a man, understand?

1210
01:29:32,811 --> 01:29:35,329
We must marry her
immediately to that guy.

1211
01:29:35,353 --> 01:29:37,442
That will be the real cure.

1212
01:29:37,770 --> 01:29:39,740
You are all blind!

1213
01:30:51,655 --> 01:30:54,368
Save', here's the coffee
It's ten o'clock.

1214
01:30:54,453 --> 01:30:55,822
- At night?
- No, day.

1215
01:30:55,846 --> 01:30:58,146
At least come down
for a bite to eat.

1216
01:31:00,749 --> 01:31:03,931
- No pap.
- Huh? What did you say?

1217
01:31:04,055 --> 01:31:06,419
- No pap!
- Oh, no!

1218
01:31:06,858 --> 01:31:09,031
That won't do! No!

1219
01:31:10,415 --> 01:31:13,180
Bregonzo phoned. I spoke to him.

1220
01:31:13,307 --> 01:31:14,986
Everything can be saved.

1221
01:31:15,655 --> 01:31:16,955
Really?

1222
01:31:17,976 --> 01:31:20,274
- Tomorrow.
- What tomorrow?

1223
01:31:20,357 --> 01:31:23,672
He says the new minister is
ready to take an interest.

1224
01:31:23,815 --> 01:31:27,071
Indeed, to give a joint interest.
He expects a call.

1225
01:31:27,095 --> 01:31:28,878
What shall I do? Call him?

1226
01:31:28,902 --> 01:31:32,591
- Bregonzo can go fuck himself.
- Go fuck himself?

1227
01:31:32,615 --> 01:31:36,551
Have you forgotten that a half
billion of options are at stake?

1228
01:31:36,575 --> 01:31:40,384
Your money and not just yours!
Think a little about yours truly!

1229
01:31:40,408 --> 01:31:43,627
- Emerald Shores!
- Fuck Emerald Shores.

1230
01:31:46,382 --> 01:31:49,787
And above all,
don't break my balls!

1231
01:31:51,735 --> 01:31:53,235
He needs a doctor.

1232
01:31:59,175 --> 01:32:00,525
Leave me alone.

1233
01:32:01,060 --> 01:32:03,030
Otherwise, I'll…

1234
01:32:30,625 --> 01:32:33,625
I've been spying on you
for a few days, Mazzacolli.

1235
01:32:34,185 --> 01:32:37,069
If you think this is over,
you're wrong.

1236
01:32:38,823 --> 01:32:40,402
You'll pay for it.

1237
01:32:51,679 --> 01:32:53,421
You son of a bitch!

1238
01:32:53,589 --> 01:32:55,684
Disgusting worm!

1239
01:32:58,268 --> 01:32:59,568
Worm!

1240
01:33:04,046 --> 01:33:05,446
Disgusting worm!

1241
01:33:07,151 --> 01:33:09,207
What did you do to Clotilde?

1242
01:33:11,815 --> 01:33:14,527
Nothing… Nothing, I swear.

1243
01:33:15,008 --> 01:33:16,308
On my life…

1244
01:33:16,856 --> 01:33:18,669
On my mother's memory.

1245
01:33:18,815 --> 01:33:20,297
Yes, I tried…

1246
01:33:20,321 --> 01:33:22,981
but I didn't do anything to her.
I swear!

1247
01:33:23,095 --> 01:33:24,595
What do you swear?

1248
01:33:25,295 --> 01:33:28,204
On my mother's life.
I didn't do anything to her.

1249
01:33:28,295 --> 01:33:29,595
Nothing.

1250
01:33:31,569 --> 01:33:35,377
I won't kill you because I pity you.
I pity you all. You make me sick!

1251
01:33:35,474 --> 01:33:37,274
What do you want? Money?

1252
01:33:55,295 --> 01:33:58,527
Don't worry, I won't stop it
in the bank. You can cash it.

1253
01:34:00,056 --> 01:34:01,556
It's even covered.

1254
01:34:11,903 --> 01:34:13,203
Counselor!

1255
01:34:18,815 --> 01:34:20,565
- Thank you.
- For what?

1256
01:34:22,072 --> 01:34:24,933
Servants are paid
when they serve well.

1257
01:34:25,481 --> 01:34:27,481
And you have served me well.

1258
01:34:33,787 --> 01:34:35,405
Actually… Take it!

1259
01:34:36,869 --> 01:34:38,169
A gift.

1260
01:34:39,411 --> 01:34:42,128
You've been drooling
over it since you saw it.

1261
01:34:42,607 --> 01:34:43,957
My gift to you.

1262
01:34:59,362 --> 01:35:02,513
You take care of the transfer
of ownership. Understand?

1263
01:35:06,815 --> 01:35:10,114
If you don't admit her immediately,
I decline all responsibility.

1264
01:35:10,138 --> 01:35:12,138
Electroshock and right away!

1265
01:35:12,254 --> 01:35:14,725
We will then have a consultation.

1266
01:35:14,799 --> 01:35:17,412
- So, do we agree, Donna Raimonda?
- No.

1267
01:35:17,436 --> 01:35:19,382
- What?
- I said no.

1268
01:35:19,438 --> 01:35:21,712
Well then, good day.

1269
01:35:21,953 --> 01:35:23,579
Good day, Doctor.

1270
01:35:25,265 --> 01:35:26,961
I'll give him everything:

1271
01:35:26,985 --> 01:35:29,455
palaces, lands, factories…

1272
01:35:29,594 --> 01:35:31,775
Everything. But he must marry her.

1273
01:35:32,415 --> 01:35:33,915
He must marry her.

1274
01:35:35,455 --> 01:35:36,755
Bravo!

1275
01:35:37,332 --> 01:35:39,138
Hurry up, for heaven's sake!

1276
01:35:39,162 --> 01:35:43,559
Bregonzo's plane with the minister
arrives in an hour and a half!

1277
01:35:43,655 --> 01:35:46,071
You made me sick all night.

1278
01:35:47,086 --> 01:35:50,041
But where the hell were you?

1279
01:35:50,271 --> 01:35:53,532
- You have become a wild cat.
- A cat is beautiful.

1280
01:35:53,735 --> 01:35:55,736
Watch out for those two, eh?

1281
01:35:56,010 --> 01:35:57,810
Are you listening to me?

1282
01:35:58,968 --> 01:36:00,268
Yes!

1283
01:36:01,260 --> 01:36:03,231
The minister is coming to look.

1284
01:36:03,255 --> 01:36:06,794
To talk to you and
have the project explained.

1285
01:36:08,022 --> 01:36:10,390
- The recovery of the South…
- The project, sure.

1286
01:36:10,414 --> 01:36:12,044
- The economic roll-out.
- Yes.

1287
01:36:12,068 --> 01:36:15,380
And all that bullshit. You don't
need me to tell you what to say, eh?

1288
01:36:15,404 --> 01:36:16,670
No.

1289
01:36:16,694 --> 01:36:19,264
- Concetta!
- Here, Peppe!

1290
01:36:29,695 --> 01:36:32,711
Tonight we sleep in Bari
and then… in Milan!

1291
01:36:32,735 --> 01:36:36,685
I've a friend who emigrated last year
and he's in the big leagues!

1292
01:36:37,435 --> 01:36:39,698
Is it really true?
He gave it to you?

1293
01:36:41,068 --> 01:36:42,468
He's a fine man.

1294
01:36:42,775 --> 01:36:44,075
Poor guy.

1295
01:36:44,505 --> 01:36:47,389
In Milan, there's
the Duomo with 100 spires!

1296
01:36:53,780 --> 01:36:55,409
I put it all in the bag:

1297
01:36:55,433 --> 01:36:58,111
drawings, financial plans,
a copy of the application,

1298
01:36:58,135 --> 01:37:00,635
copy of option contracts,
everything!

1299
01:37:01,015 --> 01:37:02,315
Certainly.

1300
01:37:03,416 --> 01:37:04,716
And the bag?

1301
01:37:08,655 --> 01:37:10,605
The bag can go fuck itself.

1302
01:37:13,160 --> 01:37:14,460
Bye.

1303
01:37:21,098 --> 01:37:24,578
Counselor Saverio Mazzacolli…

1304
01:37:25,335 --> 01:37:27,058
Mazza-shitty!

1305
01:37:31,465 --> 01:37:35,191
Go now to the Loyola Palace.
Deliver it to Counselor Mazzacolli.

1306
01:37:35,215 --> 01:37:37,765
Be careful:
give it to him personally.

1307
01:37:37,975 --> 01:37:39,275
Yes, Ma'am.

1308
01:38:01,095 --> 01:38:03,791
Ma'am, Counselor Mazzacolli's here.

1309
01:38:03,815 --> 01:38:06,065
- He's here?
- Shall I let him in?

1310
01:38:27,295 --> 01:38:28,595
Listen…

1311
01:38:30,578 --> 01:38:31,978
I want Clotilde.

1312
01:38:32,706 --> 01:38:35,656
No, I don't want anything else.
Just Clotilde.

1313
01:38:35,855 --> 01:38:38,027
You take everything, Emerald Shores…

1314
01:38:38,051 --> 01:38:39,922
Take anything you want.

1315
01:38:42,295 --> 01:38:44,095
Just let me be near her.

1316
01:38:47,518 --> 01:38:48,818
I love her.

1317
01:38:51,186 --> 01:38:52,486
I love her.

1318
01:38:54,335 --> 01:38:55,885
Did you come here.…

1319
01:38:56,476 --> 01:38:58,571
- to tell me this?
- Yes.

1320
01:38:59,775 --> 01:39:01,863
- Have you read…?
- What?

1321
01:39:02,735 --> 01:39:05,618
- The letter?
- No, what does it say? - Nothing.

1322
01:39:06,132 --> 01:39:08,282
Nothing. It's not important.

1323
01:39:11,044 --> 01:39:12,583
Come. Come!

1324
01:39:53,455 --> 01:39:54,755
Clo.

1325
01:39:56,615 --> 01:39:57,915
My love?

1326
01:40:15,455 --> 01:40:16,755
Clo!

1327
01:40:28,561 --> 01:40:29,861
Clo…

1328
01:40:35,015 --> 01:40:36,315
Clo!

1329
01:40:53,139 --> 01:40:54,439
Well?

1330
01:41:08,073 --> 01:41:09,373
Clo!

1331
01:41:23,729 --> 01:41:27,748
Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes!
Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes!

1332
01:41:30,939 --> 01:41:32,689
Let's leave them alone.

1333
01:41:47,811 --> 01:41:49,804
It is the will of the Lord!

1334
01:41:54,288 --> 01:41:58,025
The letter?
Has he already read it?

1335
01:41:58,815 --> 01:42:00,874
Whatever! Well then...

1336
01:42:01,291 --> 01:42:04,012
everything is all sorted out!

1337
01:42:26,633 --> 01:42:28,087
Yes, go on. I love…

1338
01:42:28,111 --> 01:42:29,611
I love you.

1339
01:42:30,000 --> 01:42:31,774
I love…

1340
01:42:32,089 --> 01:42:33,907
I love…

1341
01:42:35,343 --> 01:42:38,354
Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes!
I understand! I do!
