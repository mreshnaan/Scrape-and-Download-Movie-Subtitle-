You've got quite the skill set.

Again? What happened?

57
00:06:36,958 --> 00:06:38,750
What else? My pitch got rejected.

[woman] Well, those old coots

I'm quitting my job.

What?

61
00:06:47,458 --> 00:06:50,750
My boss's friend pulled some strings
to get his child promoted.

62
00:06:52,291 --> 00:06:54,208
Whoa. That's rash.

63
00:06:54,958 --> 00:06:57,291
Did you think it through?
You have another job lined up?

64
00:06:57,375 --> 00:06:59,458
- Mm.
- [Jang] Easy for you to say.

65
00:06:59,541 --> 00:07:02,708
Soon as you graduated,
you had this job waiting for you.

Working our asses off for chump change!

72
00:07:18,041 --> 00:07:19,375
Yeah, but why me?

73
00:07:20,750 --> 00:07:22,333
[Au] I'm glad it's you.

74
00:07:23,291 --> 00:07:24,750
You cook better than Dad.

75
00:07:24,833 --> 00:07:27,250
[Jang] Whoa! Way to suck up to her!

76
00:07:28,291 --> 00:07:29,875
And what about you, Au?

77
00:07:29,958 --> 00:07:33,083
Freelance online content creator, huh?

78
00:07:33,166 --> 00:07:35,291
You have no idea how hard it is for us.

79
00:07:35,375 --> 00:07:36,208
[Au] Of course I do.

80
00:07:36,291 --> 00:07:37,833
I know how poor I am.

81
00:07:38,750 --> 00:07:40,875
How much do you think I earn per gig?

82
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:43,791
Every day, I wake up
feeling so fucking poor.

83
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:49,166
[sighs] I used to think I'd graduate

84
00:07:49,250 --> 00:07:52,083
and then, somehow,
I'd manage to change the world.

85
00:07:52,916 --> 00:07:56,958
Yeah, right! Look at us now.
Menial work, no prospects.

86
00:07:57,041 --> 00:07:59,875
For sure. It's not easy to succeed here.

87
00:07:59,958 --> 00:08:01,708
Especially if you start out with no money.

88
00:08:01,791 --> 00:08:03,831
You have to be
the child of someone rich to make it.

89
00:08:03,875 --> 00:08:07,166
Normal people like us,
we've no right to be happy.

Oh!

00:08:12,833 --> 00:08:16,875
Some weirdo came up to me today
and handed me this card.

Asked me to go and work for them.

Excuse me, sir, is this your car?

100
00:08:36,791 --> 00:08:37,791
You have to move it.

[Jang] Yeah.
Some people get special treatment.

106
00:09:08,541 --> 00:09:10,083
[woman 2] Gotta be some big shot.

107

It is what it is.
No parking for the rest of us.

00:18:23,541 --> 00:18:25,333
Do you know how to work the fire?

179
00:18:26,125 --> 00:18:27,541
I... think so.

180
00:18:27,625 --> 00:18:28,833
Do you or don't you?

181
00:18:29,750 --> 00:18:30,750
I do.

182
00:18:33,416 --> 00:18:35,125
Why do you want to work at Hunger?

183
00:18:43,916 --> 00:18:44,916
[clicks tongue]

184
00:18:45,958 --> 00:18:48,041
I want to be special.

185
00:18:50,791 --> 00:18:52,791
[soft music playing]

186
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,000
[sniffs deeply]

187
00:19:19,416 --> 00:19:21,625
The smell from your <i>Pad See Ew </i>joint

188
00:19:22,833 --> 00:19:23,916
doesn't belong here.

189
00:19:27,458 --> 00:19:28,875
Wash up and get changed.

190
00:19:40,958 --> 00:19:42,416
[exhales]

191
00:19:42,500 --> 00:19:44,500
[soft music continues]

192
00:19:49,541 --> 00:19:51,000
[sniffs]

193
00:20:29,916 --> 00:20:31,458
[kitchen tools clattering]

194
00:20:32,333 --> 00:20:34,133
[sous-chef] Go to the market
once you're done,

195
00:20:34,166 --> 00:20:35,750
and don't forget to check the potatoes.

196
00:20:38,416 --> 00:20:42,125
We're a crew of seven... for the moment.
Including Chef Paul.

197
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:45,041
"For the moment"?

198
00:20:45,708 --> 00:20:49,083
Seven for now.
That number can change at any time.

199
00:20:49,166 --> 00:20:50,416
It's up to the Chef.

200
00:20:51,583 --> 00:20:52,583
Come on.

201
00:20:54,041 --> 00:20:56,416
Right here, that's Uncle Dang,
the sous-chef.

202
00:20:56,500 --> 00:20:58,125
Chef Paul's second-in-command.

203
00:20:58,625 --> 00:21:01,125
He's a real veteran. Been through a lot.

204
00:21:01,875 --> 00:21:04,083
That is Tue,
in charge of the soup station.

205
00:21:04,166 --> 00:21:06,250
If you hear him speak, you're lucky!

206
00:21:07,791 --> 00:21:10,708
That's Keng.
He joined us just a few months ago.

207
00:21:11,750 --> 00:21:13,208
He handles cold dishes.

208
00:21:13,708 --> 00:21:16,333
He also makes sauces and desserts.

209
00:21:18,250 --> 00:21:19,250
This is Bae.

210
00:21:19,916 --> 00:21:21,208
The kitchen porter.

211
00:21:21,916 --> 00:21:24,750
He can hardly speak the language,
so all he does is smile.

212
00:21:25,333 --> 00:21:26,583
Hard worker.

213
00:21:27,250 --> 00:21:28,583
And you are...

214
00:21:29,291 --> 00:21:32,666
I'm Tone. Junior sous-chef,
just below Dang.

215
00:21:34,875 --> 00:21:36,333
Um, what about me?

216
00:21:37,125 --> 00:21:39,458
You? You're replacing
someone who got fired.

217
00:21:39,958 --> 00:21:42,500
I'm guessing Paul wants you
to be the fry chef.

218
00:21:43,083 --> 00:21:44,500
That's the same level as me...

219
00:21:45,500 --> 00:21:46,500
more or less.

220
00:21:48,375 --> 00:21:50,375
[objects clatter]

221
00:21:54,041 --> 00:21:55,166
Tomorrow we have a

222
00:21:56,583 --> 00:21:58,083
private birthday party.

223
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:00,583
Fifteen guests, total.

224
00:22:00,666 --> 00:22:05,083
The average age is 40-plus.
The venue is a private residence.

225
00:22:05,166 --> 00:22:08,666
The host is... General Premsak.

226
00:22:14,541 --> 00:22:18,666
Guests are members of the upper crust.
Business and political.

227
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:21,500
The theme for the dinner

228
00:22:22,125 --> 00:22:23,666
will be "Flesh and Blood."

229
00:22:26,708 --> 00:22:27,875
Intense colors.

230
00:22:28,375 --> 00:22:31,875
Everything juicy and succulent,
leaving the mouth stained and messy.

231
00:22:32,375 --> 00:22:33,791
A5 BEEF, 16" GOLD PLATE

232
00:22:33,875 --> 00:22:34,708
[Paul] Got it?

233
00:22:34,791 --> 00:22:36,125
[all] Yes, Chef.

234
00:22:37,083 --> 00:22:38,458
Now, your job

235
00:22:39,291 --> 00:22:42,708
is to fry the Wagyu A5 beef
into tender pieces

236
00:22:43,416 --> 00:22:44,833
that require no chewing.

237
00:22:48,375 --> 00:22:49,458
[hesitantly] Yes, Chef.

238
00:23:05,458 --> 00:23:10,250
Everything depends on perfect slicing
and your control of the fire.

239
00:23:11,083 --> 00:23:13,250
Cook it just enough to keep the juice.

240
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,666
But do not overdo it.

241
00:23:20,916 --> 00:23:21,916
Go on.

242
00:23:41,833 --> 00:23:42,833
Too thick.

243
00:23:48,125 --> 00:23:49,375
Still too thick.

244
00:23:55,750 --> 00:23:57,000
Firm grip on the knife.

245
00:24:02,416 --> 00:24:03,833
Keep the blade straight.

246
00:24:14,833 --> 00:24:16,000
Don't tear it.

247
00:24:20,458 --> 00:24:21,458
Again.

248
00:24:30,375 --> 00:24:31,416
Don't saw it.

249
00:24:43,625 --> 00:24:45,625
I told you not to saw it.

250
00:24:57,291 --> 00:24:58,750
[yelling] Don't fucking saw it!

251
00:25:01,416 --> 00:25:02,416
Again.

252
00:25:03,666 --> 00:25:05,666
[tense music playing]

253
00:25:11,291 --> 00:25:12,625
You're doing it again!

254
00:25:15,708 --> 00:25:19,708
Have you any idea how much this costs?

255
00:25:28,750 --> 00:25:29,750
Cook it.

256
00:25:53,250 --> 00:25:54,250
Overcooked.

257
00:25:55,666 --> 00:25:56,666
Again.

258
00:26:01,458 --> 00:26:02,583
Overdone.

259
00:26:08,833 --> 00:26:10,791
Go home if you're scared of fire.

260
00:26:12,625 --> 00:26:14,166
Overdone. Again.

261
00:26:18,583 --> 00:26:20,250
The meat's stuck to the wok!

262
00:26:20,750 --> 00:26:21,875
Again. Come on!

263
00:26:25,083 --> 00:26:27,083
[tense music continues]

264
00:26:28,708 --> 00:26:30,125
There is too much oil!

265
00:26:34,250 --> 00:26:35,583
[sizzling]

266
00:26:39,708 --> 00:26:41,333
Don't you want to be special?

267
00:26:51,416 --> 00:26:53,500
I hired you to handle the frying.

268
00:26:55,166 --> 00:26:57,083
If you can't do that,
you don't belong here.

269
00:26:58,750 --> 00:26:59,875
I've asked for one thing.

270
00:26:59,958 --> 00:27:03,000
And I've made it perfectly clear
how I want the meat to be cooked.

271
00:27:05,541 --> 00:27:07,041
Do it until you get it right.

272
00:27:12,083 --> 00:27:13,875
If I don't see you when I get back,

273
00:27:15,458 --> 00:27:16,541
then it's proof

274
00:27:17,583 --> 00:27:18,916
that you belong

275
00:27:19,958 --> 00:27:21,583
in your generic noodle joint.

276
00:27:31,333 --> 00:27:35,416
If she can't manage,
we'll change the menu.

277
00:27:35,500 --> 00:27:36,333
[all] Yes, Chef.

278
00:27:36,416 --> 00:27:38,416
[tense music continues]

279
00:27:55,916 --> 00:27:57,958
[tense music fades]

280
00:28:12,875 --> 00:28:15,041
[intense music building]

281
00:28:18,166 --> 00:28:19,625
[wok heating]

282
00:28:25,333 --> 00:28:27,333
[music continues building]

283
00:29:05,166 --> 00:29:06,166
[Aoy exclaims]

284
00:29:07,416 --> 00:29:08,500
[inhales sharply]

285
00:29:12,791 --> 00:29:14,416
[wok sizzling]

286
00:29:49,041 --> 00:29:51,041
[music builds dramatically]

287
00:30:00,291 --> 00:30:02,291
[music ends]

288
00:30:21,166 --> 00:30:22,166
Whoa!

289
00:30:24,708 --> 00:30:26,666
Oh! [laughing] Bro!

290
00:30:27,250 --> 00:30:29,583
Looks like your girl
couldn't find her way home.

291
00:30:50,458 --> 00:30:52,458
[groans]

292
00:31:09,458 --> 00:31:11,500
[suspenseful music playing]

293
00:31:42,041 --> 00:31:43,166
[switches off stove]

294
00:32:23,291 --> 00:32:24,958
[Paul] Aren't you gonna get changed?

295
00:32:25,041 --> 00:32:26,125
[all] Yes, Chef.

296
00:32:32,583 --> 00:32:34,916
Here. Wipe off the oil.

297
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:47,000
[tender music playing]

298
00:33:14,666 --> 00:33:17,458
Sir, could you squeeze in a little please?
That's perfect.

299
00:33:18,250 --> 00:33:20,791
- Smile. One more, please.
- [camera clicks]

300
00:33:23,125 --> 00:33:25,125
- [guests chattering]
- [soft music playing]

301
00:33:29,791 --> 00:33:30,791
[man] How is he doing?

302
00:33:32,750 --> 00:33:35,791
- Hi. Good evening. Good evening.
- Good evening, sir.

303
00:33:36,583 --> 00:33:37,583
Hey, look.

304
00:33:39,041 --> 00:33:40,458
Maya's a guest.

305
00:33:40,541 --> 00:33:41,666
- You look lovely.
- Oh...

306
00:33:41,750 --> 00:33:43,750
- She's dating Lieutenant Pom.
- [camera clicks]

307
00:33:44,250 --> 00:33:47,041
- He'll be a military spokesperson soon.
- [camera clicks]

308
00:33:47,125 --> 00:33:49,791
[Aoy] That guy,
isn't he from the Chaiprakan family?

309
00:33:49,875 --> 00:33:53,000
Why is he here?
It's a politician's birthday party.

310
00:33:53,583 --> 00:33:57,291
Well, yes. Businessmen cozy up
with politicians for favors all the time.

311
00:33:58,125 --> 00:34:00,833
That family, they've been busy
forging connections everywhere.

312
00:34:01,791 --> 00:34:03,541
Getting invited here is a big deal.

313
00:34:15,083 --> 00:34:16,083
Good evening, Chef.

314
00:34:19,333 --> 00:34:20,333
Mr. Tos.

315
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:23,833
This area is reserved for me and my crew...

316
00:34:23,916 --> 00:34:26,916
Come on now.
Don't give me the cold shoulder.

317
00:34:27,458 --> 00:34:31,125
I'm only here so I can sample your menu,
not to pester you.

318
00:34:31,833 --> 00:34:32,833
[Tone] That's Mr. Tos.

319
00:34:32,875 --> 00:34:34,750
He's a prominent restaurateur.

320
00:34:35,666 --> 00:34:38,458
He wanted to be our sponsor
but Chef said no.

321
00:34:47,958 --> 00:34:49,041
[camera clicking]

322
00:35:01,375 --> 00:35:02,375
Evening, General.

323
00:35:03,375 --> 00:35:05,500
- Oh.
- How are you doing, sir?

324
00:35:05,583 --> 00:35:06,708
Are you a general now?

325
00:35:06,791 --> 00:35:08,916
No, not yet, sir.
I'm still just a lieutenant.

326
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:09,833
- Really?
- Yes.

327
00:35:09,916 --> 00:35:12,250
- Let me know when you're a general.
- Yes, sir.

328
00:35:12,333 --> 00:35:15,875
I'll give you my blessing. Oh, I see
you've brought your lady with you.

329
00:35:15,958 --> 00:35:17,416
- Yes, sir.
- May I touch her hair?

330
00:35:17,500 --> 00:35:18,666
[guests chuckling]

331
00:35:18,750 --> 00:35:20,625
- Yes, sir.
- May you both be successful.

332
00:35:20,708 --> 00:35:22,309
- [Pom] Thank you.
- Become a general soon.

333
00:35:22,333 --> 00:35:24,875
- Thank you, sir.
- I wish you a happy birthday, sir.

334
00:35:24,958 --> 00:35:26,791
- Thank you.
- You remember me?

335
00:35:27,291 --> 00:35:29,875
Oh. You look familiar.
Minister of Finance, aren't you?

336
00:35:29,958 --> 00:35:33,000
Yes, sir. I knew you'd remember.
You appointed me yourself.

337
00:35:33,083 --> 00:35:35,000
Right. Now, share some
of that money with me.

338
00:35:35,083 --> 00:35:36,500
[guests chuckling]

339
00:35:36,583 --> 00:35:37,625
All right. Come on now.

00:39:26,083 --> 00:39:26,916
[man] It was perfect.

355
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:30,833
But please, don't tell anyone
how much food I had to eat tonight.

00:39:32,125 --> 00:39:35,125
- Just say I had a few pieces.
- I didn't want it to end.

358
00:39:40,208 --> 00:39:42,583
If you need anything,
you can call me anytime.

359
00:39:48,708 --> 00:39:50,833
[general] Oh, it was very good.

360
00:39:50,916 --> 00:39:52,916
We're quite lucky to be here.

361
00:39:54,291 --> 00:39:55,416
Well done, sir.

362
00:39:56,166 --> 00:39:58,458
[radio chattering]

363
00:39:58,541 --> 00:39:59,916
[Aoy's dad] What would you like?

364
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,291
[woman] I'll have two regular <i>Pad See Ew.</i>

365
00:40:06,708 --> 00:40:08,541
[Aoy's dad] Two regular <i>Rad Na, </i>table six.

366
00:40:10,583 --> 00:40:12,208
[Bo] Table four, good to go.

367
00:40:12,291 --> 00:40:14,291
[sizzling]

368
00:40:17,083 --> 00:40:18,750
[Aoy's dad] Table five is still waiting.

369
00:40:37,833 --> 00:40:38,875
You look chipper.

370
00:40:43,125 --> 00:40:45,083
What are you doing?
Why don't you eat at home?

371
00:40:47,291 --> 00:40:48,291
'Cause I miss you.

372
00:40:49,875 --> 00:40:52,416
There's nothing more sad
than eating all alone.

373
00:40:54,875 --> 00:40:57,458
What's that? Looks like pigswill.

374
00:40:58,666 --> 00:41:00,333
Pigswill? It's meatballs!

375
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:04,083
What's your problem?
There's nothing weird about my soup.

376
00:41:04,791 --> 00:41:05,791
It looks gross.

377
00:41:08,125 --> 00:41:09,125
[laughs softly]

378
00:41:09,958 --> 00:41:13,666
You get to cook for magnates once
and everything else looks gross to you.

379
00:41:14,250 --> 00:41:17,250
- Do I have to say "Your Highness" now?
- [Aoy kicks table] Au!

380
00:41:21,333 --> 00:41:23,666
The food before you,
what you're about to eat,

381
00:41:24,208 --> 00:41:26,083
it should look good, not gross!

382
00:41:26,166 --> 00:41:27,166
Hey!

383
00:41:28,083 --> 00:41:29,250
Au...

384
00:41:34,375 --> 00:41:37,041
[muffled] I'll tell you one thing,
I eat to live.

385
00:41:39,875 --> 00:41:44,041
You see... fancy food might be good,
but I wouldn't know.

386
00:41:44,875 --> 00:41:47,125
It's for rich people
who have money they can throw away.

387
00:41:47,791 --> 00:41:49,708
For you and me, this does the trick.

388
00:41:49,791 --> 00:41:52,541
- [phone buzzing]
- [Au] Cheap, tasty, fills you right up.

389
00:41:53,625 --> 00:41:54,625
Hello, Tone!

390
00:41:56,750 --> 00:41:57,750
What for?

391
00:42:09,125 --> 00:42:11,125
[gentle music playing]

392
00:42:37,500 --> 00:42:40,583
[Tone] <i>What gives the food we cook
such rich and unique flavor</i>

393
00:42:40,666 --> 00:42:43,250
<i>is the quality of the ingredients we use,</i>

394
00:42:44,250 --> 00:42:45,625
<i>as well as their freshness.</i>

395
00:42:47,791 --> 00:42:51,375
<i>Whether it's meat, fish, or spices,</i>

396
00:42:52,375 --> 00:42:54,583
<i>their source give them a unique character.</i>

397
00:42:54,666 --> 00:42:55,958
[man] It's $40 a pound.

398
00:42:56,041 --> 00:42:57,166
Oh, nice.

399
00:42:57,250 --> 00:42:59,125
[man] Unfortunately, it's too small.

400
00:43:01,583 --> 00:43:02,416
This one's big.

401
00:43:02,500 --> 00:43:04,500
[gentle music continues]

402
00:43:10,791 --> 00:43:12,000
This one's good.

403
00:43:14,791 --> 00:43:15,708
I like this one...

404
00:43:15,791 --> 00:43:16,791
That's good.

405
00:43:18,750 --> 00:43:20,250
[man] <i>Is she your girlfriend?</i>

406
00:43:21,958 --> 00:43:25,000
- Mm. No, no. Friend. Just a friend.
- [chuckling]

407
00:43:25,083 --> 00:43:26,375
You're such a liar.

408
00:43:32,791 --> 00:43:34,625
You guys seem very close.

409
00:43:36,250 --> 00:43:37,375
I come here a lot.

410
00:43:38,333 --> 00:43:42,458
I used to come with the Chef.
Now he trusts me to come here alone.

411
00:43:44,291 --> 00:43:45,458
He used to come here?

412
00:43:46,208 --> 00:43:47,208
Hmm.

413
00:43:47,958 --> 00:43:52,333
Chef told me that, uh,
even the most luxurious dishes

414
00:43:52,416 --> 00:43:56,083
rely on ingredients provided
or produced by poorer people.

415
00:43:56,958 --> 00:43:59,666
He always pays them well,
but on one condition.

416
00:43:59,750 --> 00:44:02,250
They should always provide him
with their very best.

417
00:44:04,416 --> 00:44:05,416
That way...

418
00:44:06,458 --> 00:44:10,708
all the villagers feel proud
of their products and earn good money.

419
00:44:10,791 --> 00:44:11,791
[man] Here.

420
00:44:12,541 --> 00:44:13,958
- Thank you.
- [woman chuckles]

421
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:16,583
[woman] Are you full already?

422
00:44:17,416 --> 00:44:19,416
So, cooking for rich people

423
00:44:20,375 --> 00:44:21,708
also benefits the poor?

424
00:44:24,291 --> 00:44:25,375
Chef's all right.

425
00:44:29,208 --> 00:44:30,208
[Tone] Here, Chef.

426
00:44:33,750 --> 00:44:34,910
See if there are any fresher.

427
00:44:35,458 --> 00:44:38,125
- [Tone] Yes, Chef.
- Chef, would you taste the sauce, please?

428
00:44:41,625 --> 00:44:43,708
[Paul] Reduce it and add salt.

429
00:44:43,791 --> 00:44:44,791
Yes, Chef.

430
00:44:45,375 --> 00:44:46,375
[Dang] Chef.

431
00:44:48,666 --> 00:44:51,458
[Paul] Find ingredients
that are more "golden."

432
00:44:53,541 --> 00:44:55,458
Chef, is there anything for me to fry?

433
00:44:56,833 --> 00:44:57,833
No.

434
00:44:59,833 --> 00:45:01,273
What am I supposed to be doing then?

435
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:06,833
Scrub the pots and pans.
Mop the floor. Take out the trash.

436
00:45:07,458 --> 00:45:08,833
Lots for you to do.

437
00:45:09,375 --> 00:45:11,125
But I'm a junior sous-chef.

438
00:45:12,791 --> 00:45:13,791
Says who?

439
00:45:15,166 --> 00:45:16,833
Last job, I did all the frying.

440
00:45:17,333 --> 00:45:19,958
Last time is last time.
This time you're a cook helper.

441
00:45:20,750 --> 00:45:23,166
No, but I'm a junior sous-chef.
I should rea...

442
00:45:23,250 --> 00:45:24,458
[Paul inhales sharply]

443
00:45:28,750 --> 00:45:30,750
What makes you think you're so important?

444
00:45:37,708 --> 00:45:38,708
You see Bae?

445
00:45:40,875 --> 00:45:42,416
Try chopping like he does.

446
00:45:59,333 --> 00:46:01,875
[knife slicing]

447
00:46:01,958 --> 00:46:02,958
Faster.

448
00:46:04,166 --> 00:46:06,541
[knife slicing faster]

449
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:11,000
Faster.

450
00:46:13,333 --> 00:46:14,333
Faster.

451
00:46:15,041 --> 00:46:16,833
Faster. Faster.

452
00:46:17,791 --> 00:46:18,916
Faster!

453
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:20,708
- [grunts]
- [knife clatters]

454
00:46:21,958 --> 00:46:23,958
[hisses in pain]

455
00:46:25,875 --> 00:46:27,000
Besides frying...

456
00:46:28,666 --> 00:46:30,583
there is nothing else you can do.

457
00:46:32,291 --> 00:46:34,916
So what makes you think
you deserve the privilege?

458
00:46:51,458 --> 00:46:53,458
[dance music playing]

459
00:47:00,583 --> 00:47:03,541
[cheering]

460
00:47:03,625 --> 00:47:05,625
[woman] More! I want more!

461
00:47:07,500 --> 00:47:08,625
[whoops]

462
00:47:08,708 --> 00:47:10,708
- Oh my God, this is so good.
- Ooh!

463
00:47:11,958 --> 00:47:13,916
- You having fun? Yeah? Keep it up.
- Amazing.

464
00:47:14,625 --> 00:47:17,250
- Hey y'all! Let's party!
- [guests cheering, whooping]

465
00:47:21,166 --> 00:47:22,166
Yeah!

466
00:47:23,250 --> 00:47:24,958
Hey! I said fuck off.

467
00:47:25,583 --> 00:47:28,208
Hey, ladies! Want some cash? There you go!

468
00:47:28,291 --> 00:47:30,541
[women giggling]

469
00:47:30,625 --> 00:47:31,875
[growls playfully]

470
00:47:33,958 --> 00:47:35,958
[dance music continues]

471
00:47:46,541 --> 00:47:47,625
[speaks indistinctly]

472
00:48:01,041 --> 00:48:02,041
Enjoy.

473
00:48:18,333 --> 00:48:19,375
Mm!

474
00:48:21,291 --> 00:48:22,333
It's delicious.

475
00:48:22,833 --> 00:48:25,208
- Hey! This is great.
- [guests cheering]

476
00:48:25,291 --> 00:48:27,666
[man] Whoo! Amazing, dude!
- [host] Wicked!

477
00:48:27,750 --> 00:48:29,541
Wait a sec, I got you a present, bro.

478
00:48:30,166 --> 00:48:31,791
- [all laughing]
- Hey!

479
00:48:31,875 --> 00:48:33,291
I swear you're gonna love it, man!

480
00:48:33,375 --> 00:48:35,791
[host] Let's go, Prang. Come on, come on!

481
00:48:36,750 --> 00:48:38,416
[guests cheering]

482
00:48:48,625 --> 00:48:51,375
- Ooh! That's what I'm talkin' 'bout!
- Hot!

483
00:48:51,458 --> 00:48:54,375
- My man! He rocks!
- [host] Yeah!

484
00:48:55,375 --> 00:48:57,000
Oh! Let me have some of that.

485
00:48:58,333 --> 00:48:59,416
Oh, man!

486
00:49:00,708 --> 00:49:01,833
That's my dream right there.

487
00:49:02,791 --> 00:49:05,458
Look at those brats.
I mean, they're younger than us.

488
00:49:07,250 --> 00:49:08,250
[Tone] That they are.

489
00:49:08,750 --> 00:49:10,541
But can you make a fortune in crypto?

490
00:49:11,208 --> 00:49:12,208
No.

491
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:14,208
But we're Chef Paul's crew.

492
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:17,250
They're all over him.
Practically worship him.

493
00:49:17,958 --> 00:49:20,625
No, you're wrong. Look at them.

494
00:49:21,375 --> 00:49:23,916
They don't even know
what's good and what's not.

495
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:26,666
They only hired Chef Paul
for bragging rights.

496
00:49:26,750 --> 00:49:28,375
We're nobody to them.

497
00:49:29,583 --> 00:49:32,833
We'll never be anything else.
Till the day we die.

498
00:49:34,916 --> 00:49:36,833
As long as you don't make your own menu,

499
00:49:37,833 --> 00:49:39,041
you're invisible.

500
00:49:40,458 --> 00:49:41,625
Just keep that in mind.

501
00:49:43,333 --> 00:49:45,458
[guests continue chattering and laughing]

502
00:49:54,333 --> 00:49:55,958
Wow! Pork chop, sis!

503
00:49:58,166 --> 00:49:59,166
Try it.

504
00:50:04,458 --> 00:50:05,458
Hmm.

505
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:13,000
It's good.

506
00:50:13,541 --> 00:50:14,375
[Aoy] Really?

507
00:50:14,458 --> 00:50:15,833
You really think so?

508
00:50:17,041 --> 00:50:18,791
[Joy] Mm. It's good.

509
00:50:20,250 --> 00:50:24,416
There you go. You wanted to try it.
Cost almost six dollars.

510
00:50:25,166 --> 00:50:26,291
That's expensive!

511
00:50:26,375 --> 00:50:27,375
Oh, yeah.

512
00:50:27,958 --> 00:50:30,208
The barista said the coffee beans
won some kind of award

513
00:50:30,291 --> 00:50:33,291
and are single-sourced
from Kenya, I think.

514
00:50:33,375 --> 00:50:34,583
Anyway, just try it.

515
00:50:39,916 --> 00:50:41,166
- Mm.
- [Au] How is it?

516
00:50:43,583 --> 00:50:44,583
Mm.

517
00:50:45,333 --> 00:50:46,708
Pork chop and coffee.

518
00:50:48,208 --> 00:50:50,291
I don't get the modern world.

519
00:50:50,958 --> 00:50:54,833
It's got to be special.
So they can sell it at a higher price.

520
00:50:54,916 --> 00:50:58,958
Is it expensive 'cause it's special?
Or special 'cause it's expensive?

521
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:03,000
Oh, wow.

522
00:51:07,291 --> 00:51:08,416
Crybaby noodles?

523
00:51:09,125 --> 00:51:10,125
- Yeah!
- Oh, yeah!

524
00:51:10,708 --> 00:51:11,833
All right.

525
00:51:16,125 --> 00:51:16,958
You made this?

526
00:51:17,041 --> 00:51:18,750
- Mm.
- Let me try.

527
00:51:19,291 --> 00:51:20,625
- Hey, hey, hey!
- Hey.

528
00:51:20,708 --> 00:51:21,708
- Wait.
- What?

529
00:51:21,750 --> 00:51:24,708
- Don't use your hands!
- Hey, I do like my ancestors.

530
00:51:26,458 --> 00:51:27,458
Use a fork!

531
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:30,000
Ooh!

532
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:32,960
Tastes like the cheap pork
you find on the street.

533

- The same.

- Oh!

You just added pepper.

[Aoy] Hmm.

- Am I holding it right?
- Yes.

552
00:52:44,208 --> 00:52:46,958
No. Do it like this.
Curl in the fingers of your left hand.

553

- Mm-hmm.
- Lift the right hand.

554

Hold it straight, nice and firm,
and press down.

Now, press the meat into the pan,

Come on. Give it a good shake.

- I mean, shake it.
- What about the angle?

See?

Oh. Hmm.

581
00:54:39,875 --> 00:54:43,416
And I think
you massaged the meat a little too much.

582
00:54:44,291 --> 00:54:47,916
With a good cut of meat,
a gentle rub is all it takes.

583

Or else, the marinade takes over.

Okay. I'll try it again.

How is it?

596
00:57:10,916 --> 00:57:12,166
The fat is undercooked.

- Here. Look.

The fat bits, there's still some white.

599
00:57:19,166 --> 00:57:22,416
You have to be meticulous.
Make sure it's evenly cooked.

00:57:23,333 --> 00:57:24,375
Is that clear?

00:57:25,500 --> 00:57:29,875
- You still have a lot to learn.
- He's right. Still got a long way to go.

Not just in terms of flavor,
but swagger, also.

01:12:08,166 --> 01:12:10,000
Chef Paul has no family?

712
01:12:19,166 --> 01:12:21,166
[somber music playing]

713
01:13:03,583 --> 01:13:05,458
[nurse] Flowers from the deputy, sir.

714
01:13:06,333 --> 01:13:09,208
[Paul] Take them out!
Do they think I'm dead or something?

715
01:13:09,291 --> 01:13:11,416
I don't want damn funeral flowers!

716
01:13:14,000 --> 01:13:15,916
- Not eating.
- It's important you eat...

717
01:13:16,000 --> 01:13:17,291
Who would eat this shit?

718
01:13:17,375 --> 01:13:19,041
You need food if you want to get better.

719
01:13:19,125 --> 01:13:21,833
This isn't food! I'm a chef.
Get this shit out of my face!

720
01:13:24,916 --> 01:13:25,916
[door opens]

721
01:14:04,458 --> 01:14:05,458
Noodles.

722
01:14:08,125 --> 01:14:10,250
[scoffs] What's so good about them?

723
01:14:13,166 --> 01:14:15,125
Crybaby noodles, it's my grandma's dish.

724
01:14:16,500 --> 01:14:21,083
It's... When my dad was a child,
he used to cry an awful lot.

725
01:14:21,583 --> 01:14:23,291
And he was a really fussy eater.

726
01:14:23,916 --> 01:14:26,416
So to get him to stop crying
and start eating,

727
01:14:26,500 --> 01:14:29,750
Grandma tried anything and everything,
and eventually came up with this.

728
01:14:30,958 --> 01:14:33,916
It's a really tasty dish.
And made with love.

729
01:14:34,583 --> 01:14:36,958
My dad always loved it.
The recipe got passed down.

730
01:14:37,041 --> 01:14:38,166
It's a family favorite.

731
01:14:41,875 --> 01:14:42,875
[sniffs]

732
01:15:01,250 --> 01:15:03,250
Miso paste mixed with XO sauce.

733
01:15:05,458 --> 01:15:07,083
You can tell with just one bite?

734
01:15:08,916 --> 01:15:09,916
Hmm!

735
01:15:11,333 --> 01:15:12,333
Made with love, huh?

736
01:15:15,125 --> 01:15:18,125
Sentimental excuse
for when you're stuck living in poverty.

737
01:15:18,916 --> 01:15:22,583
To me, love has nothing to do with food.

738
01:15:27,166 --> 01:15:28,250
To be a chef, you need...

739
01:15:29,291 --> 01:15:30,791
a stronger drive than love.

740
01:15:37,291 --> 01:15:39,083
[sighs] So...

741
01:15:41,958 --> 01:15:43,875
what drove you to become a chef?

742
01:15:59,583 --> 01:16:02,041
[tense music playing]

743
01:16:02,125 --> 01:16:03,750
[Paul] A jar of caviar.

744
01:16:17,916 --> 01:16:19,166
My mother was a maid.

745
01:16:23,041 --> 01:16:25,791
I watched how the rich live their lives.

746
01:16:27,875 --> 01:16:29,083
And it made me wonder.

747
01:16:31,791 --> 01:16:34,375
How come we never get to use
what they use?

748
01:16:36,083 --> 01:16:38,583
Why didn't we ever get to eat
what they eat?

749
01:16:47,541 --> 01:16:50,458
Especially those shiny black beads
in a jar.

750
01:16:50,541 --> 01:16:52,000
I knew they were expensive.

751
01:16:52,916 --> 01:16:54,916
[tense music continues]

752
01:17:01,083 --> 01:17:02,708
Put that back!

753
01:17:11,333 --> 01:17:13,791
Caviar is something
the poor can never afford.

754
01:17:15,125 --> 01:17:17,125
[no audible dialogue]

755
01:17:19,500 --> 01:17:22,166
[Paul] My mother had to
work her ass off for months

756
01:17:22,250 --> 01:17:24,791
just to pay for that tiny jar of caviar.

757
01:17:31,500 --> 01:17:35,250
After I got caught,
we had to clean up the mess.

758
01:17:35,875 --> 01:17:37,583
The caviar was all over the floor.

759
01:17:38,916 --> 01:17:40,916
[tense music continues]

760
01:17:55,708 --> 01:17:57,208
You know what really surprised me?

761
01:18:02,416 --> 01:18:04,083
It tasted like total shit!

762
01:18:10,375 --> 01:18:12,541
[tense music intensifies]

763
01:18:12,625 --> 01:18:16,875
What you eat
represents your social status.

764
01:18:18,416 --> 01:18:20,041
It has nothing to do with love.

765
01:18:23,875 --> 01:18:27,875
The poor eat
simply to satisfy their hunger.

766
01:18:29,791 --> 01:18:32,000
But when you have more than enough to eat...

767
01:18:34,500 --> 01:18:35,916
your hunger doesn't end.

768
01:18:39,333 --> 01:18:40,750
You hunger for approval,

769
01:18:42,000 --> 01:18:43,541
for something special,

770
01:18:45,041 --> 01:18:47,166
for exclusive experiences.

771
01:18:52,041 --> 01:18:57,791
That shitty caviar made me realize
that I wanted to be a chef.

772
01:19:00,500 --> 01:19:04,041
I wanted to be the kind of chef
that the rich bow down to,

773
01:19:04,125 --> 01:19:05,750
begging him to cook for them.

774
01:19:10,666 --> 01:19:12,916
I would make them hungry for <i>me</i>.

- Joy!
- Sis!

785
01:20:13,791 --> 01:20:15,750
What's going on?
Why isn't he being treated?

786
01:20:15,833 --> 01:20:18,500
[crying] Well, the nurse said
there are no beds available.

787
01:20:19,666 --> 01:20:22,500
[nurse] Please, one at a time.
You have to wait until we call you.

788
01:20:22,583 --> 01:20:26,500
Nurse! What are you doing?
Why is my father still lying over there?

[overlapping arguments]

790

- [nurse] Please, calm down.
- My dad is gonna die!

791
01:20:30,208 --> 01:20:33,375
- He needs to be seen right away!
- [man] My father's been here for hours.

792
01:20:33,458 --> 01:20:35,601
- You wait in line with everyone else.
- So is my father!

[silence]

794
01:21:00,958 --> 01:21:02,000
What did the doctor say?

795
01:21:02,708 --> 01:21:06,875
He's just had bypass surgery
but he's still not out of the woods yet.

796
01:21:07,541 --> 01:21:09,750
They're keeping him under observation.

797
01:21:19,625 --> 01:21:22,166
I don't know. Isn't there a way
we could get a better room?

01:31:21,000 --> 01:31:23,291
But why, Tone? It's a great opportunity.

886
01:31:24,333 --> 01:31:26,375
Yes. For you, it is.

887
01:31:27,083 --> 01:31:30,541
But I wouldn't feel right
working under you.

888
01:31:33,250 --> 01:31:34,791
Let me introduce your kitchen crew.

889
01:31:39,875 --> 01:31:42,833
In the kitchen,
there is no room for democracy.

890
01:31:44,041 --> 01:31:45,125
It's a dictatorship.

891
01:31:45,208 --> 01:31:47,208
[music intensifies]

892
01:31:48,541 --> 01:31:49,541
Here, Chef.

893
01:31:51,625 --> 01:31:52,833
- Thicker.
- Yes, Chef.

894
01:31:52,916 --> 01:31:54,208
How's this, Chef?

895
01:31:55,875 --> 01:31:56,875
Try some other colors.

896
01:32:44,875 --> 01:32:47,333
[music softens]

897
01:32:55,125 --> 01:32:56,125
Prawn tastes good.

898
01:32:59,041 --> 01:33:01,791
Everything is cooked just right.

899
01:33:05,125 --> 01:33:06,791
But you're playing it too safe.

900
01:33:09,125 --> 01:33:11,125
You're still in your comfort zone.

901
01:33:12,625 --> 01:33:13,708
Nothing here

902
01:33:14,208 --> 01:33:16,458
reflects your identity, who you are.

903
01:33:19,916 --> 01:33:22,583
I'm not investing in you
for Chef Paul's food.

904
01:33:26,166 --> 01:33:28,083
[suspenseful music building]

905
01:33:47,208 --> 01:33:48,291
[sniffs]

906
01:33:57,000 --> 01:33:58,666
No, not this one. It's too long.

907
01:33:59,708 --> 01:34:00,708
Chef, the sauce.

908
01:34:02,291 --> 01:34:03,541
You call this red?

909
01:34:13,375 --> 01:34:14,958
The pork slices are too thick!

910
01:34:20,166 --> 01:34:21,333
You're in Paul's crew?

911
01:34:21,916 --> 01:34:22,916
Not anymore.

912
01:34:24,291 --> 01:34:25,541
[man] Good for you.

913
01:34:27,416 --> 01:34:30,791
Forget about him. Don't copy what he does.

914
01:34:30,875 --> 01:34:33,791
Just stick to what you know
and what you do best.

915
01:34:33,875 --> 01:34:36,666
[suspenseful music continues]

916
01:34:59,041 --> 01:35:01,041

01:35:11,250 --> 01:35:13,625
- [soft jazz playing]
- [quiet conversation]

918
01:35:24,208 --> 01:35:26,208
[no audible dialogue]

[patrons laughing]

920
01:35:49,583 --> 01:35:50,583
[music ends]

921
01:35:52,541 --> 01:35:56,500
[Au] "The chic chef who plays with fire."
It's going viral.

922
01:35:57,791 --> 01:36:00,583
The comments say,
"So hard to get a table!"

923
01:36:01,750 --> 01:36:03,666
[high voice] "Have to book a month ahead!"

924
01:36:05,875 --> 01:36:07,666
[Joy laughs]

925
01:36:07,750 --> 01:36:10,291
Oh, well, she finally made it.

926
01:36:12,583 --> 01:36:14,208
Aoy is famous now.

927
01:36:17,125 --> 01:36:18,125
[chuckles] Hmm.

928
01:36:23,541 --> 01:36:24,541
[door opens]

929
01:36:25,666 --> 01:36:26,875
Come in, please, I...

930
01:36:41,250 --> 01:36:43,250
[somber music playing]

931
01:37:18,916 --> 01:37:20,916
[music fades]

932
01:37:21,000 --> 01:37:22,958
[Tone] This place won't survive
till next month.

933
01:37:32,541 --> 01:37:35,083
Following my dream
is harder than I thought.

934
01:37:37,250 --> 01:37:38,708
I don't know how to run a business.

935
01:37:43,875 --> 01:37:44,875
No.

936
01:37:46,791 --> 01:37:48,750
It's the location of the restaurant.

937
01:37:48,833 --> 01:37:50,458
You're too far from the main street.

938
01:37:53,083 --> 01:37:54,083
Yeah, right.

939
01:37:56,333 --> 01:37:57,875
I don't have a sponsor like you.

940
01:37:59,708 --> 01:38:00,708
Oh.

941
01:38:01,458 --> 01:38:04,250
This is the only area
where I can afford the rent.

942
01:38:05,208 --> 01:38:06,208
Why do you say that?

943
01:38:10,125 --> 01:38:12,333
Tone, it's not just
because I have a sponsor.

944
01:38:12,416 --> 01:38:14,333
It's because I work really hard.

945
01:38:16,000 --> 01:38:18,000
You mean if I get all these burns,

946
01:38:19,541 --> 01:38:20,708
I'll succeed too?

947
01:38:20,791 --> 01:38:22,208
Hey! Don't be a jerk.

948
01:38:24,125 --> 01:38:26,500
What I've achieved,
you don't think I came by it honestly?

949
01:38:26,583 --> 01:38:28,000
I don't deserve it?

950
01:38:32,375 --> 01:38:33,583
Okay, so what?

951
01:38:38,333 --> 01:38:40,250
You want me to congratulate you?

952
01:38:43,458 --> 01:38:45,208
Congratulations, Aoy!

953
01:38:46,125 --> 01:38:47,708
You are the best.

954
01:38:47,791 --> 01:38:48,791
Tone!

955
01:38:50,791 --> 01:38:53,416
You seem to forget,
you're the one who brought me into this.

956
01:38:55,083 --> 01:38:56,083
Yeah.

957
01:38:58,708 --> 01:39:00,750
And I don't regret the decision one bit.

958
01:39:03,125 --> 01:39:06,000
The day I saw you,
I knew you were better than me.

959
01:39:11,708 --> 01:39:13,625
I saw how much talent you had.

960
01:39:21,916 --> 01:39:22,916
I was jealous.

961
01:39:25,250 --> 01:39:27,250
[somber music playing]

962
01:39:33,166 --> 01:39:34,166
You know what?

963
01:39:35,291 --> 01:39:37,625
The reason why
you can't make your dream come true

964
01:39:39,291 --> 01:39:41,416
is because you're not hungry enough.

965
01:39:47,833 --> 01:39:48,833
That hurt.

966
01:39:52,958 --> 01:39:54,458
You sounded just like Chef.

967
01:39:56,416 --> 01:39:57,500
[inhales sharply]

968
01:40:00,333 --> 01:40:02,000
[Tone] But maybe you're right.

969
01:40:04,541 --> 01:40:06,041
I'm just not hungry enough.

970
01:40:11,375 --> 01:40:13,625
[breathes deeply]

971
01:40:18,458 --> 01:40:20,458
[somber music continues]

972
01:40:26,875 --> 01:40:30,041
[door opens, closes]

973
01:40:42,125 --> 01:40:44,125
[lively chatter]

974
01:41:03,916 --> 01:41:05,375
[sighs]

975
01:41:05,458 --> 01:41:06,458
Mr. Tos?

976
01:41:07,166 --> 01:41:10,041
Do you remember Tone,
a sous-chef from Hunger?

977
01:41:10,125 --> 01:41:11,833
You think you could help him out?

978
01:41:12,916 --> 01:41:13,916
[Tos] Tone.

979
01:41:14,291 --> 01:41:15,291
I remember him.

980
01:41:17,166 --> 01:41:18,541
I'll be frank with you, Aoy.

981
01:41:20,250 --> 01:41:22,208
He has absolutely no selling point.

982
01:41:23,583 --> 01:41:26,541
Yes, but he's very skilled and works hard.

983
01:41:26,625 --> 01:41:27,875
He is a brilliant cook.

984
01:41:27,958 --> 01:41:28,958
I'm sure he is.

985
01:41:29,583 --> 01:41:30,583
I believe you.

986
01:41:31,500 --> 01:41:33,416
But there are a million like him
out there.

987
01:41:33,500 --> 01:41:35,500
I don't want someone who cooks well.

988
01:41:35,583 --> 01:41:37,666
I want someone with character.

989
01:41:45,958 --> 01:41:48,916
Okay. I'll have a chat with him.

990
01:41:50,291 --> 01:41:51,291
Thank you.

991
01:42:00,541 --> 01:42:01,541
You're doing well.

992
01:42:03,375 --> 01:42:05,208
But you can definitely do better.

993
01:42:09,875 --> 01:42:10,875
Cheers!

994
01:42:16,875 --> 01:42:20,125
By the way,
there's a big event next week.

995
01:42:21,041 --> 01:42:23,541
It'll be your first
since we've opened our restaurant.

996
01:42:24,166 --> 01:42:25,875
Madam Milky's birthday party.

997
01:42:27,625 --> 01:42:30,083
- What, Madam Milky, the socialite?
- That's right.

998
01:42:30,583 --> 01:42:32,208
Wants you and no one else.

999
01:42:33,083 --> 01:42:34,708
A-listers on the guest list.

1000
01:42:35,375 --> 01:42:38,458
Top celebrities. Business people.

1001
01:42:38,541 --> 01:42:40,791
Even international foodies.

1002
01:42:42,958 --> 01:42:45,958
This restaurant's been open for months.
The hype isn't there yet.

1003
01:42:46,625 --> 01:42:48,208
We need something sensational.

1004
01:42:49,458 --> 01:42:50,708
This is your coming out.

1005
01:42:51,541 --> 01:42:53,750
Your chance to be discovered
by the whole country.

1006
01:43:02,875 --> 01:43:04,041
[man] See you tomorrow, Chef.

1007

[line ringing]

1008
01:43:42,875 --> 01:43:43,875
[Au] <i>Hello?</i>

01:43:44,291 --> 01:43:46,000
You're not in bed yet?

<i>Won't be long. What's up?</i>

01:43:51,041 --> 01:43:52,708
Did you eat anything tonight?

1012

<i>Nah, I don't know what to eat.</i>

1013
01:43:57,791 --> 01:44:00,583
You, Jang and the gang
should come to my restaurant.

1014
01:44:01,166 --> 01:44:04,000
I haven't seen you guys in ages.
It'll be my treat.

1015
01:44:04,083 --> 01:44:06,125
I miss you guys. Really.

1016
01:44:08,041 --> 01:44:12,291
<i>I've already asked them.
It sounds like they were very busy lately.</i>

1017
01:44:13,750 --> 01:44:15,333
Oh? Doing what?

1018
01:44:17,208 --> 01:44:18,500
They're so fussy.

1019
01:44:19,166 --> 01:44:20,666
<i>Ah, don't blame them.</i>

1020
01:44:23,250 --> 01:44:24,458
<i>Look who's talking, huh?</i>

1021
01:44:25,583 --> 01:44:26,875
Everything all right?

1022
01:44:29,416 --> 01:44:36,416
TEMPORARILY CLOSED

1023
01:44:38,250 --> 01:44:39,500
Come home, Aoy.

1024
01:44:42,041 --> 01:44:44,458
Dad's gonna be discharged
from the hospital soon.

[somber music playing]

1026
01:44:50,541 --> 01:44:52,708
<i>You've already made it, haven't you?</i>

1027
01:44:54,666 --> 01:44:56,500
<i>What more do you have to prove?</i>

1028
01:45:09,708 --> 01:45:11,083
I've only just started.

1029
01:45:14,416 --> 01:45:16,291
Take care of Dad for me, won't you?

1030
01:45:18,541 --> 01:45:19,541
[Au sighs]

1031
01:45:20,291 --> 01:45:21,291
<i>Yeah, sure thing.</i>

1032
01:45:27,250 --> 01:45:28,250
<i>Aoy...</i>

1033
01:45:31,500 --> 01:45:32,583
<i>I miss you.</i>

[laughs softly]

1035
01:45:38,833 --> 01:45:40,500
That's so incredibly corny.

1036
01:45:42,041 --> 01:45:43,791
Corny, my ass. I mean it.

1037
01:45:45,458 --> 01:45:48,041
The neighbors around here
said you've changed a lot.

1038
01:45:50,125 --> 01:45:51,125
I don't buy it.

1039
01:45:54,500 --> 01:45:56,208
You're still the same old Aoy to me.

Hang on. Sorry, we're closed...

[music fades]

1044
01:47:25,916 --> 01:47:27,583
You're not gonna say anything?

1045
01:47:31,250 --> 01:47:32,333
What's the point?

1046
01:47:33,625 --> 01:47:35,125
You're a famous chef now.

1047
01:47:36,166 --> 01:47:39,916
My comments... mean nothing.
Only your customers' do.

1048
01:47:44,416 --> 01:47:46,500
Still, I want to know
what you think of it.

1049
01:47:52,791 --> 01:47:56,916
My opinions aren't as important
as all those rich people Tos takes you to...

1050

kiss the asses of, every month or so.

1051
01:48:04,458 --> 01:48:06,666
Tos is a damn good businessman.

1052
01:48:08,500 --> 01:48:12,208
So... you're special now. How is it?

1053
01:48:13,625 --> 01:48:14,625
Is it fun?

1054
01:48:24,041 --> 01:48:25,291
It's scary, isn't it?

1055
01:48:33,250 --> 01:48:35,250
[unsettling music playing]

1056
01:48:37,833 --> 01:48:38,833
From now on,

1057
01:48:41,750 --> 01:48:43,666
all you will ever think about

1058
01:48:45,750 --> 01:48:47,666
is, "When will I fall off the edge?"

1059
01:48:49,416 --> 01:48:50,791
"Am I still relevant?"

1060
01:48:52,458 --> 01:48:54,208
"Is this really for me?"

1061
01:49:00,125 --> 01:49:04,000
You'll cling to your success at all cost
without realizing what you've lost.

1062
01:49:07,041 --> 01:49:08,041
Like Tone.

1063
01:49:10,041 --> 01:49:11,541
You've lost him, haven't you?

1064
01:49:17,833 --> 01:49:18,833
But don't panic yet.

1065
01:49:20,958 --> 01:49:22,125
This is just the start.

1066
01:49:24,291 --> 01:49:26,333
There is so much more for you to lose.

1067
01:49:29,375 --> 01:49:33,750
That... is the price for being special.

1068
01:49:35,916 --> 01:49:37,916
[unsettling music continues]

1069
01:49:51,083 --> 01:49:54,750
It's a shame.
I couldn't teach you all I wanted to.

1070
01:50:03,291 --> 01:50:04,416
But that's okay.

1071
01:50:05,708 --> 01:50:10,666
I'll see you soon anyway
at the party for Madam Milky's birthday.

1072
01:50:14,875 --> 01:50:16,250
What are you talking about?

1073
01:50:20,083 --> 01:50:23,875
I'm saying
you're not the only chef she's hired.

01:51:17,958 --> 01:51:22,291
- [woman 1] Hi! Welcome. How are you doing?
- [woman 2] Hi!

1080
01:51:24,708 --> 01:51:26,166
Oh!

1081
01:51:28,541 --> 01:51:29,541
[man] You look great.

1084
01:51:33,458 --> 01:51:35,125
Thank you. Enjoy yourself.

[chuckles]

1086
01:51:40,500 --> 01:51:41,625
Have fun, Elsa!

1087
01:51:46,375 --> 01:51:48,291
Hey, you! Is Chef Paul here?

1088
01:51:51,500 --> 01:51:53,166
Chef Paul's station is over there.

1089
01:51:53,250 --> 01:51:54,250
Oh!

1090
01:51:55,291 --> 01:51:58,500
Ah! You're with Mr. Tos, right?
What's your name?

1091
01:52:02,333 --> 01:52:03,541
Oh! Chef Paul's here.

1092
01:52:08,791 --> 01:52:10,125
Good evening, Chef.

1093
01:52:10,916 --> 01:52:12,916
Shall we take a picture together?

1094
01:52:13,000 --> 01:52:13,833
Of course.

1095
01:52:13,916 --> 01:52:15,916
[guests chattering]

1096
01:52:18,583 --> 01:52:21,166
Okay. A little closer, please.

1097
01:52:21,875 --> 01:52:22,875
Ready?

1098
01:52:24,791 --> 01:52:25,791
Just ignore him.

1099
01:52:27,125 --> 01:52:28,208
Focus on your job.

1100
01:52:29,541 --> 01:52:31,041
You are not going to lose.

1101
01:52:37,750 --> 01:52:40,208
It feels like
I'm being slaughtered in public.

1102
01:52:40,958 --> 01:52:45,250
Come on! Chin up!
I brought him here to cheer you on.

1103
01:52:52,125 --> 01:52:53,125
Mr. Tos,

1104
01:52:54,041 --> 01:52:57,416
is it true that Madam Milky
specifically asked for us?

1105
01:52:59,208 --> 01:53:00,208
Why?

1106
01:53:02,291 --> 01:53:04,291

Triumph of the New Wave.

[lively conversation]

1112
01:54:47,291 --> 01:54:48,375
For you.

1113
01:54:50,083 --> 01:54:51,666
[man] This foam, is it edible?

1114
01:54:51,750 --> 01:54:53,830
- [crew] Everything is edible, sir.
- [camera clicks]

1115
01:54:54,791 --> 01:54:56,500
[woman] The fish is simply amazing.

1116
01:55:01,208 --> 01:55:02,208
Mm!

1117
01:55:07,166 --> 01:55:09,166

[tense music continues]

1122

Crybaby noodles.

1132
02:00:51,458 --> 02:00:54,083
A home recipe passed down from my grandma.

1133
02:00:56,458 --> 02:01:00,750
Each of us has this one dish
that makes us feel right at home.

1134
02:01:02,833 --> 02:01:06,291
As one gets older, you toil away,

1135
02:01:08,000 --> 02:01:09,291
and feel lonely.

1136
02:01:12,041 --> 02:01:14,541
Then you go home and eat this dish...

1137
02:01:17,291 --> 02:01:18,708
and you feel better.

1138
02:01:22,250 --> 02:01:23,916
And it makes you realize...

1139
02:01:27,833 --> 02:01:29,625
there's always someone who loves you.

1140
02:01:31,500 --> 02:01:33,916
And you love them also, just as much.

1141
02:01:40,291 --> 02:01:41,291
Enjoy.

1142
02:02:07,833 --> 02:02:08,833
Mm.

1143
02:02:16,625 --> 02:02:18,416
The noodles taste amazing.

1144
02:02:19,208 --> 02:02:21,666
The look is somewhat ordinary,
but it's delicious.

1145
02:02:29,625 --> 02:02:31,625
[trickling echoes]

1146
02:02:33,750 --> 02:02:36,333

[trickling echoes]

1148
02:03:06,250 --> 02:03:08,125
How about some soup to counter the oil?

1149
02:03:10,833 --> 02:03:12,291
Ordinary people.

1150
02:03:13,333 --> 02:03:16,750
'Cause in the end, we are simply human.

1151
02:03:18,583 --> 02:03:19,708
Enjoy.

[uneasy music continues]

1153
02:03:24,208 --> 02:03:25,500
[man] That's great.

1154
02:03:27,791 --> 02:03:29,041
Let's go taste this.

1155
02:03:30,166 --> 02:03:32,375
[excited chatter]

1156
02:03:35,208 --> 02:03:36,750
[inhales deeply]

1157
02:03:56,166 --> 02:03:57,166
Wow.

[uneasy music continues]

1160
02:04:18,458 --> 02:04:20,916
This is the final lesson I have for you.

1161
02:04:23,666 --> 02:04:25,875
No matter how good your food is,

1162
02:04:26,416 --> 02:04:28,083
how sophisticated it looks,

1163
02:04:28,833 --> 02:04:30,708
or how creative your menu is...

1164
02:04:33,625 --> 02:04:36,333
prejudice is something
you can never overcome.

1165
02:04:42,916 --> 02:04:44,291
These people know who I am.

1166
02:04:46,375 --> 02:04:48,458
They've already crowned me the winner.

1167
02:04:55,583 --> 02:04:57,625
Because they are hungry for <i>me</i>.

1168
02:05:01,208 --> 02:05:02,208
Don't you get it?

1169
02:05:10,250 --> 02:05:12,250
[music ends]

1170
02:05:17,416 --> 02:05:19,375
We need to bring you in for questioning.

1173
02:05:24,583 --> 02:05:26,166

[phones chiming]

1175
02:05:33,500 --> 02:05:34,625
[woman] Did you see this?

1176
02:05:34,708 --> 02:05:35,708
[man] What's this?

1177
02:05:38,250 --> 02:05:40,583
[hunter] <i>Chef, put this on a plate for me.</i>

1180
02:05:47,458 --> 02:05:49,583
- [woman] What?
- [man 2] That's disgusting.

1181
02:05:51,458 --> 02:05:52,791
<i>Delicious.</i>

1182
02:05:53,875 --> 02:05:55,083

[dramatic music continues]

1187
02:06:49,791 --> 02:06:53,083
Thanks, all of you,
for releasing the clip.

1188
02:06:55,416 --> 02:06:56,958
I will get away with it anyway.

1189
02:07:01,500 --> 02:07:04,166
And then
even more rich people will line up

1190
02:07:04,875 --> 02:07:06,791
and take me out hunting with them.

1191
02:07:06,875 --> 02:07:08,291
[man] Oh, that's disgusting.

1192
02:07:09,333 --> 02:07:10,625
Because people like me...

1193
02:07:12,416 --> 02:07:14,708
we are totally above the law.

1194
02:07:16,916 --> 02:07:19,875
[woman] Take him away! Oh! That's it.

1195
02:07:21,416 --> 02:07:24,250
Are you absolutely sure
that's how you wanna play it?

1196
02:07:24,958 --> 02:07:26,208
[policeman] Come on.

1197
02:07:29,166 --> 02:07:30,958
- Well done, Chef.
- [policeman] Sir, come.

1198
02:07:31,666 --> 02:07:33,000
[Paul] Congratulations, Chef.

1199
02:07:33,541 --> 02:07:34,791
Well done, Chef!

[music fades]

1201
02:07:55,666 --> 02:07:59,250
I want to say
all your dishes were phenomenal.

1202
02:08:00,000 --> 02:08:04,541
I've always thought that
Chef Paul's cuisine was so pretentious.

1203
02:08:04,625 --> 02:08:06,666
[muffled] Yours is far more genuine.

1204
02:08:06,750 --> 02:08:10,000
[muffled] And now,
the next part of our show, "Spartacus"!

1208
02:08:20,875 --> 02:08:24,250
Aoy. I'm happy for you. You were amazing.

1209
02:08:24,333 --> 02:08:29,000
You have no idea how many strings
I had to pull to get you here tonight.

1210
02:08:31,750 --> 02:08:34,000
Chef Paul's era will soon be over

1211
02:08:34,083 --> 02:08:35,583
and yours will begin.

1212
02:08:36,708 --> 02:08:41,000
Imagine! The rising new chef
who overthrew Chef Paul!

1213
02:08:42,041 --> 02:08:46,625
Thanks to Tone's clip, no one will ever
look at Chef Paul the same way again.

1214
02:08:49,666 --> 02:08:50,958
That's what it's about, huh?

1215
02:08:52,416 --> 02:08:54,833
[Tos] Aoy, this world

1216
02:08:55,500 --> 02:08:57,250
isn't ruled by some principle.

1217
02:08:59,500 --> 02:09:02,041
The clip is the only thing
Tone has to offer

1218
02:09:02,125 --> 02:09:04,666
in exchange for my help,
just like you asked.

1219
02:09:04,750 --> 02:09:06,750
[somber music continues]

1220
02:09:12,500 --> 02:09:13,833
Hey, Aoy!

1221
02:09:14,333 --> 02:09:15,708
Don't be angry.

1222
02:09:17,000 --> 02:09:18,708
You didn't lose to Chef Paul.

1223
02:09:19,541 --> 02:09:20,750
Now all you have to do

1224
02:09:20,833 --> 02:09:23,875
is grow some real clout
and gain influence.

1225
02:09:23,958 --> 02:09:26,291
Let everyone know you're top dog.

1226
02:09:27,041 --> 02:09:28,916
First, we'll need
to work on your appearance.

1227
02:09:29,000 --> 02:09:30,500
It's a question of marketing.

1228
02:09:30,583 --> 02:09:32,083
I'll hire some experts for that.

1229
02:09:42,375 --> 02:09:43,375
Aoy!

1230
02:09:45,000 --> 02:09:49,125
Aren't you the one who told me...
that I wasn't hungry enough for success?

1231
02:09:54,875 --> 02:09:56,708
Isn't this what you were hungry for?

1232

Well, suddenly Au wanted to sell noodles.

1245
02:15:05,625 --> 02:15:07,791
He was afraid we wouldn't have a chef.

1246
02:15:12,833 --> 02:15:14,166
What took you so long?

1257
02:16:11,666 --> 02:16:13,791
I'll be the chef of this restaurant.

[Joy] What about the other restaurant?

1259
02:16:18,666 --> 02:16:20,041
This is my restaurant.

1260
02:16:33,041 --> 02:16:35,166
This is where I'll set up my menu.

1261
02:16:39,458 --> 02:16:41,250
We'll restart our own thing here.
