Chanho is a bit

355
00:23:08,793 --> 00:23:10,890
out of my league, right?

356
00:23:13,094 --> 00:23:14,410
Hey!

357
00:23:14,411 --> 00:23:18,384
Why are you talking down to
yourself so seriously like that?

358
00:23:19,722 --> 00:23:22,738
That guy... Chanho...

359
00:23:22,739 --> 00:23:26,386
was a bit popular when
we were in high school.

360
00:23:26,387 --> 00:23:29,192
No, he was super popular!

361
00:23:29,193 --> 00:23:33,412
He could have been a K-pop
idol with a face like that.

362
00:23:35,083 --> 00:23:38,023
He was academically great too.

363
00:23:41,986 --> 00:23:45,304
Wasn't I also cool when we were younger?

364
00:23:45,305 --> 00:23:48,591
You are sobering me up.

365
00:23:48,592 --> 00:23:51,298
Was that a serious question?

366
00:23:51,802 --> 00:23:54,802
Woah, you don't have to burn me like that.

367
00:23:55,260 --> 00:23:59,784
You were different from Chanho.

368
00:24:00,806 --> 00:24:04,012
You were the kind of type
that attracted party girls.

369
00:24:04,013 --> 00:24:06,305
You had this mint chocolate vibe.

370
00:24:06,306 --> 00:24:08,277
Only liked by a certain group.

371
00:24:08,278 --> 00:24:10,201
Definitely controversial.

372
00:24:10,202 --> 00:24:13,154
Tasted like toothpaste or chocolate.
Neither one nor the other.

373
00:24:13,155 --> 00:24:16,901
They were good kids. You only
judge a book by its cover.

374
00:24:16,902 --> 00:24:18,302
Also, toothpaste?

375
00:24:18,303 --> 00:24:21,315
If I was toothpaste, was Chanho mouthwash?

376
00:24:21,316 --> 00:24:23,808
No, no, no.

377
00:24:23,809 --> 00:24:26,406
He was a classic, luxurious chocolate.

378
00:24:26,407 --> 00:24:28,511
From Belgium, like Godiva?

379
00:24:28,512 --> 00:24:30,397
Everyone loved Chanho.

380
00:24:30,398 --> 00:24:32,923
He was smart, kind, honest.

381
00:24:32,924 --> 00:24:36,008
All the teachers really liked him, too.

382
00:24:36,790 --> 00:24:40,575
I got along with some teachers, too.

383
00:24:40,576 --> 00:24:44,902
Oh, yeah! Remember that teacher
that was only good to Chanho?

384
00:24:46,994 --> 00:24:49,087
What's next period?

385
00:24:49,531 --> 00:24:52,143
Hey, hey! This isn't a flea market!

386

Hey, you are running down the corridor!

387

389
00:25:00,488 --> 00:25:05,007
Chanho, could you get the mock
exam results from my office?

390
00:25:05,008 --> 00:25:07,697
You came first again. Don't study too hard.

391
00:25:07,698 --> 00:25:10,192
Spare some hope for the others.

392
00:25:10,193 --> 00:25:11,898
Yes, sir.

393
00:25:11,899 --> 00:25:13,569
Anyway, that kid.

394
00:25:13,570 --> 00:25:17,806
Always looks like he's goofing off
but his test scores are always good.

395
00:25:17,807 --> 00:25:20,702
He was second again. Just below you.

396
00:25:20,703 --> 00:25:24,282
Your homeroom teacher must
be happy to have both of you.

397
00:25:24,283 --> 00:25:26,600
I'm just lucky.

398
00:25:38,796 --> 00:25:40,997
He's a rare breed.

399
00:25:50,174 --> 00:25:52,100
You didn't have to walk me home.

400
00:25:52,101 --> 00:25:53,399

401
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:54,906
Hey.

402
00:25:54,907 --> 00:25:57,200
I think you two look alike.

403
00:25:57,201 --> 00:25:58,126

00:25:58,127 --> 00:26:02,094

The long-faced version.

409
00:26:13,601 --> 00:26:15,173
Ugh, Mr. Park.

410
00:26:15,174 --> 00:26:17,200

There's no need to send a car.
I'll be fine on my own.

417

Right! The background music.

our school clubs are gathered. Right?

446
00:29:03,801 --> 00:29:04,860

01:00:07,294 --> 01:00:11,699
When you were in eighth grade
you wanted to study in New York.

876
01:00:11,700 --> 01:00:14,605
- At Pass?
- Parsons.

877
01:00:14,606 --> 01:00:17,916
That's a fashion school anyway.
I ended up choosing art, remember?

878
01:00:17,917 --> 01:00:20,340
Be a more attentive father.

879
01:00:22,736 --> 01:00:24,942
For six years during
middle and high school.

880
01:00:24,943 --> 01:00:29,174
You changed your career path 22
times, same with your crushes.

881
01:00:29,175 --> 01:00:31,398
And I'm not an attentive father.

882
01:00:31,399 --> 01:00:35,155
Your crush in 12th grade must
have been an art student.

883
01:00:36,070 --> 01:00:37,083
That's enough.

884
01:00:37,084 --> 01:00:39,142
And you wanted to follow him to New York.

885
01:00:39,143 --> 01:00:40,516
Have you heard of Covid-19?

886
01:00:40,517 --> 01:00:43,019
Korea is doing well. Studying
abroad is a bad idea.

887
01:00:43,020 --> 01:00:44,638
Do you ever worry

888
01:00:44,639 --> 01:00:48,801
that your dad won't be able to
buy you a nice wedding dress?

889
01:00:48,802 --> 01:00:50,975
- Do you?
- I'm only twenty years old!

890
01:00:50,976 --> 01:00:54,598
I told you to be quiet
when we do our masks.

891
01:00:54,599 --> 01:00:56,795
Your dad is still alive!

892
01:00:56,796 --> 01:00:59,677
Don't worry about money
and do what you want.

893
01:00:59,678 --> 01:01:02,131
Have I ever asked you to sell
the house for a start-up?

894
01:01:02,132 --> 01:01:05,692
Or asked to borrow what's
left of your pension?

895
01:01:06,991 --> 01:01:09,077
Is it andropause?

896
01:01:11,753 --> 01:01:15,326
I, Park Kyungshik, am in the
second chapter of my life.

897
01:01:17,217 --> 01:01:20,336
Luck! Fortune!

898
01:01:22,444 --> 01:01:26,904
That's a man finally breaking after
being stuck in traffic for hours.

899
01:01:32,359 --> 01:01:35,516
You know there are many bars around here.

900
01:01:35,517 --> 01:01:38,007
The convenience store isn't so bad.

901
01:01:38,008 --> 01:01:40,686
I really wanted to do this with you.

902
01:01:40,687 --> 01:01:42,308
- What is "this"?
- You know,

903
01:01:42,309 --> 01:01:45,234
cracking open some beers on
a nice night with a friend.

904
01:01:45,235 --> 01:01:47,220
When will we do this again?

905
01:01:47,221 --> 01:01:48,574
We have military duty soon.

906
01:01:48,575 --> 01:01:52,034
Once that's done, we are back on
campus with freshmen crawling around.

907
01:01:52,035 --> 01:01:54,212
Do you think we'll be able to?

908
01:01:54,213 --> 01:01:55,706
The romance of youth!

909
01:01:55,707 --> 01:01:57,421
Romance?

910
01:01:58,381 --> 01:02:00,813
You haven't changed at all, Jaemin.

911
01:02:00,814 --> 01:02:02,025
The same as high school.

912
01:02:02,026 --> 01:02:06,120
Even though we weren't
close in high school,

913
01:02:09,596 --> 01:02:11,226
"I have to drink with this guy,"

914
01:02:11,227 --> 01:02:12,707
is what I thought.

915
01:02:12,708 --> 01:02:13,915
Why me?

916
01:02:13,916 --> 01:02:16,230
Dude, you were so smart in high school.

917
01:02:16,231 --> 01:02:17,601
The thing is...

918
01:02:17,602 --> 01:02:24,011
people want to experience a unique,
tight bond with the best of the best.

919
01:02:24,012 --> 01:02:28,811
That's rich coming from you. You didn't
even study after school and you did great.

920
01:02:28,812 --> 01:02:30,025
Guess I did.

921
01:02:30,026 --> 01:02:32,205
In fact, I thought you were so arrogant.

922
01:02:32,206 --> 01:02:35,144
Whom are you calling arrogant? You
were worse. Following around teachers,

923
01:02:35,145 --> 01:02:36,387
like a teacher's pet.

924
01:02:36,388 --> 01:02:39,173
No way, they were following me.

925
01:02:39,174 --> 01:02:43,496
To them, I was the kid that chose
liberal arts over a science high school.

926
01:02:43,497 --> 01:02:45,097
Their attention was too much.

927
01:02:45,098 --> 01:02:49,098
I knew how the other kids saw me.
I understand.

928
01:02:50,597 --> 01:02:54,014
You are way more arrogant than I thought.

929
01:03:00,057 --> 01:03:03,303
Do you have a girl you like?

930
01:03:03,304 --> 01:03:05,282
A girl?

931
01:03:05,283 --> 01:03:06,587
Why?

932
01:03:06,588 --> 01:03:08,591
You have someone in mind?

933
01:03:09,495 --> 01:03:12,105
Well, I could introduce you.

934
01:03:13,315 --> 01:03:14,540
You want me to?

935
01:03:14,541 --> 01:03:18,167
Actually, I already have someone I like.

936
01:03:18,168 --> 01:03:19,661
You do?

937
01:03:19,662 --> 01:03:21,132
Who?

938
01:03:21,133 --> 01:03:23,292
She must be a catch if you are into her.

939
01:03:23,293 --> 01:03:26,093
- Do I know her?
- It's Joohee.

940
01:03:27,386 --> 01:03:29,812
Joohee? What's her surname?

941
01:03:29,813 --> 01:03:31,623
Park Joohee.

942
01:03:32,504 --> 01:03:34,718
Well, it is a common name.

943
01:03:34,719 --> 01:03:38,874
Is there another Park Joohee we know?

944
01:03:38,875 --> 01:03:43,120
Our friend Park Joohee?
You seriously like her?

945
01:03:43,121 --> 01:03:46,823
The same Park Joohee that
we went to high school with?

946
01:03:46,824 --> 01:03:49,268
The very same Joohee that
studies art at Hankuk University?

947
01:03:49,269 --> 01:03:50,776
Yeah.

948
01:03:50,777 --> 01:03:53,434
That's one hell of a reaction.

949
01:03:56,769 --> 01:03:58,967
Can I go out with Joohee?

950
01:04:00,579 --> 01:04:02,291
Why are you asking me for?

951
01:04:02,292 --> 01:04:04,948
Because you and Joohee are best friends.

952
01:04:04,949 --> 01:04:06,159
Best friends?

953
01:04:06,160 --> 01:04:08,106
Are we?

954
01:04:10,396 --> 01:04:12,899
She's not some object needing approval,

955
01:04:12,900 --> 01:04:15,417
whether you two should date,

956
01:04:17,519 --> 01:04:19,334
that decision,

957
01:04:19,808 --> 01:04:21,818
is between you two.

958
01:04:22,666 --> 01:04:25,944
I thought you were interested in her.

959
01:04:25,945 --> 01:04:27,510
Guess not, huh?

960
01:04:27,511 --> 01:04:29,510
That's a relief.

961
01:04:29,511 --> 01:04:31,025
Yeah.

962
01:04:31,496 --> 01:04:33,411

Why are you asking me for?

Park Jaemin, how are you?

974
01:05:44,290 --> 01:05:48,491
- You're looking after Joohee, right?
- Of course, sir.

975
01:05:48,492 --> 01:05:51,784
This is a pleasant surprise,
how can I help you?

976
01:05:51,785 --> 01:05:53,796
You know, this and that.

977
01:05:53,797 --> 01:05:55,384
Thought I'd ask how you're doing.

978
01:05:55,385 --> 01:05:58,532
The last time you called, you asked
me how I was doing for 20 minutes.

979
01:05:58,533 --> 01:06:00,216
And we had 20 minutes of small talk.

980
01:06:00,217 --> 01:06:03,127
Let's skip to the bottom line, for both us?

981
01:06:03,128 --> 01:06:09,699
We can definitely skip that part where we
engage in small talk to build a rapport.

982
01:06:09,700 --> 01:06:11,821
You're an honest man.

983
01:06:11,822 --> 01:06:13,681
You said you were

984
01:06:13,682 --> 01:06:15,900
- a computer science major?
- Yes.

985
01:06:15,901 --> 01:06:19,313
It's a little weird calling
you out of the blue like this,

986
01:06:19,314 --> 01:06:22,812
but you really know your stuff
when it comes to things like this.

987
01:06:22,813 --> 01:06:24,225
Do you happen to know

988
01:06:24,226 --> 01:06:28,390
- anything about blockchain?
- Ah, you want to talk about crypto.

989
01:06:28,391 --> 01:06:32,448
- Wow, exactly!
- I do know a thing or two about that.

- Then why stop?

- We're a team.

This kind of exposure is not

We got lucky and got into his backdoor,

1031
01:08:33,331 --> 01:08:37,236
and tore up all of his
timestamps and checksum values.

are getting out of there alive but

I was crying and begging for
them to catch that fucker

their hands in their pockets.

have to be scared of what they'll do?

01:34:48,924 --> 01:34:52,542
If you want to mount a
camera, we would need MI6...

1391
01:34:52,543 --> 01:34:55,089
I have another plan.

1392
01:35:08,512 --> 01:35:11,306
Do you know what YOUKNOWWHAT is?

1393
01:35:12,985 --> 01:35:14,485
What is it?

1394
01:35:15,984 --> 01:35:18,083
It's...

1395
01:35:18,084 --> 01:35:19,666
no one.

1396
01:35:32,732 --> 01:35:35,597
With Chanho's profound parting words,

1397
01:35:35,598 --> 01:35:40,888
an unusual summer for a
twenty-year-old came and went.

1398
01:35:40,889 --> 01:35:43,480
The Seoul Cyber Bureau was at
Songdo International Exchange...

1399
01:35:43,481 --> 01:35:47,592
The hack of the century, which could
have erased millions of cryptocurrencies,

1400
01:35:47,593 --> 01:35:50,416
did attract the public's
attentions for a while

1401
01:35:50,417 --> 01:35:54,853
but the news died down and was remembered
as the act of an attention-craving hacker.

1402
01:35:54,854 --> 01:35:57,693
YOUKNOWWHAT, the man I
hunted for three years,

1403
01:35:57,694 --> 01:36:01,438
was forgotten by the
public in just three days.

1404
01:36:04,120 --> 01:36:08,149
[NOTICE: As of August 10, 2020, "Better World" club
will be converted into a "Fine Dust" research room.]

1405
01:36:08,150 --> 01:36:10,579
"Better World"?

1406
01:36:11,071 --> 01:36:13,282
Is it a name of a club?

1407
01:36:13,283 --> 01:36:14,552
Never heard of it.

1408
01:36:14,553 --> 01:36:17,031
It's a weird name. "Better World," huh?

1409
01:36:17,032 --> 01:36:19,631
Maybe it's a volunteering group?

1410
01:36:27,834 --> 01:36:30,679
So, if we're out,

1411
01:36:30,680 --> 01:36:32,473
who's replacing us?

1412
01:36:32,474 --> 01:36:35,007
What's so great about them?

1413
01:36:35,008 --> 01:36:36,625
They're sponsored by Samsung,

1414
01:36:36,626 --> 01:36:39,634
collaborating with MIT students on
atmospheric engineering research.

1415
01:36:39,635 --> 01:36:42,550
Kids that can save the
world from fine dust?

1416
01:36:42,551 --> 01:36:45,431
I heard KBS is going to interview them too.

1417
01:36:45,432 --> 01:36:47,555

1418
01:36:48,592 --> 01:36:50,904
Then, what about us?

1419
01:36:50,905 --> 01:36:54,548
- Where can we do our club activities?
- You guys...

1420
01:36:54,549 --> 01:36:56,325
should meet in the virtual world.

1421
01:36:56,326 --> 01:36:59,947
Your club failed to meet the
member's requirements anyways.

1422
01:36:59,948 --> 01:37:03,119
You're making me look like a
bad landlord expelling tenants.

1423
01:37:03,120 --> 01:37:04,780
I have no power.

1424
01:37:04,781 --> 01:37:06,687
I have no power to help you.

1425
01:37:06,688 --> 01:37:09,436
Do you want me to make an
appointment with the president?

1426
01:37:11,725 --> 01:37:13,473
My honorable TA,

1427
01:37:13,474 --> 01:37:15,650
you can't do this to us!

1428
01:37:15,651 --> 01:37:19,375
It's not like I'm a pearl lacquerware
master trying to pass down the torch

1429
01:37:19,376 --> 01:37:21,332
or noodle pulling master from China.

1430
01:37:21,333 --> 01:37:24,632
I have no plans to accept any disciples.

1431
01:37:24,633 --> 01:37:28,317
I just want to be the owner of an
internet cafe for the rest of my life.

1432
01:37:28,318 --> 01:37:30,827
I heard you were a reverse engineer,

1433
01:37:30,828 --> 01:37:32,877
one of the top three engineers at the
Ministry of Science and Technology.

1434
01:37:32,878 --> 01:37:36,464
If you accept me as a
disciple, I will do my best.

1435
01:37:36,465 --> 01:37:37,506
Who would have thought?

1436
01:37:37,507 --> 01:37:40,254
That the boss at my part-time
job was a genius hacker?

1437
01:37:40,255 --> 01:37:45,000
That he's one of the very few
Wizard Experts in the world.

1438
01:37:45,001 --> 01:37:47,065
This is not Hogwarts, okay?

1439
01:37:47,066 --> 01:37:49,493
Wizards? Are you a wizard?

1440
01:37:49,494 --> 01:37:51,233
Gryffindor or Slytherin?

1441
01:37:51,234 --> 01:37:53,826
Why do people always say,
"Gryffindor or Slytherin?"

1442
01:37:53,827 --> 01:37:56,116
Ravenclaw, known for their
cleverness and creativity,

1443
01:37:56,117 --> 01:37:58,956
and the protectors of morals
and character, Hufflepuff.

1444
01:37:58,957 --> 01:38:01,266
But I am... a Gryffindor.

1445
01:38:01,267 --> 01:38:03,661
- Such a nerd.
- Could you not bring her here anymore?

1446
01:38:03,662 --> 01:38:06,186
Hey, she didn't even pay for that.

1447
01:38:06,187 --> 01:38:07,265
He will pay for it.

1448
01:38:07,266 --> 01:38:10,558
That will be deducted from your wages.

1449
01:38:11,857 --> 01:38:15,359
Stop eating the expensive
snacks, take the bagged ones.

1450
01:38:15,360 --> 01:38:18,258
- May you travel safely, my master.
- Get lost!

1451

I'm a better cook than your number 28.

1454
01:38:29,136 --> 01:38:30,878
28?

1455
01:38:32,888 --> 01:38:35,028
I totally forgot about him.

1456
01:38:35,029 --> 01:38:38,053
It's okay, I'll just
have to find number 29.

1457
01:38:38,054 --> 01:38:40,005
Right.

1458
01:38:40,006 --> 01:38:41,617
Eat.

1459
01:38:42,700 --> 01:38:44,452
Wait.

1460
01:38:47,031 --> 01:38:49,464
My dumb dad.

1461
01:38:50,094 --> 01:38:53,213
Thanks for saving him twice.

1462
01:38:53,214 --> 01:38:55,408
It's not a big deal.

1463
01:38:55,409 --> 01:39:00,289
Your dad was kind to
me in high school, too.

1464
01:39:00,290 --> 01:39:04,414
Just tell him to stop going to
those weird investment seminars.

1465
01:39:04,415 --> 01:39:06,423
You make sure he doesn't, okay?

1466
01:39:24,631 --> 01:39:26,331
So pretty.

1467
01:39:27,268 --> 01:39:29,128

- Yes.

1468
