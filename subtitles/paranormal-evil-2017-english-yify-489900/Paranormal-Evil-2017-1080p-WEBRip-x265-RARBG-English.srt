1
00:02:05,429 --> 00:02:07,257
Aunt Pat!

2
00:02:07,301 --> 00:02:08,650
Aunt Pat!

3
00:02:40,116 --> 00:02:41,726
Stop it!

4
00:04:26,396 --> 00:04:28,137
Hey.

5
00:04:31,314 --> 00:04:32,663
What's wrong.

6
00:04:32,707 --> 00:04:34,796
Oh my god, why are you shaking?

7
00:04:34,839 --> 00:04:36,101
It's happening again.

8
00:04:36,145 --> 00:04:37,581
What's happening again?

9
00:04:40,410 --> 00:04:42,847
I was in the tub and I
thought I heard somebody

10
00:04:42,891 --> 00:04:44,109
or something.

11
00:04:44,153 --> 00:04:45,546
I don't know.

12
00:04:45,589 --> 00:04:47,722
It was there and it touched
me and then I ran out

13
00:04:47,765 --> 00:04:49,637
of the bathroom, and when
I came back the mirror

14
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:51,334
was busted.

15
00:04:51,378 --> 00:04:53,597
Oh my god, are you serious?

16
00:05:02,606 --> 00:05:04,565
Come on Lex.

17
00:05:04,608 --> 00:05:06,436
What the hell are you doing
taking a bath in 200 degree

18
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:08,090
water for?

19
00:05:08,133 --> 00:05:10,571
It's obvious you opened the
door too fast and you let

20
00:05:10,614 --> 00:05:12,790
the cold air in,
and it's cracked.

21
00:05:13,574 --> 00:05:15,532
- Are you seriously
saying that right now?

22
00:05:16,185 --> 00:05:17,665
Look at it Paul.

23
00:05:22,104 --> 00:05:24,193
- Look, I don't know,
it's just physics.

24
00:05:24,541 --> 00:05:26,151
Just breath.

25
00:05:26,195 --> 00:05:27,936
- Don't tell me
to fucking breath.

26
00:05:28,415 --> 00:05:30,504
I'm sick of you always
acting like I'm crazy,

27
00:05:30,547 --> 00:05:32,549
when I'm showing
you these things!

28
00:05:45,954 --> 00:05:47,477
- I'm sorry.

29
00:05:49,523 --> 00:05:51,176
- What are you apologizing for?

30
00:05:51,220 --> 00:05:53,048
- I don't know I just am.

31
00:05:56,834 --> 00:05:59,054
Just breath.

32
00:05:59,097 --> 00:06:00,838
- Alexis?

33
00:06:00,882 --> 00:06:02,231
- I'm getting dressed.

34
00:06:05,147 --> 00:06:06,714
- Oh, hey Paul.

35
00:06:06,757 --> 00:06:08,280
- Hi aunt Pat.

36
00:06:08,324 --> 00:06:10,239
- You're almost
done packing huh?

37
00:06:14,025 --> 00:06:16,158
What's going on?

38
00:06:26,342 --> 00:06:27,212
Are you okay?

39
00:06:27,256 --> 00:06:28,953
What happened?

40
00:06:32,174 --> 00:06:34,350
- I must of had the
bathroom too hot,

41
00:06:34,394 --> 00:06:38,093
and when I opened the
door, I cracked the glass.

42
00:06:40,138 --> 00:06:41,226
- Oh, well.

43
00:06:41,270 --> 00:06:42,619
I'll take care of that later.

44
00:06:42,663 --> 00:06:45,143
Just be careful in there okay?

45
00:06:45,666 --> 00:06:47,319
- Okay.

46
00:06:47,363 --> 00:06:50,888
- Oh, the lawyer is going to
give you the deed and the keys

47
00:06:50,932 --> 00:06:52,803
to the house in
Victorville tomorrow.

48
00:06:52,847 --> 00:06:54,762
Have you decided what
your'e gonna do with it?

49
00:06:56,633 --> 00:06:59,375
- You know what aunt Pat,
I think I'm gonna keep it.

50
00:06:59,767 --> 00:07:01,290
Live in it.

51
00:07:01,333 --> 00:07:03,901
I mean it is the house
I grew up in after all.

52
00:07:03,945 --> 00:07:05,425
- Only if you're ready.

53
00:07:05,468 --> 00:07:06,469
Okay?

54
00:07:06,817 --> 00:07:08,253
- Okay.

55
00:07:08,297 --> 00:07:10,342
- Stay for dinner Paul,
I'm making meatloaf

56
00:07:10,386 --> 00:07:12,127
and apple cobbler for dessert.

57
00:07:12,432 --> 00:07:13,824
- Hmm.

58
00:07:13,868 --> 00:07:16,044
Homemade meatloaf or ramen
noodles at the dorms.

59
00:07:16,827 --> 00:07:18,612
I choose homemade meatloaf.

60
00:07:18,916 --> 00:07:20,352
- Good choice.

61
00:07:32,016 --> 00:07:35,324
- So I was thinking that
I would take a road trip

62
00:07:35,367 --> 00:07:36,717
with Paul,

63
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:40,721
and see Dorian after
we sign the paperwork.

64
00:07:42,374 --> 00:07:44,333
Maybe give him some money.

65
00:07:44,376 --> 00:07:47,945
- Sweetheart, that man is gonna
be locked in that nuthouse

66
00:07:47,989 --> 00:07:49,686
for the rest of his life.

67
00:07:50,382 --> 00:07:52,080
He don't need money.

68
00:07:52,733 --> 00:07:54,474
- He needs things.

69
00:07:54,517 --> 00:07:56,388
I'm sure there's
stuff he wants to buy.

70
00:07:56,432 --> 00:07:58,042
Like personal items.

71
00:07:58,608 --> 00:08:00,741
Besides it's his money too.

72
00:08:01,132 --> 00:08:04,353
- Well, even after
all that's happening,

73
00:08:04,396 --> 00:08:06,355
guess he's still
your stepfather.

74
00:08:07,356 --> 00:08:09,924
I'm just happy you
keeping us in your home.

75
00:08:10,272 --> 00:08:11,926
- You're my family.

76
00:08:12,666 --> 00:08:15,059
- Even though my brother
doesn't deserve a daughter

77
00:08:15,103 --> 00:08:16,452
like you.

78
00:08:32,903 --> 00:08:36,472
- Well, here are your
keys to the house,

79
00:08:36,516 --> 00:08:38,692
and we're done here.

80
00:08:39,301 --> 00:08:40,128
- Thank you.

81
00:08:40,171 --> 00:08:40,824
- Congratulations.

82
00:08:40,868 --> 00:08:41,869
- Thank you mister.

83
00:08:41,912 --> 00:08:43,131
- So good seeing you.

84
00:08:43,174 --> 00:08:44,480
- Good to see you.

85
00:08:55,447 --> 00:08:57,362
Oh I'm gonna miss you honey.

86
00:08:57,406 --> 00:08:58,712
- I'm gonna miss you too.

87
00:08:58,755 --> 00:09:00,452
We'll see each other lots okay.

88
00:09:00,496 --> 00:09:02,411
- Alright you take care.

89
00:09:02,672 --> 00:09:04,195
Now be careful.

90
00:09:05,414 --> 00:09:07,242
Take care of my baby.

91
00:09:34,399 --> 00:09:36,140
- You good?

92
00:09:36,401 --> 00:09:37,925
- Yeah.

93
00:09:37,968 --> 00:09:40,014
- Whens the last
time you seen him?

94
00:09:43,539 --> 00:09:45,410
- I think I was 15.

95
00:09:46,629 --> 00:09:49,589
He moved in right after
my dad's overdose.

96
00:09:51,112 --> 00:09:53,462
He was really there
for me and my mom.

97
00:09:57,945 --> 00:10:00,512
I guess that's why I
keep trying so hard.

98
00:10:02,123 --> 00:10:03,907
- Of course you keep trying.

99
00:10:03,951 --> 00:10:05,605
He's the only dad you've known.

100
00:10:06,780 --> 00:10:08,695
- Thank you for coming.

101
00:10:08,738 --> 00:10:10,522
I know this isn't a
normal way a guy meets his

102
00:10:10,566 --> 00:10:12,089
girlfriends father.

103
00:10:12,829 --> 00:10:14,570
- I'm here for you.

104
00:10:23,971 --> 00:10:25,973
- We don't normally do
visitations like this.

105
00:10:27,278 --> 00:10:29,367
Have a seat Dorian.

106
00:10:41,249 --> 00:10:43,425
- You look good, Dad.

107
00:10:44,034 --> 00:10:45,732
Really good.

108
00:10:48,038 --> 00:10:49,997
This is my boyfriend Paul.

109
00:10:51,259 --> 00:10:53,217
- It's good to meet you sir.

110
00:10:59,963 --> 00:11:02,096
- You're not even
gonna shake his hand?

111
00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:15,022
I came to bring
you money Dorian.

112
00:11:27,034 --> 00:11:29,819
- I never thought
I'd see you again.

113
00:11:33,649 --> 00:11:36,086
- What happened, Dad?

114
00:11:45,574 --> 00:11:47,445
- Why did you let her in?

115
00:11:47,489 --> 00:11:49,143
- Dorian this is
your stepdaughter.

116
00:11:49,186 --> 00:11:51,014
- Why is she in here!

117
00:11:51,058 --> 00:11:52,886
- Hey man she's just
trying to reach out to you.

118
00:11:52,929 --> 00:11:54,583
You're the only family she has.

119
00:11:54,844 --> 00:11:57,064
- Don't say anything
else to him.

120
00:12:03,331 --> 00:12:05,202
What happened in that house?

121
00:12:07,117 --> 00:12:08,292
- No.

122
00:12:09,076 --> 00:12:11,078
I didn't understand it then.

123
00:12:13,602 --> 00:12:15,647
- What happened to my mother?

124
00:12:15,691 --> 00:12:17,345
- I didn't understand.

125
00:12:17,388 --> 00:12:18,955
- Tell me!

126
00:12:18,999 --> 00:12:20,783
- Ms. King, I'm gonna have to
ask you to lower your voice

127
00:12:20,827 --> 00:12:22,437
you're upsetting my patient.

128
00:12:23,090 --> 00:12:25,135
Dorian, hands in your lap.

129
00:12:25,179 --> 00:12:27,094
Remember your calming words.

130
00:12:33,187 --> 00:12:35,102
- When you can talk to
me like a real person

131
00:12:35,145 --> 00:12:36,625
you contact me.

132
00:12:37,539 --> 00:12:39,323
I'm not coming back here.

133
00:12:40,020 --> 00:12:41,108
- Hey.

134
00:12:43,850 --> 00:12:45,895
- I didn't wanna believe it.

135
00:12:45,939 --> 00:12:48,332
I didn't wanna believe
it till it was too late.

136
00:12:51,161 --> 00:12:52,989
But now I see.

137
00:12:53,860 --> 00:12:56,427
The truth is digging
it's way out it's grave.

138
00:12:58,429 --> 00:12:59,909
- I wish it was you.

139
00:13:01,432 --> 00:13:04,218
I wish it was that
was dead not her.

140
00:13:04,261 --> 00:13:05,872
- No, let's go.

141
00:13:10,877 --> 00:13:12,835
- No!

142
00:13:16,926 --> 00:13:18,536
- Get off me!

143
00:13:21,931 --> 00:13:22,802
- Are you okay?

144
00:13:22,932 --> 00:13:24,281
Alexis are you alright?

145
00:13:51,178 --> 00:13:52,483
It's big.

146
00:13:52,527 --> 00:13:53,876
- Mhm.

147
00:13:55,312 --> 00:13:57,314
- You ready?

148
00:13:58,185 --> 00:13:59,969
- Do I have a choice?

149
00:14:00,578 --> 00:14:02,189
- Yeah.

150
00:14:02,493 --> 00:14:04,060
- Come on.

151
00:14:31,566 --> 00:14:32,306
- Nice.

152
00:14:33,829 --> 00:14:35,135
You're aunt really kept this
place up all these years.

153
00:14:37,224 --> 00:14:38,268
- Yeah.

154
00:14:38,312 --> 00:14:39,574
She did.

155
00:14:40,314 --> 00:14:41,750
- Hm.

156
00:15:10,257 --> 00:15:12,172
How do you feel?

157
00:15:13,086 --> 00:15:16,393
- I feel, surprised.

158
00:15:19,222 --> 00:15:21,529
Surprised that I feel at home.

159
00:15:23,444 --> 00:15:27,535
It's been 13 years
since I've been here.

160
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:31,974
- I'm surprised there
aren't any rodents running

161
00:15:32,018 --> 00:15:32,844
around here.

162
00:15:32,888 --> 00:15:34,672
- There better not be sir.

163
00:15:36,065 --> 00:15:38,111
Come on lets start unpacking
before it gets too late.

164
00:15:41,114 --> 00:15:42,289
- Alright.

165
00:16:30,163 --> 00:16:32,208
Hey.

166
00:16:32,252 --> 00:16:33,644
Where do you want it?

167
00:16:36,212 --> 00:16:38,998
- I guess we should see
which room we're sleeping in.

168
00:17:13,249 --> 00:17:14,946
- Nice.

169
00:17:16,209 --> 00:17:18,167
- It's my Dad's room.

170
00:17:19,647 --> 00:17:21,301
Look at this.

171
00:17:23,825 --> 00:17:25,392
- You look just like her.

172
00:17:29,613 --> 00:17:31,746
Is that you?

173
00:17:32,225 --> 00:17:33,530
Cute.

174
00:17:34,705 --> 00:17:36,229
- No that's my brother.

175
00:17:38,274 --> 00:17:39,493
- Oh.

176
00:17:39,536 --> 00:17:41,843
- I haven't seen a
picture of him in ages.

177
00:17:44,933 --> 00:17:46,543
Joshua.

178
00:17:47,805 --> 00:17:49,938
- You remember him at all?

179
00:17:54,029 --> 00:17:55,596
- I do.

180
00:17:58,251 --> 00:18:01,254
You say I'm a crybaby,
no he was a crybaby.

181
00:18:06,259 --> 00:18:09,305
The silence in this house
was so heavy when he died.

182
00:18:13,266 --> 00:18:15,398
- Nothing's the same
after a baby's death.

183
00:18:15,442 --> 00:18:18,314
- Yeah but my mom really
blamed herself you know?

184
00:18:43,252 --> 00:18:46,125
- He drowned in that
tub right there.

185
00:18:55,830 --> 00:18:57,701
Jesus.

186
00:19:00,313 --> 00:19:01,662
- Alexis,

187
00:19:01,705 --> 00:19:03,533
Are you sure you're
ready for this?

188
00:19:07,015 --> 00:19:09,235
- There are three rooms.

189
00:19:09,887 --> 00:19:12,281
This one's this biggest
so I'll take this one.

190
00:19:12,325 --> 00:19:15,284
Kira can have my old room
and I remember my mother

191
00:19:15,328 --> 00:19:18,505
used the other one as a
sewing room after Joshua died.

192
00:19:19,854 --> 00:19:21,334
I think.

193
00:19:21,899 --> 00:19:23,640
- Let's go check it out.

194
00:19:44,879 --> 00:19:47,186
- I don't know why I'm scared.

195
00:20:02,418 --> 00:20:04,551
It's exactly how I left it.

196
00:20:12,254 --> 00:20:13,473
- Do you remember it?

197
00:20:13,516 --> 00:20:14,909
Any of it?

198
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:20,480
- It's weird I don't but
I feel like I lived here

199
00:20:20,523 --> 00:20:22,003
my whole life.

200
00:20:23,222 --> 00:20:24,832
Like I never left.

201
00:21:11,922 --> 00:21:14,273
I remember that tree.

202
00:21:15,274 --> 00:21:17,450
- Tell Kira
to keep the bed.

203
00:21:17,493 --> 00:21:19,278
She's a little girl anyway.

204
00:21:27,938 --> 00:21:29,592
Alexis.

205
00:21:30,158 --> 00:21:32,291
I said do you want
Chinese for dinner?

206
00:21:33,335 --> 00:21:35,163
- Yeah that's fine.

207
00:22:54,024 --> 00:22:55,461
- Whoa.

208
00:22:55,852 --> 00:22:59,029
- It's the basement
but it's locked.

209
00:22:59,552 --> 00:23:01,684
- You know what they
say about basements.

210
00:23:01,728 --> 00:23:03,338
- What?

211
00:23:04,470 --> 00:23:06,907
- I didn't really have an
answer prepared for that.

212
00:23:06,950 --> 00:23:08,256
Hey.

213
00:23:08,299 --> 00:23:10,911
One thing we must
do is kiss in there.

214
00:23:11,825 --> 00:23:16,830
Every single room in this house.

215
00:23:19,485 --> 00:23:21,443
- Every single room?

216
00:23:22,575 --> 00:23:24,403
Every nook.

217
00:23:24,577 --> 00:23:26,100
And closet.

218
00:23:26,492 --> 00:23:27,797
- Really?

219
00:23:28,494 --> 00:23:30,757
Better get to it before
my roommate gets here.

220
00:24:33,559 --> 00:24:35,125
Damn Lex!

221
00:24:36,562 --> 00:24:38,520
I think you drew blood.

222
00:24:46,180 --> 00:24:48,095
- Peace offering?

223
00:25:02,283 --> 00:25:04,459
I'm really sorry.

224
00:25:06,069 --> 00:25:07,810
- Forget it.

225
00:25:21,084 --> 00:25:23,522
- How bad do you
think this house is?

226
00:25:23,565 --> 00:25:25,219
Maintenance wise?

227
00:25:25,872 --> 00:25:27,090
- It's not good,

228
00:25:27,134 --> 00:25:29,049
but it's not bad.

229
00:25:30,180 --> 00:25:32,443
- Well that's a good thing
of having a new boyfriend.

230
00:25:34,402 --> 00:25:36,317
- I gotta be good for something.

231
00:25:39,102 --> 00:25:40,060
- No.

232
00:25:40,103 --> 00:25:41,583
Wait till after we eat.

233
00:25:41,627 --> 00:25:43,150
- No do it now.

234
00:25:43,411 --> 00:25:47,067
And whatever it says lets
follow it with in bed.

235
00:25:48,111 --> 00:25:49,112
- Alright.

236
00:25:55,641 --> 00:25:57,251
It says...

237
00:25:58,774 --> 00:26:01,734
New and exciting
adventures await you.

238
00:26:03,344 --> 00:26:04,693
In bed.

239
00:26:04,737 --> 00:26:05,825
- Hell yeah.

240
00:26:05,868 --> 00:26:07,087
- It's about time.

241
00:26:07,130 --> 00:26:08,175
- Hey.

242
00:26:08,218 --> 00:26:09,742
- Kidding, do yours.

243
00:26:21,014 --> 00:26:22,885
- It says...

244
00:26:23,146 --> 00:26:26,323
Hope for the best
except the worst.

245
00:26:26,367 --> 00:26:27,890
What kind of fortune
cookie is that?

246
00:26:27,934 --> 00:26:29,196
- You forgot to say in bed.

247
00:26:29,239 --> 00:26:30,676
- Hell no.

248
00:26:30,719 --> 00:26:32,242
We'll share yours.

249
00:26:32,286 --> 00:26:34,288
- Here you can have it, I
don't like the way they taste.

250
00:26:35,419 --> 00:26:36,725
Good lord.

251
00:26:38,161 --> 00:26:39,772
My roomie's here.

252
00:26:42,688 --> 00:26:43,514
Kira!

253
00:26:46,169 --> 00:26:48,128
- Hey Alexis.

254
00:26:48,171 --> 00:26:49,738
Home sweet home huh?

255
00:26:51,174 --> 00:26:54,090
This place is awesome!

256
00:26:55,526 --> 00:26:58,355
It's got just the
right amount of creepy.

257
00:26:58,834 --> 00:27:00,270
- Come on I'll
show you your room,

258
00:27:00,314 --> 00:27:01,750
or you can pick one there's two.

259
00:27:01,794 --> 00:27:04,057
- I take it you already
got the biggest one.

260
00:27:04,100 --> 00:27:05,493
- Of course.

261
00:27:08,452 --> 00:27:10,672
- Yo man
you need some help?

262
00:27:11,847 --> 00:27:13,457
- Nah, I'm good bro.

263
00:27:16,330 --> 00:27:17,287
- Come on.

264
00:27:18,549 --> 00:27:21,204
- It's like a time
capsule in here.

265
00:27:22,466 --> 00:27:24,294
- I know we probably
should have waited.

266
00:27:24,338 --> 00:27:25,774
- No, I like it.

267
00:27:29,082 --> 00:27:30,823
- Hey where do you
want all your crap?

268
00:27:32,215 --> 00:27:34,261
- Right there is fine.

269
00:27:34,304 --> 00:27:35,654
- Perfect.

270
00:27:35,915 --> 00:27:38,004
- I'll help you unpack the car.

271
00:27:48,971 --> 00:27:51,191
- Alright that's it.

272
00:27:51,234 --> 00:27:52,801
All your craps in the house.

273
00:27:52,845 --> 00:27:54,194
- Thank you darling.

274
00:27:54,237 --> 00:27:55,195
- Your welcome.

275
00:27:55,238 --> 00:27:56,805
Alright I'm heading back to LA.

276
00:27:56,849 --> 00:27:58,067
- Why?

277
00:27:58,111 --> 00:28:00,156
- 'Cause there's nothing
to do in fumblefuck.

278
00:28:00,200 --> 00:28:01,505
I mean Victorville.

279
00:28:02,332 --> 00:28:05,727
- There is plenty to
do in Victorville.

280
00:28:05,771 --> 00:28:06,946
- Oh yeah?

281
00:28:06,989 --> 00:28:09,209
- Not in my little
bed you don't.

282
00:28:09,252 --> 00:28:12,603
- Might as well stay man,
they're not gonna let you go.

283
00:28:13,256 --> 00:28:15,258
I feel like I've
been trapped here.

284
00:28:19,045 --> 00:28:21,656
- Now you're over the
limit, you have to stay.

285
00:28:21,700 --> 00:28:22,483
- Oh yeah?

286
00:28:22,526 --> 00:28:24,267
Well, in that case.

287
00:28:24,877 --> 00:28:26,574
Cheers.

288
00:28:29,620 --> 00:28:32,145
So how'd your mom get so rich?

289
00:28:32,188 --> 00:28:33,320
- I don't know.

290
00:28:33,363 --> 00:28:35,539
- We should invest.

291
00:28:35,583 --> 00:28:37,367
- It's we now?

292
00:28:37,890 --> 00:28:38,629
- Yes.

293
00:28:38,673 --> 00:28:39,761
We are one.

294
00:28:39,805 --> 00:28:41,807
One million dollars in one.

295
00:28:42,372 --> 00:28:44,984
- You don't have any life
insurance policies on me do you?

296
00:28:45,027 --> 00:28:46,289
- You're life is full
of drama already.

297
00:28:46,333 --> 00:28:48,248
No need to add this
to the Lifetime movie.

298
00:28:48,291 --> 00:28:49,728
- What?

299
00:28:52,034 --> 00:28:54,123
- I'm sorry babe.

300
00:28:54,167 --> 00:28:55,995
- Wait, what happened?

301
00:28:58,562 --> 00:29:03,306
- I went to visit my father
today and he attacked me.

302
00:29:03,916 --> 00:29:05,700
- Shit Lex.

303
00:29:05,744 --> 00:29:07,267
You think he killed your mom?

304
00:29:07,310 --> 00:29:08,659
- I don't know.

305
00:29:09,312 --> 00:29:11,924
I don't remember him to
be that type of person.

306
00:29:12,968 --> 00:29:15,405
I consider him to be my father.

307
00:29:16,406 --> 00:29:17,886
- It happens all the time.

308
00:29:17,930 --> 00:29:19,758
- Yeah but he wasn't
there when I...

309
00:29:35,425 --> 00:29:37,340
- When you what?

310
00:29:38,733 --> 00:29:40,082
- Can we not talk about that,

311
00:29:40,126 --> 00:29:41,823
I'm trying to put
that all behind me.

312
00:29:41,867 --> 00:29:44,043
- I agree, let's
lighten up the mood,

313
00:29:44,086 --> 00:29:45,479
and play a game.

314
00:29:45,827 --> 00:29:47,220
- Play a game?

315
00:29:47,263 --> 00:29:48,221
What game?

316
00:29:48,264 --> 00:29:49,613
- Hide and seek.

317
00:29:50,092 --> 00:29:51,702
- Hide and seek?

318
00:29:52,878 --> 00:29:54,488
- In the dark?

319
00:29:54,749 --> 00:29:56,838
- Yes, in the dark.

320
00:29:56,882 --> 00:29:59,449
What other way is there
to play hide and seek?

321
00:30:00,320 --> 00:30:02,670
Besides it'll help me
get to know the house.

322
00:30:03,018 --> 00:30:04,324
- No but what if we--

323
00:30:04,367 --> 00:30:06,456
- You guys are
thinking too much.

324
00:30:07,066 --> 00:30:10,373
- Hey Lex, your bedroom
fits this kid perfectly.

325
00:30:14,508 --> 00:30:15,639
- One,

326
00:30:15,901 --> 00:30:17,250
two,

327
00:30:17,293 --> 00:30:18,904
three,

328
00:30:18,947 --> 00:30:20,862
four,

329
00:30:20,906 --> 00:30:22,429
five,

330
00:30:22,472 --> 00:30:24,474
six,

331
00:30:24,518 --> 00:30:26,650
seven,

332
00:30:27,651 --> 00:30:29,349
eight,

333
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:31,830
nine,

334
00:30:33,657 --> 00:30:35,398
ten.

335
00:31:34,849 --> 00:31:37,678
- Ready or not, here I come.

336
00:31:39,201 --> 00:31:41,421
Who's upstairs?

337
00:32:09,928 --> 00:32:11,886
- I found you!

338
00:32:13,235 --> 00:32:15,063
I found you huh!

339
00:32:19,111 --> 00:32:20,460
- Find your own spot.

340
00:32:20,503 --> 00:32:21,852
- No.

341
00:32:24,551 --> 00:32:25,813
- Let's get them back.

342
00:32:25,856 --> 00:32:27,119
- What are you talking about?

343
00:32:27,162 --> 00:32:27,989
- Now don't play this
with me, we both know

344
00:32:28,033 --> 00:32:28,903
what they're doing.

345
00:32:28,947 --> 00:32:29,773
Lets get them back.

346
00:32:29,817 --> 00:32:31,601
- Stop.

347
00:32:35,301 --> 00:32:37,956
- God.

348
00:32:40,306 --> 00:32:42,090
Crazy bitch.

349
00:32:51,186 --> 00:32:52,971
Son of a...

350
00:33:07,594 --> 00:33:09,074
- Ha!

351
00:33:09,117 --> 00:33:10,640
Gotcha.

352
00:33:24,567 --> 00:33:26,743
Seriously?

353
00:33:26,787 --> 00:33:28,310
You didn't even try.

354
00:33:28,354 --> 00:33:30,530
- I'm fine with all
the losers alright.

355
00:33:30,573 --> 00:33:32,271
Wasn't even here.

356
00:33:32,967 --> 00:33:34,099
- You're out.

357
00:33:34,142 --> 00:33:35,578
You lose.

358
00:33:37,102 --> 00:33:39,321
- Let me get
a chance to hide.

359
00:34:02,518 --> 00:34:04,303
- Alexis.

360
00:34:05,869 --> 00:34:07,784
- What happened?

361
00:34:11,962 --> 00:34:14,095
- I saw...

362
00:34:15,009 --> 00:34:16,228
- A what?

363
00:34:20,058 --> 00:34:22,190
- I thought
I saw a mouse.

364
00:34:22,234 --> 00:34:23,757
- A mouse?

365
00:34:23,800 --> 00:34:26,151
- Oh come on Lex,
are you serious?

366
00:34:26,194 --> 00:34:28,240
- I'll let you know, I'd
probably scream like a girl too.

367
00:34:28,283 --> 00:34:29,850
I hate mice.

368
00:34:31,025 --> 00:34:33,419
- I'll just go find some
mouse traps or something.

369
00:34:34,159 --> 00:34:35,508
- Oh man.

370
00:34:40,034 --> 00:34:40,991
- What?

371
00:34:41,035 --> 00:34:43,124
It wasn't a mouse, was it?

372
00:34:45,039 --> 00:34:46,780
Was it?

373
00:35:02,491 --> 00:35:04,363
- What's wrong?

374
00:35:04,406 --> 00:35:05,886
- It wasn't a mouse.

375
00:35:05,929 --> 00:35:07,670
- Oh come on Kira.

376
00:35:07,714 --> 00:35:09,324
I don't want to hear
shit about a ghost.

377
00:35:09,368 --> 00:35:10,673
- No ghosts?

378
00:35:10,717 --> 00:35:12,501
After what happened here?

379
00:35:13,676 --> 00:35:14,851
- Did you guys find it?

380
00:35:16,157 --> 00:35:18,028
- What the hell
are you gonna with that?

381
00:35:18,072 --> 00:35:20,509
- Hm, if you'd like I
can demonstrate on you.

382
00:35:21,510 --> 00:35:23,033
How do you deal
with this girl man?

383
00:35:23,077 --> 00:35:25,079
All she does is talk
about ghosts and shit.

384
00:35:25,123 --> 00:35:27,386
- He used to believe
Ray, and I'll get you

385
00:35:27,429 --> 00:35:28,430
to believe too.

386
00:35:28,474 --> 00:35:29,344
- Oh yeah? No.

387
00:35:29,388 --> 00:35:31,172
I'm far too sane for that shit.

388
00:35:32,391 --> 00:35:34,044
- Listen if Alexis is
seeing something she needs

389
00:35:34,088 --> 00:35:35,437
to let me know.

390
00:35:35,481 --> 00:35:36,525
- If Alexis is seeing
something she needs to be

391
00:35:36,569 --> 00:35:38,092
in a looney bin.

392
00:35:39,659 --> 00:35:41,400
- I can't believe
you would say that.

393
00:35:41,443 --> 00:35:42,488
- I'm serious.

394
00:35:42,531 --> 00:35:44,054
No ghost stories.

395
00:35:44,098 --> 00:35:45,317
We're all adults here.

396
00:35:45,360 --> 00:35:47,188
- Yeah, all adults
playing hide and seek.

397
00:35:47,232 --> 00:35:48,798
- Seriously, I think
we should order a psychic

398
00:35:48,842 --> 00:35:50,365
to come in and
cleanse the house.

399
00:35:50,409 --> 00:35:51,584
Just in case.

400
00:35:51,627 --> 00:35:53,151
- No.

401
00:35:53,977 --> 00:35:55,588
- You know I think that
you should leave since

402
00:35:55,631 --> 00:35:57,198
you don't live here.

403
00:36:00,897 --> 00:36:03,204
- You wanna be crazy,
do it by yourself.

404
00:36:08,296 --> 00:36:09,950
- Don't get
in the middle of it.

405
00:36:09,993 --> 00:36:11,125
Ray!

406
00:36:12,648 --> 00:36:14,389
- He's right.

407
00:36:14,433 --> 00:36:16,348
There are no ghosts.

408
00:36:17,087 --> 00:36:18,567
Ever since I've been back
in this house I've been

409
00:36:18,611 --> 00:36:21,701
I guess you could say
remembering things.

410
00:36:23,398 --> 00:36:24,617
- That's normal.

411
00:36:24,660 --> 00:36:27,228
Being here is triggering
childhood memories.

412
00:36:27,533 --> 00:36:29,404
I mean Lex,

413
00:36:33,147 --> 00:36:35,193
your baby brother died in here,

414
00:36:36,281 --> 00:36:38,457
and you found your mother dead.

415
00:36:38,500 --> 00:36:41,199
That's the most traumatizing
thing I can think of.

416
00:36:41,677 --> 00:36:44,158
- I don't remember being
that close to my mother.

417
00:36:45,072 --> 00:36:46,160
- What?

418
00:36:46,204 --> 00:36:48,249
- I don't think...

419
00:36:48,293 --> 00:36:51,078
I don't feel like I
lost somebody I love.

420
00:36:51,513 --> 00:36:52,732
I don't know.

421
00:36:52,775 --> 00:36:54,473
I don't have any fond
childhood memories

422
00:36:54,516 --> 00:36:56,039
because of--

423
00:36:56,083 --> 00:36:59,434
- Listen, I'm sure you and
your mother were close.

424
00:37:00,174 --> 00:37:02,132
The memories, they're
probably masked by the most

425
00:37:02,176 --> 00:37:03,482
daunting memory.

426
00:37:04,570 --> 00:37:06,224
Finding her dead,

427
00:37:06,789 --> 00:37:09,183
and that's very, very
traumatizing Lex.

428
00:37:10,184 --> 00:37:12,491
You have to give yourself
credit for even being able

429
00:37:12,534 --> 00:37:14,232
to sleep here.

430
00:37:15,668 --> 00:37:17,583
- I have nightmares.

431
00:37:17,626 --> 00:37:19,149
Bad ones.

432
00:37:19,976 --> 00:37:22,152
Not only that, even
when I'm awake.

433
00:37:22,196 --> 00:37:25,634
It's almost like hallucinations.

434
00:37:26,069 --> 00:37:29,769
- Well, a drowning and a
suicide occurred in this house.

435
00:37:31,074 --> 00:37:33,512
If your mother and brother
spirits are lingering--

436
00:37:33,555 --> 00:37:35,296
- Don't talk like that.

437
00:37:37,298 --> 00:37:40,258
- Listen, all that psychology
babble they taught you

438
00:37:40,301 --> 00:37:43,783
in school may help
you rationalize,

439
00:37:44,131 --> 00:37:47,047
but Lex, there are
somethings in this world

440
00:37:47,090 --> 00:37:49,267
that are way beyond
our understanding.

441
00:37:51,747 --> 00:37:54,881
I think we should order
a psychic to come in

442
00:37:54,924 --> 00:37:56,622
and cleanse the house.

443
00:37:57,231 --> 00:37:59,364
I do have to live here to.

444
00:37:59,407 --> 00:38:01,191
- Oh, well thank you.

445
00:38:01,235 --> 00:38:03,237
I'm sure that will help
you sleep at night.

446
00:38:03,281 --> 00:38:05,065
- Anyways.

447
00:38:06,153 --> 00:38:08,286
You'll thank me later.

448
00:38:09,809 --> 00:38:11,201
Did he leave?

449
00:38:11,245 --> 00:38:12,986
- No he's out back smoking.

450
00:38:13,029 --> 00:38:14,944
- Stay here with her.

451
00:38:14,988 --> 00:38:17,120
- Yeah, don't get
in the middle of it.

452
00:38:32,614 --> 00:38:34,834
Alright, I'ma take off.

453
00:38:53,809 --> 00:38:56,334
- Alexis is gonna
kill you for smoking.

454
00:38:59,293 --> 00:39:00,903
- I don't care.

455
00:39:04,516 --> 00:39:06,344
- You good?

456
00:39:07,170 --> 00:39:08,433
- Yeah.

457
00:39:09,521 --> 00:39:11,305
How about you?

458
00:39:11,349 --> 00:39:12,915
- Good.

459
00:39:14,439 --> 00:39:16,266
I broke up with Ray.

460
00:39:16,310 --> 00:39:17,616
- What?

461
00:39:17,659 --> 00:39:19,792
- What the hell are you
two doing here then?

462
00:39:21,315 --> 00:39:23,404
- He doesn't know it yet.

463
00:39:24,971 --> 00:39:26,407
What?

464
00:39:26,451 --> 00:39:28,583
I do live in bumblefuck now.

465
00:39:33,240 --> 00:39:35,329
I don't love him.

466
00:39:38,463 --> 00:39:41,770
Don't you think you should...

467
00:39:43,032 --> 00:39:44,991
- I'm gonna marry her.

468
00:39:45,818 --> 00:39:47,776
- You know what?

469
00:39:47,820 --> 00:39:49,169
I don't get guys.

470
00:39:49,212 --> 00:39:51,301
You call her crazy and
psycho behind her back

471
00:39:51,345 --> 00:39:54,261
hell to her face and
yet, I don't get it.

472
00:39:54,783 --> 00:39:56,263
What?

473
00:39:56,306 --> 00:39:58,352
You feel like hero for
sticking by the crazy chick?

474
00:39:59,440 --> 00:40:01,616
- She's not the
craziest chick I know.

475
00:40:02,051 --> 00:40:03,618
- I'm sick of you Paul.

476
00:40:03,662 --> 00:40:05,315
So what are you saying?

477
00:40:05,359 --> 00:40:07,361
You're really gonna marry her?

478
00:40:09,929 --> 00:40:12,497
I guess her inheritance
sealed that deal.

479
00:40:12,540 --> 00:40:14,977
- You don't know what the
fuck you're talking about.

480
00:40:16,109 --> 00:40:17,850
- What about me?

481
00:40:17,893 --> 00:40:20,243
I thought you wanted
to be with me?

482
00:40:21,984 --> 00:40:23,856
- She needs me.

483
00:40:26,424 --> 00:40:29,296
- Well then next time your
psycho flips out on you,

484
00:40:29,339 --> 00:40:32,473
don't come running into my bed.

485
00:41:00,196 --> 00:41:02,460
- I don't have a peace offering.

486
00:41:04,723 --> 00:41:06,942
What you're not
talking to me now?

487
00:41:36,276 --> 00:41:38,234
- Paul?

488
00:41:42,848 --> 00:41:44,589
Paul?

489
00:42:43,909 --> 00:42:45,867
- What's wrong?

490
00:42:48,435 --> 00:42:50,350
- It was so real.

491
00:42:51,481 --> 00:42:53,266
- What was so real?

492
00:42:55,007 --> 00:42:57,009
- I saw my mother.

493
00:42:58,663 --> 00:43:01,056
The way I found her
when I was eight.

494
00:43:02,362 --> 00:43:04,277
I was right there.

495
00:43:07,976 --> 00:43:09,412
It was so real.

496
00:43:11,327 --> 00:43:13,112
- Let's go to sleep.

497
00:43:26,516 --> 00:43:29,345
- I really hope Ray brings
my mattress like he promised.

498
00:43:30,085 --> 00:43:32,305
He can be such a
douche sometimes.

499
00:43:32,348 --> 00:43:35,874
You gotta tell me what
you want to keep in here.

500
00:43:36,701 --> 00:43:39,007
I'd hate to throw away
anything memorable.

501
00:43:39,312 --> 00:43:41,357
- Just get rid of it all.

502
00:43:41,706 --> 00:43:43,316
- You sure?

503
00:43:43,359 --> 00:43:44,796
- Yeah.

504
00:43:45,318 --> 00:43:46,928
- Okay.

505
00:44:00,289 --> 00:44:01,334
- Hey.

506
00:44:01,377 --> 00:44:02,814
Nice touch.

507
00:44:02,857 --> 00:44:04,511
Like the mattress.

508
00:44:18,656 --> 00:44:21,180
- Upstairs to the left.

509
00:44:26,228 --> 00:44:28,491
- Oh fuck this man.

510
00:44:28,970 --> 00:44:30,319
I just came to drop it off.

511
00:44:30,363 --> 00:44:31,843
She can take it from here.

512
00:44:31,886 --> 00:44:33,235
- Come on man.

513
00:44:33,279 --> 00:44:34,019
- No.

514
00:44:34,062 --> 00:44:35,803
Let her go.

515
00:44:36,108 --> 00:44:37,457
- Great now I have
to deal with this.

516
00:44:37,500 --> 00:44:39,024
- No you don't.

517
00:44:39,067 --> 00:44:39,851
No drama.

518
00:44:39,894 --> 00:44:40,634
No meddling.

519
00:44:40,678 --> 00:44:41,417
- Yes I do.

520
00:44:41,461 --> 00:44:43,158
I don't want Ray to...

521
00:44:43,202 --> 00:44:44,594
- To what?

522
00:44:44,856 --> 00:44:46,814
- I don't want him
to break up with her.

523
00:44:46,858 --> 00:44:48,511
- No meddling.

524
00:44:51,689 --> 00:44:53,647
I have to carry
this shit by myself.

525
00:44:54,169 --> 00:44:55,388
What a dick.

526
00:45:22,197 --> 00:45:24,460
You know I could talk
to him if you want.

527
00:45:26,549 --> 00:45:28,073
- No.

528
00:45:28,116 --> 00:45:29,596
It's fine.

529
00:45:30,423 --> 00:45:32,425
You have your own
relationship to deal with.

530
00:45:52,837 --> 00:45:54,403
- Hey aunt Pat.

531
00:45:54,447 --> 00:45:56,841
- So, hows the
settling coming along?

532
00:45:56,884 --> 00:45:59,452
- Good, we're do the
whole out with the old,

533
00:45:59,495 --> 00:46:01,019
in with the new thing.

534
00:46:01,062 --> 00:46:03,021
I'm not getting rid of too
much, just making it mine,

535
00:46:03,064 --> 00:46:03,978
you know?

536
00:46:04,022 --> 00:46:05,501
- Yeah, I understand.

537
00:46:05,545 --> 00:46:07,852
Hey why don't I bring
you kids some dinner?

538
00:46:07,895 --> 00:46:10,158
- No, you don't have to
come all the way out here.

539
00:46:10,202 --> 00:46:11,899
- I won't have you
starving to death.

540
00:46:11,943 --> 00:46:13,466
- I'll be fine.

541
00:46:13,509 --> 00:46:15,468
I'm gonna rest later anyways.

542
00:46:15,511 --> 00:46:17,600
- Just don't forget about
your old auntie okay?

543
00:46:17,905 --> 00:46:18,993
- I'm not.

544
00:46:19,037 --> 00:46:20,125
I love you.

545
00:46:20,168 --> 00:46:21,604
- Love you too honey.

546
00:46:30,918 --> 00:46:33,094
- I'm gonna check the
roof and the foundation.

547
00:46:33,138 --> 00:46:34,530
See if any repairs
need to be made.

548
00:46:34,574 --> 00:46:35,793
- Okay.

549
00:46:35,836 --> 00:46:36,968
- You alright?

550
00:46:37,011 --> 00:46:39,274
- Yeah I just hope Kira's okay.

551
00:46:39,492 --> 00:46:41,450
- Seriously, how many
times have they broken up?

552
00:46:41,973 --> 00:46:43,496
I'll be back.

553
00:47:11,306 --> 00:47:13,004
- Hey.

554
00:47:13,047 --> 00:47:14,266
What are you doing?

555
00:47:14,309 --> 00:47:16,050
- Just scrubbing the floor.

556
00:47:16,094 --> 00:47:18,183
- What do you want me
to do with this stuff?

557
00:47:18,618 --> 00:47:20,707
- Just put it in the
dumpster out back?

558
00:47:21,621 --> 00:47:23,536
- Okey dokey.

559
00:48:46,619 --> 00:48:47,968
You gotta go.

560
00:48:48,012 --> 00:48:49,883
- What are you doing?

561
00:48:51,363 --> 00:48:53,365
- I'm cutting down
this old bird house.

562
00:48:53,408 --> 00:48:55,106
The wood is rotten, besides
it's bad to feed the birds--

563
00:48:55,149 --> 00:48:57,456
- What is wrong with you?

564
00:48:57,499 --> 00:48:59,066
I'm not gonna get
rid of everything.

565
00:48:59,110 --> 00:49:00,981
Can you have a little
consideration and ask me before

566
00:49:01,025 --> 00:49:02,635
you get rid of stuff?

567
00:49:03,462 --> 00:49:04,854
- Fine.

568
00:49:05,551 --> 00:49:07,031
Cuckoo.

569
00:49:49,769 --> 00:49:51,466
Hey.

570
00:49:52,815 --> 00:49:55,383
Why the hell did
you leave like that?

571
00:49:58,691 --> 00:50:02,477
- Paul, there are no
pictures of me in this house.

572
00:50:03,565 --> 00:50:04,523
- What?

573
00:50:04,566 --> 00:50:06,046
- Pictures.

574
00:50:06,090 --> 00:50:08,222
There are no pictures
anywhere of me in this house.

575
00:50:09,136 --> 00:50:10,746
They're all boxed up.

576
00:50:10,790 --> 00:50:13,271
- I saw some
hanging around somewhere.

577
00:50:13,923 --> 00:50:15,621
- No, those are my brother.

578
00:50:15,664 --> 00:50:17,101
Joshua.

579
00:50:19,929 --> 00:50:21,192
I don't understand why
they wouldn't have pictures

580
00:50:21,235 --> 00:50:22,932
of me hanging up everywhere.

581
00:50:24,021 --> 00:50:26,197
- I don't know Lex.

582
00:50:26,240 --> 00:50:29,243
Look, try not to stress over it.

583
00:50:30,114 --> 00:50:31,202
Ask your aunt.

584
00:50:31,245 --> 00:50:32,725
I'm sure she knows what's up.

585
00:50:33,117 --> 00:50:35,206
- She doesn't have any
pictures of me this young.

586
00:50:35,249 --> 00:50:36,729
- Let me see this picture.

587
00:50:38,252 --> 00:50:39,471
Were you an ugly baby?

588
00:50:39,514 --> 00:50:40,863
- No!

589
00:50:40,907 --> 00:50:42,952
I was an adorable baby.

590
00:50:44,128 --> 00:50:45,781
Stop.

591
00:50:45,825 --> 00:50:47,218
- Alright.

592
00:50:47,261 --> 00:50:48,132
You good?

593
00:50:48,175 --> 00:50:49,742
I'm gonna head out.

594
00:50:49,785 --> 00:50:54,051
- Well, it was good to
spend some time with you.

595
00:50:54,921 --> 00:50:56,270
- I know.

596
00:50:56,314 --> 00:50:58,055
- It's like you
live another state.

597
00:50:58,098 --> 00:51:01,362
- I was thinking that after
you get out of your classes

598
00:51:01,406 --> 00:51:03,321
you could move down here.

599
00:51:04,061 --> 00:51:05,584
In here.

600
00:51:06,019 --> 00:51:07,455
- Hm.

601
00:51:07,499 --> 00:51:08,978
- Unless you know, you have
to go work with your dad

602
00:51:09,022 --> 00:51:10,502
and I get it.

603
00:51:10,545 --> 00:51:12,069
- No, no.

604
00:51:12,112 --> 00:51:14,071
It's actually not a bad idea.

605
00:51:14,767 --> 00:51:17,204
I can start my own
construction company.

606
00:51:17,900 --> 00:51:20,033
Make him proud.

607
00:51:25,386 --> 00:51:27,562
- Hey you two.

608
00:51:27,606 --> 00:51:29,042
- Hey.

609
00:51:29,086 --> 00:51:30,652
Oh look.

610
00:51:34,047 --> 00:51:36,093
- I've never seen a
baby photo of you.

611
00:51:36,136 --> 00:51:37,398
Cute.

612
00:51:38,269 --> 00:51:40,749
Someone thinks it's cute.

613
00:51:40,793 --> 00:51:42,011
- I didn't say a word.

614
00:51:42,055 --> 00:51:44,362
Alright, I'll see you
guys later alright.

615
00:51:44,405 --> 00:51:46,015
- Goodnight.

616
00:51:48,148 --> 00:51:51,064
Well, it's just me and you.

617
00:51:52,587 --> 00:51:56,025
- Come on lets go
start this new chapter

618
00:51:56,069 --> 00:51:57,592
in our lives.

619
00:51:59,203 --> 00:52:03,337
Law school for me, psycho
babble school for you.

620
00:52:03,381 --> 00:52:05,034
Lets.

621
00:54:31,703 --> 00:54:33,357
- Hey.

622
00:54:35,272 --> 00:54:36,751
What time is your first class?

623
00:54:36,795 --> 00:54:38,405
Did you wanna carpool?

624
00:54:40,886 --> 00:54:43,062
- It's not till 10.

625
00:54:43,105 --> 00:54:45,020
- You good?

626
00:54:46,892 --> 00:54:48,241
- I'll see you later.

627
00:54:48,285 --> 00:54:49,982
- Okay, see ya.

628
00:56:51,277 --> 00:56:53,366
- Leave me alone!

629
00:56:54,062 --> 00:56:56,674
- Jesus Lexi what the
hell is wrong with you?

630
00:56:57,022 --> 00:56:57,979
- I'm sorry.

631
00:56:58,023 --> 00:56:59,894
Let me get you a towel.

632
00:57:00,199 --> 00:57:02,114
- I cannot deal with this.

633
00:57:03,202 --> 00:57:05,160
- I'm sorry.

634
00:57:54,558 --> 00:57:56,124
- Dammit.

635
00:57:56,168 --> 00:57:57,691
Fucking shit.

636
00:58:28,592 --> 00:58:30,550
- Hey whats up?

637
00:58:31,290 --> 00:58:32,465
What's wrong?

638
00:58:32,509 --> 00:58:33,466
- It's Alexis.

639
00:58:33,510 --> 00:58:34,249
- How is she?

640
00:58:34,293 --> 00:58:35,555
- Not good.

641
00:58:35,599 --> 00:58:37,122
- Shit.

642
00:58:52,877 --> 00:58:54,574
Jesus Christ, Lex.

643
00:58:58,012 --> 00:59:00,101
- Where's Alexis?

644
00:59:14,333 --> 00:59:16,161
Alexis.

645
00:59:32,656 --> 00:59:35,180
Mind if I crash here tonight?

646
00:59:35,484 --> 00:59:37,269
- Of course not.

647
00:59:47,888 --> 00:59:52,589
You know I think my
manifestations will go away

648
00:59:53,111 --> 00:59:55,200
now that I figured it out.

649
00:59:56,505 --> 00:59:58,159
- Do you think you
need to see somebody?

650
00:59:58,203 --> 01:00:00,161
Like a doctor or something?

651
01:00:00,205 --> 01:00:01,902
- I'm fine.

652
01:00:03,208 --> 01:00:04,949
- Okay.

653
01:00:07,255 --> 01:00:10,171
Well maybe we can focus on
being a little normal now.

654
01:00:11,869 --> 01:00:14,306
- You don't like normal,
that's why you're with me.

655
01:00:14,741 --> 01:00:16,613
- That's not why I'm with you.

656
01:00:18,702 --> 01:00:19,877
- Hm.

657
01:00:19,920 --> 01:00:21,443
I don't wanna know
why you're with me,

658
01:00:21,487 --> 01:00:23,402
I just wanna know that you are.

659
01:00:42,334 --> 01:00:44,379
Are you leaving?

660
01:00:44,423 --> 01:00:45,206
- Yeah.

661
01:00:45,250 --> 01:00:46,425
I have class.

662
01:00:46,468 --> 01:00:47,818
So do you.

663
01:00:47,861 --> 01:00:49,558
- What time is it?

664
01:00:49,602 --> 01:00:51,299
- Six.

665
01:00:51,343 --> 01:00:54,302
If I leave now, I should
make it to LA by tomorrow.

666
01:00:54,563 --> 01:00:56,653
- It's not that far.

667
01:01:00,439 --> 01:01:02,833
- See you soon babe.

668
01:01:35,343 --> 01:01:38,956
- Oh my god.

669
01:02:20,301 --> 01:02:21,041
What!

670
01:02:21,085 --> 01:02:21,868
- Hey.

671
01:02:21,912 --> 01:02:23,043
Are you up?

672
01:02:23,087 --> 01:02:24,088
- Yeah.

673
01:02:24,131 --> 01:02:25,393
- What times your first class?

674
01:02:25,437 --> 01:02:26,307
Wanna carpool?

675
01:02:26,351 --> 01:02:27,395
You're right by my job.

676
01:02:27,439 --> 01:02:29,049
- It's not the way.

677
01:02:29,876 --> 01:02:31,269
- Lex.

678
01:02:33,097 --> 01:02:35,534
- I really figured
it out this time.

679
01:02:35,839 --> 01:02:36,883
- Lex.

680
01:02:36,927 --> 01:02:39,843
I don't like to
see you like this.

681
01:03:28,239 --> 01:03:30,067
- Hold your horses.

682
01:03:30,545 --> 01:03:31,938
Hold your horses.

683
01:03:37,770 --> 01:03:39,250
Hello?

684
01:03:39,293 --> 01:03:42,340
- Hello, may I speak
to Patricia King please?

685
01:03:42,383 --> 01:03:43,384
- This is she.

686
01:03:43,428 --> 01:03:44,864
Who is this?

687
01:03:44,908 --> 01:03:45,996
- This is nurse
Amy I'm calling regarding

688
01:03:46,039 --> 01:03:47,867
your brother Dorian.

689
01:04:11,195 --> 01:04:12,979
- Hey.

690
01:04:14,067 --> 01:04:16,417
I didn't think
you'd beat me home.

691
01:04:16,853 --> 01:04:18,463
How are your classes?

692
01:04:18,942 --> 01:04:20,334
- Good.

693
01:04:20,813 --> 01:04:22,902
- Well, I don't
have a lot of time.

694
01:04:24,948 --> 01:04:27,254
I can make you some dinner.

695
01:04:27,602 --> 01:04:29,430
Before I go if you'd like.

696
01:04:29,691 --> 01:04:31,128
- It's fine.

697
01:04:39,963 --> 01:04:43,140
- I'm telling
you Ray, something's up.

698
01:04:43,183 --> 01:04:44,706
I don't think she
went to class today.

699
01:04:44,750 --> 01:04:46,360
She's wearing the same clothes.

700
01:04:46,708 --> 01:04:48,449
I don't know what to do.

701
01:04:48,493 --> 01:04:49,755
- Did you call her aunt?

702
01:04:49,798 --> 01:04:51,452
She takes some pretty
heavy pills doesn't she?

703
01:04:51,496 --> 01:04:52,410
- Yeah.

704
01:04:52,453 --> 01:04:53,498
Mood disorder stuff.

705
01:04:53,541 --> 01:04:55,456
Stuff I don't wanna deal with.

706
01:04:56,544 --> 01:04:59,330
I really, really should
have gotten my own place.

707
01:05:00,418 --> 01:05:02,899
This place is starting
to creep me out.

708
01:05:03,116 --> 01:05:05,292
She said she's
already seen ghosts.

709
01:05:05,597 --> 01:05:07,425
- Oh come on.

710
01:05:07,773 --> 01:05:09,383
- Seriously.

711
01:05:10,080 --> 01:05:12,082
I think she's possessed.

712
01:05:12,125 --> 01:05:14,954
- Alright look just, stop
being as nutty as she is

713
01:05:14,998 --> 01:05:16,434
and call her aunt.

714
01:05:16,782 --> 01:05:18,305
- Whatever.

715
01:05:19,132 --> 01:05:20,742
I wanna see you.

716
01:05:20,786 --> 01:05:22,353
- Ha, yeah right.

717
01:05:22,788 --> 01:05:24,833
You miss Pauly.

718
01:05:24,877 --> 01:05:26,966
- Would you stop that?

719
01:05:27,271 --> 01:05:29,360
I really wanna see you.

720
01:05:31,405 --> 01:05:34,365
- Manana, I gotta go.

721
01:05:45,071 --> 01:05:47,030
- She locked me away.

722
01:05:47,073 --> 01:05:48,901
- Who Alexis?

723
01:05:55,516 --> 01:05:57,997
- She's at the
bottom of the stairs.

724
01:05:58,867 --> 01:06:00,652
He will be too.

725
01:06:02,132 --> 01:06:04,699
- Alexis maybe you
should lie back down.

726
01:06:05,309 --> 01:06:07,006
- You don't see her.

727
01:06:07,702 --> 01:06:09,574
Not like I do.

728
01:06:10,053 --> 01:06:12,098
- Okay, I'm calling your aunt.

729
01:06:12,142 --> 01:06:13,665
- Don't call her.

730
01:06:15,319 --> 01:06:17,234
I don't wanna worry her.

731
01:06:18,670 --> 01:06:22,413
Besides, no one
will believe you.

732
01:06:23,980 --> 01:06:27,374
- Alexis, you're really
fucking scary me.

733
01:06:27,418 --> 01:06:28,636
- Shit.

734
01:06:30,725 --> 01:06:32,684
She's here.

735
01:06:33,119 --> 01:06:35,165
- No one is here.

736
01:06:37,080 --> 01:06:38,820
No one is here.

737
01:06:39,778 --> 01:06:42,215
Lex I can't just
leave you like this.

738
01:06:42,259 --> 01:06:43,651
Lex?

739
01:07:23,778 --> 01:07:25,998
- Are you
ready for your bath?

740
01:07:40,230 --> 01:07:42,014
- What's up?

741
01:07:42,058 --> 01:07:43,450
What's the emergency now?

742
01:07:43,494 --> 01:07:45,104
- She's babbling.

743
01:07:45,148 --> 01:07:46,584
I don't know what she's saying.

744
01:07:46,627 --> 01:07:48,455
You need to help her.

745
01:07:52,503 --> 01:07:55,593
I think she needs you.

746
01:07:57,464 --> 01:07:59,423
- Okay.

747
01:08:26,537 --> 01:08:27,886
Stop!

748
01:08:27,929 --> 01:08:29,540
Stop!

749
01:08:32,369 --> 01:08:33,457
It's me.

750
01:09:20,243 --> 01:09:22,201
She's sleeping.

751
01:09:23,811 --> 01:09:25,726
- It's never been like this.

752
01:09:25,770 --> 01:09:27,337
I was so scared.

753
01:09:27,380 --> 01:09:29,252
Thank god you came.

754
01:11:36,988 --> 01:11:38,772
- What are you doing here?

755
01:11:38,816 --> 01:11:39,991
- You said you missed me.

756
01:11:40,034 --> 01:11:41,209
- Really?

757
01:11:41,253 --> 01:11:43,255
You hung up on me,
I don't miss that.

758
01:11:43,777 --> 01:11:46,258
- Come on babe,
I'm making amends.

759
01:11:49,653 --> 01:11:53,309
Okay, well I'll come inside,
see as that you won't let me.

760
01:11:55,920 --> 01:11:56,921
- Shh.

761
01:11:56,964 --> 01:11:58,923
Paul's sleeping on the couch.

762
01:11:58,966 --> 01:12:00,228
- What?

763
01:12:00,272 --> 01:12:00,968
Why the hell is he
sleeping on the couch?

764
01:12:01,012 --> 01:12:01,534
- Would you stop.

765
01:12:01,578 --> 01:12:02,840
- What?

766
01:12:02,883 --> 01:12:04,232
It's 11 o'clock yo bro
wake up, I got beer.

767
01:12:04,276 --> 01:12:05,321
- I told you
something happened with Lex.

768
01:12:08,193 --> 01:12:09,803
- Shit.

769
01:12:09,847 --> 01:12:11,327
Damn she do that?

770
01:12:11,631 --> 01:12:12,850
- Yes.

771
01:12:12,893 --> 01:12:14,155
- I didn't know it
was that serious.

772
01:12:14,199 --> 01:12:16,157
- That's because you
don't listen to me.

773
01:12:16,636 --> 01:12:18,421
- It took me a while,

774
01:12:18,464 --> 01:12:20,248
to calm her down.

775
01:12:20,466 --> 01:12:21,380
- Alright.

776
01:12:21,424 --> 01:12:22,642
That's it,

777
01:12:22,686 --> 01:12:23,991
You guys need to have
this girl committed.

778
01:12:24,035 --> 01:12:25,166
- It's not her.

779
01:12:25,210 --> 01:12:26,385
It's this house.

780
01:12:26,429 --> 01:12:27,343
- Would you stop.

781
01:12:27,386 --> 01:12:28,866
It's her.

782
01:12:28,909 --> 01:12:30,346
She's crazy okay, just like
her mother and her father.

783
01:12:30,650 --> 01:12:32,304
And I don't know what...

784
01:12:32,870 --> 01:12:35,220
- Sorry I didn't mean
to scare you guys.

785
01:12:36,264 --> 01:12:38,354
- How you feeling?

786
01:12:39,572 --> 01:12:40,965
- Much better.

787
01:12:41,008 --> 01:12:42,227
Thank you.

788
01:12:43,489 --> 01:12:45,361
- Hey Ray, thanks
for coming over.

789
01:12:45,404 --> 01:12:47,232
- Hey Lexi, how you doing?

790
01:12:47,493 --> 01:12:49,190
- Good, thanks.

791
01:12:49,234 --> 01:12:50,366
- Good, good.

792
01:12:51,541 --> 01:12:54,282
I'ma take this to the fridge.

793
01:12:57,329 --> 01:12:59,113
- I'll be back.

794
01:13:00,376 --> 01:13:01,202
- Hey.

795
01:13:01,246 --> 01:13:02,552
I didn't--

796
01:13:02,595 --> 01:13:03,770
- Hey, it's okay.

797
01:13:03,814 --> 01:13:05,816
I'm gonna grab a
beer, do you want one?

798
01:13:06,382 --> 01:13:07,426
- I don't think it's a
good idea that you drink

799
01:13:07,470 --> 01:13:08,340
with the medication.

800
01:13:08,384 --> 01:13:10,255
- Will you stop?

801
01:13:12,866 --> 01:13:15,303
Don't do that, okay honey.

802
01:13:17,262 --> 01:13:18,872
I've been going through a lot.

803
01:13:18,916 --> 01:13:21,266
Just been a little
distraught that's all.

804
01:13:22,136 --> 01:13:23,486
I'm fine now.

805
01:13:23,529 --> 01:13:24,878
Okay.

806
01:13:36,281 --> 01:13:37,848
- Oh fuck.

807
01:13:59,478 --> 01:14:00,740
- I knew you'd come around Kira.

808
01:14:00,784 --> 01:14:02,263
Fuck, Lex.

809
01:14:02,481 --> 01:14:03,482
What are you doing here?

810
01:14:03,526 --> 01:14:04,570
Paul's in the other room.

811
01:14:04,614 --> 01:14:06,398
- You were right about them.

812
01:14:07,181 --> 01:14:09,749
So let's get them back.

813
01:14:10,750 --> 01:14:13,318
- No, no, no, no.

814
01:14:14,058 --> 01:14:16,103
- They're fucking Ray.

815
01:14:16,147 --> 01:14:18,062
You and I both know it.

816
01:14:20,717 --> 01:14:22,632
- No, no they're not.

817
01:14:23,328 --> 01:14:24,460
- You're psycho.

818
01:14:24,503 --> 01:14:26,070
Why the fuck would
I listen to you?

819
01:14:26,113 --> 01:14:27,506
- Why do people always do that?

820
01:14:27,550 --> 01:14:29,639
Call someone else crazy.

821
01:14:29,900 --> 01:14:32,337
You came to me first.

822
01:14:32,685 --> 01:14:35,079
So wouldn't that
make you crazy too?

823
01:14:43,435 --> 01:14:44,871
- Fuck you.

824
01:14:56,535 --> 01:14:58,537
Fuck it man this bitch.

825
01:14:58,581 --> 01:14:59,712
Fuck.

826
01:14:59,756 --> 01:15:01,105
Fuck!

827
01:15:03,890 --> 01:15:05,762
Crazy ass motherfucker.

828
01:17:40,307 --> 01:17:42,309
- I don't know if...

829
01:17:46,662 --> 01:17:49,142
I'm thinking of moving to
Colorado after graduation.

830
01:17:50,187 --> 01:17:51,754
There's a company there
that offered me a project

831
01:17:51,797 --> 01:17:53,364
manager position.

832
01:17:53,407 --> 01:17:55,061
A real good job.

833
01:17:58,151 --> 01:17:59,849
- Okay.

834
01:18:01,589 --> 01:18:03,330
I'll come with you.

835
01:18:07,726 --> 01:18:10,207
- I think you need to stay here.

836
01:18:10,990 --> 01:18:12,557
And get some help.

837
01:18:13,079 --> 01:18:14,515
- Hey.

838
01:18:14,559 --> 01:18:16,430
I'll be fine.

839
01:18:20,478 --> 01:18:22,436
I'm making it through this.

840
01:18:33,491 --> 01:18:34,492
Hello?

841
01:18:34,535 --> 01:18:36,015
- Are you okay?

842
01:18:36,059 --> 01:18:37,364
- Yeah I'm fine aunt Pat.

843
01:18:37,408 --> 01:18:38,583
What's wrong?

844
01:18:38,626 --> 01:18:40,977
- It's Dorian,
you're step father,

845
01:18:41,020 --> 01:18:42,413
I don't know how he did it.

846
01:18:42,456 --> 01:18:44,110
He's out Lex.

847
01:18:44,241 --> 01:18:46,069
He was here in my house.

848
01:18:46,112 --> 01:18:48,027
He attacked me.

849
01:18:48,071 --> 01:18:50,029
- Okay I'll send
Paul to come get you.

850
01:18:50,073 --> 01:18:52,031
- No, no he said
he's coming for you.

851
01:18:52,075 --> 01:18:54,251
You've got to get
out of that house!

852
01:18:55,513 --> 01:18:56,775
- Lex what's wrong?

853
01:18:56,819 --> 01:18:58,255
- It's Dorian.

854
01:18:58,298 --> 01:18:59,735
He's coming after me.

855
01:18:59,778 --> 01:19:00,474
- Wait.

856
01:19:00,518 --> 01:19:01,388
What?

857
01:19:01,432 --> 01:19:02,607
- We have to get out of here.

858
01:19:02,650 --> 01:19:04,087
He's dangerous.

859
01:19:04,130 --> 01:19:06,176
- Oh fuck man!

860
01:19:12,486 --> 01:19:14,271
- She locked me away.

861
01:19:14,314 --> 01:19:16,664
She locked me away to
keep him from getting me.

862
01:19:17,796 --> 01:19:19,537
- Oh damn man!

863
01:19:24,368 --> 01:19:27,110
Yo Ray, come on man we gotta go.

864
01:19:29,634 --> 01:19:31,723
I'm serious man we gotta
get the fuck out of here.

865
01:19:31,767 --> 01:19:33,812
Lex's crazy ass pops
is on the loose!

866
01:19:35,901 --> 01:19:37,947
You drunk ass motherfucker!

867
01:19:40,950 --> 01:19:42,865
Ray did you hear me?

868
01:19:42,908 --> 01:19:44,214
Why you playing man we gotta...

869
01:19:45,258 --> 01:19:46,085
Shit!

871
01:19:46,956 --> 01:19:47,826
Ray!

872
01:19:47,870 --> 01:19:49,001
Oh my god.

873
01:19:49,045 --> 01:19:50,133
Ray!

874
01:19:53,179 --> 01:19:55,442
- Alexis what the
hell is going on?

875
01:19:57,488 --> 01:19:59,795
- He's coming after me.

876
01:20:01,187 --> 01:20:02,841
I'm sorry.

877
01:20:02,885 --> 01:20:04,538
- What?

878
01:20:04,800 --> 01:20:07,237
- Alexis, Kira we gotta get
the fuck out of here now!

879
01:20:10,501 --> 01:20:12,024
- Is that blood?

880
01:20:12,068 --> 01:20:13,243
What the hell is going on?

881
01:20:13,286 --> 01:20:14,374
We gotta go.

882
01:20:14,418 --> 01:20:15,854
Lex now!

883
01:20:15,898 --> 01:20:17,508
- Fine where's Ray?

884
01:20:18,291 --> 01:20:19,162

885
01:20:19,205 --> 01:20:21,555
- We gotta go, now!

886
01:20:22,165 --> 01:20:23,601
- Ray!

887
01:20:25,081 --> 01:20:26,430
- Oh fuck.

888
01:20:36,570 --> 01:20:37,833
Oh shit.

889
01:20:37,876 --> 01:20:39,356
Fuck!

01:20:39,399 --> 01:20:40,879
Shit.

01:20:42,925 --> 01:20:44,361
Kira what the hell

01:20:44,404 --> 01:20:46,145
We gotta get the fuck

893
01:20:46,189 --> 01:20:47,407
- We have to go!

894
01:20:47,451 --> 01:20:49,279
- No I can't just
leave him like this.

895
01:20:51,977 --> 01:20:53,544
- Paul do something!

896
01:20:54,762 --> 01:20:55,938
Do something!

897
01:20:55,981 --> 01:20:56,895
- Okay!

898
01:20:56,939 --> 01:20:57,853
Alright.

01:20:57,896 --> 01:20:59,376
Fucking help me pick him up.

900
01:20:59,419 --> 01:21:01,030
Get the legs, get legs

901
01:21:01,073 --> 01:21:02,422
- Wait, wait.

902
01:21:02,466 --> 01:21:04,033
- Can't we just go man!

903
01:21:04,076 --> 01:21:05,164
- Oh my god be careful!

904
01:21:05,208 --> 01:21:07,340
- Get his legs man.

905
01:21:07,950 --> 01:21:08,820
Lets go.

906
01:21:08,864 --> 01:21:10,213
- Can you be careful!

907
01:21:10,256 --> 01:21:11,997
Fucking idiot.

908
01:21:12,215 --> 01:21:13,259

01:21:29,232 --> 01:21:30,755
Fuck.

- Fuck man.

912
01:21:38,415 --> 01:21:40,721
- Paul do something.

913
01:21:40,765 --> 01:21:42,201
- I don't know what to do man!

914
01:21:42,245 --> 01:21:43,724
We gotta get the
fuck out of here!

915
01:21:43,768 --> 01:21:45,204
Kira we gotta go leave him!

916
01:21:45,248 --> 01:21:46,075
- No!

917
01:21:46,118 --> 01:21:47,293
- Come on!

918
01:21:47,337 --> 01:21:48,947
What the fuck!

919
01:21:49,382 --> 01:21:50,731
Fuck man!

920
01:21:51,254 --> 01:21:53,343
He's already dead we have to go!

921
01:21:54,170 --> 01:21:55,432
Fuck man!

922
01:21:55,475 --> 01:21:57,260
Oh my god.

923
01:21:57,651 --> 01:21:58,522
What am I gonna do?

924
01:21:58,565 --> 01:21:59,653
What am I gonna do?

925
01:21:59,697 --> 01:22:00,611
What do I do?

926
01:22:00,654 --> 01:22:02,134
What do I do?

927
01:22:02,656 --> 01:22:04,354
Fuck.

928
01:22:05,355 --> 01:22:08,053
Where the fuck did Alexis go!

929
01:22:08,836 --> 01:22:10,447
Shit man!

930
01:22:13,798 --> 01:22:15,495
- Oh my god.

931
01:22:23,329 --> 01:22:25,201
- Alexis?

932
01:22:25,462 --> 01:22:27,246
Alexis!

933
01:22:35,037 --> 01:22:36,299
Alexis?

934
01:22:41,347 --> 01:22:42,870
Alexis?

935
01:23:01,324 --> 01:23:02,760
Alexis?

936
01:23:02,803 --> 01:23:04,283
Alexis?

937
01:24:16,442 --> 01:24:18,096
Alexis?

938
01:24:58,919 --> 01:25:00,921
- Where are you?

939
01:25:03,794 --> 01:25:06,927
You sick bastard.

940
01:25:19,505 --> 01:25:21,203
Where are you?

941
01:27:11,226 --> 01:27:13,619
- It's got to stop!

942
01:28:57,941 --> 01:29:00,030
- Aunt Pat look what I found.

943
01:29:01,423 --> 01:29:03,599
I'm clumsy though, do
you have another frame?

944
01:29:03,642 --> 01:29:05,601
- Oh, look how cute.

945
01:29:07,733 --> 01:29:09,256
I'm sure I have a frame
in the attic, I'll check.

946
01:29:09,300 --> 01:29:10,649
- Thank you.

947
01:29:10,693 --> 01:29:13,260
Don't wait up, I have
internship after class.

948
01:29:13,304 --> 01:29:14,914
- You work too hard.

949
01:29:14,958 --> 01:29:19,354
- You know aunt Pat, I really
don't think I need those.

950
01:29:20,964 --> 01:29:22,357
- You're right.

951
01:29:22,400 --> 01:29:24,533
I don't want you over
medicated you have to focus.

952
01:29:25,055 --> 01:29:26,448
Go on get out of here.

953
01:29:26,491 --> 01:29:28,101
Don't be late.

954
01:29:55,738 --> 01:29:57,174
Dearest Dorian.

955
01:29:57,217 --> 01:29:58,828
- Dorian I
hope this letter finds it's

956
01:29:58,871 --> 01:30:00,438
way to you somehow.

957
01:30:00,482 --> 01:30:03,398
Not just physically
but, in understanding.

958
01:30:04,529 --> 01:30:07,010
I don't want to harm Alexis.

959
01:30:07,314 --> 01:30:09,142
She's my child.

960
01:30:09,534 --> 01:30:11,710
But what else can I do?

961
01:30:11,971 --> 01:30:14,452
Who would believe the
evil that's inside her?

962
01:30:18,761 --> 01:30:19,675
No!

963
01:30:19,718 --> 01:30:21,067
Josh no!

964
01:30:21,111 --> 01:30:23,853
I tried to tell you
a million times.

965
01:30:23,896 --> 01:30:26,595
I think she had something to
do with her father's death.

966
01:30:27,770 --> 01:30:30,512
I thought he was crazy
when he tried to warn me

967
01:30:30,555 --> 01:30:32,035
about her.

968
01:30:34,124 --> 01:30:36,431
I really don't know how.

969
01:30:37,388 --> 01:30:39,956
And I know it sounds crazy but,

970
01:30:42,349 --> 01:30:44,526
she drowned Joshua.

971
01:30:47,529 --> 01:30:50,053
Then she came for me.

972
01:30:52,969 --> 01:30:55,058
You were next.

973
01:31:40,538 --> 01:31:41,713
- Baby?

974
01:31:41,757 --> 01:31:42,801
Baby?

975
01:31:42,845 --> 01:31:43,976
Baby, wake up!

976
01:31:44,020 --> 01:31:44,499
- No one would believe me.

977
01:31:46,588 --> 01:31:48,894
No one will believe you.

978
01:31:49,808 --> 01:31:54,813
No one will ever believe
evil is born and lives

979
01:31:55,510 --> 01:31:57,294
in this child.

980
01:31:58,687 --> 01:32:01,864
No one will ever believe.

981
01:32:04,867 --> 01:32:05,345
- Stop!

982
01:32:05,389 --> 01:32:06,303
Stop!

983
01:32:06,346 --> 01:32:07,609
I'm not gonna hurt you.

984
01:32:08,435 --> 01:32:10,002
Where is she?

985
01:32:10,046 --> 01:32:12,222
- She lives in the
house in Victorville.

986
01:32:12,788 --> 01:32:14,311
Dorian!

987
01:32:15,834 --> 01:32:19,055
- Aunt Pat, what are you doing?
