<i>Your Royal Highness,</i>

<i>He measured 52 cm.</i>

24
00:04:01,708 --> 00:04:04,917
<i>Thank God, he's very lively

25
00:04:14,454 --> 00:04:21,770
<i>September 4, 1906. Heinrich started

<i>Heinrich was often ill with mono,
measles, pneumonia, mumps,</i>

27
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:30,179
<i>but he caught up,
with the help of Miss Rudelt</i>

28

<i>and passed with a B.</i>

29
00:04:37,844 --> 00:04:40,381
<i>March 12, 1910.</i>

30
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:46,726

<i>Russia, France, and Belgium

00:05:52,218 --> 00:05:55,529

60
00:06:56,215 --> 00:06:58,491
<i>At 5:00 pm, Mom and Dad
drove to the train station</i>

61

<i>to hand out refreshments
to the wounded soldiers.</i>

62
00:07:05,458 --> 00:07:09,406
<i>Gebhard was allowed to go with them,</i>

63
00:07:09,495 --> 00:07:11,270
<i>which made me jealous.</i>

64
00:07:11,831 --> 00:07:16,905
<i>It's not 70,000 Russians
captured in East Prussia but 90,000.</i>

<i>Instead I went' to bed.</i>

71
00:07:41,594 --> 00:07:44,905
<i>People in Landshut
are so dumb and cowardly.</i>

72
00:07:44,997 --> 00:07:48,376
<i>Even the idea
of the troop withdrawal from Paris</i>

73
00:07:48,468 --> 00:07:52,848
<i>made them shit their pants.</i>

74
00:07:52,939 --> 00:07:56,079
<i>I would have expected that
least of all from the Bavarians,</i>

75
00:07:56,175 --> 00:07:58,712
<i>since they are usually so rowdy.</i>

76
00:07:58,811 --> 00:08:01,314
<i>Even a wounded soldier said so.</i>

77
00:08:02,815 --> 00:08:07,457
<i>Gebhard turns 17 today
and joins the Landsturm (militia).</i>

78
00:08:07,553 --> 00:08:12,730
<i>I wish I was the right age.
I'd have gone ages ago.</i>

79
00:08:12,825 --> 00:08:14,532
<i>I look forward to joining them.</i>

80
00:08:14,627 --> 00:08:18,200
<i>I can be useful
to the fatherland out there.</i>

81
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:34,287
People don't like me.

82
00:08:35,448 --> 00:08:40,488
<i>Citizens! Gather to protest
the shame of Versailles!</i>

83
00:08:40,586 --> 00:08:43,590
<i>Germany must give up its colonies!</i>

84
00:08:43,689 --> 00:08:47,466
<i>Germany alone
must accept guilt for the war!</i>

85
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:51,303
<i>Germany must pay billions in reparations!</i>

86
00:08:51,397 --> 00:08:54,344

<i>Horrible night.</i>

91
00:09:08,614 --> 00:09:13,256
<i>Cramps. Stomach pain.
I was moody and depressed.</i>

92
00:09:13,553 --> 00:09:18,093
<i>I never reveal my troubled thoughts
and my struggling soul.</i>

93
00:09:18,190 --> 00:09:22,696
<i>I'm pessimistic about politics,
very pessimistic.</i>

<i>I don't know
who I am studying for right now.</i>

97
00:09:36,175 --> 00:09:38,917
<i>I study because it is my duty.</i>

98
00:09:42,949 --> 00:09:46,624
<i>Today I started to regain my equilibrium.</i>

99
00:09:46,953 --> 00:09:49,866
<i>I was accepted into the Apollo fraternity.</i>

100
00:09:49,956 --> 00:09:54,371
<i>It has a very decent national attitude.
Father was also a member.</i>

101
00:09:54,994 --> 00:09:57,736
<i>At the gathering
I sat at the leaders' table.</i>

102
00:09:57,830 --> 00:10:00,208
<i>Conversations about
land reform, degeneracy,</i>

103
00:10:00,299 --> 00:10:02,370
<i>homosexuality, the Jewish question.</i>

104
00:10:02,935 --> 00:10:05,438
<i>I volunteered for special activities.</i>

105
00:10:05,538 --> 00:10:10,578
<i>I drank two mugs of beer
and thanked the chairman.</i>

106
00:10:11,410 --> 00:10:13,117
<i>He said, in a farsighted way,</i>

107
00:10:13,212 --> 00:10:16,716
<i>that it wouldn't be
the last time I'd speak.</i>

108

<i>7:00. Went to a fencing match.</i>
I <i>wasn't nervous.</i>

109
00:10:25,558 --> 00:10:28,937
<i>I fought quite well,
and technically, I fenced fine.</i>

110
00:10:32,498 --> 00:10:35,945
<i>It turned out
I had five cuts that were bleeding.</i>

111
00:10:36,702 --> 00:10:39,012
<i>I didn't even twitch.</i>

112
00:10:39,438 --> 00:10:41,418
<i>Now I'm happy-</i>

113
00:10:44,677 --> 00:10:48,284
<i>At 3:00 pm We Went for a useless drive
with the other students.</i>

114
00:10:48,381 --> 00:10:52,955
<i>We went to the Reich's Eagle Bar.
It was crawling with Jews.</i>

115
00:10:53,052 --> 00:10:55,498
<i>A dancer came up to us.</i>

116
00:10:56,055 --> 00:10:59,901
<i>She was quiet and simple,
not vain or snobbish.</i>

117
00:10:59,992 --> 00:11:02,472
<i>She's from Vienna, but Jewish.</i>

118
00:11:02,561 --> 00:11:06,008
<i>Still, there was nothing
Jewish in her behavior.</i>

119
00:11:06,098 --> 00:11:10,672
<i>I made some remarks about Jews,
not thinking she was one.</i>

120
00:11:10,770 --> 00:11:14,582
<i>She teased me a bit,
but in a delightful Way.</i>

121
00:11:14,674 --> 00:11:18,053
<i>In a word, that girl deserves respect.</i>

122
00:11:19,712 --> 00:11:23,387
<i>The girls were generally pretty.
Some were even beautiful.</i>

123
00:11:23,482 --> 00:11:25,052
<i>Slutty but stunning.</i>

124
00:11:25,151 --> 00:11:26,687
<i>The horrible thing
about Germany today is</i>

125
00:11:26,786 --> 00:11:29,699
<i>that women don't want
to be mothers anymore.</i>

126
00:11:33,859 --> 00:11:37,033
<i>February 22, 1922.</i>

127
00:11:37,630 --> 00:11:41,305
<i>At 9:00, Apollo voted. I wasn't elected.</i>

128
00:11:41,901 --> 00:11:43,539
<i>Bad feeling in the pit of my stomach.</i>

129
00:11:43,636 --> 00:11:46,480
<i>A terrible feeling of
dissatisfaction and disgust.</i>

130
00:11:46,572 --> 00:11:49,416
<i>People don't like me.</i>

131
00:11:49,875 --> 00:11:51,980
<i>Why? Because I talk too much.</i>

132
00:11:52,078 --> 00:11:55,287
<i>I'm such a chatter-box,
I can never shut my mouth.</i>

133
00:11:55,381 --> 00:11:57,088
<i>Thoughtless and immature.</i>

134
00:11:57,183 --> 00:12:00,596
<i>When will I get a grip on myself?</i>

135
00:12:03,055 --> 00:12:06,002
<i>Last night
I was very somber and depressed.</i>

136
00:12:06,092 --> 00:12:08,834
<i>I wanted to get up at 5:30
to fire a machine gun, but overslept.</i>

137
00:12:08,928 --> 00:12:10,965
<i>I didn't hear the alarm.</i>

138
00:12:11,063 --> 00:12:14,101
<i>I'm ashamed! Is that soldier-like?</i>

139
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:17,044
<i>I'm so weak-minded.</i>

140
00:12:17,136 --> 00:12:21,710
<i>You star?' to think,
“If only there was a war again,</i>

141
00:12:21,807 --> 00:12:26,347
<i>if only I could put my life
on the line, fight,</i>

142
00:12:26,445 --> 00:12:28,516
<i>it would be a pleasure.”</i>

143
00:12:32,618 --> 00:12:34,825
<i>I went to visit Hugo.</i>

144
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:38,925
<i>His little daughter Irmgard
jumps around naked before bed.</i>

145
00:12:39,024 --> 00:12:41,368
<i>I disapprove of a three-year-old
behaving like that.</i>

146
00:12:41,460 --> 00:12:44,669
<i>Children should be taught modesty.</i>

147
00:12:45,164 --> 00:12:50,944
<i>Hugo pinched me because I said
I never flirted, and called me a eunuch.</i>

148
00:12:52,638 --> 00:12:57,280
<i>The young, undisciplined generation
is a serious threat to Germany.</i>

149
00:12:57,376 --> 00:13:00,118
<i>Dear God, turn it back
to how it was before.</i>

150
00:13:03,849 --> 00:13:07,661
<i>Got books. They give me peace of mind.</i>

151
00:13:09,355 --> 00:13:13,064
<i>Read Rudolph Stratz's
The Light in the East.</i>

152
00:13:13,159 --> 00:13:17,471
<i>Everyone has the urge to grow,
but our space is limited.</i>

153
00:13:18,297 --> 00:13:22,803
<i>So, the fight to breed begins,
the fight for space.</i>

154
00:13:23,936 --> 00:13:26,712
<i>When there's another campaign in the east,
I will join it.</i>

155
00:13:26,806 --> 00:13:31,812
<i>The east is most important for us.
We must fight for it and settle it.</i>

156
00:13:36,282 --> 00:13:39,991
<i>Tacitus' Germania,
new translation by Dr. Ludwig Wilser.</i>

157
00:13:40,085 --> 00:13:46,127
<i>An admirable picture: how great,
how morally pure our ancestors were.</i>

158
00:13:46,225 --> 00:13:49,968
<i>We should be like that again,
at least some of us.</i>

159
00:13:50,963 --> 00:13:55,036

I had an inhuman amount of work today.</i>

00:15:53,953 --> 00:15:59,801
<i>I had to lead and restructure

<i>It is an act of selflessness

00:16:07,032 --> 00:16:11,742
<i>Yesterday I drove to Vilsbiburg.
The coachman picked me up.</i>

00:26:03,962 --> 00:26:07,603
<i>We are German mercenaries,
fighting for liberty,</i>

329
00:26:07,699 --> 00:26:10,703
<i>and should remain alone.</i>

330
00:26:11,102 --> 00:26:15,676
<i>Dear, dear child,
I don't write these words carelessly.</i>

331
00:26:15,774 --> 00:26:20,086
<i>I can predict the horrors of the future.</i>

332
00:26:21,913 --> 00:26:26,658
<i>My mercenary will never improve,
but he is loved the way he is,</i>

333
00:26:26,751 --> 00:26:29,391
<i>and your love, if it belongs to me,</i>

334
00:26:29,487 --> 00:26:32,161
<i>gives me the strength and courage
to suffer through everything.</i>

335
00:26:32,257 --> 00:26:34,601
<i>I shall proudly endure my destiny.</i>

336
00:26:34,693 --> 00:26:37,799
<i>I love you very much, Marga.</i>

337
00:26:46,504 --> 00:26:49,951
How marvelous our life will be.

338
00:26:58,216 --> 00:27:00,753
<i>My dear, pure, gracious wife,</i>

339
00:27:01,219 --> 00:27:04,564
<i>this morning I had a meeting
with a party member about the SS'</i>

340
00:27:04,656 --> 00:27:07,933
<i>and the financial opportunities.</i>

341
00:27:08,760 --> 00:27:11,570
<i>When the Jew gives you
the money for the clinic,</i>

342
00:27:11,663 --> 00:27:13,006
<i>please send it to me.</i>

343
00:27:13,098 --> 00:27:15,738
<i>I need it to expand the house.</i>

344
00:27:18,637 --> 00:27:21,777
<i>Hauschild hasn't paid me
for the clinic yet.</i>

345
00:27:21,873 --> 00:27:23,784
<i>A Jew remains a Jew.</i>

346
00:27:23,875 --> 00:27:27,618
<i>Sometimes I worry about
how crass those people are.</i>

347
00:27:27,712 --> 00:27:30,488
<i>ls everyone as bad as my pack of Jews?</i>

348
00:27:32,584 --> 00:27:35,292
<i>My charming, cute little wife,</i>

349
00:27:35,387 --> 00:27:37,890
<i>money is such a necessity.</i>

350
00:27:37,989 --> 00:27:40,162
<i>How nasty and cursed it is.</i>

351
00:27:40,258 --> 00:27:43,034
<i>Don't be annoyed by your Jew anymore.</i>

352
00:27:46,665 --> 00:27:49,339
<i>Letter no. 145.</i>

353
00:27:49,834 --> 00:27:53,179
<i>You good, sweet little wife.</i>

354
00:27:53,271 --> 00:27:57,151
<i>Dear darling, how lovely our home will be.</i>

355
00:27:57,442 --> 00:27:59,285
<i>How fine.</i>

356
00:27:59,377 --> 00:28:02,620
<i>The trees and shrubs have grown.</i>

357
00:28:02,714 --> 00:28:06,560
<i>I'll handle the details
with the painter and electrician tomorrow.</i>

358
00:28:06,651 --> 00:28:09,962
<i>I left you a note
with the windows' measurements.</i>

359
00:28:10,055 --> 00:28:15,164
<i>The kitchen I specified yellowish,
the stairs, blue-gray,</i>

360
00:28:15,260 --> 00:28:19,675
<i>the bedroom, fright green,
the maid's room, a lighter color,</i>

361
00:28:19,764 --> 00:28:22,574
<i>and the guest room, a lighter color too.</i>

362
00:28:23,234 --> 00:28:25,145
<i>How marvelous our life will be.</i>

363
00:28:25,236 --> 00:28:29,651
<i>Our pure, deep love of body and soul.</i>

364
00:28:29,741 --> 00:28:31,846
<i>Dearest wife, how I love you.</i>

365
00:28:31,943 --> 00:28:36,688
<i>All filth will be kept
out of our home, our castle.</i>

366
00:28:37,282 --> 00:28:39,091
<i>Your husband.</i>

367
00:28:44,622 --> 00:28:48,001
<i>As per the order of our Fuhrer
on January 6, 1929,</i>

368
00:28:48,093 --> 00:28:51,336
<i>I have taken over the leadership
of the SS of the NSDAP.</i>

369
00:28:51,429 --> 00:28:54,035
<i>When recruiting SS members</i>

370
00:28:54,132 --> 00:28:57,375
<i>I demand the following criteria:</i>

371
00:28:57,469 --> 00:28:59,608
<i>The minimum age will be 23,</i>

372
00:28:59,704 --> 00:29:02,378
<i>minimum height, 1.70m,</i>

373
00:29:02,474 --> 00:29:04,920
<i>one year of party membership,</i>

374
00:29:05,009 --> 00:29:09,151
<i>written testimony of two witnesses
willing to vouch for the man.</i>

375
00:29:09,247 --> 00:29:12,319
<i>He must also be a good and decent person.</i>

376
00:29:12,417 --> 00:29:16,593
<i>Out of 100 men,
we can take no more than 10 to 15.</i>

377
00:29:16,688 --> 00:29:20,966
<i>We demand a report
on the family's political affiliations.</i>

378
00:29:21,059 --> 00:29:23,665
<i>We require a family tree
going back to 7750.</i>

379
00:29:23,762 --> 00:29:26,800
<i>We will gather as many people as possible</i>

380
00:29:26,898 --> 00:29:31,540
<i>who have the desired bloodline
of the German nation,</i>

381
00:29:31,636 --> 00:29:34,207
<i>and discipline them as soldiers.</i>

382
00:29:34,305 --> 00:29:39,846
<i>Through the land of Germany we march</i>

383
00:29:39,944 --> 00:29:45,553
<i>We fight for Adolf Hitler</i>

384
00:29:45,650 --> 00:29:51,225
<i>The Red Front, beat them to a pulp</i>

385
00:29:51,322 --> 00:29:53,427
<i>The SA is on the march</i>

386
00:29:53,525 --> 00:29:57,473
<i>Beware
Clear the road</i>

387
00:30:02,333 --> 00:30:07,146
<i>So comrades, come rally</i>

388
00:30:07,238 --> 00:30:11,243
<i>And the last fight let us face</i>

389
00:30:11,342 --> 00:30:16,087
<i>The Internationale</i>

390

<i>Letter no. 152.</i>

392
00:30:22,353 --> 00:30:23,661
<i>Dear Marga,</i>

393
00:30:23,755 --> 00:30:24,961
<i>I went to my parents</i>

394
00:30:25,056 --> 00:30:29,300
<i>to explain the dire need
for street fighting to my father.</i>

395
00:30:29,394 --> 00:30:32,773
<i>Fighting and working
never caused me any harm.</i>

396
00:30:32,864 --> 00:30:36,835
<i>We strive for the revolution.
That's our goal.</i>

397
00:30:39,470 --> 00:30:42,679
<i>I read in the papers about
the street fights in Brunswick.</i>

398
00:30:43,241 --> 00:30:46,313
<i>Why do you want to pick up
the bloodthirsty knife?</i>

399
00:30:46,411 --> 00:30:50,951
<i>Dearly beloved, are you good and decent?</i>

400
00:30:52,317 --> 00:30:54,820
<i>There is one thing you cannot ask of me.</i>

401
00:30:54,919 --> 00:30:59,891
<i>I can? always be as good
as you want me to be.</i>

402
00:31:00,859 --> 00:31:07,071
<i>You should always remain honest.
You nasty man with the black soul.</i>

403
00:31:09,801 --> 00:31:12,873
<i>Gudrun Margaret
Elfriede Emma Anna</i>

404
00:31:12,971 --> 00:31:16,248
<i>was born on August 8, 1929,</i>

405
00:31:16,341 --> 00:31:20,118
<i>by cesarean section in a Munich hospital.</i>

406
00:31:20,211 --> 00:31:25,126
<i>She weighed 3,625 grams
and was 54 cm long.</i>

407
00:31:25,216 --> 00:31:29,255
<i>Blond, blue-eyed, with rosy little nails.</i>

408
00:31:33,091 --> 00:31:38,598
<i>Our good child sneezes just like
her daddy every day, twice in a row.</i>

409
00:31:39,631 --> 00:31:41,872
<i>January 12, 1930.</i>

410
00:31:41,966 --> 00:31:45,209
<i>She now raises her head
on her own and tries to laugh.</i>

411
00:31:45,303 --> 00:31:48,750
<i>She loves baths
and she splashes water everywhere.</i>

412
00:31:48,840 --> 00:31:51,116
<i>All in all, she's very lively.</i>

413
00:31:53,645 --> 00:31:58,025
<i>Before each even)',
the SS lines up in two rows by height'.</i>

414
00:31:59,817 --> 00:32:03,094
<i>SS evenings are followed
by obedience exercises</i>

415
00:32:03,187 --> 00:32:04,632
<i>for at least 45 minutes.</i>

416
00:32:04,722 --> 00:32:06,201
<i>They drill:</i>

417
00:32:06,291 --> 00:32:10,899
<i>standing at attention, turns,
counting, Salutations, et cetera.</i>

418
00:32:10,995 --> 00:32:12,872
<i>Singing is to be practiced as well.</i>

419
00:32:12,964 --> 00:32:16,502
<i>I expect all commands
to be obeyed at all times.</i>

420
00:32:21,606 --> 00:32:24,485
<i>Gudrun's birthday party.
August 8, 1930.</i>

421
00:32:25,076 --> 00:32:29,047
<i>Her grandparents came by bus at 2:30,
as did the Schonbohms.</i>

422
00:32:35,353 --> 00:32:41,065
<i>Gudrun's hand on her first birthday.
She didn't stop moving as I drew.</i>

423
00:32:44,495 --> 00:32:47,408
<i>April 13, 1931.</i>

424
00:32:47,498 --> 00:32:49,569
<i>She likes to visit the chickens.</i>

425
00:32:49,667 --> 00:32:52,773
<i>She's not afraid of them,
not even of the big turkey.</i>

426
00:32:52,870 --> 00:32:56,113
<i>She plays with the livestock
and feeds them happily.</i>

427
00:32:56,207 --> 00:32:59,245
<i>She has learned a lot lately.</i>

428
00:32:59,344 --> 00:33:02,018
<i>She understands most of what she is told.</i>

429
00:33:02,113 --> 00:33:06,357
<i>She likes to work and to help.</i>

430
00:33:06,451 --> 00:33:09,694
<i>She loves her daddy above all.</i>

431
00:33:09,787 --> 00:33:14,497
<i>She always asks, ”Where's Daddy?”
then sadly says, “Daddy is away.”</i>

432
00:33:14,592 --> 00:33:16,970
<i>June 2, 1932.</i>

433
00:33:17,862 --> 00:33:21,207
<i>Darling, your evil husband
can't write you often.</i>

434
00:33:21,299 --> 00:33:25,372
<i>The time until the elections will be terrible.
Don't get angry.</i>

435
00:33:25,470 --> 00:33:29,646
<i>Darling, we will fight for our love,
and everything will go well.</i>

436
00:33:29,741 --> 00:33:32,187
<i>Our paradise,
the one we built for ourselves,</i>

437
00:33:32,276 --> 00:33:34,483
<i>cannot be destroyed by anyone.</i>

438
00:33:48,393 --> 00:33:50,805
Must Uncle Hitler also die?

439
00:34:01,506 --> 00:34:03,918
<i>Chancellor Adolf Hitler.</i>

440
00:34:05,043 --> 00:34:07,717
<i>The leader of young Germany.</i>

441
00:34:09,947 --> 00:34:12,052
<i>Our nation,</i>

442
00:34:12,150 --> 00:34:14,221
<i>our fatherland,</i>

443
00:34:14,318 --> 00:34:16,423
<i>and our fuhrer!</i>

444
00:34:19,457 --> 00:34:22,961
<i>It was already 10:30 pm,
and Gudrun wasn't asleep yet.</i>

445
00:34:23,061 --> 00:34:27,567
<i>Suddenly she said,
“Must Uncle Hitler also die?”</i>

446
00:34:27,665 --> 00:34:31,909
<i>I calmed her and said,
“Uncle Hitler will live for a long time. ”</i>

447
00:34:32,003 --> 00:34:33,482
<i>Delighted, she called out,</i>

448
00:34:33,571 --> 00:34:38,020
<i>”100 years! Very long!
No, Mommy, I know. 200 years!”</i>

449
00:34:39,077 --> 00:34:41,990
<i>When I said, ”Of course,”
she was satisfied.</i>

450
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:45,220
<i>She lay down quietly and soon fell asleep.</i>

451
00:34:53,691 --> 00:34:56,501
<i>That is why
you are doing a good thing</i>

452
00:34:57,728 --> 00:35:03,474
<i>by putting the demons of the past
to the flames.</i>

453
00:35:04,168 --> 00:35:08,446
<i>It is a powerful, great, symbolic act.</i>

454
00:35:13,611 --> 00:35:17,923
<i>My dear son,
you finally gained ground in the fortress.</i>

455
00:35:18,015 --> 00:35:22,361
<i>You too shall receive our heartfelt
and sincere congratulations</i>

456
00:35:22,453 --> 00:35:24,763
<i>for the success and victory

<i>My dear son,</i>

460

<i>I take joy in congratulating you,</i>

<i>now that you
and all your ambitions have been fulfilled,</i>

462
00:35:41,706 --> 00:35:46,280
<i>and our Fuhrer
has won the longed-for victory.</i>

463
00:35:46,377 --> 00:35:50,450
<i>May he continually be granted luck
and God's blessing.</i>

464
00:35:50,548 --> 00:35:53,290
<i>And for you, my dear son,</i>

465
00:35:53,384 --> 00:35:55,057
<i>I wish from the bottom of my heart</i>

466
00:35:55,153 --> 00:36:00,933
<i>that with all the hassle

467
00:36:01,025 --> 00:36:03,767
<i>With tender and loving care,</i>

<i>Dear Heinrich,</i>

470
00:36:18,576 --> 00:36:20,578
<i>may we ask you to forward</i>

<i>our most intimate

<i>for his picture
with the gracious dedication,</i>

473
00:36:26,751 --> 00:36:30,062
<i>as we are not allowed
to thank him personally?</i>

474
00:36:31,189 --> 00:36:36,036
<i>How pleased we are with
every picture of you, my dear Heinrich,</i>

475
00:36:36,127 --> 00:36:41,076
<i>and for the reports on the radio

476
00:36:41,165 --> 00:36:45,238
<i>I cordially greet and kiss you with love.</i>

477

<i>Your mother, Heil Hitler.</i>

478
00:36:51,075 --> 00:36:53,817
<i>I know that there are some people
in Germany</i>

479
00:36:53,911 --> 00:36:57,188
<i>who get sick
when they see our black uniforms.</i>

480
00:36:59,684 --> 00:37:04,827
<i>We understand
and don't expect to be loved by many.</i>

481
00:37:05,756 --> 00:37:09,431
<i>All those who cherish Germany
will and should respect us.</i>

482
00:37:10,561 --> 00:37:12,734
<i>Only those
with the slightest pangs of conscience</i>

483
00:37:12,830 --> 00:37:17,040
<i>for acting against the nation
and the fuhrer need to fear us.</i>

484
00:37:17,501 --> 00:37:20,107
<i>Reichsfuhrer-SS H. Himmler.</i>

485
00:37:26,210 --> 00:37:28,451
THE JEWS ARE OUR MISFORTUNE

486
00:37:32,016 --> 00:37:34,121
DON'T BUY IN JEWISH SHOPS

487
00:37:34,218 --> 00:37:39,065
<i>It is a small international group
without any roots</i>

488
00:37:39,156 --> 00:37:40,863
<i>which sets nation against nation.</i>

489
00:37:40,958 --> 00:37:41,993
<i>Jews!</i>

490
00:37:42,093 --> 00:37:48,374
<i>They are the only group
that should be called international,</i>

491
00:37:48,466 --> 00:37:52,778
<i>because they do business everywhere.</i>

492
00:37:59,777 --> 00:38:02,087
<i>We don't have enough children.</i>

493
00:38:02,179 --> 00:38:06,821
<i>A good, racially pure nation
that is short of children</i>

494
00:38:06,917 --> 00:38:09,397
<i>is doomed to extinction.</i>

495
00:38:10,888 --> 00:38:13,767
<i>A nation that has many children</i>

496
00:38:13,858 --> 00:38:18,329
<i>has the benefit of world power
and world domination.</i>

497
00:38:19,697 --> 00:38:25,409
<i>For a good and healthy marriage,
a minimum of four children is required.</i>

498
00:38:26,704 --> 00:38:30,675
<i>h', due to unhappy circumstances,
a married couple fails to give birth to children,</i>

499
00:38:30,775 --> 00:38:32,686
<i>every SS leader</i>

500
00:38:32,777 --> 00:38:38,250
<i>should adopt
racially, hereditarily healthy children</i>

501
00:38:38,783 --> 00:38:42,196
<i>and raise them in the spirit
of national socialism.</i>

502
00:38:59,236 --> 00:39:01,910
<i>May 10, 1933.</i>

503
00:39:02,807 --> 00:39:06,812
<i>On Friday, our foster son
Gerhard von der Ahé came to live with us.</i>

504
00:39:06,911 --> 00:39:08,720
<i>He is a handsome, lively boy.</i>

505
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:11,317
<i>Puppi wanted to fondle and mother him,</i>

506
00:39:11,415 --> 00:39:15,295
<i>but he disliked it, so he hit her,
and the big fight started.</i>

507
00:39:15,386 --> 00:39:18,060
<i>Unfortunately, they quarrel often.</i>

508
00:39:19,590 --> 00:39:21,729
<i>The boy wants to have everything,</i>

509
00:39:21,826 --> 00:39:24,432
<i>and, although Puppi
gives him some of her toys,</i>

510
00:39:24,528 --> 00:39:27,304
<i>she is quite jealous.</i>

511
00:39:28,065 --> 00:39:31,205
<i>What I demand of you is order,</i>

512
00:39:31,969 --> 00:39:35,883
<i>order in big things,
and order in small things.</i>

513
00:39:35,973 --> 00:39:42,151
<i>Order creates the nation, the culture,
and order creates the state.</i>

514
00:39:42,246 --> 00:39:46,422
<i>The soldier whose uniform is disorderly
will no longer be obedient,</i>

515
00:39:46,517 --> 00:39:49,191
<i>like the soldiers of Bolshevism are not.</i>

516
00:39:49,286 --> 00:39:51,232
<i>We will teach all these things.</i>

517
00:39:51,322 --> 00:39:54,792
<i>Even decent eating,
we will teach the commanders.</i>

518
00:39:54,892 --> 00:39:59,568
<i>I also demand to persevere with education.</i>

519
00:39:59,663 --> 00:40:01,472
<i>No reward without effort.</i>

520
00:40:01,565 --> 00:40:05,980
<i>I expect human kindness.</i>

521
00:40:06,070 --> 00:40:07,879
<i>See yourself as helpers</i>

522
00:40:07,972 --> 00:40:10,316
<i>not as dictators.</i>

<i>Dear Heinrich,</i>

539
00:41:40,331 --> 00:41:42,834
<i>you must be thinking,
“It's my father again.”</i>

540
00:41:43,300 --> 00:41:45,576
<i>Dr. Weber, my successor,</i>

541
00:41:45,669 --> 00:41:49,708
<i>spoke to me on Saturday
about a personal matter.</i>

542
00:41:49,807 --> 00:41:52,185
<i>I know for sure that he and his family</i>

543
00:41:52,276 --> 00:41:55,416
<i>always had and still have
a nationalist worldview.</i>

544
00:41:55,513 --> 00:42:01,589
<i>Only his eldest son Franz,
a lawyer, strayed.</i>

545
00:42:01,685 --> 00:42:04,632
<i>His parents worked hard
so that he doesn't starve.</i>

546
00:42:04,722 --> 00:42:08,761
<i>He was probably misled by his wife,
to earn some money,</i>

547
00:42:08,859 --> 00:42:13,035
<i>and Went to defend Communists,
though he is not a Communist.</i>

548
00:42:13,130 --> 00:42:17,601
<i>His poor mother was shocked
when, early this Sunday,</i>

549
00:42:17,701 --> 00:42:20,910
<i>six people, and three more later,
showed up at her door</i>

550
00:42:21,005 --> 00:42:24,179
<i>to search the apartment
for weapons, documents, et cetera,</i>

551
00:42:24,275 --> 00:42:26,687
<i>and to interrogate the family.</i>

552
00:42:26,777 --> 00:42:30,520
<i>I'm asking you to do what you can.</i>

553
00:42:31,615 --> 00:42:32,958
<i>Dear Father,</i>

554
00:42:33,050 --> 00:42:36,588

<i>lam attaching a copy
of the response to Mr. Weber,</i>

556
00:42:40,024 --> 00:42:43,335
<i>so you can see how it was handled.</i>

557
00:42:43,894 --> 00:42:47,432
<i>Thank you very much.
You were merciful.</i>

558
00:42:49,433 --> 00:42:51,037
<i>Dear Heinrich,</i>

559
00:42:51,502 --> 00:42:55,609
<i>all these petitions are a burden

560
00:42:55,706 --> 00:42:57,686
<i>They depress me.</i>

561
00:42:58,375 --> 00:43:02,585
<i>Today at noon

<i>the senior teacher, Dr. Brunner,</i>

00:43:05,449 --> 00:43:09,397
<i>concerning the arrest of his son.</i>

564
00:43:09,486 --> 00:43:12,296
<i>Please help this respectable man.</i>

565
00:43:12,389 --> 00:43:16,963
<i>Father, the arrest of Brunner's son
was essential.</i>

566
00:43:19,630 --> 00:43:24,773
<i>Dear Heini, on his name day</i>

567
00:43:24,868 --> 00:43:29,010
<i>your good father
received lots of congratulations.</i>

568

DEATH NOTICE FOR GEBHARD HIMMLER

570
00:44:18,255 --> 00:44:23,728
H. is absolutely right.
Better to aggravate others than yourself.

571
00:44:40,110 --> 00:44:44,217
<i>Today we are having dinner with 25 guests.</i>

572
00:44:44,314 --> 00:44:48,990
<i>Everything is done poorly.
Heini is livid.</i>

573
00:44:49,086 --> 00:44:52,033
<i>The staff here is terrible.</i>

574
00:44:52,122 --> 00:44:56,229
<i>There are still people like that
in the Third Reich! God, those people!</i>

575
00:44:56,326 --> 00:44:59,796
<i>Heini is absolutely right.
Better to aggravate others than yourself.</i>

576
00:45:01,732 --> 00:45:04,076
<i>Heinrich had to leave early.</i>

577
00:45:04,168 --> 00:45:08,173
<i>He works day and night.
How does he manage?</i>

578
00:45:08,272 --> 00:45:11,685
<i>He is so tired and tense
from all the troubles.</i>

579
00:45:11,775 --> 00:45:16,019
<i>I always think he's not fully appreciated.</i>

580
00:45:18,115 --> 00:45:20,891
<i>All sexual matters</i>

581
00:45:20,984 --> 00:45:24,022
<i>are no longer private.</i>

582
00:45:24,121 --> 00:45:28,763
<i>They are a matter of life and death
for the nation.</i>

583
00:45:29,259 --> 00:45:31,569
<i>Here's a real life example.</i>

584
00:45:32,096 --> 00:45:36,476
<i>Department Head X is homosexual</i>

585
00:45:36,567 --> 00:45:40,140
<i>and is looking for an assistant
from the young clerks.</i>

586
00:45:40,237 --> 00:45:43,184
<i>He won't choose someone
based on his merits.</i>

587
00:45:43,273 --> 00:45:45,776
<i>He won't look for the best legal mind.</i>

588
00:45:45,876 --> 00:45:50,347
<i>He will select another homosexual.</i>

589
00:45:50,447 --> 00:45:54,122
<i>Those people can recognize their kind
across a room.</i>

590
00:45:54,218 --> 00:45:59,896
<i>Homosexuality undermines
the states achievements</i>

591
00:45:59,990 --> 00:46:03,528
<i>and destroys its foundations.</i>

592
00:46:04,762 --> 00:46:08,039
<i>Sadly, we don't have it
as easy as our ancestors.</i>

593
00:46:08,132 --> 00:46:12,308
<i>They only dealt with
a few cases of this perversion,</i>

594
00:46:12,402 --> 00:46:14,780
<i>and homosexuals
were drowned in the swamp.</i>

595
00:46:15,472 --> 00:46:18,316
<i>I've decided.</i>

596
00:46:18,709 --> 00:46:22,213
<i>They will be sent to a concentration camp
per my order,</i>

597
00:46:22,312 --> 00:46:25,657
<i>and shot on the spot
as if they attempted to escape.</i>

601
00:46:45,269 --> 00:46:47,749
<i>Puppi and Riischen
saw a deer for the first time</i>

602
00:46:47,838 --> 00:46:50,250
<i>and were so happy.</i>

603
00:46:50,340 --> 00:46:53,150
<i>Time passes quickly with the children.</i>

604
00:46:53,710 --> 00:46:57,385
<i>They switch from sweet to nasty,
from bickering to getting along.</i>

605
00:46:57,481 --> 00:47:00,485
<i>Lately, the boy has been well-behaved.</i>

MUSHROOMS, FISH, ROAST

608
00:47:15,399 --> 00:47:20,815
<i>We invited the Wedels, the Oswalds,
and Berta and her husband.</i>

609
00:47:21,638 --> 00:47:24,744
<i>We ate dinner
to the strains of Gypsy music.</i>

610
00:47:26,543 --> 00:47:29,649
<i>March 12, 1938.</i>

611
00:47:30,314 --> 00:47:32,555
<i>Heini went hunting today.</i>

612
00:47:36,453 --> 00:47:39,229
<i>We listened to the radio till 2:00 am.</i>

613
00:47:39,323 --> 00:47:41,963
<i>Heini was the first to enter Vienna.</i>

614
00:47:42,659 --> 00:47:44,866
<i>Now Austria is part of the German Reich.</i>

615
00:47:59,543 --> 00:48:03,355
<i>Heini called. He is doing well,
but he is overwhelmed.</i>

616
00:48:03,447 --> 00:48:07,589
<i>During the night Puppi got ill
and had a fever. I couldn't sleep.</i>

617
00:48:07,684 --> 00:48:11,257
<i>I sat by her bed
and told her it is already 2:30</i>

618
00:48:11,355 --> 00:48:13,665
<i>so she should try
to get some sleep.</i>

619
00:48:13,757 --> 00:48:17,569
<i>She said,
“At this time yesterday, Daddy went in!”</i>

620
00:48:17,661 --> 00:48:20,198
<i>She meant Vienna.</i>

621
00:48:20,297 --> 00:48:24,837
<i>Obviously the girl
is strongly connected to her father.</i>

622
00:48:34,144 --> 00:48:36,124
<i>As long as there are people on earth,</i>

623
00:48:36,213 --> 00:48:40,218
<i>humans and sub-humans will be at war.</i>

624
00:48:40,317 --> 00:48:45,198
<i>Biologically, the sub-human
seems to be the same kind of creature,</i>

625
00:48:45,289 --> 00:48:49,237
<i>with arms and legs,
some kind of a brain, eyes and mouth,</i>

626
00:48:49,326 --> 00:48:53,570
<i>but emotionally and spiritually
inferior to any animal.</i>

627
00:48:55,265 --> 00:48:58,303
<i>The sub-human hates the work of others.</i>

628
00:48:58,402 --> 00:49:01,781
<i>He rages against it secretly like a thief,</i>

629
00:49:01,872 --> 00:49:04,785
<i>and publicly
like a blasphemer and murderer.</i>

630
00:49:04,875 --> 00:49:07,947
<i>The sub-human's desires are eternal:</i>

631
00:49:08,045 --> 00:49:09,956
<i>That everything will turn to wasteland,</i>

632
00:49:10,047 --> 00:49:14,325
<i>and the light of knowledge will turn dark.</i>

633
00:49:17,821 --> 00:49:19,801
<i>Regarding the Jews,</i>

634
00:49:19,890 --> 00:49:24,339
<i>when will those scoundrels finally leave,
so we can enjoy life again?</i>

635
00:49:24,428 --> 00:49:28,467
JEWS ARE NOT WANTED IN THE

<i>I can assure you of one thing.</i>

<i>As long as I run the SS,</i>

641
00:50:12,743 --> 00:50:15,383
<i>during this war
there will be no draft dodgers</i>

642
00:50:15,479 --> 00:50:18,983
<i>or individuals
who even think of starting a revolution.</i>

643
00:50:19,082 --> 00:50:22,222
<i>A master race
must be able to eliminate individuals</i>

644
00:50:22,319 --> 00:50:25,493
<i>who are harmful to society.</i>

645
00:50:25,589 --> 00:50:27,660
<i>We must show no mercy.</i>

646
00:50:27,758 --> 00:50:31,900
<i>It doesn't matter if 7, 000
must be eliminated in one town.</i>

647
00:50:32,696 --> 00:50:34,334
<i>I will certainly do that.</i>

648
00:50:42,305 --> 00:50:46,378

<i>Puppi has a map of Germany

<i>Gerhard has a delinquent streak.</i>

00:51:39,963 --> 00:51:43,467
<i>Heini was so happy on his birthday.</i>

658
00:51:43,567 --> 00:51:47,344
<i>The Fuhrer promoted him
to the settlement commissioner of Germany.</i>

659
00:51:47,437 --> 00:51:51,112
<i>It feels so good
that he is finally being recognized.</i>

660
00:51:56,313 --> 00:52:00,261
<i>I was in Poznan, Lodz and Warsaw.</i>

661
00:52:00,617 --> 00:52:03,063
<i>Muhlenhavel and its surroundings
look terrible.</i>

662
00:52:03,153 --> 00:52:04,530
<i>All is falling apart.</i>

663
00:52:04,621 --> 00:52:08,501
<i>During the Polish era,
nothing was done.</i>

664
00:52:08,592 --> 00:52:10,572
<i>There is so much to do.</i>

665
00:52:11,161 --> 00:52:15,439
<i>These Jewish scoundrels, the Pollocks,
don't even look human.</i>

666
00:52:15,532 --> 00:52:18,706
<i>Pollocks don't die as easily
from diseases.</i>

667
00:52:18,802 --> 00:52:19,803
<i>They are immune.</i>

668
00:52:19,903 --> 00:52:23,942
<i>It is an enormous task
to establish order there.</i>

669
00:52:24,040 --> 00:52:26,077
<i>Heini has too much work.</i>

670
00:52:26,176 --> 00:52:30,818
<i>People will speak of this
a thousand years hence.</i>

671
00:52:36,753 --> 00:52:39,029
<i>State police regulations:</i>

672
00:52:40,290 --> 00:52:42,099
<i>You are hereby notified</i>

673
00:52:42,192 --> 00:52:45,139
<i>that within seven hours
you mus)' leave your apartment.</i>

674
00:52:45,228 --> 00:52:48,300
<i>Tie all your keys together</i>

675
00:52:48,398 --> 00:52:52,778
<i>and label them
with your name and address.</i>

676
00:52:52,869 --> 00:52:58,444
<i>You may take one suitcase,
no bigger than 100 x 80 x 80.</i>

677
00:52:58,542 --> 00:53:02,718
<i>You may not take
cash, securities, foreign currency,</i>

678
00:53:02,812 --> 00:53:05,554
<i>savings, books
and valuables of any kind,</i>

<i>gold, silver, platinum,</i>

680
00:53:07,184 --> 00:53:09,255
<i>and no livestock.</i>

681
00:53:09,352 --> 00:53:12,595
<i>You must follow all orders
without objection</i>

682
00:53:12,689 --> 00:53:15,670
<i>or be subject to severe penalties.</i>

683

GHETTO

684
00:53:45,021 --> 00:53:50,027
RESIDENTIAL AREA FOR JEWS
ENTRY PROHIBITED

685
00:53:57,067 --> 00:54:01,709
Today we visited
the SS concentration camp in Dachau.

686
00:54:01,805 --> 00:54:05,343
POETRY

687
00:54:09,446 --> 00:54:12,256
<i>Your parents' home
should be your home.</i>

688
00:54:12,349 --> 00:54:15,626
<i>Your mom.
Gmund, Tegernsee.</i>

689
00:54:18,521 --> 00:54:22,731
<i>You must always be decent,
brave and kind.</i>

690
00:54:22,826 --> 00:54:27,866
<i>Your father. Gmund, May 18, 1941.</i>

691
00:54:36,539 --> 00:54:40,112
<i>The Lindenfycht home in Gmund.
My parents' house.</i>

692
00:54:40,210 --> 00:54:44,989
<i>All of the SS men address me now
formally as “Miss Gudrun.”</i>

693
00:54:45,081 --> 00:54:47,118
<i>It sounds so strange.</i>

694
00:54:51,921 --> 00:54:55,596
<i>When peace returns,
We will probably get a farm in the east.</i>

695
00:54:55,692 --> 00:54:58,138
<i>That would bring in more money.</i>

696
00:54:58,228 --> 00:55:01,903
<i>Maybe we can even get
a house in Obersalzberg.</i>

697
00:55:01,998 --> 00:55:05,878
<i>The Lindenfycht home
will someday be mine.</i>

698
00:55:06,670 --> 00:55:09,708
<i>Yes, when peace comes,</i>

699
00:55:09,806 --> 00:55:12,787
<i>but that will take a long time,
a very long time,</i>

700
00:55:12,876 --> 00:55:14,753
<i>two to three years.</i>

701
00:55:22,786 --> 00:55:26,996
<i>Today we visited
the SS concentration camp in Dachau:</i>

702
00:55:27,090 --> 00:55:33,097
<i>Mommy, Aunt Lydia, Aunt Frieda,
Roschen, Inge Hammer! and me.</i>

703
00:55:39,536 --> 00:55:45,418
<i>We saw everything.
The vegetable patch, the mill, the bees.</i>

704
00:55:45,508 --> 00:55:50,753
<i>Then we saw the books,
from the 16th century until today.</i>

705
00:55:50,847 --> 00:55:55,159
<i>Then, the pictures that the prisoners painted.
They're beautiful.</i>

706
00:55:55,952 --> 00:55:57,954
<i>Then We ate, a lot.</i>

707
00:55:59,189 --> 00:56:01,226
<i>Then everyone got a gift.</i>

708
00:56:01,691 --> 00:56:03,693
<i>h' was so nice.</i>

709
00:56:04,427 --> 00:56:07,169
<i>A very large operation.</i>

710
00:56:15,372 --> 00:56:17,249
<i>Aunt Lydia and I are alone again.</i>

711
00:56:18,341 --> 00:56:21,550
<i>Daddy is in the east.
Mommy is in Paris.</i>

712
00:56:22,712 --> 00:56:26,387
<i>Yesterday I sat in the last row
in biology class.</i>

713
00:56:26,483 --> 00:56:28,429
<i>During a test,
I copied from a note I had.</i>

714
00:56:28,518 --> 00:56:31,522
<i>Mrs. Zimmer saw it but said nothing.</i>

715
00:56:32,255 --> 00:56:34,599
<i>I thought it was very decent other.</i>

716
00:56:36,292 --> 00:56:40,763
<i>June 15, 1941. My wonderful Mommy.</i>

717
00:56:40,864 --> 00:56:43,344
<i>Before I leave
I wanted to send you a note</i>

718
00:56:43,433 --> 00:56:45,538
<i>and some flowers.</i>

719
00:56:45,635 --> 00:56:49,014
<i>The next time I write,
it will be from Russia.</i>

720
00:56:49,105 --> 00:56:53,383
<i>Here are five chocolate bars
I promised for the children.</i>

721
00:56:53,476 --> 00:56:56,423
<i>Lots of love and kisses.
Yours, Daddy.</i>

722
00:57:11,428 --> 00:57:13,465
<i>My dearest love,</i>

723
00:57:13,563 --> 00:57:18,945
<i>Puppi is only 12 years old,
so she cannot even imagine the war.</i>

724
00:57:19,035 --> 00:57:20,946
<i>She mentions her birthday every day.</i>

725
00:57:21,438 --> 00:57:24,715
<i>With love and kisses.
Yours, Marga.</i>

726
00:57:33,950 --> 00:57:35,588
<i>My wonderful Mommy,</i>

727
00:57:35,685 --> 00:57:39,132
<i>the trip to the Baltic states
was very interesting.</i>

728
00:57:39,923 --> 00:57:44,872
<i>I also think it is good
that our Puppi doesn't fully grasp the war,</i>

729
00:57:44,961 --> 00:57:48,465
<i>but you should tell her about it.</i>

730
00:57:48,565 --> 00:57:50,101
<i>There are huge tasks ahead,</i>

731
00:57:50,200 --> 00:57:53,181
<i>and, as far as distance,
we are only at the beginning.</i>

732
00:57:53,269 --> 00:57:57,240
<i>I sent a package today for Puppi,
our sweetheart.</i>

733
00:57:58,708 --> 00:58:02,019
<i>Lots of love and kisses.
Yours, Daddy.</i>

734
00:58:02,712 --> 00:58:04,988
<i>My dear, beloved Daddy,</i>

735
00:58:05,548 --> 00:58:10,497
<i>I'm so sad you left again
to fight the war.</i>

736
00:58:11,087 --> 00:58:13,624
<i>I hope that you are well.</i>

737
00:58:13,723 --> 00:58:17,068
<i>It is terrible that we are at war
with the Russians.</i>

738
00:58:17,160 --> 00:58:19,265
<i>They were once our allies.</i>

739
00:58:19,362 --> 00:58:22,241
<i>Please be careful and be safe.</i>

740
00:58:22,332 --> 00:58:24,812
<i>You do not need to send us more chocolate.</i>

741
00:58:24,901 --> 00:58:27,507
<i>The postman brought so much.</i>

742
00:58:27,604 --> 00:58:29,311
<i>Thank you.</i>

743
00:58:31,875 --> 00:58:34,412
<i>How the Russians feel,
how the Czechs feel,</i>

744
00:58:34,511 --> 00:58:37,458
<i>does not concern me at all.</i>

745
00:58:37,547 --> 00:58:41,393
<i>Whether other nations
live in prosperity or die from hunger</i>

746
00:58:41,484 --> 00:58:47,162
<i>interests me only insofar
as we need them as slaves for our culture.</i>

747
00:58:48,424 --> 00:58:50,563
<i>If they dare harm one of us,</i>

748
00:58:50,660 --> 00:58:55,370
<i>they and all Polish men
in their village will die.</i>

749
00:58:56,065 --> 00:59:01,913
<i>We will never be cruel
when it is unnecessary.</i>

750
00:59:02,705 --> 00:59:04,912
<i>We Germans
are the only nation in the world</i>

751
00:59:05,008 --> 00:59:07,420
<i>with a decent attitude toward animals,</i>

752
00:59:07,510 --> 00:59:11,424
<i>and we will have a decent attitude
toward these human animals.</i>

753
00:59:13,550 --> 00:59:16,258
<i>Ten or 20
or 100 years from today,</i>

754
00:59:16,352 --> 00:59:19,128
<i>the current German border
will be left far behind.</i>

755
00:59:19,222 --> 00:59:25,434
<i>We will create pure Germanic areas,
just like our ancestors did.</i>

756
00:59:30,266 --> 00:59:34,908
<i>August 8, 1941. My birthday.</i>

757
00:59:35,004 --> 00:59:41,421
<i>We lit 13 candles and the Yule lamp.
Every SS man should have one.</i>

758
00:59:41,511 --> 00:59:45,220
<i>From Daddy I got pictures
of all the German emperors,</i>

759
00:59:45,315 --> 00:59:47,693
<i>stilts, turtles,</i>

760
00:59:47,784 --> 00:59:51,027
<i>a book of traditional costumes
and a basket of roses.</i>

761
00:59:51,554 --> 00:59:54,228
<i>Elke gave me a Shetland pony.</i>

762
00:59:54,324 --> 00:59:57,237
<i>Daddy won't let me keep it</i>

763
00:59:57,327 --> 01:00:01,332
<i>because Elke's parents
want to benefit from our friendship.</i>

764
01:00:01,431 --> 01:00:05,538
<i>Daddy says I 'll get a horse
when there is peace.</i>

765
01:00:14,143 --> 01:00:19,650
<i>Here I am in all my glory!
No tree has leaves like me!</i>

766
01:00:20,483 --> 01:00:23,157
<i>It is evening.</i>

767
01:00:23,987 --> 01:00:29,665
<i>The Jew walks through the forest
with his long beard, carrying a sack.</i>

768
01:00:30,693 --> 01:00:34,368
<i>He picks all the leaves,
puts them in his sack,</i>

769
01:00:34,464 --> 01:00:37,775
<i>and leaves the poor tree naked.</i>

770
01:00:56,819 --> 01:01:01,029
Despite all the work
lam doing fine and I sleep well.

771
01:01:03,526 --> 01:01:06,097
<i>Household expenditures:</i>

772
01:01:06,195 --> 01:01:08,607
<i>salaries, 90 marks,</i>

773
01:01:09,232 --> 01:01:11,473
<i>donations, five marks,</i>

775
01:01:16,406 --> 01:01:20,752
<i>flowers, 5.40 marks,
miscellaneous, 1.40 marks.</i>

776
01:01:22,245 --> 01:01:23,747
<i>My dear Mommy,</i>

777
01:01:23,846 --> 01:01:28,090
<i>I am so sorry that I forgot
our wedding anniversary for the first time,</i>

778
01:01:28,184 --> 01:01:30,562
<i>but I was so busy these past few days.</i>

779
01:01:31,554 --> 01:01:34,763
<i>I wake up at 9:00, and at 10:00
I get dressed, eat breakfast</i>

780
01:01:34,857 --> 01:01:39,135
<i>and shave while Dr. Brandt
reads the morning mail to me.</i>

781
01:01:41,397 --> 01:01:46,574
<i>8:30-9:30, wake up, tidy up,
stroll through the garden,</i>

782
01:01:46,669 --> 01:01:48,307
<i>discuss all the work
that must get done.</i>

783
01:01:48,404 --> 01:01:50,077
<i>Crafts.</i>

784
01:01:50,373 --> 01:01:54,014
<i>Then working and governing
by phone, radio and telegraph.</i>

785
01:01:54,110 --> 01:02:00,425
<i>In the afternoon, Puppi and I
read the books you sent us.</i>

786
01:02:00,516 --> 01:02:03,588
<i>Every other day at 1 :00 pm,
I drive to the Fuhrer,</i>

787
01:02:03,686 --> 01:02:05,791
<i>arriving at 2:00, and eat.</i>

788
01:02:05,888 --> 01:02:09,836
<i>4:00-5:00pm, work on train on the way home.</i>

789
01:02:12,929 --> 01:02:15,432
<i>Saturday to Tuesday
I visited the training sites</i>

790
01:02:15,531 --> 01:02:17,875
<i>and saw very interesting
new shooting procedures.</i>

791
01:02:18,935 --> 01:02:22,348
<i>In between,
trips of three or more days</i>

792
01:02:22,438 --> 01:02:26,944
<i>to Lublin, Lemberg,
Dubno, Rowno, Luzk.</i>

793
01:03:39,215 --> 01:03:40,888
<i>My dear Mommy,</i>

794
01:03:40,983 --> 01:03:43,088
<i>enclosed please find
a very interesting report</i>

795
01:03:43,186 --> 01:03:46,292
<i>in which our Gerhard plays a role.</i>

796
01:03:46,722 --> 01:03:50,795
<i>He probably can? help it,
but his willingness to lie is typical.</i>

797
01:03:51,460 --> 01:03:55,636
<i>When I write to Gerhard,
should I still sign, “Mother”?</i>

798
01:03:55,731 --> 01:03:59,144
<i>For now I wouldn't sign with "Mother?</i>

799
01:04:00,403 --> 01:04:03,873
<i>If his behavior improves you may again.</i>

800
01:04:03,973 --> 01:04:07,614
<i>He'll be going to Kovno, Riga and Minsk.</i>

801
01:04:08,311 --> 01:04:12,157
<i>Despite all the work,
lam doing fine and I sleep Well.</i>

802
01:04:12,682 --> 01:04:14,628
<i>Lots of kisses.</i>

803
01:04:14,717 --> 01:04:17,027
<i>With love. Yours, Heini.</i>

804
01:04:37,807 --> 01:04:40,720
<i>Thank you for your lovely letter.</i>

805
01:04:40,810 --> 01:04:44,622
<i>Look, in this picture
you're making a funny face.</i>

806
01:04:44,714 --> 01:04:47,490
<i>You look so, so sweet in h'.</i>

807
01:04:47,583 --> 01:04:52,259
<i>When I look at the picture,
you look straight back at me.</i>

808
01:04:52,355 --> 01:04:55,928
<i>Daddy, come back to us soon.</i>

809
01:04:58,728 --> 01:05:02,369
<i>Letter no. 99a
to the Reichsfuhrer-SS.</i>

810
01:05:02,465 --> 01:05:07,539
<i>I send the following interim report
regarding General von den Bach.</i>

811
01:05:08,738 --> 01:05:10,979
<i>He suffers from hallucinations</i>

812
01:05:11,073 --> 01:05:14,418
<i>related to the shooting
of Jews he conducted</i>

813
01:05:14,510 --> 01:05:17,116
<i>and other harsh experiences in the east.</i>

814
01:05:17,813 --> 01:05:22,319
<i>The severe exhaustion,
and the nerves in particular,</i>

815
01:05:22,418 --> 01:05:26,366
<i>seen in this patient, coming from
the Eastern Front is apparent.</i>

816
01:05:26,455 --> 01:05:30,562
<i>His bowels had to be emptied manually,</i>

817
01:05:30,660 --> 01:05:35,439
<i>as is common when the intestine
has been immobilized with opium.</i>

818
01:05:36,732 --> 01:05:37,733
<i>My dear Mommy,</i>

819
01:05:37,833 --> 01:05:41,645
<i>I had a bad stomachache,
but I'm feeling well again.</i>

820
01:05:41,737 --> 01:05:44,479
<i>These intestinal issues are so disgusting.</i>

821
01:05:44,573 --> 01:05:47,986
<i>Dozens of people on the front
also suffer from it.</i>

822
01:05:48,811 --> 01:05:49,881
<i>Yours, Heini.</i>

823
01:05:58,087 --> 01:06:00,397
<i>Orders to all commanders:</i>

824
01:06:00,856 --> 01:06:05,066
<i>The sacred duty of commanders
is to personally ensure</i>

825
01:06:05,161 --> 01:06:09,075
<i>that none of our men
charged with this grave duty</i>

826
01:06:09,165 --> 01:06:13,307
<i>ever suffers from it,
mentally or emotionally.</i>

827
01:06:14,003 --> 01:06:15,414
<i>This is to be achieved</i>

828
01:06:15,504 --> 01:06:18,610
<i>with the strictest discipline
when performing official duties</i>

829
01:06:18,708 --> 01:06:23,487
<i>and through friendly gatherings
in the evenings.</i>

830
01:06:23,579 --> 01:06:26,355
<i>The nights should be devoted
to German customs,</i>

831
01:06:26,449 --> 01:06:32,229
<i>with the men gathered around tables to eat,
enjoying music, lectures</i>

832
01:06:32,321 --> 01:06:35,325
<i>and the beautiful world
of the German intellect,</i>

833
01:06:35,424 --> 01:06:37,631
<i>to fill their leisure time with joy.</i>

834
01:06:43,332 --> 01:06:45,073
<i>Secret Affairs of the Reich.</i>

835
01:06:45,167 --> 01:06:47,169
<i>To the Reichsfuhrer-SS.</i>

836
01:06:47,269 --> 01:06:50,716
<i>The inspection of the cars
in Group C and D is completed.</i>

837
01:06:50,806 --> 01:06:53,753
<i>Killing with gas was not done correctly.</i>

838
01:06:53,843 --> 01:06:55,823
<i>To complete the action faster,</i>

839
01:06:55,911 --> 01:06:58,084
<i>they push down on the accelerator.</i>

840
01:06:58,180 --> 01:07:01,718
<i>This way,
the prisoners die of asphyxiation,</i>

841
01:07:01,817 --> 01:07:05,162
<i>rather than being slowly put to sleep.</i>

842
01:07:05,254 --> 01:07:06,790
<i>It is now proved</i>

843
01:07:06,889 --> 01:07:10,268
<i>that, when done this way,
death occurs faster,</i>

844
01:07:10,359 --> 01:07:12,771
<i>and the prisoners fall asleep peacefully.</i>

845
01:07:12,862 --> 01:07:17,868
<i>The distorted faces and excretions
are no longer evident.</i>

846
01:07:18,834 --> 01:07:21,872
<i>I'd like to draw your attention
to the following.</i>

847
01:07:21,971 --> 01:07:26,784
<i>The cars are now recognized
and referred to as “death cars.”</i>

848
01:07:36,385 --> 01:07:40,356
<i>It is a horrible slight
for a German to watch.</i>

849
01:07:40,456 --> 01:07:44,199
<i>That's how it is,
and, if it were not so terrible for us,</i>

850
01:07:44,293 --> 01:07:47,900
<i>we would not be Germans,
or even Germanic.</i>

851
01:07:47,997 --> 01:07:50,170
<i>If we lack the nerve now,</i>

852
01:07:50,266 --> 01:07:52,837
<i>our bad nerves
will be passed on to our sons</i>

853
01:07:52,935 --> 01:07:55,245
<i>and our grandsons.</i>

854
01:08:08,451 --> 01:08:12,456
If only they knew how bitter life is.

855
01:08:13,422 --> 01:08:15,231
<i>Dear Sister,</i>

856
01:08:15,324 --> 01:08:20,865
<i>unfortunately, the exceptional circumstances
caused by this war</i>

857
01:08:20,963 --> 01:08:24,376
<i>make it impossible to discuss
the content of this letter in person.</i>

858
01:08:24,967 --> 01:08:27,174
<i>Christmas 1938.</i>

859
01:08:27,269 --> 01:08:30,409
<i>Heinrich and I had a talk</i>

860
01:08:30,506 --> 01:08:33,953
<i>in which we confessed
that we love each other deeply.</i>

861
01:08:34,043 --> 01:08:37,718
<i>ll ls very unlikely that he will divorce.</i>

862
01:08:37,813 --> 01:08:39,759
<i>His daughter is only 13 years old.</i>

863
01:08:40,382 --> 01:08:44,057
<i>His wife can't give him more children.</i>

864
01:08:44,153 --> 01:08:45,928
<i>She is already 48.</i>

865
01:08:46,322 --> 01:08:48,734
<i>The only ones who know our secret
are the Fuhrer,</i>

866
01:08:48,824 --> 01:08:51,270
<i>Martin Bormann and Karl Wolff.</i>

867
01:08:52,228 --> 01:08:54,299
<i>Your sister, Hedwig.</i>

868
01:08:58,267 --> 01:09:00,008
<i>My beloved bunny,</i>

869
01:09:00,302 --> 01:09:04,751
<i>you gave me your dear beloved heart
and your entire self.</i>

870
01:09:04,840 --> 01:09:06,410
<i>I have just one wish.</i>

871
01:09:06,509 --> 01:09:08,352
<i>Despite the obstacles,</i>

872
01:09:08,444 --> 01:09:11,516
<i>may you be as happy as you made me
and make me every day.</i>

873
01:09:11,614 --> 01:09:15,061
<i>I kiss your dear, fine hands
and your sweet mouth.</i>

874
01:09:15,151 --> 01:09:16,789
<i>Yours, H.</i>

875
01:09:20,156 --> 01:09:21,533
<i>My dear, good husband,</i>

876
01:09:21,624 --> 01:09:24,195
<i>I attach Puppi's Christmas wish list.</i>

877
01:09:24,293 --> 01:09:28,366
<i>You can check off what you plan to buy her
and send it back to me.</i>

878
01:09:28,964 --> 01:09:32,434
<i>Now the Christmas gifts
for the SS are being bought.</i>

879
01:09:32,535 --> 01:09:34,947
<i>10,000 bars of chocolate.</i>

880
01:09:35,905 --> 01:09:39,318
<i>Do you know what I want
from you this Christmas?</i>

881
01:09:39,408 --> 01:09:41,217
<i>Yours, Marga.</i>

882
01:09:44,680 --> 01:09:48,321
<i>This year We will celebrate
our first Christmas without Daddy.</i>

883
01:09:48,884 --> 01:09:50,886
<i>Gerhard is coming too.</i>

884
01:09:50,986 --> 01:09:52,932
<i>Daddy called us.</i>

885
01:09:53,022 --> 01:09:57,266
<i>Previously, when I asked Daddy
for my Christmas present,</i>

886
01:09:57,359 --> 01:10:01,569
<i>he said he got me a block of wood
so that I wouldn't be cold.</i>

887
01:10:02,064 --> 01:10:04,635
<i>Will the war be over by next Christmas?</i>

888
01:10:04,733 --> 01:10:06,679
<i>God, keep our daddy safe.</i>

889
01:10:08,370 --> 01:10:10,043
<i>My dear,</i>

890
01:10:10,139 --> 01:10:15,054
<i>I received a package from E. Lorenz.</i>

891
01:10:15,144 --> 01:10:17,124
<i>It was a giant bird.</i>

892
01:10:17,213 --> 01:10:19,625
<i>At first I was shocked by the sight of it,</i>

893
01:10:19,715 --> 01:10:22,423
<i>because I saw myself eating it
for the next eight days.</i>

894
01:10:22,518 --> 01:10:26,625
<i>When I went to thank Erika for the gift,</i>

895
01:10:26,722 --> 01:10:29,225
<i>she told me that it was from you.</i>

896
01:10:29,325 --> 01:10:30,770
<i>Yours, H.</i>

897
01:10:33,195 --> 01:10:36,369
<i>Midnight, and again I cannot sleep.</i>

898
01:10:36,465 --> 01:10:38,843
<i>Thoughts, thoughts.</i>

899
01:10:38,934 --> 01:10:40,675
<i>Mops Wedel died in battle.</i>

900
01:10:40,769 --> 01:10:44,182
<i>Eighteen years old, SS.
His poor mother.</i>

901
01:10:44,273 --> 01:10:47,948
<i>I have not heard anything from Heini
in the last two days.</i>

902
01:10:48,043 --> 01:10:50,683
<i>Mrs. Berkelmann wrote me today.
She's getting a divorce.</i>

903
01:10:50,779 --> 01:10:53,623
<i>Her husband is having a child
with another woman.</i>

904
01:10:54,416 --> 01:10:57,420
<i>Every young girl longs for a husband.</i>

905
01:10:57,519 --> 01:11:00,830
<i>If only they knew how bitter life is.</i>

906
01:11:07,796 --> 01:11:11,437
<i>Well, Sister, the important thing
is that since late June</i>

907
01:11:11,533 --> 01:11:14,514
<i>I'm sure that our wish is fulfilled.</i>

908
01:11:14,603 --> 01:11:17,982
<i>Our child is growing inside me.</i>

909
01:11:18,073 --> 01:11:21,316
<i>How satisfying it feels when it moves.</i>

910
01:11:21,410 --> 01:11:26,883
<i>I love imaging myself holding it in my arms,
and how I will care for it.</i>

911
01:11:26,982 --> 01:11:29,053
<i>I can't even describe it to you.</i>

912
01:11:29,551 --> 01:11:31,997
<i>The way he takes care of me
is so touching.</i>

913
01:11:32,087 --> 01:11:35,000
<i>Sometimes ifs too much,
not even pleasant.</i>

914
01:11:35,324 --> 01:11:37,395
<i>Your sister, Hedwig.</i>

MOTHER: HEDWIG POTTHAST
FATHER: UNKNOWN

917
01:11:49,805 --> 01:11:51,113
<i>My dear bunny,</i>

918
01:11:51,206 --> 01:11:54,949
<i>soon I will call you
so I can hear your sweet voice.</i>

919
01:11:55,044 --> 01:11:59,254
<i>The package does not contain any valuables,
but everything in it was carefully chosen.</i>

920
01:11:59,348 --> 01:12:03,558
<i>I hope our child
will not hurt itself with the rattle.</i>

921
01:12:04,119 --> 01:12:07,032
<i>I love you endlessly.
Yours, H.</i>

922
01:12:09,825 --> 01:12:14,535
<i>Heini was nearby for two days
and didn't even call.</i>

923
01:12:14,630 --> 01:12:18,043
<i>I will suffer and endure everything
for my child.</i>

924
01:12:18,133 --> 01:12:21,945
<i>She is only 13
and should not know how serious life is.</i>

925
01:12:22,037 --> 01:12:24,574
<i>She hears enough things
she doesn't need to know.</i>

926
01:12:24,673 --> 01:12:27,483
<i>Can you still trust and believe a person?</i>

927
01:12:27,576 --> 01:12:29,522
<i>Time will tell.</i>

<i>Letter no. 122a.</i>

930
01:12:37,386 --> 01:12:38,831
<i>Dear Mr. Reichsfuhrer,</i>

931
01:12:38,921 --> 01:12:44,371
<i>it is my obligation to report to you
on the progress of my research.</i>

932
01:12:45,427 --> 01:12:46,633
<i>The method I created</i>

933
01:12:46,729 --> 01:12:50,802
<i>to sterilize the female body
without surgery</i>

934
01:12:50,899 --> 01:12:53,072
<i>is just about done.</i>

935
01:12:53,168 --> 01:12:56,012
<i>This method will enable us
to sterilize hundreds,</i>

936
01:12:56,105 --> 01:12:59,086
<i>if not thousands, of Jews per day.</i>

937
01:12:59,174 --> 01:13:01,780
<i>Out of the 10 million Jews
living in Europe,</i>

938
01:13:01,877 --> 01:13:06,917
<i>two to three million should be sterilized,
and kept alive for labor.</i>

939
01:13:07,750 --> 01:13:09,286
<i>Secret Affairs.</i>

940
01:13:09,385 --> 01:13:10,762
<i>Honorable Herr Professor,</i>

941
01:13:10,853 --> 01:13:13,231
<i>the Jewish females are to know nothing.</i>

942
01:13:13,322 --> 01:13:15,563
<i>As part of a general examination,</i>

943
01:13:15,657 --> 01:13:18,365
<i>you could administer
the appropriate syringes.</i>

944
01:13:18,460 --> 01:13:20,963
<i>About the effectiveness of the sterilization,</i>

945
01:13:21,063 --> 01:13:25,239
<i>in-depth tests are to be performed</i>

946
01:13:25,334 --> 01:13:30,147
<i>in which a female Jew
is locked in with a male Jew.</i>

947
01:13:30,239 --> 01:13:32,651
<i>We can then observe the outcome.</i>

948
01:13:32,741 --> 01:13:33,879
<i>Heil Hitler.</i>

949
01:13:37,146 --> 01:13:38,989
<i>Dear Sister,</i>

950
01:13:39,081 --> 01:13:41,527
<i>I wanted to find a new job</i>

951
01:13:41,617 --> 01:13:44,564
<i>and try to achieve a certain independence.</i>

952
01:13:45,554 --> 01:13:49,468
<i>King Heinrich commented on my plan</i>

953
01:13:49,558 --> 01:13:53,370
<i>that the very thought of me
earning my own bread</i>

954
01:13:53,462 --> 01:13:55,169
<i>was intolerable to him.</i>

955
01:13:55,264 --> 01:13:58,643
<i>Once the war is over,
he wants to buy us a country home</i>

956
01:13:58,734 --> 01:14:01,408
<i>that will always be a warm refuge for us.</i>

957
01:14:01,503 --> 01:14:07,010
<i>He thought of installing a small nursery
or breeding small animals</i>

958
01:14:07,109 --> 01:14:09,111
<i>to make it profitable.</i>

959
01:14:09,845 --> 01:14:11,882
<i>Your sister, Hedwig.</i>

960
01:14:22,724 --> 01:14:26,763
Our good little daughter
should get the gold bracelet.

961
01:14:30,899 --> 01:14:34,244
<i>On the evening of May 20
we were sitting on the terrace,</i>

962
01:14:34,336 --> 01:14:38,045
<i>playing cards and listening to the news.</i>

963
01:14:38,140 --> 01:14:40,211
<i>Someone honked loudly.</i>

964
01:14:40,309 --> 01:14:43,290
<i>”Who has the nerve to do that?”
we wondered.</i>

965
01:14:43,378 --> 01:14:45,585
<i>It was Daddy.</i>

966
01:14:47,649 --> 01:14:51,620
<i>We spent three nights together.
Puppi was ecstatic.</i>

967
01:14:52,488 --> 01:14:56,527
<i>Daddy brought us plenty of fruit,
vegetables, and 150 tulips.</i>

968
01:14:56,625 --> 01:14:59,799
<i>They were striped and jagged,
in two colors.</i>

969
01:15:00,395 --> 01:15:03,467
<i>Mommy showed Daddy the whole garden.</i>

970
01:15:03,565 --> 01:15:06,444
<i>I hadn't seen Daddy
in civilian clothes for so long.</i>

971
01:15:06,535 --> 01:15:08,515
<i>h' was beautiful.</i>

972
01:15:09,037 --> 01:15:11,574
<i>Daddy left this morning.</i>

973
01:15:15,277 --> 01:15:17,553
<i>Headquarters, July 1942.</i>

974
01:15:18,313 --> 01:15:20,987
<i>I order the deportation
of the entire Jewish population</i>

975

<i>of the General Government.</i>

976
01:15:23,952 --> 01:15:26,762
<i>As of December 31, 1942,</i>

977
01:15:26,855 --> 01:15:31,804
<i>no one of Jewish origin
is allowed in the General Government.</i>

978
01:15:31,894 --> 01:15:35,239
<i>These measures are necessary
for the reorganization of Europe</i>

979
01:15:35,330 --> 01:15:38,777
<i>by its people's ethnic distinctions,</i>

980
01:15:38,867 --> 01:15:42,576
<i>in the interest of safety
and cleanliness in the German Reich</i>

981
01:15:42,671 --> 01:15:45,015

<i>Requests from other departments

983
01:15:48,844 --> 01:15:51,347
<i>must be submitted to me personally.</i>

<i>Heil Hitler.

985

<i>Obviously, this wealth
was transferred to the Reich,</i>

987
01:16:33,855 --> 01:16:35,232
<i>not to ourselves.</i>

988
01:16:35,324 --> 01:16:39,295
<i>We have a moral right,
an obligation to our people,</i>

989
01:16:39,394 --> 01:16:43,274
<i>to take the people who want to kill us
and kill them,</i>

990
01:16:43,799 --> 01:16:47,372
<i>but We have no right
to enrich ourselves with a single fur,</i>

991
01:16:47,469 --> 01:16:53,215
<i>a watch, a single mark,
a cigarette, or anything else.</i>

992
01:17:03,051 --> 01:17:04,962
<i>August 10, 1942.</i>

993
01:17:05,053 --> 01:17:08,728
<i>My dear Mommy, with the package
you will receive a short note.</i>

994
01:17:08,824 --> 01:17:12,067
<i>The belt is for you.
The basket is for you.</i>

995
01:17:12,160 --> 01:17:16,074
<i>You may like the silver tray,
the bowl, and the silk cloth</i>

996
01:17:16,164 --> 01:17:19,543
<i>in black, blue and white,
and the blue handbag.</i>

997
01:17:19,635 --> 01:17:24,641
<i>Our good little daughter should get
the gold bracelet and the sports dress.</i>

998
01:17:24,740 --> 01:17:29,189
<i>A fur coat is on its way,
as is a cabinet and blue wool fabric.</i>

999
01:17:29,277 --> 01:17:31,985
<i>With love. Yours, Heini.</i>

1000
01:17:47,229 --> 01:17:52,611
Over the next few days I'll be in Lublin,
Zamosch, Auschwitz, Lemberg.

1001
01:18:00,609 --> 01:18:04,716
<i>We were at the gates of Stalingrad,
and now we are behind Kiev.</i>

1002
01:18:04,813 --> 01:18:06,793
<i>What a difference.</i>

1003
01:18:06,882 --> 01:18:10,227
<i>There is a shortage of Weapons
and ammunition everywhere.</i>

1004
01:18:10,318 --> 01:18:12,320
<i>The air force is still terrible.</i>

1005
01:18:12,854 --> 01:18:16,802
<i>Goring cares about nothing.
That flashy guy.</i>

1006
01:18:16,892 --> 01:18:21,136
<i>Goebbels is doing a great deal,
but he is so condescending.</i>

1007
01:18:23,832 --> 01:18:27,541
<i>Soon I will be 50 years old.
I've experienced so much trouble.</i>

1008
01:18:27,636 --> 01:18:30,640
<i>The war has entered a serious stage.</i>

1009
01:18:31,373 --> 01:18:36,254
<i>Stalingrad was the warning sign.
What else is going to happen?</i>

1010
01:18:37,312 --> 01:18:39,292
<i>I believe in the fuhrer.</i>

1011
01:18:39,381 --> 01:18:42,021
<i>Our people are not supposed to die.</i>

1012
01:18:42,117 --> 01:18:45,690
<i>They won't,
even if the internal situation seems harsh.</i>

1013
01:18:46,822 --> 01:18:51,635
<i>We have no allies in Europe.
We are entirely on our own.</i>

1014
01:18:51,727 --> 01:18:55,334
<i>Just imagine what will happen if we lose.</i>

1015
01:18:55,430 --> 01:18:58,309
<i>Some high ranking officers
have already been killed.</i>

1016
01:18:58,400 --> 01:19:01,244
<i>If Daddy -
No, don't even imagine that.</i>

1017
01:19:12,447 --> 01:19:15,291
<i>My dear Mommy, a few quick lines.</i>

1018
01:19:15,383 --> 01:19:18,921
<i>Enclosed are two packages
and a piece of fruitcake.</i>

1019
01:19:19,020 --> 01:19:21,694
<i>Over the next few days
I will be in Lublin, Zamosch,</i>

1020
01:19:21,790 --> 01:19:23,895
<i>Auschwitz and Lemberg.</i>

1021
01:19:24,426 --> 01:19:27,873
<i>I wonder if I will be able to call.</i>

1022
01:19:27,963 --> 01:19:31,467
<i>I'll be around 2,000 km from Gmund.</i>

1023
01:19:31,566 --> 01:19:35,810
<i>All my love. Have good days
in Gmund with our dear daughter.</i>

1024
01:19:36,671 --> 01:19:39,743
<i>Many warm greetings and kisses.
Yours, Daddy.</i>

1025
01:19:45,714 --> 01:19:47,955
<i>Dear party member Himmler,</i>

1026
01:19:48,049 --> 01:19:51,030
<i>in the wake of my visit
to the Auschwitz camp,</i>

1027
01:19:51,119 --> 01:19:54,498
<i>I am willing to allocate the following
on a one-time basis only:</i>

1028
01:19:54,589 --> 01:19:57,263
<i>1,000 tons of structural steel,</i>

1029
01:19:57,359 --> 01:20:00,897
<i>about 100 tons of water pipe.</i>

1030
01:20:00,996 --> 01:20:04,967
<i>This steel is for the expansion
of the concentration camps only,</i>

1031
01:20:05,066 --> 01:20:07,706
<i>Auschwitz in particular.</i>

1032
01:20:07,803 --> 01:20:10,647
<i>Heil Hitler!
Yours, Speer.</i>

1033
01:20:12,073 --> 01:20:16,283
<i>Dear party comrade Speer,
thank you very much for your letter</i>

1034
01:20:16,378 --> 01:20:19,086
<i>and for the allocation
of additional amounts of steel,</i>

1035
01:20:19,181 --> 01:20:22,253
<i>particularly for the expansion
of the Auschwitz camp.</i>

1036
01:20:22,350 --> 01:20:24,523
<i>Your words have strengthened
my conviction</i>

1037
01:20:24,619 --> 01:20:26,758
<i>that there is still justice in the world.</i>

1038
01:20:26,855 --> 01:20:30,029
<i>Heil Hitler!
Yours, H. Himmler.</i>

1039
01:20:44,039 --> 01:20:47,680
<i>My dear husband,
there were air raids.</i>

1040
01:20:47,776 --> 01:20:49,255
<i>Thank you.</i>

1041
01:20:49,945 --> 01:20:53,188
<i>Please order at least
four food coupons for us.</i>

1042
01:20:53,281 --> 01:20:55,488
<i>We are entitled to them.</i>

1043
01:20:55,584 --> 01:20:58,258
<i>We have alarms almost every day,</i>

1044
01:20:58,353 --> 01:21:00,663
<i>once every four hours.</i>

1045
01:21:02,657 --> 01:21:05,331
<i>Here is a silver stripe
which fell into our garden in Munich</i>

1046
01:21:05,427 --> 01:21:08,169
<i>during the last air strike.</i>

1047
01:21:09,998 --> 01:21:13,411
<i>Everyone is getting medals and decorations,
except for Daddy.</i>

1048
01:21:13,501 --> 01:21:16,573
<i>He should be the first to get one.</i>

1049
01:21:16,671 --> 01:21:20,448
<i>If not for him,
so much would be different.</i>

1050
01:21:26,047 --> 01:21:28,027
<i>Dear Mommy,</i>

1051
01:21:28,116 --> 01:21:30,596
<i>I always feel sorry
when I sleep well</i>

1052
01:21:30,685 --> 01:21:33,131
<i>and hear in the morning
that there were air strikes.</i>

1053
01:21:33,221 --> 01:21:37,567
<i>The food coupons are included.
Be assured, all will be fine.</i>

1054
01:21:37,659 --> 01:21:39,263
<i>I'm working more than ever.</i>

1055
01:21:39,361 --> 01:21:42,274
<i>Try to recuperate,
you and our dear daughter.</i>

1056
01:21:42,364 --> 01:21:45,470
<i>Lots of love and kisses.
Yours, Daddy.</i>

1057
01:21:56,845 --> 01:22:01,726
But everyone believes
firmly in victory (Daddy).

1058
01:22:21,002 --> 01:22:22,879
<i>June 1944.</i>

1059
01:22:23,538 --> 01:22:27,042
<i>The invasion started
on the night of the 5th</i>

1060
01:22:27,142 --> 01:22:28,917
<i>in Normandy, by the Channel.</i>

1061
01:22:29,010 --> 01:22:31,115
<i>We have already given up Cherbourg.</i>

1062
01:22:31,212 --> 01:22:33,351
<i>The Russians
want to take over the Baltic Sea.</i>

1063
01:22:33,448 --> 01:22:36,258
<i>The way they treat people is unspeakable.</i>

1064
01:22:37,085 --> 01:22:39,463
<i>Dear party member Gieseler,</i>

1065
01:22:40,155 --> 01:22:43,432
<i>I am definitely not the anxious type.</i>

1066
01:22:43,525 --> 01:22:47,803
<i>Still, I decided
to build the bunker in Gmund.</i>

1067
01:22:48,229 --> 01:22:53,269
<i>I believe it may be that the enemy,
who knows the location of our houses,</i>

1068
01:22:53,368 --> 01:22:55,746
<i>will launch an air strike</i>

1069
01:22:55,837 --> 01:23:00,980
<i>in order to destroy the house
with its residents,</i>

1070
01:23:01,076 --> 01:23:03,113
<i>including me.</i>

1071
01:23:03,545 --> 01:23:08,619
<i>I highly appreciate the fact
that you abandoned all formalities to help me.</i>

1072
01:23:08,717 --> 01:23:10,993
<i>I express my deepest gratitude.</i>

1073
01:23:11,086 --> 01:23:13,794
<i>With regards and Heil Hitler.</i>

1074
01:23:13,888 --> 01:23:16,300
<i>Yours, H. Himmler.</i>

1075
01:23:18,393 --> 01:23:19,872
FOR FREEDOM AND LIFE

1076
01:23:20,662 --> 01:23:22,198
PEOPLE'S ARMY

1077
01:23:31,740 --> 01:23:35,779
<i>A telegram came yesterday.
A place was found for Gerhard.</i>

1078
01:23:36,478 --> 01:23:40,984
<i>Whether he can come by
before he is sent to the front is questionable.</i>

1079
01:23:41,082 --> 01:23:44,154
<i>He is very brave
and likes it' in the SS in Brunn.</i>

1080
01:23:44,652 --> 01:23:47,064
<i>I think he has become nicer.</i>

1081
01:23:48,590 --> 01:23:50,228
<i>The fuhrer cannot believe</i>

1082
01:23:50,325 --> 01:23:52,566
<i>that the German soldier
doesn't want to flight anymore.</i>

1083
01:23:55,296 --> 01:23:57,207
<i>Daddy believes firmly in our victory.</i>

1084
01:23:57,298 --> 01:24:00,939
<i>It is impossible to imagine
that we could lose the war.</i>

1085
01:24:02,504 --> 01:24:05,542
<i>Whenever the situation gets serious,
he needs to help.</i>

1086
01:24:06,207 --> 01:24:08,244
<i>All of Germany is looking up to him.</i>

1087
01:24:09,277 --> 01:24:12,747
<i>Yet he is happy and in good spirits
when he calls.</i>

1088
01:24:14,983 --> 01:24:18,192
<i>My dear, good Mommy.
My dearest Puppi.</i>

1089
01:24:18,286 --> 01:24:21,358
<i>Despite the overwhelming
and severe situation,</i>

1090
01:24:21,456 --> 01:24:24,699
<i>I am convinced we will win.</i>

1091
01:24:25,960 --> 01:24:30,204
<i>I am attaching a beautiful poem
called Redemption.</i>

1092
01:24:30,298 --> 01:24:32,574
<i>Puppi should read it too.</i>

1093
01:24:36,805 --> 01:24:38,443
Redemption.

1094
01:24:39,074 --> 01:24:43,682
<i>From the Metz Cathedral,
it echoed four times from the clock tower.</i>

1095
01:24:43,778 --> 01:24:45,280
<i>Redemption.</i>

1096
01:24:46,381 --> 01:24:50,693
<i>Redeemed is the ancient,
the old mighty imperial sword.</i>

1097
01:24:50,785 --> 01:24:52,992
<i>Germany again holds sway,</i>

1098
01:24:53,688 --> 01:24:57,830
<i>the respect you once held.</i>

1099
01:24:58,893 --> 01:25:05,071
<i>Redemption,
and the German resumes his old post.</i>

1100
01:25:05,800 --> 01:25:13,412
<i>The evening mist still glimmers in the west.
On the Moselle, day breaks in the east.</i>

1101
01:25:14,375 --> 01:25:19,723
<i>And the future, German people, is yours.</i>

1102
01:25:19,814 --> 01:25:22,158
SURRENDER?
NO

1103
01:25:23,585 --> 01:25:28,056
<i>Baumert wanted to persuade Mom
to go to Valepp under a false name.</i>

1104
01:25:28,723 --> 01:25:31,670
<i>Wherever we go
must be kept completely secret.</i>

1105
01:25:33,962 --> 01:25:36,499
<i>I'm still here because Heini wants it.</i>

1106
01:25:36,931 --> 01:25:40,276
<i>I worry about my work and my reputation.</i>

1107
01:25:40,969 --> 01:25:43,245
<i>If you don't perform your duty
in the face of danger,</i>

1108
01:25:43,338 --> 01:25:46,376
<i>people despise you, and they're right.</i>

1109
01:25:47,976 --> 01:25:50,354
<i>Today I stayed in bed until noon.</i>

1110
01:25:50,445 --> 01:25:55,190
<i>Mommy doesn't like it when I lie down,
but I still do it anyway.</i>

1111
01:25:55,283 --> 01:25:58,730
<i>There is a lot going on in the world,
and especially at home.</i>

1112
01:25:58,820 --> 01:26:02,996
<i>In brief,
on the 24th in the evening.</i>

1113
01:26:06,060 --> 01:26:08,700
<i>April 17, 1945.</i>

1114
01:26:09,931 --> 01:26:13,743
<i>My love, dear Mommy.
My love, dear Daughter.</i>

1115
01:26:14,769 --> 01:26:18,273
<i>Mr. Baumert is driving down
so I have the chance to send you this letter.</i>

1116
01:26:19,407 --> 01:26:22,047
<i>He will tell Mommy a lot in person.</i>

1117
01:26:22,744 --> 01:26:27,215
<i>Still, he should bring a note
with this little package.</i>

1118
01:26:27,782 --> 01:26:31,059
<i>Times are tremendously hard
for all of us and yet,</i>

1119
01:26:31,352 --> 01:26:35,357
<i>it will, I firmly believe,
still turn out right.</i>

1120
01:26:36,891 --> 01:26:39,030
<i>But it is hard.</i>

1121
01:26:39,694 --> 01:26:42,038
<i>You, my loved ones, stay healthy.</i>

1122
01:26:42,797 --> 01:26:46,973
<i>The Ancient One will protect us,
especially the good German nation.</i>

1123
01:26:47,068 --> 01:26:49,241
<i>He will not lea' us fall.</i>

1124
01:26:50,205 --> 01:26:53,846
<i>I am sending you, my beloved Mommy,
and you, Puppi, my dear,</i>

1125
01:26:53,942 --> 01:26:57,981
<i>much love, kisses and greetings.</i>

1126
01:26:58,079 --> 01:26:59,558
<i>Heil Hitler.</i>

1127
01:26:59,647 --> 01:27:03,060
<i>With love. Yours, Daddy.</i>

1128
01:27:23,705 --> 01:27:26,686
<i>I think, gentlemen,
that you know me long enough</i>

1129
01:27:26,774 --> 01:27:29,380
<i>to know that I am not a bloodthirsty man</i>

1130
01:27:29,477 --> 01:27:36,258
<i>and not someone who
takes pleasure in difficult duties.</i>

1131
01:27:36,351 --> 01:27:39,730
<i>But on the other hand,
I have such strong nerves</i>

1132
01:27:39,821 --> 01:27:42,859
<i>and such a great sense of duty,</i>

1133
01:27:42,957 --> 01:27:45,301
<i>I might say,</i>

1134
01:27:46,327 --> 01:27:50,707
<i>that when I recognize something
as being essential,</i>

1135
01:27:50,798 --> 01:27:53,074
<i>I execute it without compromise.</i>

1136
01:27:56,638 --> 01:27:58,743
<i>Most of you will know</i>

1137
01:27:58,840 --> 01:28:01,252
<i>What it means
when a hundred corpses lie side by side,</i>

1138
01:28:01,342 --> 01:28:04,050
<i>whether there are 500 or 1,000.</i>

1139
01:28:05,680 --> 01:28:07,057
<i>And...</i>

1140
01:28:08,082 --> 01:28:11,620
<i>to endure that</i>

1141
01:28:13,221 --> 01:28:18,796
<i>and, apart from a few exceptions,</i>

1142
01:28:18,893 --> 01:28:21,499
<i>to remain decent,</i>

1143
01:28:22,664 --> 01:28:28,740
<i>has made us tough,
but it is never mentioned,</i>

1144
01:28:28,836 --> 01:28:31,976
<i>and will never appear
in the glorious annals of history.</i>

1145
01:28:32,674 --> 01:28:37,714
<i>We can have but one desire
as to what is said about us.</i>

1146
01:28:37,812 --> 01:28:41,123
<i>These German officers,
