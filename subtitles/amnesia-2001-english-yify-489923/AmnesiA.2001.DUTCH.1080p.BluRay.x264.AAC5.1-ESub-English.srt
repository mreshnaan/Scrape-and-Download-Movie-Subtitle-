1
00:03:12,359 --> 00:03:13,402
I have cancer.

2
00:03:14,737 --> 00:03:18,365
Of course not. It's an ulcer.
You're complaining.

3
00:03:20,534 --> 00:03:22,578
Give me a glass of wine.
- It isn't good for you.

4
00:03:22,870 --> 00:03:24,455
It's good for your heart.

5
00:03:24,740 --> 00:03:27,080
There's nothing wrong with your heart.
- That's what you say.

6
00:03:30,666 --> 00:03:31,480
It's cold here.

7
00:03:32,463 --> 00:03:33,172
It's June.

8
00:03:39,136 --> 00:03:40,429
Shall I fetch you something else?

9
00:03:46,894 --> 00:03:47,770
Yes?

10
00:03:48,687 --> 00:03:50,147
Alex?
- Yes.

11
00:03:51,023 --> 00:03:52,191
It's Aram.

12
00:04:11,460 --> 00:04:12,836
Shouldn't you pick it up?

13
00:04:19,426 --> 00:04:22,179
It's not nice to hang up
on your brother, Alex.

14
00:04:23,514 --> 00:04:25,224
It's been a long time.
- You can say that again.

15
00:04:25,516 --> 00:04:27,226
Mum is severely ill.

16
00:04:30,354 --> 00:04:33,274
What's wrong?
- Her stomach.

17
00:04:36,652 --> 00:04:38,612
Do you still live at home?

18
00:04:38,904 --> 00:04:41,657
Yes. But I have to go away
for a few days.

19
00:04:45,869 --> 00:04:48,914
Christ, Alex.
Do it for mother, not for me.

20
00:04:49,373 --> 00:04:50,416
Will you come?

21
00:04:53,335 --> 00:04:54,295
Yes.

22
00:05:03,590 --> 00:05:04,400
Who was that?

23
00:05:08,100 --> 00:05:09,268
That was my brother.

24
00:05:10,978 --> 00:05:12,146
You have to get dressed.

25
00:05:13,605 --> 00:05:15,649
Won't you tell me your name first?

26
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:36,003
You should go to bed.

27
00:05:43,844 --> 00:05:44,678
My name's Sandra.

28
00:05:48,599 --> 00:05:50,434
Drive on or we'll have an accident.

29
00:06:11,372 --> 00:06:12,331
Go on, ask.

30
00:06:13,457 --> 00:06:14,416
What?

31
00:06:15,584 --> 00:06:17,836
You want to know
what I'm doing in your car.

32
00:06:19,963 --> 00:06:21,715
You must have your reasons.

33
00:06:23,217 --> 00:06:25,094
Everyone has their reasons.

34
00:06:28,097 --> 00:06:29,473
Well ask then.

35
00:06:31,517 --> 00:06:33,477
What are you doing in this car?

36
00:06:34,395 --> 00:06:36,522
It's none of your business.

37
00:06:36,897 --> 00:06:37,648
It's my car.

38
00:06:39,942 --> 00:06:40,776
It's my life.

39
00:06:46,031 --> 00:06:48,867
Let me drive.
- Do you have a driving licence?

40
00:06:49,952 --> 00:06:50,369
No.

41
00:06:54,289 --> 00:06:55,124
Don't you trust me?

42
00:07:06,885 --> 00:07:08,637
Are you sure it's here?

43
00:07:10,889 --> 00:07:11,849
Yes.

44
00:07:14,351 --> 00:07:17,104
Completely?
- Completely.

45
00:07:22,901 --> 00:07:27,489
I'm not sure.
It looks so quiet.

46
00:07:27,823 --> 00:07:30,659
That's right,
there's no one around.

47
00:07:32,786 --> 00:07:33,954
Are you sure?

48
00:07:34,288 --> 00:07:37,249
We'll go inside,
take that thing and walk out.

49
00:07:45,674 --> 00:07:47,301
I think it's guarded.

50
00:07:48,969 --> 00:07:52,806
I told you before.
Eugene said there's no one here.

51
00:08:01,064 --> 00:08:02,941
And you're sure it's here?

52
00:08:08,489 --> 00:08:11,617
Why visit your mother so late?
- She's ill.

53
00:08:12,490 --> 00:08:13,893
What's the matter with her?

54
00:08:16,538 --> 00:08:17,956
Something about her stomach.

55
00:08:20,083 --> 00:08:21,877
Is your father there?

56
00:08:22,169 --> 00:08:23,212
He's dead.

57
00:08:25,881 --> 00:08:27,424
Does your mother live all alone?

58
00:08:30,177 --> 00:08:32,471
No. My brother lives at home.

59
00:09:17,432 --> 00:09:20,018
Oh. It's not there.

60
00:09:21,228 --> 00:09:24,356
Are they expecting you?
- Yes.

61
00:09:25,649 --> 00:09:27,401
And the key is always there?

62
00:09:29,736 --> 00:09:31,738
I haven't been here for a long time.

63
00:09:32,114 --> 00:09:33,782
How long?

64
00:09:34,950 --> 00:09:35,951
Long.

65
00:09:36,780 --> 00:09:39,693
You don't know how long it is
since you saw your mother?

66
00:09:45,460 --> 00:09:46,295
Alex?

67
00:09:58,849 --> 00:10:01,059
Jesus Christ.

68
00:10:02,936 --> 00:10:04,146
Just keep breathing calmly.

69
00:10:06,189 --> 00:10:07,232
I don't understand.

70
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:09,443
What don't you?

71
00:10:09,776 --> 00:10:13,405
The only way he could shoot me
was through you.

72
00:10:13,780 --> 00:10:14,823
I don't understand.

73
00:10:16,825 --> 00:10:18,702
And where's Eugene?

74
00:10:20,787 --> 00:10:22,122
He should have been here long ago.

75
00:10:23,874 --> 00:10:24,958
Maybe he won't come.

76
00:10:25,959 --> 00:10:27,336
Eugene always keeps his word.

77
00:10:31,006 --> 00:10:33,383
You don't want anything, girl?
It's good for your heart.

78
00:10:34,468 --> 00:10:36,261
And you, Alex?
- No. Thanks.

79
00:10:36,553 --> 00:10:40,766
It's up to you.
I'm so happy you're home again.

80
00:10:43,977 --> 00:10:45,520
Are you warm enough?

81
00:10:45,979 --> 00:10:47,898
It's June, Mum.
- It feels cold.

82
00:10:48,190 --> 00:10:51,234
It's a pity Aram has to work.
You don't want any coffee?

83
00:10:52,027 --> 00:10:55,197
I want to sleep.
We've been up all-night.

84
00:10:56,281 --> 00:10:59,451
What does Aram does for a living?
- But haven't seen your mother for years.

85
00:10:59,743 --> 00:11:01,578
We've been up all night. I'm exhausted.

86
00:11:01,870 --> 00:11:05,916
I never see you.
I want to enjoy having you here.

87
00:11:06,708 --> 00:11:08,543
I'm staying a while.
- Really?

88
00:11:08,919 --> 00:11:09,920
You're staying a while?
- Yes.

89
00:11:10,212 --> 00:11:12,172
How long?
- That depends. A while.

90
00:11:12,881 --> 00:11:15,008
Until you get better.
- There's nothing wrong.

91
00:11:16,385 --> 00:11:18,136
Aram said you were ill.

92
00:11:18,512 --> 00:11:20,972
I cough up blood.
- That's not normal.

93
00:11:21,264 --> 00:11:23,392
You should see a doctor.
- I thought so, but Aram refused.

94
00:11:23,684 --> 00:11:26,186
He doesn't like doctors.
I may have cancer.

95
00:11:26,680 --> 00:11:28,320
We'll go to the doctor tomorrow.

96
00:11:28,730 --> 00:11:30,607
I'm sure my stomach won't kill me.

97
00:11:30,899 --> 00:11:32,859
My heart is weak, like my mother's.

98
00:11:33,610 --> 00:11:34,569
We'll check that too.

99
00:11:37,906 --> 00:11:42,119
Sweden, Holland, Germany, Britain...

100
00:11:42,536 --> 00:11:44,079
All monarchies, except Germany.

101
00:11:45,414 --> 00:11:46,415
Your turn.

102
00:11:46,707 --> 00:11:48,250
Jesus, Buddha, Mohammed or Bhishma...

103
00:11:49,209 --> 00:11:51,378
Or who?
- Bhishma from the Mahabharata.

104
00:11:53,422 --> 00:11:55,507
It must be him.
- That's right.

105
00:12:00,095 --> 00:12:02,305
I don't think he's coming.
- Of course he is.

106
00:12:03,181 --> 00:12:05,809
He must have heard what happened.
He won't come.

107
00:12:22,576 --> 00:12:23,952
So you are Sandra.

108
00:12:25,245 --> 00:12:26,872
And you are Alex.

109
00:12:30,375 --> 00:12:32,461
I never met an Alex before.

110
00:12:34,045 --> 00:12:35,422
You're my first Sandra.

111
00:12:50,103 --> 00:12:52,731
What's your brother like?

112
00:12:54,024 --> 00:12:56,359
Why doesn't he take
your mother to the doctor?

113
00:12:57,319 --> 00:12:59,488
My mother used to go every week.

114
00:13:00,447 --> 00:13:02,157
There was always something.

115
00:14:16,231 --> 00:14:17,774
Where the hell are we?
- Home.

116
00:14:19,985 --> 00:14:21,862
You can meet my mother at last.

117
00:14:24,739 --> 00:14:26,700
I'm thirsty.
- I'll get you something later.

118
00:14:26,992 --> 00:14:29,828
I'm thirsty now.
- When you're lying down.

119
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:31,872
What happened?

120
00:14:32,247 --> 00:14:33,999
Nothing to worry about.

121
00:14:34,291 --> 00:14:36,459
Who's that?
- Wouter. Nice to meet you.

122
00:14:37,711 --> 00:14:39,170
You have to see a doctor.

123
00:14:39,460 --> 00:14:41,746
We don't have to do anything.
- And certainly not see a doctor.

124
00:14:41,756 --> 00:14:43,300
He can't lie on the sofa.

125
00:14:43,592 --> 00:14:46,011
Why not?
- He'll get it dirty. Take him to bed.

126
00:14:47,679 --> 00:14:49,931
He can lie in Alex's room.
- No, Alex is there.

127
00:14:51,141 --> 00:14:51,725
Is he back?

128
00:14:52,017 --> 00:14:53,894
I want the sofa.
- With his new girlfriend.

129
00:14:54,185 --> 00:14:56,021
I say.
- I'm thirsty.

130
00:14:56,313 --> 00:14:58,023
Do you have any Chinese beer?
- No, sorry.

131
00:14:58,398 --> 00:15:00,066
Christ almighty!
You know I drink Chinese beer.

132
00:15:00,358 --> 00:15:03,653
I thought you'd be away for days.
I haven't gone shopping yet.

133
00:15:04,195 --> 00:15:07,616
Excuses! A good housewife
always has beer for visitors.

134
00:15:07,908 --> 00:15:10,869
We never have visitors.
- What about me, goddamnit?!

135
00:15:11,703 --> 00:15:14,706
I've been back five minutes
and I'm already regretting it.

136
00:16:18,395 --> 00:16:19,354
How are you?

137
00:16:19,854 --> 00:16:22,315
Why did you take photos of me?

138
00:16:23,942 --> 00:16:25,694
I'm a photographer.

139
00:16:53,930 --> 00:16:55,765
Is it nice?
- Delicious.

140
00:16:56,057 --> 00:16:57,892
I thought as much.

141
00:16:58,184 --> 00:17:00,145
Everyone sleeps here all day.

142
00:17:03,314 --> 00:17:04,315
Shall I wake up Alex?

143
00:17:05,191 --> 00:17:06,234
He was very tired.

144
00:17:07,402 --> 00:17:09,696
Isn't it nice and quiet;
just the two of us?

145
00:17:09,988 --> 00:17:13,575
Did you quarrel?
Oh my god, what happened?

146
00:17:13,867 --> 00:17:15,785
No. We've never quarrelled.

147
00:17:24,210 --> 00:17:26,004
This is nice?
- Great.

148
00:17:29,549 --> 00:17:31,134
What are the pills for?

149
00:17:32,427 --> 00:17:33,428
Nothing special.

150
00:17:33,762 --> 00:17:37,599
If you can't tell your mother-in-law,
who can you tell?

151
00:17:38,725 --> 00:17:41,102
It would only worry you.
- No, really.

152
00:17:42,979 --> 00:17:44,981
Epilepsy.
- Oh God...

153
00:17:45,273 --> 00:17:48,193
It's nothing to worry about.
I take my medicine.

154
00:17:48,485 --> 00:17:51,446
Medicine?
- Against attacks.

155
00:17:52,072 --> 00:17:53,114
Attacks?

156
00:17:53,615 --> 00:17:56,451
No need for hysteria.

157
00:17:56,743 --> 00:17:58,828
It's years since I had an attack.

158
00:17:59,704 --> 00:18:00,789
The pills take care of that.

159
00:18:05,668 --> 00:18:06,544
Does Alex know?

160
00:18:09,798 --> 00:18:11,091
It hasn't come up yet.

161
00:18:16,346 --> 00:18:18,223
May I use the bathroom?

162
00:19:33,548 --> 00:19:35,884
Good morning!
- Good morning.

163
00:19:36,384 --> 00:19:38,303
I should say good afternoon.

164
00:19:38,595 --> 00:19:42,557
I'll make you some hot chocolate.
- Great!

165
00:19:42,891 --> 00:19:46,311
Hot chocolate for the late sleeper.
If you say please, at least.

166
00:19:46,811 --> 00:19:47,979
Please at least.

167
00:19:48,313 --> 00:19:50,899
No, just please.
- Just please.

168
00:19:52,483 --> 00:19:55,028
We are in a good mood.
- Stop that!

169
00:20:41,032 --> 00:20:41,574
Who are you?

170
00:20:44,118 --> 00:20:45,662
You must be Alex.

171
00:20:47,497 --> 00:20:48,665
How do you know who I am?

172
00:20:48,957 --> 00:20:53,711
Right description: identical,
but with a loser's look on his face.

173
00:20:55,838 --> 00:20:57,966
Who said that?
- Me. You heard.

174
00:21:00,218 --> 00:21:04,889
Which is the odd one out:
Jesus, Mohammed, Buddha or Bhishma?

175
00:21:06,015 --> 00:21:06,432
The last one.

176
00:21:08,268 --> 00:21:10,395
You're guessing.
You don't know who he is.

177
00:21:11,229 --> 00:21:14,274
Bhishma was invincible and
could decide when he would die.

178
00:21:16,651 --> 00:21:18,444
Who told you about me?

179
00:21:22,991 --> 00:21:24,075
Where's my brother?

180
00:21:30,456 --> 00:21:31,207
What are you doing?

181
00:21:33,126 --> 00:21:36,337
I'm blowing the milk back.
- I can see that. Throw it away.

182
00:21:37,380 --> 00:21:39,382
What's wrong with the milk?
- Throw it away, I said.

183
00:21:49,225 --> 00:21:50,226
Sandra?

184
00:21:52,979 --> 00:21:56,232
Aram is here. With a friend.

185
00:21:58,401 --> 00:21:59,694
Then I can meet him.

186
00:22:00,778 --> 00:22:02,530
What did I give you
for your birthday?!

187
00:22:03,865 --> 00:22:04,615
Oh yes.

188
00:22:05,950 --> 00:22:09,912
Don't look a gift horse in the mouth.

189
00:22:10,705 --> 00:22:14,751
Especially when you need the gift
and the giver is present.

190
00:22:16,336 --> 00:22:19,297
I don't know how it works.
- I explained it four times!

191
00:22:19,589 --> 00:22:20,381
Pour a glass of milk.

192
00:22:30,099 --> 00:22:31,601
Give it to me.

193
00:22:41,152 --> 00:22:42,111
That's not difficult, is it?

194
00:22:43,654 --> 00:22:45,156
Think you can do that next time?

195
00:22:47,742 --> 00:22:50,036
Who's this then?
Another late sleeper.

196
00:22:50,213 --> 00:22:50,866
Good morning.

197
00:22:50,995 --> 00:22:52,955
Would you like hot chocolate?
Where is Sandra?

198
00:22:53,581 --> 00:22:54,415
Hello little brother.

199
00:22:55,917 --> 00:22:59,587
Hi, Aram. How are you?
- Oh, fine so far.

200
00:23:00,254 --> 00:23:02,757
Would you like some hot chocolate?
- Yes.

201
00:23:03,049 --> 00:23:06,177
If you say please, at least.
- Please at least.

202
00:23:06,969 --> 00:23:08,971
Where's Sandra?
- Who the hell is Sandra?

203
00:23:09,263 --> 00:23:11,391
Alec's girlfriend. She takes pills.
- Pills?

204
00:23:11,682 --> 00:23:14,185
Against the attacks.
- What kind of attacks?

205
00:23:14,477 --> 00:23:16,562
She has attacks of fury.
- Really?

206
00:23:16,854 --> 00:23:19,607
She told me herself.
She foams at the mouth without the pills.

207
00:23:19,941 --> 00:23:23,986
I didn't notice that.
- She keeps it secret from you.

208
00:23:24,278 --> 00:23:27,115
It's because of the children.
- Children? We don't have any.

209
00:23:27,448 --> 00:23:30,410
All you have to do
is add some cocoa...

210
00:23:44,590 --> 00:23:45,633
How are you?

211
00:23:46,759 --> 00:23:47,802
Bad.

212
00:23:48,302 --> 00:23:49,929
Are you in pain?

213
00:23:50,847 --> 00:23:54,392
What did you think?
What are we doing here?

214
00:23:54,976 --> 00:23:57,603
Waiting for Eugene to call.
- Shouldn't you call him?

215
00:23:58,187 --> 00:23:59,230
That's not a good idea.

216
00:24:00,356 --> 00:24:05,778
You're not professional. Get focused.
Leave your brother out of it.

217
00:24:06,529 --> 00:24:08,990
Two birds with one stone.

218
00:24:10,575 --> 00:24:13,953
You're messing up.
What's the matter these days?

219
00:24:34,765 --> 00:24:37,685
You were to be away for a few days?
- Yes.

220
00:24:38,227 --> 00:24:42,064
But I didn't want to leave
those boring sleepy fossils.

221
00:24:42,356 --> 00:24:44,150
How can a fossil be sleepy?

222
00:24:46,235 --> 00:24:47,278
What?

223
00:24:49,489 --> 00:24:50,781
A fossil is dead.

224
00:24:51,699 --> 00:24:54,410
So it already dropped off.

225
00:24:55,036 --> 00:24:56,913
What are you trying to say?

226
00:24:57,830 --> 00:25:00,541
You can't say "sleepy fossil".
Just like white snow.

227
00:25:00,958 --> 00:25:02,793
It's a pleonasm.

228
00:25:04,295 --> 00:25:09,050
Are you saying I'm stupid enough
to utter a pleonasm?

229
00:25:10,426 --> 00:25:12,512
You think you're cleverer than me?

230
00:25:14,388 --> 00:25:17,683
Did you know "white snow"
was a pleonasm?

231
00:25:20,561 --> 00:25:22,772
Try to think one up with Alex.

232
00:25:24,065 --> 00:25:28,027
What you mean?
- A pleonasm with Alex. Dot dot Alex.

233
00:25:29,820 --> 00:25:30,988
I'll help you.

234
00:25:31,280 --> 00:25:33,074
Dumb Alex.

235
00:25:33,491 --> 00:25:35,284
Come on.
- Now you, damn it!

236
00:25:38,579 --> 00:25:41,499
Boring Alex.
- Good. Another one.

237
00:25:43,793 --> 00:25:46,045
Cowardly Alex.
- Stinking Alex.

238
00:25:47,046 --> 00:25:48,881
Disgusting Alex.

239
00:25:49,674 --> 00:25:52,051
Unmannered Alex.

240
00:26:08,859 --> 00:26:10,945
Send in the next.

241
00:26:13,864 --> 00:26:14,949
Hello doctor.

242
00:26:17,201 --> 00:26:18,369
Sit down.

243
00:26:25,084 --> 00:26:29,171
Did you come along anyway?
- I'm Alex. Aram's brother.

244
00:26:29,922 --> 00:26:32,633
Alex lets me come to the doctor.

245
00:26:34,927 --> 00:26:40,641
I checked your mother last week.
Nothing wrong with her heart.

246
00:26:40,933 --> 00:26:43,936
She's completely fit.
- It's her stomach.

247
00:27:02,830 --> 00:27:04,165
Are you cold, or what?

248
00:27:11,631 --> 00:27:13,466
I'll be honest.

249
00:27:14,425 --> 00:27:16,093
I'm Alex's brother.

250
00:27:18,679 --> 00:27:20,640
You're Aram?
- Well...

251
00:27:20,931 --> 00:27:25,519
So Alex did mention me.
- Not that you...

252
00:27:25,811 --> 00:27:29,899
Are his twin brother?
Half an hour older. It's strange.

253
00:27:30,274 --> 00:27:34,070
We don't meet for years and
then have about the same haircut.

254
00:27:34,362 --> 00:27:36,489
Wasn't I good to you?

255
00:27:39,116 --> 00:27:41,786
Wouter, this is Sandra.
Sandra, Wouter.

256
00:27:42,286 --> 00:27:44,246
Hello.
- Hello.

257
00:27:44,664 --> 00:27:47,375
Aram?
- Yes?

258
00:27:47,667 --> 00:27:49,418
Wasn't I good to you?

259
00:27:49,710 --> 00:27:52,797
You always were.
- I always asked you on a job.

260
00:27:53,089 --> 00:27:55,174
I appreciate that.
And you know who I ask for?

261
00:27:56,008 --> 00:27:57,802
Who for?
- I ask for you.

262
00:28:00,429 --> 00:28:02,556
You're a real Christian.
- It's nothing.

263
00:28:03,099 --> 00:28:05,351
No, you're really good to me.
- It's nothing. You're capable.

264
00:28:05,643 --> 00:28:09,563
No, I really appreciate it.
- Unnecessary to repeat yourself.

265
00:28:10,731 --> 00:28:13,818
You're right, sorry.
- Yes, quite unnecessary.

266
00:28:16,153 --> 00:28:18,030
It can give you heart problems.

267
00:28:18,322 --> 00:28:20,032
There's nothing wrong
with your heart.

268
00:28:21,867 --> 00:28:24,370
The pills can give me palpitations.
It says so.

269
00:28:26,038 --> 00:28:28,332
Just take them.
They're good for you.

270
00:28:36,048 --> 00:28:38,467
Alex?
- Yes?

271
00:28:41,220 --> 00:28:44,140
Couldn't you work in the garage?

272
00:28:47,268 --> 00:28:49,103
You know I'm not very handy.

273
00:28:52,440 --> 00:28:54,275
Your father would have loved it.

274
00:28:58,571 --> 00:29:01,657
It hurts.
- Pain is in the head.

275
00:29:02,158 --> 00:29:03,117
I'm dying.

276
00:29:03,743 --> 00:29:05,828
He has to go to a doctor.
- I don't have to go anywhere.

277
00:29:06,871 --> 00:29:10,249
Sandra, can you get a drink?

278
00:29:18,174 --> 00:29:19,508
Are you afraid of death?

279
00:29:21,343 --> 00:29:22,303
No.

280
00:29:34,482 --> 00:29:36,400
I know what you think.

281
00:29:38,068 --> 00:29:39,528
I bet you don't.

282
00:29:42,782 --> 00:29:45,534
You think Wouter
should see a doctor.

283
00:29:46,702 --> 00:29:48,746
What do you have
against doctors?

284
00:29:49,497 --> 00:29:51,081
Anyone can be a doctor.

285
00:29:52,917 --> 00:29:54,877
Anyone can be ill.

286
00:29:55,169 --> 00:29:57,171
Pain and illness are in your head.

287
00:30:06,806 --> 00:30:08,599
Don't you know a nice story, Alex?

288
00:30:08,891 --> 00:30:12,311
He always told those lovely stories,
just like his father.

289
00:30:12,728 --> 00:30:16,482
I'm right out of nice stories.
- Goodness, I wonder why?

290
00:30:18,025 --> 00:30:21,070
Alex's father was the best storyteller.
And your father?

291
00:30:21,987 --> 00:30:23,197
No, he was a good liar.

292
00:30:23,864 --> 00:30:26,450
What a pity. Theo's stories
took people's breath away.

293
00:30:26,992 --> 00:30:29,453
He was also the best car mechanic.
What does your father do?

294
00:30:30,746 --> 00:30:32,540
He's in jail because of me.

295
00:30:36,460 --> 00:30:40,798
Theo could repair a car
by looking at it.

296
00:30:41,715 --> 00:30:43,843
It's a pity nothing happens
in the garage.

297
00:30:44,134 --> 00:30:46,220
You don't do anything?
- No.

298
00:30:46,804 --> 00:30:51,058
He stopped work a year after you left.
Now it all just rots.

299
00:31:01,026 --> 00:31:02,903
My mother is very ill.

300
00:31:12,246 --> 00:31:14,164
What did the doctor say?

301
00:31:16,417 --> 00:31:19,211
Nothing, but I could see
it was serious.

302
00:31:23,382 --> 00:31:25,551
And now he's doing tests.

303
00:31:27,011 --> 00:31:29,555
We'll know more in a few days.

304
00:31:30,931 --> 00:31:34,310
Christ almighty.
- Yes, you can say that again.

305
00:31:40,024 --> 00:31:41,984
I'm glad I came back.

306
00:31:51,785 --> 00:31:54,872
Why didn't you say
you had a twin brother?

307
00:31:57,166 --> 00:31:58,792
I didn't?

308
00:31:59,335 --> 00:32:00,377
No.

309
00:32:14,725 --> 00:32:17,895
We're making a report about
a working woman in this area.

310
00:32:18,187 --> 00:32:21,690
Don't you want photos
of me at work?

311
00:32:22,066 --> 00:32:25,861
Yes. But that's for later.

312
00:32:28,238 --> 00:32:31,283
What do you most
like photographing?

313
00:32:33,369 --> 00:32:34,411
Animals.

314
00:32:35,871 --> 00:32:37,706
Everything except people.

315
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:43,754
Why?
- Look what I have for you, Sandra.

316
00:32:44,046 --> 00:32:46,924
I used to wear it myself.

317
00:32:49,051 --> 00:32:50,219
Put it on.

318
00:33:01,522 --> 00:33:03,315
It'll suit her.

319
00:33:05,067 --> 00:33:07,611
That child dresses so badly.
- What makes you say that?

320
00:33:07,903 --> 00:33:09,738
All that crap on her face,
just like Babylon.

321
00:33:10,030 --> 00:33:11,865
Mum!
- Well, it's true.

322
00:34:07,463 --> 00:34:09,381
Yes, lovely!

323
00:34:11,842 --> 00:34:13,177
What do you think?

324
00:34:14,803 --> 00:34:17,806
I don't know. Maybe
I have to get used to it.

325
00:34:18,098 --> 00:34:20,434
Get used to it? It looks lovely.

326
00:34:20,726 --> 00:34:22,561
Take a good look, Alex.

327
00:34:24,772 --> 00:34:27,024
I want to go,
to take some photos.

328
00:34:28,150 --> 00:34:29,401
I'll come along.

329
00:34:43,582 --> 00:34:46,794
We'll have to walk.
- Try again.

330
00:35:06,730 --> 00:35:08,732
I used to play here.

331
00:35:09,566 --> 00:35:11,568
It's lovely.
- Yes.

332
00:35:12,111 --> 00:35:14,071
Will you take pictures here?

333
00:35:15,906 --> 00:35:19,201
They'd be postcard landscapes.
- Rubbish.

334
00:35:24,164 --> 00:35:25,624
Maybe you're right.

335
00:35:37,719 --> 00:35:39,805
There's a nice spot.

336
00:35:41,265 --> 00:35:44,184
It's a lovely background, isn't it, Alex?

337
00:35:45,144 --> 00:35:46,353
Very nice.

338
00:35:47,604 --> 00:35:51,400
I'll stand there.
- But of course.

339
00:36:14,590 --> 00:36:16,383
It's going wrong.

340
00:36:16,884 --> 00:36:18,719
Did I do something wrong?

341
00:36:21,054 --> 00:36:23,724
I can't take pictures of people.

342
00:36:24,057 --> 00:36:26,727
It goes wrong if
a person crosses my lens.

343
00:36:32,357 --> 00:36:34,234
How long has it been like that?

344
00:36:36,612 --> 00:36:38,322
Quite a while.

345
00:36:45,662 --> 00:36:47,664
Maybe I should do
something else.

346
00:36:49,208 --> 00:36:50,876
Yes, maybe.

347
00:36:56,173 --> 00:36:58,383
I could work in the garage.

348
00:36:59,676 --> 00:37:02,471
Will you call him?
- No, not yet.

349
00:37:02,763 --> 00:37:04,640
You have to call him.

350
00:37:07,559 --> 00:37:10,729
We messed up.
- What makes you think that?

351
00:37:11,146 --> 00:37:12,564
I...

352
00:37:14,149 --> 00:37:16,068
I messed up.

353
00:37:25,494 --> 00:37:27,329
Can I ask?

354
00:37:44,972 --> 00:37:46,556
What happened?

355
00:37:50,686 --> 00:37:53,647
I once photographed
a terrible accident.

356
00:37:55,732 --> 00:37:56,900
By accident.

357
00:38:00,070 --> 00:38:02,781
It happened while
I pressed the shutter.

358
00:38:12,207 --> 00:38:14,042
I burned the film.

359
00:38:16,211 --> 00:38:18,380
I didn't even dare develop it.

360
00:38:32,978 --> 00:38:34,980
You trust me, don't you?

361
00:38:49,119 --> 00:38:50,746
I have to pee.

362
00:38:53,373 --> 00:38:56,168
I'll go with you.
- No, I want to pee outside.

363
00:38:58,962 --> 00:39:01,214
I'll work on my car.

364
00:39:39,753 --> 00:39:42,089
I could kick that jack away.

365
00:39:47,052 --> 00:39:50,180
Aram?
- Since when do you repair cars?

366
00:39:52,140 --> 00:39:53,308
Since today.

367
00:39:54,226 --> 00:39:58,605
Maybe you should be a mechanic.
- Yes, maybe.

368
00:39:59,523 --> 00:40:02,901
You never were a good photographer.
- And you know all about that?

369
00:40:03,777 --> 00:40:06,655
Well the last session I attended
wasn't very impressive.

370
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:09,783
I don't want to talk about it.

371
00:40:10,283 --> 00:40:12,160
It was your idea, damn it.

372
00:40:50,532 --> 00:40:52,826
Mum, have you seen Sandra?

373
00:40:57,456 --> 00:41:00,834
Did you set fire to that thing?
- No. Why should I?

374
00:41:01,126 --> 00:41:05,088
Be nice to each other.
How long since you last met?

375
00:41:05,380 --> 00:41:06,673
Not long enough.

376
00:41:09,759 --> 00:41:11,595
Are you expecting a call?

377
00:41:12,596 --> 00:41:13,597
You?

378
00:41:14,723 --> 00:41:17,559
Will someone pick it up?

379
00:41:18,852 --> 00:41:20,020
Alex speaking...

380
00:41:30,155 --> 00:41:31,406
Yes, I'll be right there.

381
00:41:34,451 --> 00:41:35,452
Who was that?

382
00:41:36,411 --> 00:41:39,080
Just an acquaintance.
- Which acquaintance?

383
00:41:39,581 --> 00:41:41,833
You don't know him.
- How d'you know?

384
00:41:42,125 --> 00:41:44,085
Let it be, Aram.

385
00:41:48,507 --> 00:41:51,968
The doctor called.
- And?

386
00:41:53,428 --> 00:41:55,388
I have to come round.

387
00:41:57,432 --> 00:41:59,267
It didn't sound good.

388
00:42:01,853 --> 00:42:03,438
Does she know?

389
00:42:04,814 --> 00:42:05,815
No.

390
00:42:08,193 --> 00:42:12,155
Why are you so nasty to your brother?
- Because he's a fool.

391
00:42:12,447 --> 00:42:15,200
He's a good photographer.
You don't win prizes for nothing.

392
00:42:15,492 --> 00:42:18,036
Have you watched him
all these years, then?

393
00:42:18,578 --> 00:42:20,330
You should be proud of him.

394
00:42:20,622 --> 00:42:23,667
He wants to be a car mechanic.
- Oh yes? Since when?

395
00:42:25,043 --> 00:42:26,962
Why d'you love him more than me?

396
00:42:30,257 --> 00:42:33,051
He didn't call for years.
- He's busy.

397
00:42:33,343 --> 00:42:36,805
Who stayed here?
Who took over the business?

398
00:42:37,097 --> 00:42:40,016
For two years,
then you stopped.

399
00:42:40,308 --> 00:42:43,311
And now you think Alex will
take care of it? I know you.

400
00:42:44,187 --> 00:42:47,649
Alex could be a good mechanic.
- Rubbish.

401
00:42:48,483 --> 00:42:50,902
Dad was proud of me,
you know that.

402
00:42:52,779 --> 00:42:54,573
Your father is dead.

403
00:43:15,719 --> 00:43:17,971
Do you notice people treating you
as a woman?

404
00:43:18,930 --> 00:43:22,851
What do you mean?
- People think doctors should be men.

405
00:43:24,060 --> 00:43:28,231
Sometimes.
But most male patients don't mind.

406
00:43:28,523 --> 00:43:30,442
They may even prefer it.

407
00:43:31,401 --> 00:43:33,612
That never causes tension?

408
00:43:34,529 --> 00:43:37,699
Why are male doctors
never asked that?

409
00:43:40,493 --> 00:43:42,662
There's something on your face.
- What?

410
00:43:44,080 --> 00:43:46,833
A smudge. On your face.

411
00:43:49,252 --> 00:43:50,962
It's your turn.

412
00:44:03,558 --> 00:44:05,435
What do you do for a living?

413
00:44:05,727 --> 00:44:07,687
You first.
- Car mechanic.

414
00:44:08,688 --> 00:44:10,023
Hairdresser.
- God, that's nice.

415
00:44:10,315 --> 00:44:13,026
Aram!
- Did you cut Alex's hair?

416
00:44:14,194 --> 00:44:16,446
No? What's all this? Why not?

417
00:44:17,238 --> 00:44:20,325
I'm really still learning.
- Aram!

418
00:44:21,326 --> 00:44:22,452
One moment.

419
00:44:23,453 --> 00:44:25,705
Aram!

420
00:44:27,666 --> 00:44:28,875
Yes, what's up?

421
00:44:29,167 --> 00:44:31,753
I'm thirsty.
- But there's no beer.

422
00:44:32,045 --> 00:44:35,965
Where's your mother?
- What? Gone somewhere.

423
00:44:36,800 --> 00:44:39,260
There must be something
to drink in the house.

424
00:44:41,471 --> 00:44:44,224
To be honest,
I may have been exaggerating.

425
00:44:44,599 --> 00:44:46,142
Really?

426
00:44:46,851 --> 00:44:48,728
I only had a couple of lessons.

427
00:44:49,312 --> 00:44:51,314
Then you need some more practice.

428
00:44:52,565 --> 00:44:55,985
I only worked with the dummy,
not real people.

429
00:45:07,497 --> 00:45:09,165
What are you doing?

430
00:45:10,291 --> 00:45:11,793
I'm having my hair styled.

431
00:45:13,420 --> 00:45:15,338
You're wearing rollers.

432
00:45:15,755 --> 00:45:16,756
You don't say...

433
00:45:22,137 --> 00:45:23,888
Shouldn't someone look at that?

434
00:45:26,307 --> 00:45:29,269
Don't you mind me exaggerating?
- Of course.

435
00:45:29,561 --> 00:45:33,523
But it's water under the bridge.
I have something to admit too.

436
00:45:35,692 --> 00:45:39,529
I haven't been a car mechanic for years.
Honesty lasts longer.

437
00:45:39,821 --> 00:45:42,699
My mother always said that.
- How sensible.

438
00:45:43,533 --> 00:45:47,829
Shall we promise to be honest
with each other now?

439
00:45:48,955 --> 00:45:51,166
No more lies?
- Nothing but the truth!

440
00:45:51,458 --> 00:45:53,126
Ask me something.

441
00:45:55,670 --> 00:45:58,548
Don't you ever wear shoes?
- No shoes, no socks.

442
00:45:59,632 --> 00:46:01,468
Never?
- Not ever.

443
00:46:02,761 --> 00:46:03,928
Why not?

444
00:46:04,721 --> 00:46:07,891
Do you know Abbey Road?
- Who gave Wouter curls?

445
00:46:15,356 --> 00:46:16,357
Aram.

446
00:46:16,983 --> 00:46:19,194
Hello, Eugene.
I was about to call.

447
00:46:19,611 --> 00:46:22,030
Of course not... Just a scratch.

448
00:46:23,740 --> 00:46:26,201
I have to talk to you.

449
00:46:26,910 --> 00:46:28,286
Of course you can.

450
00:46:28,703 --> 00:46:30,538
My mother has cancer.

451
00:46:35,668 --> 00:46:37,837
She only has a couple of months.

452
00:46:39,255 --> 00:46:40,799
Christ.

453
00:46:44,344 --> 00:46:46,429
How are you going to tell her?

454
00:46:49,432 --> 00:46:51,434
She wouldn't believe it.

455
00:46:52,811 --> 00:46:56,606
She always thought
she'd die of a heart attack.

456
00:47:01,027 --> 00:47:02,111
And now?

457
00:47:04,030 --> 00:47:05,198
I don't know.

458
00:47:08,326 --> 00:47:10,203
I can't leave now.

459
00:47:17,627 --> 00:47:18,795
Take a look.

460
00:47:24,133 --> 00:47:25,969
That's cheeky.

461
00:47:33,142 --> 00:47:34,936
Christ, what do we want
with an animal?

462
00:47:35,228 --> 00:47:37,313
It's nice for mum.
A rabbit, like the old days.

463
00:47:37,605 --> 00:47:41,276
The past is gone.
- The past never dies.

464
00:47:41,693 --> 00:47:44,362
Big words from my little brother.

465
00:47:44,654 --> 00:47:47,156
If you'd been that clever,
your father might still live.

466
00:47:47,907 --> 00:47:49,909
It was an accident.
- Oh yes?

467
00:47:50,243 --> 00:47:52,787
Yes, you know that as well as I do.

468
00:47:53,162 --> 00:47:57,208
How lovely, a rabbit!
Guess what I won at bingo?

469
00:47:58,042 --> 00:48:01,546
A trip round the world!
- It's only the village bingo.

470
00:48:01,838 --> 00:48:03,756
You'll never guess.
- Tell us.

471
00:48:04,299 --> 00:48:07,343
No, you guess.
- Something for the living room?

472
00:48:07,635 --> 00:48:09,804
It's a cake. Who'd have thought?

473
00:48:10,138 --> 00:48:14,142
Can I take out the curlers?
- Alex, did you think it was a cake?

474
00:48:14,726 --> 00:48:18,313
Of course not.
- Can I take them out, or what?

475
00:48:18,938 --> 00:48:21,107
I bought Chinese beer too.

476
00:48:21,482 --> 00:48:26,112
Our father, who art in Heaven,
hallowed by thy name...

477
00:48:38,041 --> 00:48:39,125
Amen.

478
00:48:44,213 --> 00:48:48,509
More respect for the Word of God
would not be misplaced.

479
00:48:56,851 --> 00:49:00,521
He was part of me.
- But not worth a dig?

480
00:49:00,813 --> 00:49:04,692
We have laborers for that.
You want to be a laborer, don't you?

481
00:49:05,109 --> 00:49:08,947
That's no way to be buried.
- It happens the way I say.

482
00:49:09,280 --> 00:49:12,283
I didn't like it, the last time
I listened to you.

483
00:49:16,329 --> 00:49:19,248
We wouldn't mention it again.
- Also your idea.

484
00:49:19,540 --> 00:49:21,626
God, you have bad ideas.

485
00:49:21,918 --> 00:49:23,836
You think it's so easy for me?

486
00:49:24,879 --> 00:49:26,589
What d'you think it meant to me?

487
00:49:26,881 --> 00:49:29,092
The poor boy can't take
any more pictures.

488
00:49:29,384 --> 00:49:31,803
You were the one who left,
you bastard. Now dig!

489
00:49:51,698 --> 00:49:54,742
You thought you could
get round Mum with a rabbit?

490
00:49:55,910 --> 00:49:58,371
You think that's why
I captured the beast?

491
00:50:00,498 --> 00:50:02,583
Dad mechanic, you mechanic.

492
00:50:03,167 --> 00:50:05,420
Dad rabbit, you rabbit.

493
00:50:07,672 --> 00:50:08,965
You're crazy.

494
00:50:19,100 --> 00:50:20,309
Give that dirty mess to me.

495
00:50:20,893 --> 00:50:22,937
I'll put it in the wash with
the rest of your clothes.

496
00:50:23,229 --> 00:50:25,565
The rest? They weren't dirty.

497
00:50:26,107 --> 00:50:27,358
They stank.

498
00:50:38,995 --> 00:50:41,080
A microwave damages the health.

499
00:50:41,956 --> 00:50:43,750
So does smoking.

500
00:50:44,042 --> 00:50:45,918
My health isn't important.

501
00:50:48,087 --> 00:50:50,256
Those microwaves
could make you impotent.

502
00:50:50,548 --> 00:50:52,675
If you climb inside.

503
00:50:55,803 --> 00:50:59,891
What will Sandra think if you stop taking
pictures and become a mechanic?

504
00:51:01,100 --> 00:51:04,020
She'll understand.
- Oh really? You think so?

505
00:51:05,021 --> 00:51:10,860
You think Sandra with her skinny
yet delicious body would agree?

506
00:51:23,498 --> 00:51:25,750
Why treat the animal like that?

507
00:51:26,042 --> 00:51:28,669
Your boyfriend has strange ideas
about rabbits.

508
00:51:28,961 --> 00:51:31,881
Did you put it in, Alex?
- No, of course not.

509
00:51:32,340 --> 00:51:34,842
I think I'll leave you alone
to sort it out.

510
00:51:35,134 --> 00:51:38,262
You can quarrel in peace.
- We're not quarrelling.

511
00:51:54,112 --> 00:51:56,155
Are you still mad at me?

512
00:51:58,407 --> 00:52:01,077
Can you give this to Alex?

513
00:52:01,452 --> 00:52:03,329
What is it?
- Open it.

514
00:52:10,378 --> 00:52:12,380
It was years ago.

515
00:52:12,755 --> 00:52:15,967
Alex gave them to me. I thought...

516
00:52:16,759 --> 00:52:18,803
...he might want them back.

517
00:52:19,762 --> 00:52:21,889
Aram gave me this.

518
00:52:36,696 --> 00:52:38,614
Don't you want to see them?

519
00:53:18,279 --> 00:53:19,572
Who's that woman?

520
00:53:22,992 --> 00:53:25,369
She used to be our doctor.

521
00:53:27,872 --> 00:53:29,081
And the man?

522
00:53:34,045 --> 00:53:35,338
That's my father.

523
00:53:45,890 --> 00:53:48,809
Aram said you gave them to him.

524
00:53:55,691 --> 00:53:56,734
That's right.

525
00:54:01,113 --> 00:54:03,157
I followed my father.

526
00:54:05,368 --> 00:54:07,370
I thought something was going on.

527
00:54:12,708 --> 00:54:14,627
Did your mother know?

528
00:54:21,050 --> 00:54:21,968
No.

529
00:54:23,344 --> 00:54:25,096
We never told her.

530
00:54:28,474 --> 00:54:30,518
It would have broken her.

531
00:54:36,941 --> 00:54:38,901
How long did this go on?

532
00:54:45,825 --> 00:54:47,285
I don't remember exactly.

533
00:54:49,954 --> 00:54:52,123
At a certain point it was all over.

534
00:54:54,625 --> 00:54:56,502
She probably moved.

535
00:55:05,886 --> 00:55:08,681
You think Aram was involved?

536
00:55:15,438 --> 00:55:17,023
I don't know.

537
00:55:20,276 --> 00:55:21,402
A little to the left.

538
00:55:25,698 --> 00:55:27,533
It's still there.

539
00:55:27,825 --> 00:55:30,995
Stop taking pictures
and do something about it.

540
00:56:12,828 --> 00:56:14,497
Goodnight.

541
00:57:11,137 --> 00:57:12,930
Have you been awake long?

542
00:57:15,933 --> 00:57:17,226
All night.

543
00:57:20,729 --> 00:57:22,356
What's worrying you?

544
00:57:25,526 --> 00:57:26,485
Aram.

545
00:57:34,910 --> 00:57:36,745
I think he's creepy.

546
00:57:39,165 --> 00:57:40,833
He's changed.

547
00:57:42,585 --> 00:57:45,171
Why is he always barefoot?

548
00:57:47,214 --> 00:57:48,507
I don't know.

549
00:57:51,343 --> 00:57:53,345
Things used to be different.

550
00:57:53,679 --> 00:57:56,599
If I look in his eyes,
I can't feel anything anymore.

551
00:58:18,787 --> 00:58:22,583
...Yours is the kingdom, the power
and the glory, for ever and ever...

552
00:58:23,042 --> 00:58:24,043
...Amen.

553
00:58:29,006 --> 00:58:32,426
I'm pleased you behaved this time.

554
00:58:35,137 --> 00:58:36,680
There they are.

555
00:58:44,855 --> 00:58:46,065
Aram!

556
00:58:47,691 --> 00:58:48,901
Eugene!

557
00:58:55,032 --> 00:58:56,450
Isn't Wouter here?

558
00:58:58,244 --> 00:59:00,079
He didn't make it.

559
00:59:02,581 --> 00:59:05,584
Eugene doesn't like that, Aram.
You know that.

560
00:59:06,919 --> 00:59:07,962
I know.

561
00:59:08,879 --> 00:59:10,965
Where is the corpse?

562
00:59:16,136 --> 00:59:18,264
That isn't right, Aram.

563
00:59:19,390 --> 00:59:20,516
I know.

564
00:59:22,393 --> 00:59:25,062
That's not what we agreed.

565
00:59:25,354 --> 00:59:29,817
Just creep in,
take the things and go.

566
00:59:33,529 --> 00:59:36,031
That always worked out in the past.

567
00:59:36,323 --> 00:59:39,159
A man in my position
can't tolerate this.

568
00:59:43,122 --> 00:59:47,418
If I didn't have position, it would
be no problem. But I have a position.

569
00:59:48,711 --> 00:59:50,588
You certainly have one, Eugene.

570
00:59:50,879 --> 00:59:53,299
I shall never deny it.

571
00:59:53,966 --> 00:59:55,551
I understand.

572
00:59:56,468 --> 00:59:58,762
Piss on the grave, Esther.

573
00:59:59,930 --> 01:00:00,848
I say, Eugene.

574
01:00:01,140 --> 01:00:04,184
You say what?
You had enough to drink.

575
01:00:16,614 --> 01:00:19,491
Let this be a lesson to you, Aram.

576
01:00:21,493 --> 01:00:23,704
It certainly is, Eugene.

577
01:00:24,788 --> 01:00:29,001
I have a respectable business
and want to keep it that way.

578
01:00:34,131 --> 01:00:36,091
Now let's have a barbecue.

579
01:00:40,387 --> 01:00:41,597
We're going to have a barbecue.

580
01:00:42,348 --> 01:00:44,683
But we're just having dinner.
Delicious stew.

581
01:00:44,975 --> 01:00:47,936
With all due respect,
I thought something more festive.

582
01:00:48,228 --> 01:00:51,649
I have chickens in the car,
beef and wine.

583
01:00:51,940 --> 01:00:53,734
Let's have a good time.

584
01:00:54,902 --> 01:00:57,112
You'll have to change, Alex.

585
01:01:03,535 --> 01:01:05,496
Would you like some wine?
- Oh, please.

586
01:01:05,829 --> 01:01:07,873
I don't know if it's a good idea.

587
01:01:08,415 --> 01:01:11,794
What does Aram do for a living?
He's always so vague.

588
01:01:12,086 --> 01:01:15,964
Aram works for Eugene.
- Exactly. And usually very well.

589
01:01:28,560 --> 01:01:30,479
I'll take you to bed, Mum.

590
01:01:32,981 --> 01:01:35,651
You shouldn't drink too much wine.
It's not good for your stomach.

591
01:01:35,943 --> 01:01:38,696
Nothing wrong with my stomach.

592
01:01:39,697 --> 01:01:42,825
My mother died of a heart attack,
and her mother too.

593
01:01:43,117 --> 01:01:47,496
That doesn't mean you'll have problems.
You have a healthy heart.

594
01:01:48,038 --> 01:01:50,332
Thanks to the wine.

595
01:01:52,334 --> 01:01:53,585
Go to sleep.

596
01:01:58,465 --> 01:01:59,466
Alex?

597
01:02:00,884 --> 01:02:01,844
Yes?

598
01:02:04,054 --> 01:02:06,181
I'm glad you're here.

599
01:02:07,433 --> 01:02:09,309
Yes, so am I.

600
01:02:10,519 --> 01:02:14,690
Your father would be pleased
the garage is being used again.

601
01:02:16,650 --> 01:02:18,736
Yes, I miss him too.

602
01:02:21,613 --> 01:02:23,532
You're so like him.

603
01:02:25,784 --> 01:02:26,827
You think so?

604
01:02:27,661 --> 01:02:28,871
Come here.

605
01:02:35,085 --> 01:02:36,962
I'm so proud of you.

606
01:02:37,546 --> 01:02:39,256
I'm glad of that.

607
01:02:39,631 --> 01:02:41,592
Dad loved you a lot too.

608
01:02:47,681 --> 01:02:49,808
Your collar is wrong, Theo.

609
01:02:50,976 --> 01:02:52,728
I'm Alex.

610
01:03:02,696 --> 01:03:06,158
That took a long time.
- I had to take my mother to bed.

611
01:03:06,450 --> 01:03:07,868
I was going to look for you.

612
01:03:08,368 --> 01:03:11,789
Hide and seek!
- That's a good idea.

613
01:03:12,706 --> 01:03:15,918
Don't we have business to settle?
- Aram, you're too serious.

614
01:03:16,210 --> 01:03:19,087
The night is young.
Let's play hide and seek.

615
01:03:19,963 --> 01:03:22,132
Now?
- Yes, hide and seek.

616
01:03:22,424 --> 01:03:25,010
You know what it is?

617
01:03:27,721 --> 01:03:30,432
You can use the whole house.

618
01:03:36,897 --> 01:03:38,899
You have something of mine.

619
01:03:39,775 --> 01:03:41,109
It's outside.

620
01:03:53,372 --> 01:03:55,624
... 50! I'm coming!

621
01:04:03,799 --> 01:04:07,010
Is that you, Theo?
- It's me, Alex.

622
01:04:10,013 --> 01:04:13,267
I trust you, Aram.
- I know.

623
01:04:15,477 --> 01:04:19,398
I won't look in the box.
I know what's there.

624
01:04:21,775 --> 01:04:24,444
I wouldn't be insulted if you counted.

625
01:04:24,736 --> 01:04:27,906
I trust you too, Eugene.
- That's good.

626
01:04:31,827 --> 01:04:34,079
It's time to have a rest, Aram.

627
01:04:35,914 --> 01:04:38,417
I'm tired.
- I know.

628
01:05:03,358 --> 01:05:04,985
Found you.

629
01:05:05,277 --> 01:05:08,155
I thought you'd never find me here.

630
01:05:11,700 --> 01:05:13,785
I can't get down.

631
01:05:14,494 --> 01:05:17,039
Are you stuck?
- I think so.

632
01:05:21,126 --> 01:05:23,837
Do you still love me, Theo?

633
01:05:24,212 --> 01:05:26,131
I'm Alex, mum.

634
01:05:27,049 --> 01:05:28,550
Were you working late?

635
01:05:29,426 --> 01:05:31,678
We're playing hide and seek.

636
01:05:32,846 --> 01:05:36,600
Aren't you a bit old for that?

637
01:05:37,559 --> 01:05:38,810
You're sweet.

638
01:05:46,109 --> 01:05:47,778
Esther, let's go.

639
01:05:50,238 --> 01:05:53,158
Our mission is completed.
Say thanks to Aram.

640
01:05:53,533 --> 01:05:54,534
Thanks.

641
01:05:55,160 --> 01:05:58,497
You don't have to go.
Don't you want to stay?

642
01:05:58,789 --> 01:06:00,874
No, it's up to you now.

643
01:06:04,086 --> 01:06:07,714
You're my favourite employee, Aram.
- I'm glad of that.

644
01:06:12,886 --> 01:06:15,138
It's been such a long time, Theo.

645
01:06:16,056 --> 01:06:18,600
Mum, don't.

646
01:06:19,685 --> 01:06:23,480
What do you see in Alex?
- He's very kind to me.

647
01:06:23,772 --> 01:06:25,899
What you think about his brother?

648
01:06:26,441 --> 01:06:27,943
He's not bad.

649
01:06:28,944 --> 01:06:31,780
I'm going to look for Alex.
- Just call out loud.

650
01:06:32,072 --> 01:06:33,740
That'll wake your mother.

651
01:06:34,032 --> 01:06:36,785
Theo... Theo...

652
01:06:39,538 --> 01:06:41,415
Where could he be?

653
01:06:42,541 --> 01:06:44,584
Alex is good at hide and seek.

654
01:06:45,711 --> 01:06:47,212
Theo...

655
01:06:57,014 --> 01:06:58,807
Jesus Christ.

656
01:07:21,079 --> 01:07:23,081
I don't think this is normal.

657
01:07:28,170 --> 01:07:30,172
It's just like a slaughtered pig.

658
01:07:30,630 --> 01:07:32,340
But then without blood.

659
01:07:39,973 --> 01:07:41,975
I did First Aid.

660
01:08:07,751 --> 01:08:10,712
Sandra is a strange girl, Alex.

661
01:08:31,566 --> 01:08:33,110
I think she's better now.

662
01:09:38,550 --> 01:09:42,554
I'm sorry. I'm really sorry.

663
01:09:44,181 --> 01:09:46,641
You don't do things like that.
- Certainly not.

664
01:09:46,933 --> 01:09:48,685
I think I should be punished.

665
01:09:48,977 --> 01:09:52,814
No, just don't do it again.
- No, I have to be punished.

666
01:09:58,111 --> 01:10:00,280
One hard blow should be enough.

667
01:10:09,915 --> 01:10:11,082
Come on.

668
01:10:12,042 --> 01:10:13,877
One hard blow.

669
01:10:20,175 --> 01:10:22,052
Is that all?
- Yes.

670
01:10:24,679 --> 01:10:27,682
I got off lightly.
- Yes, I think so too.

671
01:10:28,850 --> 01:10:31,561
Failure is human,
forgiveness is divine.

672
01:10:31,853 --> 01:10:33,021
It's all right.

673
01:10:40,028 --> 01:10:43,448
It's nice and clean.
Do you understand greenfly?

674
01:10:45,200 --> 01:10:47,702
What do you mean?
- There isn't a single greenfly.

675
01:10:48,245 --> 01:10:51,665
But when it gets sick,
it'll be covered in greenfly.

676
01:10:52,374 --> 01:10:56,419
They can smell a sick plant?
- That's the nice bit.

677
01:10:56,836 --> 01:10:59,923
A strong plant is left alone,
a weak one is consumed.

678
01:11:00,799 --> 01:11:02,926
I understand that much
about the greenfly.

679
01:11:03,218 --> 01:11:05,804
So what don't you understand?
- Where are they now?

680
01:11:06,972 --> 01:11:11,017
They must be somewhere.
When it's sick, you see hundreds.

681
01:11:11,309 --> 01:11:13,770
Where do the greenfly come from?

682
01:11:14,813 --> 01:11:19,901
Have you never thought about that?
- No, not really.

683
01:11:20,986 --> 01:11:22,737
I have, boy.

684
01:11:24,030 --> 01:11:26,992
Maybe they warn
each other with walkie-talkies.

685
01:11:27,284 --> 01:11:30,829
Don't you take anything seriously?
Is everything a joke?

686
01:11:31,121 --> 01:11:35,208
Why so serious?
- Your jokes made father commit suicide.

687
01:11:36,376 --> 01:11:38,628
It was an accident.
- What do you know?

688
01:11:39,421 --> 01:11:42,299
The police said so.
- Don't always believe them.

689
01:11:44,467 --> 01:11:47,762
Why on earth should Dad kill himself?
- The man was unhappy.

690
01:11:48,179 --> 01:11:50,849
So am I.
- But you're a coward.

691
01:11:52,017 --> 01:11:53,268
A weakling.

692
01:11:53,893 --> 01:11:56,896
You'd rather be eaten by greenfly.

693
01:12:34,017 --> 01:12:35,977
Where were you this morning?

694
01:12:36,644 --> 01:12:38,646
You were sleeping so soundly.

695
01:12:40,357 --> 01:12:42,275
I got the fright of my life
when I woke up.

696
01:12:42,984 --> 01:12:44,402
Ah, you did?

697
01:12:48,281 --> 01:12:51,493
You're the one
with some explaining to do.

698
01:12:52,369 --> 01:12:55,288
If you mean last night,
that was nothing.

699
01:12:55,622 --> 01:12:57,374
My mother was confused.

700
01:12:58,041 --> 01:13:00,710
You want me to hurt her
in her last few months?

701
01:13:04,172 --> 01:13:06,257
You're mad at me,
aren't you?

702
01:13:07,926 --> 01:13:12,055
No, I just don't know how to cope.

703
01:13:17,519 --> 01:13:19,938
How long will you go on like this?

704
01:13:22,607 --> 01:13:23,650
Like what?

705
01:13:23,942 --> 01:13:27,737
When something happens,
you just stand there and watch.

706
01:13:34,411 --> 01:13:37,038
You can't replace your father.

707
01:13:39,165 --> 01:13:40,625
I'm not trying to.

708
01:13:42,419 --> 01:13:44,712
You do his work,
you wear his clothes.

709
01:14:12,615 --> 01:14:14,826
We have to leave here, Alex.

710
01:14:17,996 --> 01:14:22,083
You're thinking of your mother,
but Aram isn't good for you.

711
01:14:46,149 --> 01:14:47,442
I had a call.

712
01:14:49,444 --> 01:14:50,987
Who from?

713
01:14:51,279 --> 01:14:52,530
From a client.

714
01:14:54,324 --> 01:14:58,703
You not saying you're going to leave?
- No, Alex is staying a while.

715
01:15:00,038 --> 01:15:01,581
I'm afraid I have to go.

716
01:15:01,873 --> 01:15:04,667
You promised.
- What do you have to do?

717
01:15:05,710 --> 01:15:08,755
A job. Photography.
- Can't you do it here?

718
01:15:09,047 --> 01:15:12,467
No. I have to leave tomorrow.
- Don't stay away so long this time.

719
01:15:15,303 --> 01:15:19,474
You can't leave.
- I decide about my own life.

720
01:15:21,601 --> 01:15:23,603
Your life is mine too.

721
01:15:26,606 --> 01:15:29,150
We aren't finished, Alex.

722
01:15:30,235 --> 01:15:32,362
You know that as well as I do.

723
01:16:00,014 --> 01:16:01,933
Alex, we're leaving.

724
01:18:32,375 --> 01:18:33,668
It was your fault too, Alex.

725
01:18:38,715 --> 01:18:40,049
I didn't want it.
- Don't lie.

726
01:18:41,551 --> 01:18:43,970
Who produced those photos
of her and Dad?

727
01:18:45,221 --> 01:18:46,764
It was your idea.

728
01:18:47,056 --> 01:18:48,975
Are you so sure of that?

729
01:18:55,106 --> 01:18:57,442
I knew what you thought, Alex.

730
01:19:01,821 --> 01:19:03,614
I always knew what you thought.

731
01:19:07,034 --> 01:19:09,078
I didn't want it.
- Don't lie.

732
01:19:09,704 --> 01:19:13,040
I did what you wanted.
You were too scared.

733
01:19:17,628 --> 01:19:21,090
After that I didn't know
what you thought anymore.

734
01:19:26,471 --> 01:19:28,431
You're just as guilty as me, Alex.

735
01:19:32,977 --> 01:19:34,061
Say it.

736
01:19:38,065 --> 01:19:39,275
Say it!

737
01:19:42,195 --> 01:19:44,030
I'm just as guilty.

738
01:19:44,322 --> 01:19:45,615
Same with Dad's death.

739
01:19:46,199 --> 01:19:48,409
It was an accident.
- Really?

740
01:19:48,910 --> 01:19:51,662
Yes, you know that.
- It was suicide.

741
01:19:52,538 --> 01:19:54,499
You only say that to hurt me.

742
01:19:54,791 --> 01:19:56,501
It was suicide.
- Stop it.

743
01:19:56,793 --> 01:19:59,128
Dad did it because she was dead.
- I said stop it.

744
01:19:59,420 --> 01:20:02,048
You really think he was stupid enough
to drive into the water?

745
01:20:02,160 --> 01:20:04,880
Your father killed himself
because we made his life pointless.

746
01:20:05,176 --> 01:20:07,261
You're lying!

747
01:20:08,513 --> 01:20:10,681
You knew all along, Alex.

748
01:20:12,266 --> 01:20:15,603
You always thought so.
- You're lying...

749
01:20:16,646 --> 01:20:19,482
You're lying! You're lying!

750
01:20:24,028 --> 01:20:25,279
Maybe.

751
01:21:54,619 --> 01:21:57,038
I still wonder whether
it's high enough.

752
01:21:58,956 --> 01:22:00,082
Of course it is.

753
01:22:34,575 --> 01:22:35,618
I pushed.

754
01:22:38,663 --> 01:22:40,247
I can't do it.
