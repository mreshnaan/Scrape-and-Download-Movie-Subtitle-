HIDDEN DIARY

2
00:01:07,670 --> 00:01:09,172
Audrey!

3
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:21,587
Are you well?
Your mother couldn't come.

4
00:01:24,085 --> 00:01:26,290
- A pleasant journey?
- Yes.

5
00:01:29,558 --> 00:01:31,061
You look wonderful.

6
00:01:31,226 --> 00:01:33,863
Martine Laurencin
General practitioner

7
00:01:39,468 --> 00:01:40,536
- Everything ok?
- Fine.

8
00:01:40,703 --> 00:01:43,608
- Is Audrey here?
- Yes, she's out in the garden.

9
00:01:43,772 --> 00:01:45,509
What have you made for dinner?

10
00:01:45,674 --> 00:01:47,344
Hold on, l just finished work!

11
00:01:47,509 --> 00:01:49,947
- Ok, forget it.
- l'll go out.

12
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:53,952
l hurried things up.

13
00:01:55,017 --> 00:01:57,621
Had a good journey?
You must be tired.

14
00:01:57,787 --> 00:02:00,224
No, l slept on the plane.

15
00:02:00,389 --> 00:02:04,096
- Longer hair suits you.
- Thanks.

16
00:02:04,259 --> 00:02:05,895
He's a funny dog.

17
00:02:06,061 --> 00:02:07,931
Yes, he's young.

18
00:02:08,698 --> 00:02:11,102
l took your things up
to your room.

19
00:02:11,266 --> 00:02:12,669
Thank you.

20
00:02:18,708 --> 00:02:20,243
Here we are...

21
00:02:20,877 --> 00:02:23,315
lf you had told us

22
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:26,352
that you were coming
a little sooner

23
00:02:26,516 --> 00:02:28,419
we'd have taken time off.

24
00:02:28,585 --> 00:02:31,390
lt's a miracle
l managed to get away.

25
00:02:31,554 --> 00:02:33,491
But l have to work too.

26
00:02:33,656 --> 00:02:36,194
- To your visit!
- Can't you take 10 days off

27
00:02:36,359 --> 00:02:40,200
No, just before l lea,
they gave me a great project.

28
00:02:40,363 --> 00:02:42,934
l'd have cancelled.

29
00:02:43,099 --> 00:02:47,240
l didn't want to.
l wanted to see you.

30
00:02:51,174 --> 00:02:55,015
This is for you both.

31
00:03:06,089 --> 00:03:10,564
l don't take photos.
Your father can have it.

32
00:03:13,864 --> 00:03:15,499
ls it a digital one?

33
00:03:15,666 --> 00:03:20,307
Yes, it's very easy to use.
The definition is wonderful.

34
00:03:20,471 --> 00:03:22,474
l don't understand a word.

35
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:26,381
You could take photos
of the garden. It's beautiful.

36
00:03:26,544 --> 00:03:29,650
The garden's your mother.

37
00:03:31,715 --> 00:03:34,554
No, if you feed him,
we'll never get any peace.

38
00:03:34,718 --> 00:03:36,288
l can't believe that...

39
00:03:36,454 --> 00:03:37,789
That's enough!

40
00:03:39,256 --> 00:03:41,693
No, Tiger, come here!

41
00:03:41,859 --> 00:03:44,931
Michel, you could
try training him.

42
00:03:45,096 --> 00:03:47,768
We could have him put down too.

43
00:04:34,045 --> 00:04:36,683
- You can't sleep?
- No.

44
00:04:38,950 --> 00:04:42,324
- Want a sleeping pill?
- No thanks.

45
00:07:42,970 --> 00:07:44,539
Everything ok?

46
00:07:44,706 --> 00:07:47,310
l can't concentrate in my room.

47
00:07:47,474 --> 00:07:50,213
There's a lot of bronchitis about.

48
00:07:51,478 --> 00:07:55,052
l passed Grand dad's house earlier.
It's empty, isn't it?

49
00:07:55,216 --> 00:07:57,554
lt's uninhabitable.

50
00:07:58,453 --> 00:08:00,390
l can't get anything done here.

51
00:08:00,555 --> 00:08:01,990
You just got here!

52
00:08:02,156 --> 00:08:07,199
Relax for a couple of days,
then get back to your work.

53
00:08:08,763 --> 00:08:12,136
You always asked me
to go to Granddad's with you,

54
00:08:12,301 --> 00:08:16,175
as if to avoid being
alone with him.

55
00:08:19,607 --> 00:08:22,779
l took you
because he wanted to see you.

56
00:08:24,011 --> 00:08:26,816
He was fond of you.

57
00:08:26,982 --> 00:08:30,555
He always asked about you.
You know that.

58
00:08:32,254 --> 00:08:35,928
So he'd be happy to see me
in his house.

59
00:08:39,161 --> 00:08:41,198
l couldn't come to the funeral.

60
00:08:41,363 --> 00:08:43,533
l really couldn't get away

61
00:08:43,698 --> 00:08:46,905
and I’m sorry that l wasn't with you.

62
00:08:47,069 --> 00:08:49,741
I’ve worked a lot
these last for years. Sorry.

63
00:08:49,905 --> 00:08:51,507
This wasn't planned either.

64
00:08:51,673 --> 00:08:54,444
The engineer just found
a clever way

65
00:08:54,610 --> 00:08:56,279
to save even more water.

66
00:08:56,444 --> 00:08:59,884
lt's a really great project.
Sorry, but l need quiet.

67
00:09:00,048 --> 00:09:02,553
You sound like an old maid.

68
00:09:07,390 --> 00:09:09,393
Right, l'll get back to work.

69
00:09:11,326 --> 00:09:15,468
The keys are in the kitchen,
the ring with Tintin's rocket.

70
00:10:15,959 --> 00:10:18,129
- We'll deliver tomorrow.
- Thank you.

71
00:10:27,804 --> 00:10:30,041
You scared me!

72
00:10:31,342 --> 00:10:32,811
Aren't you working?

73
00:10:32,976 --> 00:10:35,581
Yes, but l close at seven.

74
00:10:35,745 --> 00:10:37,882
lt's already seven?

75
00:10:38,047 --> 00:10:40,252
l haven't stopped.

76
00:10:40,417 --> 00:10:42,387
l came to see
if you were comfortable.

77
00:10:42,552 --> 00:10:44,789
You don't waste time.

78
00:10:46,056 --> 00:10:48,493
- Want a coffee?
- No thanks.

79
00:10:49,527 --> 00:10:51,731
Will you have room to work?

80
00:10:51,896 --> 00:10:54,935
Are you making fun?

81
00:10:55,099 --> 00:10:59,474
No, I’m glad to see
someone living here.

82
00:11:00,437 --> 00:11:04,378
Even if l'd prefer to see you
staying with us.

83
00:11:07,244 --> 00:11:08,780
ls life good?

84
00:11:08,946 --> 00:11:11,050
Of course. Why?

85
00:11:11,649 --> 00:11:13,084
l don't know.

86
00:11:13,250 --> 00:11:17,391
You seem like
you want to avoid us.

87
00:11:17,556 --> 00:11:18,491
Got problems?

88
00:11:18,656 --> 00:11:22,029
Not at all.
l came here to see you, l swear.

89
00:11:22,192 --> 00:11:25,566
But l have to work too,
make phone calls at night...

90
00:11:25,729 --> 00:11:29,135
I’ve been in Toronto 10 years
and you've never been over.

91
00:11:29,300 --> 00:11:33,642
lf it were up to me,
we'd have come long ago.

92
00:11:33,804 --> 00:11:37,035
lf you insisted,
maybe she'd fly for once.

93
00:11:37,050 --> 00:11:40,800
No, l don't think so.

94
00:11:40,935 --> 00:11:46,322
Last year, l got us tickets
to go to Florence by train.

95
00:11:46,484 --> 00:11:48,187
At the last minute,

96
00:11:48,353 --> 00:11:51,292
l found her sitting next to
her bag, refusing to leave.

97
00:11:51,456 --> 00:11:53,226
With her father's illness,

98
00:11:53,391 --> 00:11:55,996
even going to Bordeaux
stressed her.

99
00:11:56,161 --> 00:11:59,433
Apart from work,
nothing interests her.

100
00:12:18,316 --> 00:12:21,055
- You can't leave it here!
- Suzanne...

101
00:12:21,219 --> 00:12:23,156
Don't shout.
It's a delivery for me.

102
00:12:23,321 --> 00:12:24,156
Hello. l won't take long.

103
00:12:24,322 --> 00:12:26,860
l couldn't have known.

104
00:12:27,025 --> 00:12:29,329
lt holds for you too, you know.

105
00:12:29,495 --> 00:12:32,667
Parking here
is strictly forbidden.

106
00:12:32,831 --> 00:12:34,066
All right.

107
00:12:37,470 --> 00:12:38,538
Mind out.

108
00:12:49,181 --> 00:12:54,291
This is no good at all.
There's no hook-up.

109
00:12:54,453 --> 00:12:56,490
The pipes need changing.

110
00:12:56,656 --> 00:12:58,926
The dish washer
was a bad idea then.

111
00:12:59,091 --> 00:13:02,130
lt'll take years to redo it,
right?

112
00:13:02,727 --> 00:13:04,831
lt's a day's work for a plumber.

113
00:13:04,997 --> 00:13:09,205
l could try to help out
but this needs a professional.

114
00:13:09,368 --> 00:13:11,405
Thank you. l'll manage.

115
00:13:11,570 --> 00:13:13,373
I’m sorry.

116
00:13:13,539 --> 00:13:14,707
Let's go.

117
00:14:10,863 --> 00:14:14,103
Roast pork with prunes

118
00:14:14,267 --> 00:14:20,545
A new school year

119
00:15:21,235 --> 00:15:26,044
Suzanne, thank you for the fruit.

120
00:15:28,743 --> 00:15:31,615
There's far too much of it for me.

121
00:15:33,281 --> 00:15:38,057
And l prefer to pick it
before the birds gorge on it.

122
00:15:38,219 --> 00:15:40,089
lf someone can use it...

123
00:15:40,254 --> 00:15:42,091
That's kind.

124
00:15:42,825 --> 00:15:45,563
You live in America, l hear?

125
00:15:45,727 --> 00:15:47,697
ln Canada.

126
00:15:47,862 --> 00:15:50,132
Quite a success.

127
00:15:50,932 --> 00:15:53,470
Do you want some sugar?

128
00:15:53,635 --> 00:15:55,371
No.

129
00:15:56,772 --> 00:15:59,276
lt's nice to have family photos.

130
00:15:59,441 --> 00:16:02,680
I’ve always liked them.

131
00:16:02,845 --> 00:16:04,982
My parents have taken very few

132
00:16:05,146 --> 00:16:09,355
and l think my grandfather
burnt his after his wife leave.

133
00:16:09,518 --> 00:16:11,889
l don't know what he did.

134
00:16:12,053 --> 00:16:14,691
You and Louise were neighbours.

135
00:16:14,857 --> 00:16:17,495
Maybe you didn't talk much?

136
00:16:17,659 --> 00:16:18,994
We'd say hello.

137
00:16:19,161 --> 00:16:21,932
No one's ever told me much
about her.

138
00:16:22,097 --> 00:16:23,666
All my mother told me

139
00:16:23,832 --> 00:16:27,639
is that she leave just after
a new kitchen was put in for her.

140
00:16:27,803 --> 00:16:31,978
That's possible.
He used to spoil her so much.

141
00:16:32,140 --> 00:16:34,310
He loved her, l think.

142
00:16:34,476 --> 00:16:37,014
Do you know why she leave?

143
00:16:37,179 --> 00:16:38,681
No.

144
00:16:38,848 --> 00:16:43,489
She certainly was rather distant.

145
00:16:43,652 --> 00:16:46,157
She was a beautiful woman.

146
00:16:49,157 --> 00:16:53,766
She came
from a very modest background

147
00:16:53,929 --> 00:16:58,571
and marrying your grandfather was
a wonderful opportunity for her.

148
00:16:58,735 --> 00:17:01,239
He'd make her outfits...

149
00:17:01,403 --> 00:17:02,639
You should have seen them.

150
00:17:03,439 --> 00:17:07,847
l often wondered
what could have become of her.

151
00:17:08,010 --> 00:17:11,684
lt was rare
to see someone leave like that.

152
00:17:18,888 --> 00:17:21,193
''The new kitchen has been made.

153
00:17:21,357 --> 00:17:24,296
''lf only he could understand me,

154
00:17:25,060 --> 00:17:28,634

of father bacon...

171
00:20:54,640 --> 00:21:02,655
A quarter pound of father bacon...

172
00:21:41,021 --> 00:21:43,258
Hello.

173
00:21:55,769 --> 00:21:57,439
Goodbye, doctor. Thank you.

174
00:22:02,409 --> 00:22:05,314
- l just wanted a quick word.
- Come in.

175
00:22:06,546 --> 00:22:08,616
- Are you well?
- Yes, very well.

176
00:22:08,782 --> 00:22:10,385
Just a second...

177
00:22:16,991 --> 00:22:20,263
l just told a woman she has cancer.

178
00:22:21,761 --> 00:22:26,070
And l have patients with nothing
who moan all day long.

179
00:22:26,234 --> 00:22:28,872
They're more depressing.

180
00:22:29,036 --> 00:22:31,941
They confide in you.
It's important for them.

181
00:22:32,830 --> 00:22:36,313
Sometimes l get tired
of all this misey.

182
00:22:37,111 --> 00:22:39,215
Have you managed to rest a little?

183
00:22:39,379 --> 00:22:40,815
A little.

184
00:22:40,982 --> 00:22:42,819
You look a bit off-colour.

185
00:22:42,984 --> 00:22:45,154
Yes, l worked late.

186
00:22:45,318 --> 00:22:46,988
ls it going well?

187
00:22:47,154 --> 00:22:49,759
Slowly.

188
00:22:51,525 --> 00:22:56,534
Your skin is blotchy.
Do you use sunscreen?

189
00:22:56,697 --> 00:22:58,132
Yes, always.

190
00:22:58,299 --> 00:23:02,507
At your age, you should be
more careful. Here.

191
00:23:02,670 --> 00:23:04,273
Thank you.

192
00:23:04,805 --> 00:23:06,475
Come to dinner tonight.

193
00:23:06,641 --> 00:23:09,213
Not tonight.
We're going to my brother's.

194
00:23:09,377 --> 00:23:12,349
l said you might come.
They'd like to see you.

195
00:23:12,513 --> 00:23:14,583
Why don't you all come over?

196
00:23:14,749 --> 00:23:18,756
The least l can do
is invite Gérard, right?

197
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:21,690
You're impossible...

198
00:23:24,259 --> 00:23:26,596
''Chop half pound of a liver

199
00:23:26,761 --> 00:23:29,433
''and a quarter pound
of bacon.''

200
00:23:37,072 --> 00:23:40,913
''Put the bacon and liver
in a lime boiling stock,

201
00:23:41,076 --> 00:23:43,313
''Boil it for 5 minutes.''

202
00:24:00,595 --> 00:24:04,536
''Chop neatly and place
the mixture in a mortar.''

203
00:24:06,835 --> 00:24:08,838
lt's us!

204
00:24:12,175 --> 00:24:14,279
Thank you.

205
00:24:15,911 --> 00:24:17,648
- You're alone?
- Mum's on the beach.

206
00:24:17,813 --> 00:24:19,183
- They're not here yet?
- No.

207
00:24:19,349 --> 00:24:20,651
They won't be long.

208
00:24:20,816 --> 00:24:22,653
l just put the duck in the oven.

209
00:24:22,818 --> 00:24:24,821
Duck...

210
00:24:27,823 --> 00:24:31,263
l found an old recipe book
that belonged to Louise.

211
00:24:31,426 --> 00:24:32,294
Really?

212
00:24:32,461 --> 00:24:37,972
lt's a sort of diay too.
Maybe l should give it to them.

213
00:24:38,134 --> 00:24:41,440
No, l don't think
that would be a good idea.

214
00:24:41,603 --> 00:24:45,544
Your grandfather's death
upset your mother

215
00:24:45,708 --> 00:24:49,615
and l don't think this is the time
to remind her of Louise.

216
00:24:53,583 --> 00:24:56,655
- How's the shop doing?
- Fine.

217
00:24:56,819 --> 00:24:59,190
lt's a pain when people buy

218
00:24:59,355 --> 00:25:01,760
more ugly pairs of specs
instead of one

219
00:25:01,924 --> 00:25:04,529
but l have loyal customers.

220
00:25:04,694 --> 00:25:07,499
Your friend Samira
came to see me today.

221
00:25:07,663 --> 00:25:10,100
Really?

222
00:25:10,266 --> 00:25:13,906
She has lovely daughters.

223
00:25:16,873 --> 00:25:18,243
Sorry.

224
00:25:46,136 --> 00:25:48,006
Audrey, don't move!

225
00:26:09,393 --> 00:26:10,796
lt's so beautiful!

226
00:26:10,961 --> 00:26:13,766
Hurry, we'll be late
for mass again!

227
00:26:14,998 --> 00:26:16,166
A photo!

228
00:26:16,333 --> 00:26:19,005
A photo, please!
Come on, children.

229
00:26:22,373 --> 00:26:23,675
Smile, Martine, please.

230
00:26:23,841 --> 00:26:26,111
Martine, please,
we haven't much time.

231
00:26:26,910 --> 00:26:28,346
Ok, let's go.

232
00:26:37,621 --> 00:26:39,558
That'll do, won't it?

233
00:26:41,192 --> 00:26:42,894
That smells so good!

234
00:26:43,962 --> 00:26:47,335
lt's a fairly old recipe.
Does it remind you of anything?

235
00:26:47,499 --> 00:26:49,035
No.

236
00:26:52,370 --> 00:26:55,042
What's this dishwasher?

237
00:26:55,206 --> 00:26:56,976
- It doesn't work?
- No.

238
00:26:57,141 --> 00:26:59,311
You messed the kitchen up
to put this in?

239
00:26:59,477 --> 00:27:02,516
The plumbing's rotten.
l can't hook it up.

240
00:27:02,680 --> 00:27:06,153
And you need a dishwasher
just for you?

241
00:27:06,317 --> 00:27:09,156
l wanted to improve the kitchen.

242
00:27:09,320 --> 00:27:11,257
The layout is perfect.

243
00:27:11,422 --> 00:27:13,727
lt just needs
some modern appliances.

244
00:27:14,592 --> 00:27:18,065
l don't want you
touching anything here.

245
00:27:26,671 --> 00:27:29,643
lt's a hand-embroidered cloth,
we can't use it.

246
00:27:29,807 --> 00:27:31,810
Want to hang it on a wall?

247
00:27:31,976 --> 00:27:34,715
Help me
instead of contradicting me.

248
00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:43,957
Martine, Cédric got his diploma.

249
00:27:44,123 --> 00:27:47,095
He had good marks.
The Grand Hotel has taken him on.

250
00:27:47,259 --> 00:27:48,761
Really?

251
00:27:59,405 --> 00:28:01,142
Tell me, Audrey...

252
00:28:01,307 --> 00:28:05,048
- Do you have someone?
- Me?

253
00:28:05,844 --> 00:28:07,714
No.

254
00:28:07,880 --> 00:28:10,451
A man or a woman
can blossom alone.

255
00:28:10,615 --> 00:28:11,350
Nonsense.

256
00:28:11,517 --> 00:28:16,326
You know, Audrey,
l met my wife

257
00:28:16,488 --> 00:28:18,158
at the age of 40.

258
00:28:18,324 --> 00:28:20,327
For years l drifted
from one affair to another

259
00:28:20,492 --> 00:28:23,197
until the right person came along...

260
00:28:24,497 --> 00:28:27,134
And she's the right person!

261
00:28:27,299 --> 00:28:30,071
Until the day you're ready,
when desire wins.

262
00:28:30,235 --> 00:28:32,138
l'd had my eye on him for years.

263
00:28:32,304 --> 00:28:34,509
But he was so way of women.

264
00:28:34,673 --> 00:28:38,246
His mother abandoning him
didn't help.

265
00:28:40,280 --> 00:28:42,450
Let's finish setting the table.

266
00:28:42,616 --> 00:28:44,786
She was brave to leave like that.

267
00:28:44,950 --> 00:28:48,757
lt was a real scandal.

268
00:28:48,921 --> 00:28:51,693
Our mother didn't agree
because she was heartless,

269
00:28:51,857 --> 00:28:53,660
not to be free.

270
00:28:53,826 --> 00:28:57,466
A mother doesn’t just abandon her kids.
She has to be crazy.

271
00:28:57,631 --> 00:28:59,701
l think she love for a man.

272
00:28:59,865 --> 00:29:01,568
lt devastated her husband.

273
00:29:01,734 --> 00:29:05,308
You didn't get over it back then.

274
00:29:05,472 --> 00:29:07,375
Maybe.

275
00:29:07,540 --> 00:29:09,343
lt's delicious.

276
00:29:09,509 --> 00:29:11,746
lt's duck 'a la paulus'.

277
00:29:11,911 --> 00:29:15,350
Here's to Audrey...

278
00:29:16,483 --> 00:29:17,986
for coming to see us.

279
00:29:18,151 --> 00:29:18,785
Thank you.

280
00:29:18,952 --> 00:29:23,761
Here's to you
and to freedom for women...

281
00:29:24,824 --> 00:29:26,727
And to Paulus!

282
00:29:28,061 --> 00:29:31,300
We can talk normally at this table
for once.

283
00:29:31,464 --> 00:29:34,336
As kids, we weren't
allowed to say a word.

284
00:29:34,502 --> 00:29:36,037
Could you at least
respect Dad's memory

285
00:29:36,202 --> 00:29:38,640
in his own home?

286
00:29:38,805 --> 00:29:40,942
Say what you like elsewhere.

287
00:29:41,107 --> 00:29:45,683
He's not doing anything, Martine,
he's not saying anything.

288
00:29:46,380 --> 00:29:49,184
Do you like the Grand Hotel,
Cédric?

289
00:29:49,350 --> 00:29:50,452
Yeah.

290
00:29:50,618 --> 00:29:54,492
Yes, congratulations.

291
00:29:54,655 --> 00:29:57,360
His money helped set up
your restaurant.

292
00:29:57,525 --> 00:29:59,095
Admit that at least.

293
00:29:59,260 --> 00:30:00,161
Cut it out, Martine,

294
00:30:00,327 --> 00:30:03,433
it wasn't easy
accepting that money.

295
00:30:03,597 --> 00:30:06,736
l only took it because the bank
refused our loan.

296
00:30:06,900 --> 00:30:08,703
He ended up giving me
a little cash.

297
00:30:08,868 --> 00:30:10,404
l was almost 40 then.

298
00:30:10,571 --> 00:30:11,839
l don't hassle you
about the house.

299
00:30:12,006 --> 00:30:14,543
lt's good Audrey's here.

300
00:30:15,109 --> 00:30:16,946
No one uses it otherwise.

301
00:30:17,111 --> 00:30:20,350
lf it's empty year round,
it will deteriorate.

302
00:30:20,514 --> 00:30:22,551
We agreed we wouldn't sell it.

303
00:30:22,717 --> 00:30:26,391
Maybe we could decide
to do it up and rent it out.

304
00:30:26,554 --> 00:30:27,957
Yes, it needs a little work.

305
00:30:28,122 --> 00:30:29,357
Who can afford it?

306
00:30:29,523 --> 00:30:32,295
We can always sell the furniture.

307
00:30:32,460 --> 00:30:36,936
l'd rather sell the house instead!

308
00:30:37,098 --> 00:30:38,734
Whatever, l don't care.

309
00:30:38,899 --> 00:30:40,836
That's settled then.

310
00:30:43,638 --> 00:30:46,577
More duck, anyone?

311
00:30:46,742 --> 00:30:50,416
Cédric, you could
bring friends here this summer.

312
00:30:50,579 --> 00:30:52,816
And enjoy all night!

313
00:30:56,618 --> 00:30:59,690
Sorry, l have a headache.
I’m going home.

314
00:30:59,854 --> 00:31:01,691
Martine, listen...

315
00:31:09,531 --> 00:31:11,568
Darling...

316
00:31:12,334 --> 00:31:13,836
Mum, you can’t just leave.

317
00:31:14,002 --> 00:31:17,541
Enough. You're starting
to get on my nerves!

318
00:31:41,631 --> 00:31:43,735
lt's delicious, Louise.

319
00:31:48,538 --> 00:31:50,975
Too bad you don't cook more oAen.

320
00:32:24,774 --> 00:32:28,581
He won't let me help at the shop.
He won't let me work.

321
00:32:28,744 --> 00:32:31,015
Soon, he won't let me speak.

322
00:32:34,884 --> 00:32:37,255
These models are lovely. Look.

323
00:32:40,256 --> 00:32:43,295
This suit is gorgeous, isn't it?

324
00:32:46,162 --> 00:32:48,132
Use it as inspiration.

325
00:32:48,297 --> 00:32:50,267
You know what l'd like, Gilles?

326
00:32:50,433 --> 00:32:51,936
To help at the shop,

327
00:32:52,101 --> 00:32:55,440
I work behind the counter
receive the customers,

328
00:32:55,606 --> 00:32:58,110
choose the fabrics with you...

329
00:32:58,274 --> 00:33:01,380
Many couples run shops.

330
00:33:09,085 --> 00:33:11,790
l'll make this model for you.

331
00:33:25,502 --> 00:33:27,105
l hear that in big cities,

332
00:33:27,271 --> 00:33:29,274
a woman doesn’t always need

333
00:33:29,439 --> 00:33:32,178
her husband's perminion to work.

334
00:33:37,916 --> 00:33:39,318
Thank you.

335
00:33:44,054 --> 00:33:45,556
You've lost weight.

336
00:33:48,492 --> 00:33:50,062
Forgive me.

337
00:33:55,800 --> 00:33:57,670
Still no kids yet?

338
00:33:57,835 --> 00:34:00,005
No.

339
00:34:00,170 --> 00:34:04,211
This world's too harsh.
I’m not brave enough.

340
00:34:04,374 --> 00:34:06,679
Are you afraid of
being alone later?

341
00:34:06,844 --> 00:34:09,415
No, I’ve never thought of that.

342
00:34:10,147 --> 00:34:12,351
l hadn't thought of it either.

343
00:34:12,517 --> 00:34:14,621
But after Paul went away,

344
00:34:14,786 --> 00:34:18,527
l realized that l had my daughters
and they had me

345
00:34:18,690 --> 00:34:21,027
and that we were strong together.

346
00:34:21,191 --> 00:34:22,627
lt's silly.

347
00:34:22,794 --> 00:34:24,697
No, l understand.

348
00:34:29,567 --> 00:34:31,904
I’m pregnant.

349
00:34:34,939 --> 00:34:38,746
I’m mo months gone.
I’m totally lost.

350
00:34:38,910 --> 00:34:42,117
Only natural.
It's such a weird condition.

351
00:34:42,280 --> 00:34:44,183
But once the baby's there,

352
00:34:44,349 --> 00:34:46,753
you'll wonder
why you waited so long.

353
00:34:46,919 --> 00:34:49,089
Personally,

354
00:34:49,253 --> 00:34:52,125
l'd have had more
if my man hadn't walked out.

355
00:34:52,290 --> 00:34:54,160
l wish l could be that simple.

356
00:34:54,325 --> 00:34:56,395
First off, I’m not simple.

357
00:34:56,561 --> 00:34:58,899
And why is it
more complicated for you?

358
00:34:59,063 --> 00:35:02,068
Without my work, I’m lost.

359
00:35:02,233 --> 00:35:04,470
I’m horribly self-centered.

360
00:35:06,972 --> 00:35:08,307
And the father?

361
00:35:08,473 --> 00:35:11,111
We're not together.
He's just a friend..

362
00:35:11,275 --> 00:35:13,680
- Is he married?
- No.

363
00:35:14,613 --> 00:35:17,117
To be honest,
I’m not made for this.

364
00:35:17,281 --> 00:35:19,251
And neither is he.

365
00:35:20,953 --> 00:35:25,027
''Night is too short.
And what if l abandoned it''

366
00:35:25,189 --> 00:35:27,961
''This sniveling baby''

367
00:35:28,126 --> 00:35:31,900
A Japanese poem l came across
just before leaving.

368
00:35:32,063 --> 00:35:35,670
lt gets easier
after the first months.

369
00:35:35,834 --> 00:35:38,406
We're hungry, Mum, we're going.

370
00:35:38,570 --> 00:35:41,142
All right,
give me a minute or mo.

371
00:35:44,309 --> 00:35:46,413
They're waiting.

372
00:35:48,313 --> 00:35:50,517
Keep in touch.

373
00:35:56,923 --> 00:35:59,294
Got all your things?

374
00:36:14,674 --> 00:36:16,878
l'd like Martine to study,

375
00:36:17,043 --> 00:36:20,282
to get an education.

376
00:36:23,083 --> 00:36:27,926
She has to learn.
She’s so stubborn, she can succeed.

377
00:36:32,058 --> 00:36:34,463
I'd like her to be me.''

378
00:36:36,463 --> 00:36:41,306
Women have always worked
in my family, even for a pimance,

379
00:37:04,024 --> 00:37:05,726
ls that Dad's dress?

380
00:37:05,893 --> 00:37:08,163
Yes. So?

381
00:37:08,328 --> 00:37:10,565
You don't wear it to the beach.

382
00:37:11,397 --> 00:37:13,334
You don't know anything.

383
00:37:15,635 --> 00:37:16,536
You're mad!

384
00:37:16,704 --> 00:37:19,275
Don't talk to your mother
like that!

385
00:37:19,974 --> 00:37:21,777
You hurt me.

386
00:37:47,835 --> 00:37:49,872
You have such a character...

387
00:37:50,037 --> 00:37:52,509
A character like that
will take you far.

388
00:37:52,673 --> 00:37:54,643
What does that mean?

389
00:37:54,808 --> 00:37:58,448
You can study, work,
fulfill yourself. It's important.

390
00:37:58,612 --> 00:38:01,484
You have to study, Martine.

391
00:38:01,649 --> 00:38:05,523
You too, Gérard,
but it's easier for boys.

392
00:38:06,420 --> 00:38:08,423
You're a good student.

393
00:38:08,589 --> 00:38:11,728
You have to carry on like that.

394
00:38:11,825 --> 00:38:13,628
You promise?

395
00:38:13,794 --> 00:38:15,364
Yes.

396
00:38:36,985 --> 00:38:39,690
People are so disgusting.

397
00:38:41,656 --> 00:38:43,358
A few weeks back

398
00:38:43,525 --> 00:38:47,866
l found a pair of bride.
Can you believe it?

399
00:38:48,029 --> 00:38:51,068
Come in for coffee. l have decaf.

400
00:39:06,448 --> 00:39:09,420
Back when she was around,

401
00:39:09,584 --> 00:39:13,758
l never had much opportunity
to come in here.

402
00:39:16,192 --> 00:39:18,262
That's right.

403
00:39:18,426 --> 00:39:21,900
She had a camera.

404
00:39:22,064 --> 00:39:26,305
She had even decided
she wanted to be an assistant

405
00:39:26,468 --> 00:39:30,743
to Mr. Lebedel, the photographer.

406
00:39:30,906 --> 00:39:34,345
The fuss that caused!

407
00:39:34,944 --> 00:39:37,883
She had an affair, you mean?

408
00:39:40,783 --> 00:39:44,322
She spent a lot of time there
but no one really knew.

409
00:39:45,988 --> 00:39:48,993
But people talked.

410
00:39:49,158 --> 00:39:50,895
First, it was photography,

411
00:39:51,060 --> 00:39:54,867
then English lessons...

412
00:39:56,999 --> 00:40:01,308
A woman like that
is a real plague...

413
00:40:02,605 --> 00:40:04,976
She was learning English?

414
00:40:05,141 --> 00:40:07,246
l think so.

415
00:40:07,810 --> 00:40:11,684
She went by bus. That wasn't done.

416
00:40:11,847 --> 00:40:14,619
Can you say,
''He's gone for a walk''?

417
00:40:14,784 --> 00:40:16,254
Of course.

418
00:40:26,595 --> 00:40:27,663
You can't say it!

419
00:40:27,830 --> 00:40:29,833
- l can.
- You can't.

420
00:40:31,001 --> 00:40:33,038
That's not the right word.

421
00:40:33,203 --> 00:40:35,006
You can't say it.

422
00:40:40,643 --> 00:40:42,480
l'd like a word.

423
00:40:57,260 --> 00:41:00,366
l can't let you go
to your lessons by bus.

424
00:41:02,666 --> 00:41:04,569
You don't trust me?

425
00:41:05,370 --> 00:41:06,705
l do.

426
00:41:06,870 --> 00:41:10,142
But my customers gossip.

427
00:41:10,308 --> 00:41:12,445
They're real chatter boxes.

428
00:41:14,044 --> 00:41:17,985
l can't lose custom
because of your English lessons.

429
00:41:18,148 --> 00:41:19,818
l just can't.

430
00:41:20,884 --> 00:41:22,654
l understand.

431
00:41:36,033 --> 00:41:38,237
You didn't continue?

432
00:41:38,403 --> 00:41:40,206
No.

433
00:41:41,772 --> 00:41:44,879
l took up photography,
more or less by chance.

434
00:41:50,915 --> 00:41:52,417
lt's for my husband.

435
00:41:52,582 --> 00:41:54,552
He wants a photo for his shop.

436
00:41:54,719 --> 00:41:56,288
l can see why.

437
00:41:56,453 --> 00:41:59,458
lt's hard being away from
a pretty wife.

438
00:42:12,470 --> 00:42:14,139
ls a camera like this expensive?

439
00:42:14,305 --> 00:42:16,410
Yes, fairly expensive.

440
00:42:18,109 --> 00:42:20,380
But l can lend you one
if you want.

441
00:42:20,545 --> 00:42:24,486
l could never accept.

442
00:42:24,649 --> 00:42:27,521
l can even teach you the basics.

443
00:43:50,636 --> 00:43:52,373
The look on your face...

444
00:44:03,649 --> 00:44:05,954
lt was a big funeral.

445
00:44:06,119 --> 00:44:07,822
He was very popular.

446
00:44:07,987 --> 00:44:10,091
He was a good tailor.

447
00:44:12,492 --> 00:44:14,630
This plant matches the stone.

448
00:44:14,794 --> 00:44:17,064
We chose pink granite.

449
00:44:17,230 --> 00:44:18,700
lt's brighter than black.

450
00:44:18,865 --> 00:44:20,835
Yes, it's more colourful.

451
00:44:24,203 --> 00:44:25,973
What's wrong?

452
00:44:27,840 --> 00:44:29,643
lt's the heat.

453
00:44:43,656 --> 00:44:46,728
Have you called a plumber
about the dishwasher?

454
00:44:46,893 --> 00:44:49,965
A plumber, you mean.

455
00:44:50,130 --> 00:44:51,966
He's busy until next week.

456
00:44:52,132 --> 00:44:55,271
That's the problem.
Everything's so complicated.

457
00:44:55,436 --> 00:44:57,306
And they complain about the Poles!

458
00:44:57,471 --> 00:44:59,675
What Poles?

459
00:45:01,342 --> 00:45:05,416
lt's funny, this old love of yours
for kitchen things.

460
00:45:05,579 --> 00:45:09,854
You always said technical progress
had helped to liberate women.

461
00:45:12,086 --> 00:45:14,791
You had
all the housewife's paraphernalia.

462
00:45:15,789 --> 00:45:18,293
You used to call it your dowry.

463
00:45:18,392 --> 00:45:21,097
l may have it
stored away somewhere.

464
00:45:25,532 --> 00:45:28,572
When Granddad died,
did Louise get in touch?

465
00:45:28,736 --> 00:45:30,405
What are you saying?

466
00:45:30,572 --> 00:45:31,172
Hold on.

467
00:45:31,338 --> 00:45:35,413
We'll put them on this.
It's handier.

468
00:45:36,511 --> 00:45:38,046
She could have...

469
00:45:38,212 --> 00:45:39,949
What?

470
00:45:40,114 --> 00:45:42,051
Come back.

471
00:45:42,216 --> 00:45:44,521
That's absurd!

472
00:45:54,396 --> 00:45:57,033
Didn't you find anything
in the house?

473
00:45:59,167 --> 00:46:03,141
Your grandfather threw
her things out when she lea.

474
00:46:03,304 --> 00:46:07,445
Audrey, you're annoying me.
Why bring this up again?

475
00:46:13,581 --> 00:46:14,917
Thanks.

476
00:46:21,322 --> 00:46:23,727
I’ve found an exercise book,

477
00:46:23,892 --> 00:46:25,996
with rough copies of letters

478
00:46:26,161 --> 00:46:28,331
and things she wrote
about herself,

479
00:46:28,496 --> 00:46:31,201
about you, about her life...

480
00:46:31,366 --> 00:46:32,569
Really?

481
00:46:32,734 --> 00:46:34,737
- Do you want to see it?
- No.

482
00:46:34,903 --> 00:46:36,238
You're not interested?

483
00:46:36,404 --> 00:46:39,744
No, but l think Evelyne will love it.

484
00:46:40,676 --> 00:46:44,517
l found it in the kitchen,
behind a dresser.

485
00:46:44,680 --> 00:46:48,621
She wasn't as insensitive
as you think.

486
00:46:48,783 --> 00:46:52,757
l don't care. She lea.
It's not my problem now.

487
00:46:53,689 --> 00:46:57,162
ls that why you're at the house?
To nose around...

488
00:46:57,326 --> 00:47:00,732
You should look to the future.
At this rate,

489
00:47:00,895 --> 00:47:04,402
you'll end up alone and that
really upsets me, you know.

490
00:47:08,437 --> 00:47:11,342
l came across it by chance.

491
00:47:11,507 --> 00:47:13,444
You can spend your life
Looking back.

492
00:47:13,609 --> 00:47:16,314
Time stretches out to infinity...

493
00:47:17,580 --> 00:47:19,650
What will it get you?

494
00:47:22,885 --> 00:47:26,859
- Are you still in therapy?
- No.

495
00:47:27,623 --> 00:47:30,362
You're making progress.
That's good.

496
00:47:30,526 --> 00:47:32,864
l'll start again after this.

497
00:47:34,597 --> 00:47:38,706
To go and cy some more
about your wicked mother

498
00:47:38,868 --> 00:47:42,374
who preferred her patients
to her daughter?

499
00:47:43,806 --> 00:47:45,943
You enjoy that?

500
00:47:46,108 --> 00:47:48,445
Wallowing in misery...

501
00:47:48,612 --> 00:47:51,083
Why do you attack me?
It's unbearable.

502
00:47:51,247 --> 00:47:54,387
You're the one
always looking for a flight!

503
00:47:54,551 --> 00:47:57,690
l can see you can't stand me.
I’m not blind!

504
00:47:57,853 --> 00:48:02,562
lt's not that, Mum, but it's tiring
being unable to talk normally.

505
00:48:03,493 --> 00:48:06,999
l come home and l can tell
everything's a problem.

506
00:48:07,163 --> 00:48:09,368
Being in the house annoys you!

507
00:48:09,533 --> 00:48:12,705
lf l buy stuff to make you happy,
that annoys you!

508
00:48:12,868 --> 00:48:15,306
Dinner annoys you,
even the table cloth!

509
00:48:15,472 --> 00:48:17,943
Everything! It's all wrong!

510
00:48:18,275 --> 00:48:21,347
l cross half the world to see you
but you're still as hard

511
00:48:21,444 --> 00:48:24,550
and authoritarian.
It's a real pain!

512
00:48:24,681 --> 00:48:27,787
You're incredible!

513
00:48:27,951 --> 00:48:30,789
l can't believe I’m hearing this
from a daughter who abandoned me.

514
00:48:30,954 --> 00:48:32,189
You're insane!

515
00:48:32,355 --> 00:48:34,692
No wonder you're alone.
Who'd put up with you?

516
00:48:34,858 --> 00:48:38,966
Okay, I’m going.
l think it's for the best.

517
00:48:41,766 --> 00:48:44,504
We've never got along anyway.

518
00:48:44,669 --> 00:48:48,943
You've always held me responsible
always blamed me!

519
00:48:54,244 --> 00:48:57,183
lt wasn't easy moving so far away.

520
00:48:57,347 --> 00:49:01,589
lt was an opportunity.
l took it and l don't regret it.

521
00:49:01,752 --> 00:49:05,024
You didn't decide my life.
It doesn't revolve around you.

522
00:49:05,188 --> 00:49:08,127
Your mother leaved
because her life was killing her.

523
00:49:08,292 --> 00:49:10,028
Not because of you.

524
00:49:10,193 --> 00:49:12,831
Guilt is just a human emotion.

525
00:49:12,996 --> 00:49:14,699
l don't consider you guilty.

526
00:49:14,866 --> 00:49:18,940
l feel guilty too but
you've never given me any choice.

527
00:49:45,196 --> 00:49:46,832
The same again?

528
00:49:46,998 --> 00:49:48,266
No, thank you.

529
00:49:48,432 --> 00:49:52,641
Could you pay then?
I’m finishing my shier.

530
00:49:52,804 --> 00:49:54,306
Yes, of course.

531
00:50:02,280 --> 00:50:03,616
Thank you.

532
00:50:11,890 --> 00:50:13,727
What are you looking for?

533
00:50:13,892 --> 00:50:14,960
A dress for Mum.

534
00:50:15,126 --> 00:50:17,431
l haven't seen her for a while.

535
00:50:17,596 --> 00:50:20,535
l don't really know
what she'd like.

536
00:50:20,699 --> 00:50:23,571
This one's different.
It would suit her.

537
00:50:23,735 --> 00:50:26,907
You think so?
With the Eiffel Tower...

538
00:50:27,071 --> 00:50:28,908
She hates big cities.

539
00:50:29,541 --> 00:50:31,578
She never likes my gift anyway.

540
00:50:31,743 --> 00:50:34,381
So treat yourself instead.

541
00:50:34,546 --> 00:50:38,620
l'd like to make her happy one day.
l don't want to get it wrong.

542
00:50:38,784 --> 00:50:40,587
lt's beautiful.

543
00:50:44,723 --> 00:50:47,028
Do you have any looser clothes

544
00:50:47,192 --> 00:50:49,931
that a pregnant woman could wear?

545
00:50:52,431 --> 00:50:54,234
Here, try this.

546
00:50:54,399 --> 00:50:55,735
Thanks.

547
00:51:01,073 --> 00:51:04,680
Even as a girl,
it was hard making her happy.

548
00:51:04,844 --> 00:51:07,950
She was sad to see me unhappy
and its didn't help.

549
00:51:10,516 --> 00:51:12,051
Why didn't you come back?

550
00:51:12,217 --> 00:51:14,789
To cancelled it all out
to start a new?

551
00:51:14,954 --> 00:51:17,325
No, forgetting was impossible.

552
00:51:17,490 --> 00:51:20,429
But staying wasn't possible either.

553
00:51:20,593 --> 00:51:22,897
Your mother never forgave me.

554
00:51:23,061 --> 00:51:24,697
l think l'd have to leave too.

555
00:51:24,864 --> 00:51:27,936
l tried to reason with myself.

556
00:51:28,100 --> 00:51:30,738
You don't need to flee.

557
00:51:30,903 --> 00:51:32,239
You're free.

558
00:51:32,405 --> 00:51:35,344
Me? It's different for me.

559
00:51:35,508 --> 00:51:37,345
I’m scared.

560
00:51:41,748 --> 00:51:44,353
l'll just take the dress.

561
00:51:44,517 --> 00:51:46,287
Are you ok, Audrey?

562
00:51:46,452 --> 00:51:48,556
l feel a bit weird.

563
00:51:51,057 --> 00:51:54,496
You have a really pretty shop.

564
00:51:54,660 --> 00:51:57,766
No one tells me
what to put in my window.

565
00:51:58,498 --> 00:52:02,305
l work with young designers,
l try to support them

566
00:52:02,468 --> 00:52:04,973
and there's a market for it.

567
00:52:05,138 --> 00:52:06,607
The prices are the problem.

568
00:52:06,774 --> 00:52:09,378
We can't compete with
the chain stores.

569
00:52:09,542 --> 00:52:11,914
My grandfather
thought like that too.

570
00:52:12,078 --> 00:52:16,152
He tried to resist ready-to-wear,
he worked all the time...

571
00:52:19,787 --> 00:52:21,389
Hi.

572
00:52:22,155 --> 00:52:23,257
How are you?

573
00:52:23,423 --> 00:52:25,226
Great, thanks.

574
00:52:25,391 --> 00:52:26,794
Who's that?

575
00:52:26,960 --> 00:52:30,334
A sort of cousin.
She lives in America.

576
00:52:30,497 --> 00:52:32,300
How do you mean, sort opt

577
00:52:32,466 --> 00:52:34,870
She's Gérard's sister's daughter.

578
00:52:35,035 --> 00:52:39,844
She's loaded but she's still single.
She's kind of weird.

579
00:52:40,808 --> 00:52:42,611
She's a beautiful woman anyhow.

580
00:52:45,646 --> 00:52:47,349
Have a good evening.

581
00:57:58,163 --> 00:58:00,200
The look on your faces!

582
00:58:03,001 --> 00:58:05,639
There was no letter when she leave?

583
00:58:06,438 --> 00:58:08,207
No.

584
00:58:08,974 --> 00:58:11,813
- Can l keep this?
- Of course.

585
00:58:16,548 --> 00:58:17,716
What is it?

586
00:58:17,883 --> 00:58:20,688
Old recipes...

587
00:58:20,852 --> 00:58:22,020
ls Martine ok?

588
00:58:22,188 --> 00:58:24,024
Yes, l think so.

589
00:58:24,190 --> 00:58:25,959
Your mother's so tough.

590
00:58:26,125 --> 00:58:29,464
She chills my blood.
But l hear she's a good doctor...

591
00:58:29,628 --> 00:58:31,198
Yes.

592
00:58:42,808 --> 00:58:45,613
- Can l keep it?
- l just said you could.

593
01:03:05,408 --> 01:03:09,516
lf only l could do something
to make my children proud.

594
01:03:11,880 --> 01:03:14,987
I like to know, like those women
whose books l read.

595
01:03:15,151 --> 01:03:17,255
They're intelligent
and independent.

596
01:03:17,420 --> 01:03:21,896
My life is at home,
I’m not even a good housewife.

597
01:03:25,695 --> 01:03:27,565
Other women seem happy.

598
01:03:27,732 --> 01:03:29,969
They smile in any case,

599
01:03:33,470 --> 01:03:36,409
Gérard has grown a lot lately.

600
01:03:36,573 --> 01:03:38,476
Martine too.

601
01:03:41,645 --> 01:03:45,084
My daughter is as reactionary
as the others.

602
01:03:45,248 --> 01:03:47,920
She judges me and hates me,

603
01:03:48,084 --> 01:03:51,424
Me-too, end up hating her.

604
01:03:51,589 --> 01:03:54,226
She defends her father against me,

605
01:04:43,474 --> 01:04:46,012
My loves, I’m leaving this house,

606
01:04:46,177 --> 01:04:48,347
l feel so bad.

607
01:04:48,512 --> 01:04:50,950
My darling children,

608
01:04:51,115 --> 01:04:53,553
I’m going away for a while

609
01:04:53,718 --> 01:04:55,655
to try to find a new life

610
01:04:55,821 --> 01:05:01,399
where we will be happy at last.

611
01:05:08,232 --> 01:05:10,403
l would like some tomatoes.

612
01:05:29,887 --> 01:05:31,257
These aren't bad.

613
01:05:31,423 --> 01:05:38,236
The trouble starts when you
hesitate bemeen mo pairs.

614
01:05:39,431 --> 01:05:41,468
Sorry.

615
01:05:41,633 --> 01:05:43,069
That's right. Unless...

616
01:05:43,235 --> 01:05:44,771
l think these are ideal for you.

617
01:05:44,936 --> 01:05:49,712
Try them on again.
They're both serious and playful.

618
01:05:49,876 --> 01:05:52,413
intelligent glasses.

619
01:05:55,547 --> 01:05:57,618
I’m not saying she has an excuse

620
01:05:57,783 --> 01:05:59,620
but you're being a pain too.

621
01:05:59,785 --> 01:06:02,757
Why? Is tying to find out wrong?

622
01:06:02,921 --> 01:06:06,795
Her mother walked out
50 years ago. What of it?

623
01:06:06,958 --> 01:06:08,494
Why pester her?

624
01:06:08,661 --> 01:06:10,664
I’m sure she knows stuff.

625
01:06:10,830 --> 01:06:14,304
Why are you so obsessed by Louise?

626
01:06:14,467 --> 01:06:18,040
Because she was a mother
yet leave anyway?

627
01:06:18,203 --> 01:06:20,441
So you think your mother

628
01:06:20,606 --> 01:06:25,983
hasn't been maternal enough
and so on...

629
01:06:26,545 --> 01:06:29,851
You're starting to piss me off
with all this.

630
01:06:30,616 --> 01:06:32,018
Because...

631
01:06:32,184 --> 01:06:34,922
if her father had leave,

632
01:06:35,087 --> 01:06:36,722
no one would have given a damn!

633
01:06:36,889 --> 01:06:38,826
What are you so upset about?

634
01:06:38,991 --> 01:06:41,729
No one gives a damn
about the father!

635
01:06:42,628 --> 01:06:45,166
l stayed at home
while your mother worked.

636
01:06:45,331 --> 01:06:50,274
l cooked for you,
l helped you with your homework...

637
01:06:50,436 --> 01:06:52,540
You've forgotten all that.

638
01:06:52,705 --> 01:06:55,644
The father doesn't count.

639
01:06:55,809 --> 01:06:58,681
Even having a kid without a father

640
01:06:58,845 --> 01:07:00,848
wouldn't be a problem for you,
l bet.

641
01:07:01,013 --> 01:07:03,685
What are you talking about?

642
01:07:06,753 --> 01:07:08,890
You're pregnant, right?

643
01:07:14,461 --> 01:07:17,332
Look at the state you're in.

644
01:07:17,497 --> 01:07:20,101
Your mother has realized.

645
01:07:23,069 --> 01:07:26,008
You turn up here and say nothing.

646
01:07:27,307 --> 01:07:29,310
We have to bring things to a head

647
01:07:29,476 --> 01:07:32,682
to find out a little about your life

648
01:07:32,846 --> 01:07:35,585
and what you're going through.

649
01:07:36,249 --> 01:07:38,286
Personally,

650
01:07:38,452 --> 01:07:41,024
I’m hurt that you haven't told us.

651
01:08:29,470 --> 01:08:31,473
Something smells good.

652
01:08:31,639 --> 01:08:34,143
lt's a new recipe.

653
01:08:34,308 --> 01:08:36,745
You're turning into
a real cordon bleu

654
01:08:36,911 --> 01:08:38,714
in your new kitchen.

655
01:08:40,248 --> 01:08:42,685
Gilles.

656
01:08:43,251 --> 01:08:47,359
Things are getting better.
l feel good, l keep busy...

657
01:08:47,522 --> 01:08:51,363
But...l'd like my own bank account.

658
01:08:51,526 --> 01:08:53,596
What for?

659
01:08:53,761 --> 01:08:56,666
You spoil me
but l was a bit short yesterday

660
01:08:56,831 --> 01:08:59,169
and l hate having to ask
each time.

661
01:08:59,333 --> 01:09:00,468
l manage the budget well

662
01:09:00,635 --> 01:09:02,840
and l'd like to have
my own account

663
01:09:03,005 --> 01:09:05,743
but l need your agreement.

664
01:09:05,908 --> 01:09:07,878
l'll think about it.

665
01:09:09,243 --> 01:09:11,580
l could give you surprises too.

666
01:09:13,414 --> 01:09:15,584
l'd like to be able to spoil you.

667
01:09:15,751 --> 01:09:18,155
What l'd really like

668
01:09:18,319 --> 01:09:20,857
is to see you have friends round

669
01:09:21,023 --> 01:09:25,231
and organize gatherings,
the way other wives do.

670
01:09:27,830 --> 01:09:32,071
We have a beautiful home,
you should be proud of it.

671
01:09:33,702 --> 01:09:35,071
You're right.

672
01:09:47,249 --> 01:09:50,688
She writes well
for someone without an education.

673
01:09:50,853 --> 01:09:51,888
That's true.

674
01:09:52,054 --> 01:09:54,559
But what she says is so sad.

675
01:09:54,723 --> 01:09:56,660
She shouldn't have married him.

676
01:09:56,825 --> 01:09:59,130
But we can't help that.

677
01:09:59,728 --> 01:10:02,166
isn’t it odd
that she lea without it?

678
01:10:02,331 --> 01:10:04,768
And without the money?

679
01:10:04,934 --> 01:10:08,106
She was probably upset
and forgot it.

680
01:10:08,270 --> 01:10:11,342
What could this money be?

681
01:10:12,075 --> 01:10:15,114
She probably had money
for the week.

682
01:10:15,277 --> 01:10:17,681
Money to do the shopping...

683
01:10:17,847 --> 01:10:20,084
This is too much.

684
01:10:24,286 --> 01:10:26,289
Have you shown your mother?

685
01:10:26,455 --> 01:10:28,626
She doesn't want to know.

686
01:10:32,494 --> 01:10:34,164
l understand that.

687
01:10:36,298 --> 01:10:38,736
Martine suffered a lot over it.

688
01:10:38,902 --> 01:10:40,839
No more than you.

689
01:10:41,871 --> 01:10:44,308
l was younger.

690
01:10:45,975 --> 01:10:48,313
l guess she protected me.

691
01:10:48,978 --> 01:10:51,717
She was a second mother to me.

692
01:10:51,881 --> 01:10:54,519
ln my memories,
they merge together.

693
01:10:54,684 --> 01:10:57,088
Was Louise hard with you?

694
01:10:57,253 --> 01:10:58,955
No.

695
01:10:59,123 --> 01:11:02,162
She was tender
but she was sad too.

696
01:11:02,325 --> 01:11:04,395
But may be l imagined her
as being sad

697
01:11:04,561 --> 01:11:06,131
After she leave.

698
01:11:08,098 --> 01:11:09,500
The way she writes...

699
01:11:10,067 --> 01:11:13,908
l tried to find her.
l went to the cops, in vain.

700
01:11:14,871 --> 01:11:18,578
Certain songs make me
think of her now.

701
01:11:19,742 --> 01:11:20,911
She dressed well.

702
01:11:21,078 --> 01:11:24,384
She always dressed well,
l remember.

703
01:11:26,249 --> 01:11:28,219
l found her beautiful.

704
01:11:40,798 --> 01:11:42,535
lt doesn't matter, dear.

705
01:11:42,700 --> 01:11:44,637
Hurry up now.

706
01:12:01,485 --> 01:12:03,655
Let's get to work.

707
01:12:42,459 --> 01:12:43,962
- Hello, madam.
- Hello.

708
01:12:44,129 --> 01:12:48,538
l'd like to empty my account
to buy my husband a new car.

709
01:12:48,700 --> 01:12:50,369
The whole amount?

710
01:12:50,535 --> 01:12:52,472
Yes, please.

711
01:12:52,637 --> 01:12:55,308
He's dreamt of it for so long.

712
01:12:55,473 --> 01:12:58,211
- Can you give me a minute?
- Of course.

713
01:13:12,757 --> 01:13:14,727
l handle such amounts myself.

714
01:13:14,893 --> 01:13:16,730
l understand. Thank you.

715
01:14:18,325 --> 01:14:20,495
You went to the bank?

716
01:14:23,296 --> 01:14:25,767
l wanted to buy you a new car.

717
01:14:26,565 --> 01:14:30,039
What an idiot l was to trust you.

718
01:14:30,203 --> 01:14:32,740
Leave this house now, Louise.

719
01:14:32,905 --> 01:14:35,277
Leave immediately.

720
01:14:35,441 --> 01:14:37,711
You're not happy,
you want to work,

721
01:14:37,877 --> 01:14:40,048
so leave.

722
01:14:40,780 --> 01:14:43,051
Keep the money.

723
01:14:43,216 --> 01:14:45,854
But never try to come back,
you hear.

724
01:14:46,452 --> 01:14:48,689
l don't want to see you again.

725
01:14:50,791 --> 01:14:52,728
l'll demand custody
of the children.

726
01:14:52,893 --> 01:14:55,564
l won't let you take my children.

727
01:14:55,729 --> 01:14:58,533
You're incapable of
Looking after them.

728
01:15:01,435 --> 01:15:03,606
You're right.

729
01:15:03,770 --> 01:15:06,474
Maybe they're better
with you for now.

730
01:15:48,182 --> 01:15:49,417
I’m really sorry.

731
01:15:49,583 --> 01:15:51,286
l'll get some napkins.

732
01:16:01,128 --> 01:16:02,330
lt's all right.

733
01:16:02,497 --> 01:16:05,069
I’m soaked but it's all right.

734
01:16:07,502 --> 01:16:09,305
Do you want to borrow a sweater?

735
01:16:09,470 --> 01:16:10,906
Yes, please.

736
01:16:20,449 --> 01:16:22,018
Thank you.

737
01:16:23,284 --> 01:16:25,321
lt's sweet of you.

738
01:16:28,756 --> 01:16:31,728
Don't worry, it doesn't matter.

739
01:16:32,327 --> 01:16:34,964
You're really kind too.

740
01:16:35,129 --> 01:16:37,934
l could lose my job over this.

741
01:16:38,099 --> 01:16:40,237
Shall l get you another?

742
01:16:40,402 --> 01:16:43,207
No, thank you, l have to go.

743
01:16:43,372 --> 01:16:45,843
l'll bring your sweater back.

744
01:16:46,007 --> 01:16:50,549
lf l forget, I’m on Avenue
de la Mer, number 15.

745
01:17:12,568 --> 01:17:15,106
- Are you married?
- No.

746
01:17:15,671 --> 01:17:18,676
- You don't have a guy?
- No.

747
01:17:24,713 --> 01:17:27,317
Your skin's so soft.

748
01:17:27,483 --> 01:17:29,285
You smell good.

749
01:17:37,092 --> 01:17:40,299
l'd like it to be functional,
for a reasonable price.

750
01:17:40,463 --> 01:17:41,965
Good morning.

751
01:17:42,130 --> 01:17:45,370
l rang the bell.
l thought you'd gone out.

752
01:17:45,535 --> 01:17:47,805
No, l was sleeping.

753
01:17:48,571 --> 01:17:50,241
lt's late to be getting up.

754
01:17:50,406 --> 01:17:52,943
I’m resting. l need it.

755
01:17:54,177 --> 01:17:57,783
- We won't be long.
- Take as long as you like.

756
01:17:59,948 --> 01:18:02,153
Changing the kitchen?

757
01:18:02,318 --> 01:18:04,021
l know you like it

758
01:18:04,187 --> 01:18:07,660
but if we may do it
along with the plumbing.

759
01:18:10,827 --> 01:18:12,964
- You spoke to Gérard about it?
- No.

760
01:18:18,468 --> 01:18:20,138
Evelyne decides.

761
01:18:20,303 --> 01:18:22,641
Their place is absolutely hideous.

762
01:18:22,805 --> 01:18:25,176
You're renting it out?

763
01:18:25,341 --> 01:18:28,513
This house causes
no end of needless tension.

764
01:18:28,678 --> 01:18:31,984
We'll do it up and then we'll see.

765
01:18:32,148 --> 01:18:34,786
Don't tell my brother.
l'll pay for it.

766
01:18:34,951 --> 01:18:37,423
- You should let him know.
- Yes.

767
01:18:38,354 --> 01:18:40,459
l think l have everything.

768
01:18:40,624 --> 01:18:42,627
l'll send you an estimate.

769
01:18:43,760 --> 01:18:45,463
See you soon.

770
01:18:45,629 --> 01:18:47,164
Goodbye.

771
01:18:51,602 --> 01:18:54,541
- Are you well?
- Yes.

772
01:18:54,704 --> 01:18:57,176
The work won’t begin right away.

773
01:18:57,341 --> 01:18:58,643
When are you leaving?

774
01:18:58,808 --> 01:18:59,910
ln mo days.

775
01:19:00,076 --> 01:19:02,848
- You must be pleased.
- Why?

776
01:19:03,012 --> 01:19:06,352
lt's natural to be pleased
to be going home.

777
01:19:08,352 --> 01:19:09,187
l'll go now.

778
01:19:09,353 --> 01:19:11,657
l have something for you.

779
01:19:17,628 --> 01:19:19,631
l hope you'll like it.

780
01:19:19,797 --> 01:19:21,366
Thank you.

781
01:19:21,532 --> 01:19:22,533
Shall l open it?

782
01:19:22,700 --> 01:19:25,338
Maybe not.

783
01:19:26,170 --> 01:19:27,840
Right...

784
01:20:05,376 --> 01:20:07,780
lt's silly,
l forgot it in the car.

785
01:20:08,979 --> 01:20:11,117
Thank you...

786
01:20:11,716 --> 01:20:14,221
Right, l'll let you work.

787
01:20:14,918 --> 01:20:17,089
ls something wrong?

788
01:20:17,255 --> 01:20:19,459
No, not at all.

789
01:20:19,624 --> 01:20:23,031
But l have a lot to do

790
01:20:23,194 --> 01:20:25,431
and you have your consultations.

791
01:20:25,597 --> 01:20:29,204
No, I’m free all day.

792
01:20:30,235 --> 01:20:32,138
What's wrong?

793
01:20:32,303 --> 01:20:33,873
I’m bleeding.

794
01:20:34,038 --> 01:20:36,977
- A lot?
- A little.

795
01:20:37,142 --> 01:20:39,145
All right, that can happen.

796
01:20:39,310 --> 01:20:41,247
Don't panic
but it's best to check.

797
01:20:41,412 --> 01:20:43,750
Get dressed. l'll wait for you.

798
01:21:49,081 --> 01:21:50,583
Everything's fine.

799
01:21:55,622 --> 01:21:57,826
Thanks for taking me.

800
01:21:57,990 --> 01:22:01,029
l feared it might be
an entopic pregnancy.

801
01:22:01,193 --> 01:22:05,100
You lose the fetus
and you end up in hospital.

802
01:22:05,264 --> 01:22:07,636
lt can leave you sterile too.

803
01:22:07,801 --> 01:22:09,938
We can be happy it's not that.

804
01:22:10,102 --> 01:22:12,307
l feel so tired, Mum.

805
01:22:13,406 --> 01:22:16,345
Don't move. What do you need?

806
01:22:16,509 --> 01:22:20,082
l'd like my thick sweater.
It's up in my room.

807
01:22:40,300 --> 01:22:42,470
Dad?

808
01:22:42,636 --> 01:22:45,008
What time is it?

809
01:22:45,806 --> 01:22:48,778
Yes, she was with me.

810
01:22:48,942 --> 01:22:51,146
l don't know. l fell asleep.

811
01:23:03,456 --> 01:23:05,527
Where did you find it?

812
01:23:07,895 --> 01:23:10,199
Behind the kitchen dresser.

813
01:23:12,198 --> 01:23:14,970
lt's Dad.
He's looking all over for you.

814
01:23:18,972 --> 01:23:20,442
Yes.

815
01:23:21,575 --> 01:23:23,378
Everything's fine.

816
01:23:23,544 --> 01:23:25,214
l won't be long.

817
01:23:51,806 --> 01:23:53,643
Are you ok, Mum?

818
01:23:55,476 --> 01:23:57,814
Just leave me alone now.

819
01:24:21,937 --> 01:24:23,573
Yes, Mum.

820
01:24:24,171 --> 01:24:26,308
What's happening?

821
01:24:26,808 --> 01:24:28,378
Where are you?

822
01:24:47,362 --> 01:24:49,566
You know, Audrey, I’ve tried...

823
01:24:49,731 --> 01:24:52,069
to pass on a taste for freedom
to you.

824
01:24:53,101 --> 01:24:55,538
lt's what my mother wanted too.

825
01:24:58,240 --> 01:25:02,448
When Gérard and l went anywhere,
people would whisper about us.

826
01:25:02,611 --> 01:25:04,614
l became hardened.

827
01:25:04,781 --> 01:25:08,554
l wanted them to know
we were managing without her.

828
01:25:10,820 --> 01:25:14,861
But, inside, l tried to be someone
she could be proud of.

829
01:25:18,260 --> 01:25:22,167
l also wanted you to be strong,
independent...

830
01:25:30,073 --> 01:25:32,678
Mum, why did she leave the money?

831
01:25:43,853 --> 01:25:44,955
Why did she leave it?

832
01:25:45,120 --> 01:25:47,925
l don't know.

833
01:25:48,091 --> 01:25:51,264
He called her a thief,
said she took his money...

834
01:25:51,427 --> 01:25:53,397
But she didn't take it.

835
01:25:53,563 --> 01:25:56,335
He said she had vanished,
that he'd looked for her...

836
01:25:56,499 --> 01:25:58,135
But he didn't call the police

837
01:25:58,301 --> 01:26:01,941
and her family
didn't hear from her either.

838
01:26:03,606 --> 01:26:05,843
He should have called the police.

839
01:26:06,877 --> 01:26:10,016
He said he'd looked for her
all day.

840
01:26:10,179 --> 01:26:15,188
But why did he look for her

841
01:26:15,351 --> 01:26:18,657
since her suitcase was
in her room?

842
01:26:20,456 --> 01:26:22,560
What suitcase?

843
01:26:28,632 --> 01:26:31,069
When Gérard and l
got home from school,

844
01:26:32,235 --> 01:26:34,773
the door wasn't locked.

845
01:26:35,973 --> 01:26:39,079
There was no one home
but the door was unlocked.

846
01:26:41,277 --> 01:26:44,317
lt was Suzanne's son's
birthday party

847
01:26:44,481 --> 01:26:46,685
but l didn't want us to go.

848
01:26:46,850 --> 01:26:48,853
l was ashamed
my mother wasn't there.

849
01:26:49,019 --> 01:26:52,559
l felt so ashamed of her.

850
01:26:52,723 --> 01:26:57,566
l thought that she might be
asleep, so l went to their room.

851
01:26:57,728 --> 01:27:00,533
The suitcase was there
with her things.

852
01:27:04,601 --> 01:27:07,975
isn’t it strange
she took nothing with her?

853
01:27:09,606 --> 01:27:13,480
Without a word
and without taking anything.

854
01:27:16,680 --> 01:27:20,187
l was in the kitchen.
My father got home late.

855
01:27:20,350 --> 01:27:22,822
He seemed very odd.

856
01:27:22,987 --> 01:27:24,990
He said she'd robbed him.

857
01:27:25,156 --> 01:27:28,028
He asked why l wasn't in bed.

858
01:27:28,193 --> 01:27:31,032
He didn't ask
if she had come back.

859
01:27:34,966 --> 01:27:36,703
He was filthy,

860
01:27:36,868 --> 01:27:39,172
covered in mud...

861
01:27:39,336 --> 01:27:42,910
He had dirt on his hands.
They were filthy.

862
01:27:43,074 --> 01:27:45,011
And his eyes...

863
01:27:45,176 --> 01:27:46,979
scared me.

864
01:27:47,145 --> 01:27:49,583
He looked mad.

865
01:27:53,151 --> 01:27:55,322
The next morning,

866
01:27:55,486 --> 01:27:58,325
he said she'd called...

867
01:27:58,489 --> 01:28:02,230
to say she wouldn't be back.

868
01:28:02,393 --> 01:28:05,232
And he burnt all her things.

869
01:28:06,898 --> 01:28:09,203
We have nothing.

870
01:28:10,236 --> 01:28:13,241
l didn't lie to you,
we have nothing of hers.

871
01:28:21,546 --> 01:28:24,418
He took the secret to his grave.

872
01:28:32,091 --> 01:28:35,430
- Walk me home.
- Of course, Mum.

873
01:29:16,269 --> 01:29:19,742
- Martine, what's wrong?
- Nothing. Nothing's wrong.

874
01:29:30,582 --> 01:29:32,552
What happened?

875
01:29:33,219 --> 01:29:35,089
He killed her.

876
01:29:38,858 --> 01:29:42,431
Gilles killed Louise.

877
01:29:45,165 --> 01:29:47,168
That's not possible...

878
01:29:48,835 --> 01:29:51,239
You should go up and see Mum.

879
01:29:55,041 --> 01:29:56,878
Want to sleep here?

880
01:29:57,043 --> 01:29:59,080
No, l'd rather go back.

881
01:31:07,748 --> 01:31:09,618
Her blood pressure is low.

882
01:31:09,784 --> 01:31:12,723
Make sure she eats
and stays nearby.

883
01:31:12,887 --> 01:31:14,390
All right.

884
01:31:33,707 --> 01:31:38,950
At first, he was always barking
and never obeyed.

885
01:31:39,114 --> 01:31:42,186
You've trained him well.

886
01:31:42,350 --> 01:31:44,654
l haven't finished yet

887
01:31:46,054 --> 01:31:48,391
but I’m pleased with him.

888
01:31:51,426 --> 01:31:53,931
She's strong, you know.

889
01:32:02,037 --> 01:32:04,107
l won't take them.

890
01:32:04,272 --> 01:32:06,142
They ease the pain.

891
01:32:06,308 --> 01:32:08,846
I’m just tired.

892
01:33:11,807 --> 01:33:13,877
l had considered it, of course.

893
01:33:16,112 --> 01:33:18,416
Not seriously.

894
01:33:26,055 --> 01:33:28,493
ln any case,
he never mentioned her.

895
01:33:33,029 --> 01:33:35,166
We can never prove it anyway.

896
01:33:43,005 --> 01:33:45,710
l'd never seen
my sister cry before.

897
01:33:50,314 --> 01:33:51,849
l have to be going.

898
01:33:58,388 --> 01:33:59,757
Love to Evelyne.

899
01:33:59,922 --> 01:34:01,358
All right.

900
01:34:12,970 --> 01:34:14,840
Mum, it's me. Can l come in?

901
01:34:15,005 --> 01:34:16,407
Yes.

902
01:34:23,981 --> 01:34:25,651
Let me help.

903
01:34:26,817 --> 01:34:28,854
- Has Gérard gone?
- Yes.

904
01:34:29,019 --> 01:34:30,856
He's gone to work.

905
01:34:31,021 --> 01:34:33,291
Evelyne will worry.

906
01:34:33,458 --> 01:34:37,599
lf he's away more than an hour,
she gets frantic.

907
01:34:39,029 --> 01:34:41,934
l'll lock the house up.

908
01:34:44,602 --> 01:34:47,407
I’m going to stay here a while.

909
01:35:50,802 --> 01:35:54,175
You see, she put the dress on.
