1
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:57,670
The kebab guy said they're dealing
in the loo or the stairwell.

2
00:01:57,880 --> 00:01:59,950
Ruedi and I'll come from the front,
you guys cover the back.

3
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:47,678
Hey, Carol, today's my lucky day!

4
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:52,075
Won three francs in the lotto, went to
the thrift store and what'd I find?

5
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:54,589
René Botteron from FC Zurich!

6
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:57,630
- Come on, let's do something fab.
- Yeah.

7
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,833
Let's go score some dope.
The good stuff.

8
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:04,237
Yeah, but they've got Dragan locked up
and the stuff on the street is shit...

9
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:06,519
Know something better?

10
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:16,712
Things okay? Long time, no see.

11
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:18,040
Carol, we got to go.

12
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:20,429
Wait. Who's got the
best dope these days?

13
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:24,159
Baby, I've gone straight.
I'm a mailman. See?

14
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:26,396
Forget it, he ain't got anything.
Let's go.

15
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,753
So you're not the king
of the street anymore?

16
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:32,834
The coolest Yugo?

17
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:35,759
I'm not a Yugo!
I'm Swiss-Albanian.

18
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:40,393
Forget him and let me take care of it.

19
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:41,749
Awesome.

20
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:47,756
Kind of a retard
but he's got hot connections.

21
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:10,918
The mailman there. Do we know him?

22
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:13,318
Why would I know any mailmen?

23
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:29,273
Want to get going?

24
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:30,999
Let's wait a bit.

25
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:37,593
Hey, look: "May and
Analannabelle"...

26
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:40,750
I get it: "Anal-Annabelle!
New and hot"

27
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:42,951
in Zurich. "She really is new."

28
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:47,233
Got to check her out.
By the way: What's up with Vera?

29
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:51,872
You back together, or is she still
doing it with that other guy?

30
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:02,433
Nice piece of tin they gave you.

31
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:04,198
You know who it belongs to?

32
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:08,551
Us, you know. The taxpayers!

33
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:19,029
- So where is it?
- Man,

34
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:21,920
I'm not a dealer. But a guy
I know will be here in a sec.

35
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:22,750
Give me the money

36
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:24,589
You think I'm dumb?

37
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:27,394
Man, I'm doing you a huge favor here
and you're getting all worked up.

38
00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:30,108
Don't you get all worked up. You'll
get your money when the guy comes.

39
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:31,389
Easy, man.

40
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:40,434
That guy there!

41
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:42,593
The one with the hairdo.

42
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:45,270
Ain't that the Albanian, Berisha?

43
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:49,915
All Albanians are named Berisha.

44
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,797
But that's really him!

45
00:05:57,880 --> 00:06:01,236
Go in! Come on, go inside...

46
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:04,549
Oh, forget it,

47
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:06,478
he never goes in.

48
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:07,914
Fucking shit!

49
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:10,310
Well then, let's just grab
another of his boys

50
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:12,511
and ship him back to Yugoland.

51
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:17,555
Hey, Beko! Still at the post office?

52
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:25,195
He's inside.
It's one of Berisha's guys!

53
00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:27,871
Fuck the post office.

54
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:31,110
Can you do me a favor?

55
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:35,954
I promised the girl something.

56
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:40,677
We told you you should
get in with us, but you

57
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:45,476
listened to your mother. Now don't
you tell me the post office is shit.

58
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:51,514
Wait here.

59
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:56,314
There's four of them.
Two junkies, a mailman and a Yugo.

60
00:06:56,520 --> 00:06:57,873
Cover the back and wait for us.

61
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:08,752
- Good day, City Police!
- Everyone stay calm.

62
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:10,473
Hands on the table!

63
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:15,593
- Piss off! Fucking cop! Let go!
- Hey! Let her go!

64
00:07:17,640 --> 00:07:19,631
Damn it, we're not here for you!

65
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:21,353
Fuck you! I'm not going with you!

66
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:30,475
The cops!

67
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:52,195
Damn it!

68
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:54,431
Have you lost it?
Just standing around?

69
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,673
I said cover the back!
What was that shit?

70
00:07:57,880 --> 00:08:00,110
Fucking bullshit! You bastard!

71
00:08:38,920 --> 00:08:40,194
Damn!

72
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:51,679
What do we have here?

73
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:54,031
Him again! What do I know?

74
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:01,192
What do you know about the other guy?

75
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:03,596
Berisha? Is he the boss
of the one who just split?

76
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:06,075
What do you want?
All Albanians are named Berisha.

77
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:07,709
This guy!

78
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:11,631
Man, I'm Beko. I know them all.

79
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:13,239
- But not that one.
- Don't lie to me!

80
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:15,749
Why are you asking me then?
Ain't you the super cop?

81
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:20,236
Listen up, Beko:
It's a jungle out there.

82
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:22,237
The big fish eat up the small ones.

83
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:24,396
Unless you're a piranha.
And that you're not!

84
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:27,313
Man, what's this whole fish thing?

85
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:31,917
Reported for theft, assault... You're
one of Berisha's dealers. Just admit it.

86
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:34,236
Man, no way!
Everyone fucks up a little

87
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:35,759
when they're young.

88
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,353
But those times are over.

89
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:39,240
I went to school in Switzerland!

90
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:41,515
Am I supposed to lie
and say I'm not working

91
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:43,711
at the post office?
- You got in my way, man.

92
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:46,200
That's aiding and abetting. Got it?

93
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:48,668
That'll get you at
least one night in jail.

94
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:52,350
If I don't go to work tonight, my boss
won't just see me as the foreigner.

95
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:53,959
I'll be the lawbreaking foreigner.

96
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:55,719
Uh, Dani...

97
00:09:55,960 --> 00:09:59,157
Could you give his mom a quick call
and check that out with his employer?

98
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:04,877
Liens, liens, liens...

99
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:08,397
How can a junkie like you
be stuck with so many liens?

100
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:10,995
Hey, it's not my fault.

101
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:16,393
You know, once I had a
real cool bicycle workshop,

102
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:21,639
with super exclusive bikes. And then
they just took it all away from me.

103
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:27,954
Fuck! But you know what?

104
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:32,078
- I'm going to get it back again.
- You always buy your dope from Beko?

105
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:34,714
Definitely not.

106
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:40,236
Carol and I only went in there
because... Galatassaray was playing.

107
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:48,352
Is she your girlfriend?

108
00:10:52,760 --> 00:10:53,715
Yeah.

109
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:58,631
Man, I'm not a dealer.

110
00:10:58,960 --> 00:11:00,951
But that junkie chick,
she's totally hot.

111
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:05,159
Don't you think? She's a bit doped up,
but act a little nice, and then...

112
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:09,756
Did you know Beko's keen on Carol?

113
00:11:13,520 --> 00:11:14,748
Well... why not?

114
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:19,116
Beko's a happening guy,
always got a good supply...

115
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:21,595
But he just took the cash,
and then you guys showed up!

116
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:29,916
And who'd he get the dope from?

117
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:33,152
How should I know.

118
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:37,036
From the Albanian.

119
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:43,475
Why do you want to lock up Beko?

120
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:47,435
If he's with them, we need him out
there so we can shadow him.

121
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:50,313
With him alone, you don't stand
a chance with the prosecutor.

122
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:10,959
- Going cold turkey?
- You crazy?

123
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:13,357
Look, not a single one!

124
00:12:13,640 --> 00:12:15,312
And how about the ecstasy tabs?

125
00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:19,552
Him again.
That's personal consumption.

126
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:21,595
I want out of here!

127
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:27,472
Fuck you

128
00:12:27,560 --> 00:12:29,312
We've got a problem with you.

129
00:12:29,560 --> 00:12:31,391
Man, can't you read!

130
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:35,120
We have to send you back
to Oberkirch Reform School.

131
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:36,599
You've run
away three times.

132
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:38,474
Shit, man!

133
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:41,954
I'm getting thrown in the reformatory.
I'll hang myself in there!

134
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:44,390
But hanging out in dealer joints,
that's okay?

135
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:46,511
None of your business. Fuck you.

136
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,831
What put you in reform school?

137
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:55,595
Stole a piece of candy.
Should I scream again?

138
00:12:56,600 --> 00:12:58,272
If it does you good...

139
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:20,757
From my end, you can go.

140
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:23,113
You crazy?

141
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:25,557
Oberkirch is bullshit.

142
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:34,680
Can't you just totally
delete my record?

143
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:35,157
Get lost!

144
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:50,434
Damn it!

145
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:08,279
And? You guys happy?

146
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:14,870
10 grams of heroin, no dealer,
a little Albanian in jail

147
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:17,835
and a bungled job. And you, Marco,

148
00:14:18,040 --> 00:14:19,393
what a screw-up!

149
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:21,875
You're the one who was so gung-ho!

150
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:23,513
That kind of thing can happen.

151
00:14:23,720 --> 00:14:27,429
No! It doesn't happen to me! Know why?
'Cause I take this shit seriously!

152
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:29,830
Calm down. The lake beat guy's coming.

153
00:14:30,040 --> 00:14:33,874
Fuck the lake beat guy!
This place is nothing but crap!

154
00:14:38,040 --> 00:14:40,349
Beat Schuppisser from the lake police.

155
00:14:42,040 --> 00:14:43,951
"Asked to switch to narcotics."

156
00:14:44,440 --> 00:14:46,670
"You can learn a lot from Strähl"

157
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:49,075
but remember:
I'm in charge here,

158
00:14:49,280 --> 00:14:50,315
not him.

159
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:53,879
- Hello.
- Good luck!

160
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:55,394
Ruedi. Break a leg.

161
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:58,116
And here's our little Strähl!

162
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:02,668
Is that necessary?

163
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:05,796
I figured if he can survive you,

164
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:08,231
then he'll survive the job.

165
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:10,599
Goodbye then.

166
00:15:12,520 --> 00:15:14,909
A guy's got a private life too,
you know.

167
00:15:18,840 --> 00:15:21,912
And there's no dealing
after six either, right?

168
00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:57,037
- Come on, give me a little too.
- Why don't you ask Fritz?

169
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:00,995
Please, give me a little bit.

170
00:16:01,280 --> 00:16:02,838
I don't have any more.

171
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:21,356
Come on, let's go or they'll
lock us up.

172
00:16:21,560 --> 00:16:24,791
Yeah, come on, René.
Fritz has got ecstasy at home.

173
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,309
This constant oppression
is killing me.

174
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:29,351
Really don't have any more?

175
00:16:31,520 --> 00:16:32,475
Hey Anz...

176
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:37,509
Shit, Anz is totally out.

177
00:16:46,920 --> 00:16:49,150
- Don't you want to share?
- Hey! You nuts?

178
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:52,558
We outsiders have got to stick
together.

179
00:16:57,680 --> 00:16:59,113
Fucking wild!

180
00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:00,748
A grenade.

181
00:17:01,160 --> 00:17:02,559
A hand grenade.

182
00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:06,948
Let me see.

183
00:17:07,320 --> 00:17:11,074
Don't worry,
he's done that to me before too.

184
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:12,998
Let me see the grenade.

185
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:16,835
- No, leave it alone or it'll go off.
- Come on, let me see!

186
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:45,593
Hey, Flaky,

187
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:50,592
did you leave the lake
'cause you don't like fish?

188
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:53,520
No, I just want to be
where things are happening

189
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:54,873
and where I can help people.

190
00:17:58,760 --> 00:18:00,751
With us narcs, ain't much happening.

191
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:04,310
We mainly deal with garbage.

192
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:09,473
I prefer fish. Piranhas.

193
00:18:10,520 --> 00:18:12,192
They eat the garbage.

194
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:17,512
Come on, I'll show you.

195
00:18:28,920 --> 00:18:30,751
What're you looking for? I'm all out.

196
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:37,188
And what's that?

197
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:40,479
- That's just personal consumption.
- Nope.

198
00:18:41,240 --> 00:18:44,550
To consume that you have to tell me
who's Berisha's new man.

199
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:47,080
Hey, leave me alone,
I don't know.

200
00:18:47,080 --> 00:18:48,991
It's way dangerous
with these Albanians.

201
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:53,078
But you locked up René today.

202
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:55,828
- Didn't you find his hand grenade?
- Grenade?

203
00:18:56,280 --> 00:18:57,156
Don't fuck with me!

204
00:18:57,360 --> 00:18:59,669
Dangerous having a grenade around!

205
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:02,314
Just imagine what could happen.

206
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:05,796
The idiot doesn't know anything.
Let's go.

207
00:19:06,120 --> 00:19:07,960
Uh, but... don't we have
to do something

208
00:19:07,960 --> 00:19:09,951
if there's a grenade
going 'round the scene?

209
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:12,200
Listen, Flaky.

210
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:15,317
Join the UN peacekeepers
if you want to hunt grenades.

211
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:17,875
We narcs have more
important stuff to do.

212
00:19:38,040 --> 00:19:40,190
The guy there with the hairdo.

213
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:42,359
That's Berisha.

214
00:19:43,160 --> 00:19:44,229
The pig...

215
00:19:45,640 --> 00:19:46,789
Lives around here,

216
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:50,680
two kids, a big fat wife, a big fat
Mercedes and a big fat business.

217
00:19:50,680 --> 00:19:51,590
And we only manage

218
00:19:51,800 --> 00:19:53,756
to nab his errand boys
with a few grams.

219
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:55,758
Damn it!

220
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:02,518
So what do we do now?

221
00:20:03,320 --> 00:20:04,070
Nothing!

222
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:09,678
No mobile, no telephone, no bank
account. He never touches the dope.

223
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:12,633
And we don't know where he
stashes his big deliveries.

224
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:16,435
Why don't we just collect the few grams we
get from his boys until it's a few kilos

225
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:19,074
and then throw it in his car
and arrest him?

226
00:20:26,360 --> 00:20:27,270
Mr. Brunner?

227
00:20:28,040 --> 00:20:29,678
Yes, sir, everything's okay.

228
00:20:52,440 --> 00:20:54,556
Come on, let's do a Smarties oracle.

229
00:20:55,400 --> 00:20:58,073
And then we'll go out
and do some ecstasy.

230
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:12,434
Okay, I'll shake up the Smarties, then
you take the first five without looking

231
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:14,279
and that's your future...

232
00:21:14,760 --> 00:21:15,636
Such bullshit...

233
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:17,393
Take five without looking.

234
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:23,433
Awesome!

235
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:27,634
Three green. Green's for professional
success, and you just got three.

236
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:31,837
Purple is for wild times
and red for love...

237
00:21:33,880 --> 00:21:36,440
Swallow them or it won't work.

238
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,753
- Now what?
- Are you stupid? You know...

239
00:21:45,040 --> 00:21:46,553
Professional success.

240
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:49,430
Your dream's going to come true.

241
00:21:50,520 --> 00:21:53,876
You'll pay back your debts and
reopen your bike workshop,

242
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:56,120
but this time much
cooler than before,

243
00:21:56,120 --> 00:21:58,588
and everyone'll want the
<<René special>> bike.

244
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:03,592
Wild times: That's obvious, 'cause
we're going out to do some ecstasy.

245
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:06,188
And love.

246
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:11,835
- Because it's all with me.
- You don't even believe that yourself.

247
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:16,310
But you swallowed them.
It's already happened!

248
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:21,195
You're the best thing
that ever happened to me.

249
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:32,152
What's up? You upset?

250
00:22:32,920 --> 00:22:35,878
Did you have to tell Brunner
about this hand grenade?

251
00:22:37,080 --> 00:22:38,832
You're starting to piss me off!

252
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:10,315
Heinz!

253
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:13,792
- Come on in!
- You think this is the right apartment?

254
00:23:14,600 --> 00:23:16,431
I didn't hear you ring.

255
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:19,195
You got the money?

256
00:23:31,480 --> 00:23:33,357
Let's just cuddle!

257
00:23:35,720 --> 00:23:36,709
Fuck.

258
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:42,873
You're so boring, you and your heroin.
If we'd only left.

259
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:46,835
What's the matter? What'd I do wrong?

260
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:49,639
- Police! Stay calm!
- Man,

261
00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:51,637
you again, fucking cop! Get lost!

262
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:54,513
- Where's this fucking hand grenade?
- Damn it, we don't have one.

263
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:55,948
Where is it?

264
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:59,676
- Come on, this is pissing me off.
- Go fuck your grenade!

265
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:03,078
Fucking bastard!

266
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:06,073
Are you crazy?
That's totally dangerous!

267
00:24:11,800 --> 00:24:12,710
You fucking bastard!

268
00:24:27,920 --> 00:24:29,512
Stop or I'll jump!

269
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:37,112
You fucking bastard!

270
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:47,838
So what made that junkie
jump out the window?

271
00:24:48,040 --> 00:24:49,439
How should I know?

272
00:24:50,120 --> 00:24:51,792
Because junkies are a bit stupid?

273
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:56,188
Listen! Wehrli said you threw him
out of the window. And Schuppisser

274
00:24:56,480 --> 00:24:57,480
saw him flying as well.

275
00:24:57,480 --> 00:24:59,357
You can screw
Schuppisser for all I care

276
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:03,195
Whatever. Another complaint
against you is one too many.

277
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:06,634
You're suspended.

278
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:11,240
And if Wehrli sticks
by his statement,

279
00:25:11,240 --> 00:25:13,708
that's the nail in
the coffin for your career.

280
00:25:15,280 --> 00:25:18,192
You don't mean to say you believe
the junkie and not me?

281
00:25:18,680 --> 00:25:22,195
Listen, Strähl... It doesn't
matter who I believe.

282
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:25,790
You've got to protect people and
not throw them out of the window or

283
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:27,115
let them jump out!

284
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:34,036
What's the matter with you anyway?

285
00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:37,395
Dr. Arbenz didn't help any?

286
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:41,873
Dr. Arbenz is a shit for brains
doctor.

287
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:46,676
You'll never manage without me!

288
00:25:49,120 --> 00:25:51,793
Never heard we help
each other out around here?

289
00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:54,514
Did you just let your colleagues
at the lake drown too?

290
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:56,517
Leave him alone! It's not his fault.

291
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:06,473
You know how much

292
00:27:06,680 --> 00:27:09,752
Strähl would have to pay me in damages
if we were in the States?

293
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:14,351
Then I'd already be
general importer for Cannondale...

294
00:27:14,600 --> 00:27:16,591
- You insane? Damn!
- Hey, what's the problem?

295
00:27:16,800 --> 00:27:18,950
- You stupid fucking junkie!
- Man! Let him go, fucking cop!

296
00:27:19,160 --> 00:27:21,230
Yeah! Thanks to you,
I'm fully disabled!

297
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:24,000
Go now and retract
your false statement.

298
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:26,357
If you'll pay me damages.

299
00:27:26,600 --> 00:27:28,431
You insane? You're coming with me!

300
00:27:28,680 --> 00:27:32,753
Here's a totally whacked ex-drug cop
beating up an innocent victim.

301
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:36,151
And on top of that,
he's a pill addict!

302
00:27:37,040 --> 00:27:38,439
Fucking junkie!

303
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:42,913
- Fuck you! You're not a real cop anyway!
- Yeah!

304
00:27:43,320 --> 00:27:45,390
And I want damages!

305
00:28:57,880 --> 00:28:59,233
Where are you going?

306
00:28:59,480 --> 00:29:00,913
Where do you think? To work!

307
00:29:01,400 --> 00:29:04,278
But you've got night shift.
And you've hardly slept!

308
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:06,559
Now I'm on day shift.

309
00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:09,920
- Since when?
- Since today.

310
00:29:13,560 --> 00:29:15,039
Did they say something
about the police?

311
00:29:15,240 --> 00:29:18,915
Leave me alone! I didn't do anything
and my boss trusts me.

312
00:29:19,680 --> 00:29:21,716
How could they manage without me?

313
00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:24,679
My son...

314
00:29:26,120 --> 00:29:28,190
I'm so proud of you, Beko

315
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:30,711
Let me go, Mama. Got to leave.

316
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:33,474
Be careful.
Don't overdo it with work!

317
00:29:36,800 --> 00:29:38,950
What do you want from us, Beko?

318
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:42,955
"Did we tell you:
"Go work at the Swiss Post"?"

319
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:44,519
We didn't.

320
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:49,155
But you didn't listen to us.

321
00:29:49,720 --> 00:29:51,790
You listened to your mother.

322
00:29:54,120 --> 00:29:56,680
And now they've kicked you out.

323
00:29:59,120 --> 00:30:00,189
You know Winkelried?

324
00:30:00,440 --> 00:30:02,396
Who's that? A cop?

325
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:05,078
You fucking us over?

326
00:30:06,200 --> 00:30:08,634
Calm down. He's dead.

327
00:30:09,880 --> 00:30:13,714
Back in school, I learned
he really helped Switzerland.

328
00:30:14,400 --> 00:30:17,073
In war, he threw himself
at the spears of the enemies.

329
00:30:17,720 --> 00:30:18,914
You understand?

330
00:30:19,720 --> 00:30:22,518
Switzerland is still around.
And he's a hero.

331
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:31,159
Am I not your Winkelried? Haven't I
earned a job with you guys?

332
00:30:36,360 --> 00:30:38,191
Don't screw up, okay?

333
00:30:39,120 --> 00:30:41,236
Hey! I'm Beko! I never screw up.

334
00:30:49,040 --> 00:30:50,029
Sugar, coke.

335
00:30:52,280 --> 00:30:53,679
Sugar, coke.

336
00:30:59,640 --> 00:31:00,760
- What do you want?

337
00:31:00,760 --> 00:31:03,433
- What do I want?
It's still my apartment too.

338
00:31:06,280 --> 00:31:08,589
I need the car
and the key's still here.

339
00:31:08,840 --> 00:31:10,990
- You're not getting it.
- Goddamnit!

340
00:31:11,560 --> 00:31:13,835
The car still belongs to both of us!

341
00:31:14,160 --> 00:31:16,276
So Patrick doesn't have a car?

342
00:31:19,760 --> 00:31:21,432
That's not fair!

343
00:31:22,040 --> 00:31:26,750
How did I stand it with you for so long?
You and your fucking job!

344
00:32:13,240 --> 00:32:14,673
Damn it!

345
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:36,672
Since I saw you the last time,

346
00:32:37,080 --> 00:32:39,116
a lot's happened to you, eh?

347
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:42,392
Now you're already out?

348
00:32:42,680 --> 00:32:44,830
No, I just lost them.

349
00:32:45,480 --> 00:32:47,277
Mr. Strähl. You're not

350
00:32:47,480 --> 00:32:50,870
the only police officer unable to
cope with his job.

351
00:32:51,120 --> 00:32:54,237
This continual pressure, this misery...
Not everyone can handle it.

352
00:32:54,760 --> 00:32:58,878
It's important to admit when
the job isn't right anymore.

353
00:32:59,880 --> 00:33:01,996
You should think about that sometime.

354
00:33:04,360 --> 00:33:05,759
Clean things up in your life!

355
00:33:05,960 --> 00:33:08,030
Damn it, there's nothing to clean up!

356
00:33:08,440 --> 00:33:11,193
Mr. Strähl, it's like this:

357
00:33:11,400 --> 00:33:14,278
You're trembling,
you smell like alcohol...

358
00:33:14,760 --> 00:33:17,115
- Looks like cold turkey.
- You prescribed this crap!

359
00:33:18,040 --> 00:33:22,238
You know, it's impossible to
tell in advance if someone's

360
00:33:22,440 --> 00:33:26,558
predisposed towards addiction, and
only a small percentage will ever...

361
00:33:26,760 --> 00:33:28,796
You're just a shit for brains doctor!

362
00:33:30,600 --> 00:33:33,797
Did you hear that? That was
the junkie in you talking.

363
00:33:34,120 --> 00:33:35,075
Idiot!

364
00:33:35,520 --> 00:33:37,238
Hey! You can't do that!

365
00:33:53,040 --> 00:33:54,519
It's Strähl!

366
00:33:58,840 --> 00:34:00,478
You look like shit.

367
00:34:01,080 --> 00:34:02,069
Thanks

368
00:34:03,160 --> 00:34:04,673
Want a bite?

369
00:34:07,560 --> 00:34:10,597
Otherwise? Things okay?
What're you doing the whole day?

370
00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:14,589
Taking a little break.
Thinking about my future.

371
00:34:17,480 --> 00:34:20,313
You know, it makes me sick.
You can really piss a guy off,

372
00:34:20,520 --> 00:34:22,909
but it was also a lot of
fun sometimes.

373
00:34:23,840 --> 00:34:26,400
Check it out, you can see
right up her privates.

374
00:34:27,400 --> 00:34:29,550
Beat wouldn't have found that amusing.

375
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:32,030
So?

376
00:34:32,360 --> 00:34:33,679
You guys making progress?

377
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:37,677
You know the Yugo mailman we nabbed
in the kebab place...

378
00:34:37,880 --> 00:34:41,156
Brunner's got him under surveillance
now. Just like you always said.

379
00:34:41,680 --> 00:34:44,672
You know, Beat thinks it's a blast.
He likes doing that, you know...

380
00:34:45,920 --> 00:34:47,353
But, um, this Berisha...

381
00:34:47,720 --> 00:34:51,156
I'm telling you: Slippery as an eel.
Little Beat doesn't have a chance there.

382
00:34:51,400 --> 00:34:52,958
Well, I got to get going.

383
00:34:55,360 --> 00:34:58,989
Hey, if I can help you out or
anything, just give a ring, okay?

384
00:35:04,680 --> 00:35:07,069
Hi there! Strähl from the City Police!

385
00:35:09,880 --> 00:35:11,393
Just great.

386
00:35:12,240 --> 00:35:14,151
That's the fifth time today I've heard
that.

387
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:16,789
Suddendly everyone's with
the police, fire department

388
00:35:17,080 --> 00:35:18,752
or security service.

389
00:35:20,040 --> 00:35:21,837
Can I see your badge?

390
00:35:45,080 --> 00:35:46,718
Hey, Anz, over here!

391
00:35:49,640 --> 00:35:50,629
Goal!

392
00:35:55,200 --> 00:35:56,553
That's a foul!

393
00:36:00,440 --> 00:36:01,316
I let that one

394
00:36:01,520 --> 00:36:04,717
in on purpose. You know,
because of the grenade.

395
00:36:16,520 --> 00:36:17,635
Shit, what do you want?

396
00:36:17,880 --> 00:36:19,233
Make a statement. Now.

397
00:36:21,120 --> 00:36:23,156
What do I get in exchange?

398
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:30,955
And what else?

399
00:36:37,520 --> 00:36:38,555
And what else?

400
00:36:53,680 --> 00:36:56,440
Hey, Zurich-Basel there.
Definitely not 1.

401
00:36:56,440 --> 00:36:57,793
Zurich forever, man.

402
00:36:58,000 --> 00:36:59,194
You got to stay true

403
00:36:59,400 --> 00:37:02,790
to your principles.
- Make an X by 2. Zurich never wins.

404
00:37:03,160 --> 00:37:04,309
Hey, are you crazy?

405
00:37:05,720 --> 00:37:07,119
Man. Okay.

406
00:37:11,680 --> 00:37:15,195
Basel, that fucked up
chemical industry shit!

407
00:37:20,200 --> 00:37:21,997
That makes 356.20.

408
00:37:30,080 --> 00:37:31,798
Thanks very much.

409
00:37:34,680 --> 00:37:37,831
Thank you. I've got a good feeling.

410
00:37:38,280 --> 00:37:40,714
- And what do we do now?
- Now?

411
00:37:43,280 --> 00:37:46,317
- Nothing.
- Fuck yourself up the ass.

412
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:50,718
You go straight to the police station
and retract your false statement!

413
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:53,355
There's a case of bribery going on
here!

414
00:37:53,680 --> 00:37:54,908
That enough for a

415
00:37:55,120 --> 00:37:57,315
false statement at the police station?
- So cool!

416
00:37:57,520 --> 00:38:00,671
Listen, if I'm supposed to say I just
jumped out of the window, then you've

417
00:38:00,880 --> 00:38:04,316
got to give me a lot more than this
here. A half-kilo. Minimum.

418
00:38:14,160 --> 00:38:15,798
Yes, Herbert here.

419
00:38:18,160 --> 00:38:20,960
I'm in the World Bar
and have got a runaway here.

420
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:22,871
Can you come pick her up?
Thanks.

421
00:38:26,160 --> 00:38:28,240
Zurich City Police,
everything under control.

422
00:38:28,240 --> 00:38:29,309
You're such a bastard!

423
00:38:29,720 --> 00:38:31,551
Goddamn asshole!

424
00:38:32,040 --> 00:38:35,237
Leave her alone. Or you can forget
the statement, just so you know.

425
00:38:35,480 --> 00:38:38,631
Listen: Now you go to the station and
if I don't hear from you in three hours,

426
00:38:38,840 --> 00:38:42,355
your sweetheart is headed to
Oberkirch. Got it? Here's my number.

427
00:38:44,360 --> 00:38:47,033
- Hey, you can't do that!
- Let Carol go!

428
00:38:47,240 --> 00:38:49,196
I can break her arm too.

429
00:38:51,440 --> 00:38:54,000
Shit, you can't do that!

430
00:38:58,680 --> 00:39:00,716
You know where you have to go, right?

431
00:39:04,560 --> 00:39:08,269
You're an unbelievably
fucked up asshole!

432
00:39:09,040 --> 00:39:12,635
This is kidnapping!
You're totally nuts, man!

433
00:39:15,840 --> 00:39:17,432
You still there?

434
00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:30,795
Hallo?

435
00:39:38,200 --> 00:39:40,236
Not hoarse yet?

436
00:39:40,520 --> 00:39:42,988
Stupid question.
That's not my biggest problem, eh?

437
00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:45,908
Your biggest problem
is your boyfriend.

438
00:39:47,360 --> 00:39:49,635
Someday I'll pay you back for this.

439
00:39:56,360 --> 00:39:57,998
Yes? René? All done?

440
00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:01,678
Yeah, it all went really well.
I've got a good feeling about it.

441
00:40:01,960 --> 00:40:03,359
And who'd you give the statement to?

442
00:40:05,120 --> 00:40:07,111
Right, same as last time: To Brunner!

443
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:08,953
He's not even there!

444
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:12,511
What, not there? How should
I know why he was there!

445
00:40:13,200 --> 00:40:16,988
Just go and make a statement. Don't play
around with Carol and no bullshit stories.

446
00:40:18,040 --> 00:40:19,189
Fuck!

447
00:40:19,480 --> 00:40:21,391
You've got until nine.

448
00:40:30,320 --> 00:40:32,709
Brunner always leaves work at six!

449
00:40:35,920 --> 00:40:38,388
But I think René is on his way now.

450
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:42,470
Hey... Can't you untie me now?

451
00:40:48,560 --> 00:40:50,630
Fritz, can I ask you something?

452
00:40:53,240 --> 00:40:56,869
If you had to choose
between betraying your dream

453
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:00,719
or the best thing
that ever happened to you...

454
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:05,278
Well, in any case, betrayal is the most
fucked up shit. Gotta go take a piss.

455
00:41:11,640 --> 00:41:14,552
- Fritz. What time is it?
- About seven.

456
00:42:01,520 --> 00:42:03,238
You're a total sicko.

457
00:42:04,600 --> 00:42:07,751
No normal person goes through this
crap just to become a cop again.

458
00:42:08,040 --> 00:42:09,109
Shut up.

459
00:42:18,320 --> 00:42:19,992
Are you all doped up?

460
00:42:25,720 --> 00:42:27,199
Hands off that and shut up!

461
00:42:27,440 --> 00:42:31,513
Pills are total shit. You get no
kicks but you're still addicted.

462
00:42:31,960 --> 00:42:33,313
You've got super cold hands.

463
00:42:33,520 --> 00:42:35,272
Just shut up.

464
00:42:35,640 --> 00:42:37,760
If I've got to sit
around in your shitty car,

465
00:42:37,760 --> 00:42:39,512
then at least I
can talk when I want.

466
00:42:39,720 --> 00:42:42,029
If you don't shut up right now,
then I'm driving you to Oberkirch!

467
00:42:42,240 --> 00:42:44,674
And then? Huh?
You can forget your fucking job!

468
00:42:45,360 --> 00:42:46,560
René's making his statement!

469
00:42:46,560 --> 00:42:48,994
I don't care where you are as
long as it's not with him.

470
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:52,910
Fuck you!

471
00:42:58,520 --> 00:42:59,839
Damn it! Stop!

472
00:43:02,720 --> 00:43:05,154
Let go or I'll swallow all your pills!

473
00:43:05,360 --> 00:43:06,395
Cut out the shit!

474
00:43:21,520 --> 00:43:22,748
Fuck you!

475
00:43:31,760 --> 00:43:33,239
Stupid bitch. Damn it!

476
00:44:03,120 --> 00:44:05,918
Shit. I overslept yesterday.

477
00:44:09,040 --> 00:44:10,598
You're such an idiot.

478
00:44:12,680 --> 00:44:16,559
You say you love me,
but heroin's the only thing you love.

479
00:44:32,560 --> 00:44:33,629
What's wrong now?

480
00:44:33,840 --> 00:44:37,435
Sore from playing soccer.

481
00:44:40,120 --> 00:44:41,553
Was it bad?

482
00:44:42,880 --> 00:44:44,518
Just leave me alone.

483
00:44:47,040 --> 00:44:48,678
I'm really glad you're back.

484
00:44:49,480 --> 00:44:52,950
But you know... actually
we're really damn lucky.

485
00:44:53,320 --> 00:44:56,517
- Now Strähl's got to pay!
- Just shut up!

486
00:44:59,440 --> 00:45:01,874
You're such a fucking asshole!

487
00:45:31,760 --> 00:45:32,795
Hello?

488
00:45:33,120 --> 00:45:36,396
You know what?
If you want to be a cop again,

489
00:45:36,600 --> 00:45:38,750
bring me that half-kilo of heroin!

490
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:42,151
Otherwise, instead of saying
I jumped out the window myself,

491
00:45:42,360 --> 00:45:44,476
I'll say you kidnapped Carol!

492
00:46:42,680 --> 00:46:45,240
Strähl! Now that's a nice surprise!

493
00:46:48,880 --> 00:46:50,632
Hey, Ruedi, you know

494
00:46:50,840 --> 00:46:52,512
you said you'd help me out.

495
00:46:54,160 --> 00:46:55,957
Want a bite?

496
00:46:58,520 --> 00:46:59,748
Shoot!

497
00:47:12,440 --> 00:47:13,634
Honeybunny, uh,

498
00:47:13,960 --> 00:47:16,872
give us a second to talk.
We'll pick back up in a minute.

499
00:47:24,720 --> 00:47:29,475
Listen, Strähl... there's no way I can
give you a half-kilo heroin. And what for?

500
00:47:29,880 --> 00:47:33,759
But it's no big deal for you. You'll get it
back in 12 hours, and nobody'll notice.

501
00:47:34,440 --> 00:47:35,395
Okay, but...

502
00:47:36,760 --> 00:47:39,832
But you're a total wacko
who ought to be in therapy.

503
00:47:40,920 --> 00:47:44,356
I mean, the drugs you had
stashed in your desk...

504
00:47:44,760 --> 00:47:49,709
I took a look at the package inserts...
only real psychos eat that kind of stuff.

505
00:47:51,280 --> 00:47:53,316
Listen, have you gone completely nuts?

506
00:47:55,160 --> 00:47:59,073
Don't take it personally but why don't
you go fishing in your little Amazon

507
00:47:59,280 --> 00:48:00,918
and spare me this shit.

508
00:49:06,880 --> 00:49:11,317
Just quickly: Sorry.
I overreacted a little there and...

509
00:49:12,200 --> 00:49:14,111
I think you're doing a good job.

510
00:49:14,400 --> 00:49:15,958
It's not so tough.

511
00:49:16,160 --> 00:49:18,879
I've been watching this Beko guy
for ages. He deals and deals,

512
00:49:19,080 --> 00:49:22,914
but you never catch Berisha with the
dope. Being a narc is really pretty shitty.

513
00:49:24,560 --> 00:49:28,075
Remember your joke about Berisha?
Putting the dope in his Mercedes?

514
00:49:30,480 --> 00:49:31,674
That's a good one.

515
00:49:32,400 --> 00:49:33,833
Let's do it.

516
00:49:39,720 --> 00:49:42,712
I'll give you a call when
I know something.

517
00:50:16,280 --> 00:50:18,271
So, where's your connection?

518
00:50:21,520 --> 00:50:23,829
Hey, Carol, have you seen Beko?

519
00:50:24,040 --> 00:50:25,553
We need something.

520
00:50:26,760 --> 00:50:29,115
Hey, Carol, you won't believe it!
I fucked over that Strähl guy.

521
00:50:29,320 --> 00:50:32,198
Spare me your crap.

522
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:36,195
What now? Who's got something?

523
00:50:38,520 --> 00:50:40,078
You guys into pills?

524
00:51:06,680 --> 00:51:07,874
Strähl, City Police.

525
00:51:08,080 --> 00:51:10,275
I want to help your son
but he doesn't want to be helped!

526
00:51:10,480 --> 00:51:11,515
Don't believe him.

527
00:51:12,080 --> 00:51:13,957
Why does he need help from the police?

528
00:51:14,720 --> 00:51:16,233
My son works at the post office!

529
00:51:17,920 --> 00:51:20,275
We found this on him.
That's heroin.

530
00:51:20,600 --> 00:51:22,113
And that's not from the post office.

531
00:51:23,680 --> 00:51:24,874
It's not true!

532
00:51:30,960 --> 00:51:32,075
Listen, Mrs. Mussafr.

533
00:51:32,440 --> 00:51:34,317
We're planning a big hit
against the drug mafia.

534
00:51:34,600 --> 00:51:36,875
Your son could be
of great help to us.

535
00:51:38,960 --> 00:51:41,474
- Then he wouldn't have to go to prison?
- No.

536
00:51:42,160 --> 00:51:44,549
If he shows us where he got this from,
he doesn't have anything to worry about.

537
00:51:44,800 --> 00:51:46,358
They're going to kill me!

538
00:51:48,480 --> 00:51:50,311
Will you be able
to protect my son?

539
00:51:52,040 --> 00:51:54,634
I promise, Mrs. Mussafr.

540
00:52:02,760 --> 00:52:06,912
Take the laundry with you if you have
to do it in the middle of the night,

541
00:52:07,280 --> 00:52:10,636
or I'll call building management.
But they won't do anything.

542
00:52:11,080 --> 00:52:13,310
You've got to do it all yourself.

543
00:52:16,680 --> 00:52:18,318
Who does this basement belong to?

544
00:52:18,880 --> 00:52:20,711
No idea. I couldn't give a shit.

545
00:52:26,920 --> 00:52:28,876
Man, you trying to fuck with me.
Where's the rest?

546
00:52:29,120 --> 00:52:30,394
Think they tell me anything?

547
00:52:31,400 --> 00:52:33,550
That guy with Berisha brings it here?

548
00:52:33,800 --> 00:52:34,755
Hoxha?

549
00:52:36,280 --> 00:52:37,395
Yes.

550
00:52:44,400 --> 00:52:46,550
Shit. I don't know
anything about this.

551
00:52:48,680 --> 00:52:52,559
Listen: Just keep going like nothing
happened. Leave Berisha to me.

552
00:52:53,920 --> 00:52:55,399
Just don't screw me, okay?

553
00:53:05,840 --> 00:53:08,752
Hey, watch out.
That junk makes you fat!

554
00:53:11,160 --> 00:53:14,072
I don't know. Only retards
break in at a cop's place.

555
00:53:14,280 --> 00:53:15,713
Perhaps that's the
good thing about it.

556
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:19,390
Yeah, you know, no one expects it
and that's what makes it totally easy.

557
00:53:19,720 --> 00:53:22,075
Are you guys wimps
or do you want to break in?

558
00:53:45,920 --> 00:53:48,673
Strähl's nuts. He's got a piranha.

559
00:53:48,920 --> 00:53:50,069
So where are these pills?

560
00:53:50,400 --> 00:53:52,391
Man, that's what we've got to find.

561
00:53:54,880 --> 00:53:56,677
Everybody take a room.

562
00:54:00,320 --> 00:54:01,309
Let me do this.

563
00:54:03,320 --> 00:54:04,753
Hey, I know how it works.

564
00:54:05,120 --> 00:54:06,678
Yeah, but let's hurry.

565
00:54:06,880 --> 00:54:09,075
Those are my keys. Leave me alone!

566
00:54:09,280 --> 00:54:10,554
Boys, I've got it.

567
00:54:13,120 --> 00:54:14,553
That's all?

568
00:54:15,120 --> 00:54:16,348
Where's René?

569
00:54:24,960 --> 00:54:26,678
Come here!

570
00:54:26,960 --> 00:54:28,951
Hey, don't screw around.
We got to get going.

571
00:54:29,240 --> 00:54:30,878
It doesn't matter anymore.

572
00:54:32,040 --> 00:54:33,792
You off your rocker?

573
00:54:38,080 --> 00:54:39,035
Goal.

574
00:54:40,040 --> 00:54:41,359
- Yeah, thanks.
- There.

575
00:54:42,120 --> 00:54:43,519
13 right.

576
00:54:44,520 --> 00:54:46,476
120,000 francs!

577
00:54:48,800 --> 00:54:50,279
- Goal!
- Goal!

578
00:54:52,600 --> 00:54:54,431
It's all just like you said.

579
00:54:56,720 --> 00:54:58,517
And now I'm going to stop doping.

580
00:54:59,920 --> 00:55:01,876
And open up a bike workshop.

581
00:55:02,960 --> 00:55:04,313
The two of us...

582
00:55:07,800 --> 00:55:11,156
- Damn it, what's...
- Shit. Why didn't we get out of here!

583
00:55:11,840 --> 00:55:13,592
Fucking mess! Dammit!

584
00:55:13,800 --> 00:55:17,031
Don't worry. I'll tell him I don't
want anything from him anymore.

585
00:55:17,240 --> 00:55:19,390
- Lowlife shitheads. Fuck!
- Strähl...

586
00:55:19,640 --> 00:55:21,949
You guys insane? Where are my pills?

587
00:55:22,280 --> 00:55:24,840
Something I wanted to tell you...

588
00:55:28,680 --> 00:55:29,669
What's that?

589
00:55:37,080 --> 00:55:38,433
Shit...

590
00:55:39,640 --> 00:55:41,392
- Double bingo!
- But you wanted to...

591
00:55:41,600 --> 00:55:42,999
- Down to the station.
- Let me go!

592
00:55:43,200 --> 00:55:45,350
- Let him go!
- Damn it! That's enough!

593
00:55:53,920 --> 00:55:55,638
Shit, I'll do it.

594
00:56:04,360 --> 00:56:06,999
Shit, René, I don't
have a good feeling

595
00:56:07,240 --> 00:56:10,232
- Why? It'll be fine.
- Just shut the fuck up and go!

596
00:56:13,280 --> 00:56:14,315
Okay...

597
00:56:30,600 --> 00:56:32,830
You probably don't want
to take that in?

598
00:56:33,320 --> 00:56:35,231
Just don't screw up.

599
00:56:43,440 --> 00:56:47,149
Next time you see me,
I'm going to be starting a new life.

600
00:57:05,120 --> 00:57:06,235
That's for you,

601
00:57:07,640 --> 00:57:08,470
sweetheart.

602
00:57:30,600 --> 00:57:31,999
Sugar, coke...

603
00:57:50,800 --> 00:57:52,119
What's up, boss?

604
00:57:58,920 --> 00:58:00,592
You screwed up.

605
00:58:01,320 --> 00:58:03,117
I didn't do anything!

606
00:58:03,360 --> 00:58:06,272
Shut up! Just give us back
what you stole from us!

607
00:58:30,960 --> 00:58:34,509
Somehow we always end up sitting
in the car waiting for René.

608
00:58:40,480 --> 00:58:42,516
What's taking him so long?

609
00:58:48,200 --> 00:58:50,589
You going to give him the dope
when he comes back?

610
00:58:51,280 --> 00:58:52,429
Would you give it to him?

611
00:58:58,600 --> 00:58:59,953
I'll go have a look.

612
00:59:03,280 --> 00:59:06,955
Did a junkie come in here two hours
ago wanting to make a statement?

613
00:59:07,520 --> 00:59:08,953
Ever seen a junkie

614
00:59:09,160 --> 00:59:11,037
wanting to make a statement?

615
01:00:51,520 --> 01:00:54,239
Why don't ya get lost
if you don't like it!

616
01:01:01,120 --> 01:01:02,235
Where is he?

617
01:01:04,920 --> 01:01:06,990
Shit, did they lock him up?

618
01:01:12,880 --> 01:01:14,199
He's dead.

619
01:01:17,320 --> 01:01:19,754
The idiot had to go to the loo first.

620
01:01:31,160 --> 01:01:32,479
Don't call him an idiot.

621
01:01:40,360 --> 01:01:41,793
Shit.

622
01:01:45,080 --> 01:01:46,638
Damn.

623
01:01:49,920 --> 01:01:53,549
He's such an asshole...
such a retard...

624
01:03:50,240 --> 01:03:52,117
What's the matter with you?

625
01:03:53,600 --> 01:03:55,670
Why are you never taking the phone?

626
01:04:45,760 --> 01:04:48,558
Shit. He'd really wanted to
set up his bike workshop again.

627
01:04:51,000 --> 01:04:53,958
And now that he came so close...

628
01:05:06,320 --> 01:05:07,639
He won.

629
01:05:11,000 --> 01:05:12,353
13 for 13.

630
01:05:18,320 --> 01:05:21,710
Fucking hell!
Why wasn't he more careful?

631
01:05:29,440 --> 01:05:31,271
He'd never have quit.

632
01:05:32,440 --> 01:05:34,556
You've got no fucking clue, jerk-off!

633
01:06:04,720 --> 01:06:06,597
Can I have some of your heroin?

634
01:06:26,800 --> 01:06:28,028
Want some too?

635
01:06:33,080 --> 01:06:34,718
You haven't got any more pills.

636
01:08:31,920 --> 01:08:33,399
Not hungry?

637
01:08:39,760 --> 01:08:41,637
Junkies never get hungry either.

638
01:08:53,800 --> 01:08:56,951
Fuck, Vera.
What is it this time?

639
01:08:57,160 --> 01:08:58,195
Stressed out?

640
01:08:59,560 --> 01:09:01,835
Sorry, boys, I'd love to
offer you a beer,

641
01:09:02,040 --> 01:09:05,077
but today's really inconvenient.
- You handling her okay?

642
01:09:05,600 --> 01:09:07,556
Don't you want to introduce
your new babe?

643
01:09:07,840 --> 01:09:09,592
You see, I'm busy. Beat it!

644
01:09:09,800 --> 01:09:12,439
- Are we supposed to put up with that?
- Shit! Carol! Put it away!

645
01:09:13,480 --> 01:09:15,000
Goddamn, Strähl!
What's going on here!

646
01:09:15,000 --> 01:09:16,718
Now you're doing it
with this junkie babe?

647
01:09:28,080 --> 01:09:29,832
Calm down, man!

648
01:09:32,800 --> 01:09:35,314
Damn it, don't act so bloody stupid!

649
01:09:48,440 --> 01:09:51,193
Don't leave me hanging here!

650
01:09:52,000 --> 01:09:53,433
What do you want anyway?

651
01:09:54,840 --> 01:09:55,909
You guys nuts?

652
01:09:56,920 --> 01:09:59,559
Brunner said you'd been
acting weird lately.

653
01:10:00,080 --> 01:10:01,638
And know what? He's right.

654
01:10:02,040 --> 01:10:05,271
Know what?
Brunner can just suck my dick!

655
01:10:05,600 --> 01:10:08,114
And what about the
dead junkie in the loo?

656
01:10:08,320 --> 01:10:10,788
About the prescription
slips from Arbenz?

657
01:10:11,000 --> 01:10:12,831
And what happened to this one?

658
01:10:16,880 --> 01:10:17,869
Shit!

659
01:10:19,120 --> 01:10:20,394
What was that?

660
01:10:21,560 --> 01:10:25,314
The big fish eat the little ones,
unless you're a piranha.

661
01:10:26,440 --> 01:10:27,793
This one's not even dangerous.

662
01:10:33,240 --> 01:10:34,434
Did you get this from her?

663
01:10:40,520 --> 01:10:42,078
Will you just shut up!

664
01:10:42,280 --> 01:10:45,033
How can you stand it with her?
Does she scream in bed like that too?

665
01:10:46,920 --> 01:10:50,549
I would have never thought one of us
would sink so low. Not even Strähl.

666
01:10:51,400 --> 01:10:55,393
Listen. You and me, we don't
let our colleagues drown,

667
01:10:55,800 --> 01:10:57,438
even if they are total loonies and

668
01:10:57,640 --> 01:11:00,393
want to catch a disease between
the legs of a babe like that.

669
01:11:00,960 --> 01:11:02,075
We'll just tell Brunner

670
01:11:02,280 --> 01:11:03,952
the girl had the dope.

671
01:11:04,200 --> 01:11:07,476
And there's no way this Arbenz shit's
going to land you in jail.

672
01:11:08,000 --> 01:11:12,278
You can't do this. Strähl,
tell me you won't do this.

673
01:11:19,280 --> 01:11:21,350
Fuck. Now I'm getting locked up.

674
01:11:29,120 --> 01:11:31,236
Go! And don't let 'em catch you.
I'll take care of this!

675
01:11:31,440 --> 01:11:33,271
- Damn! Son of a bitch!
- Fuck, Strähl!

676
01:11:33,480 --> 01:11:34,754
Have you lost it? Goddamn...

677
01:11:34,960 --> 01:11:37,554
Go ahead and run! Just wait
until Strähl puts the bite on you!

678
01:11:40,320 --> 01:11:41,833
So did that make you feel better?

679
01:11:42,400 --> 01:11:44,630
Do you have to always
screw up everything?

680
01:11:55,600 --> 01:11:57,795
Strähl, damn it! Come on, pick up!

681
01:12:08,640 --> 01:12:10,551
That's him! That's the officer!

682
01:12:10,720 --> 01:12:11,789
Shit.

683
01:12:14,320 --> 01:12:16,356
Strähl, help! They're
going to kill me!

684
01:12:16,680 --> 01:12:18,272
And now? What're you gonna do?

685
01:12:22,960 --> 01:12:25,394
Hey Beko, sorry,
can you just quickly...

686
01:12:28,600 --> 01:12:31,910
Thanks, but sorry,
I'm really in a hurry.

687
01:12:35,720 --> 01:12:36,596
Hello.

688
01:12:47,720 --> 01:12:51,156
Can't do this one. It's much too much.
Can't pay that out.

689
01:12:51,920 --> 01:12:54,275
You have to mail it in and
then they'll send you the money.

690
01:12:56,640 --> 01:12:58,358
But I need the dough right now.

691
01:12:58,640 --> 01:13:00,870
- Sorry, I can't pay out that much...
- But I need the dough right now!

692
01:13:01,080 --> 01:13:02,399
Sorry.

693
01:13:02,680 --> 01:13:04,477
Those are the rules.
I can't pay it out.

694
01:13:04,680 --> 01:13:05,590
Damn!

695
01:13:12,320 --> 01:13:15,153
Do you have a connection who can
trade a 120,000 lotto ticket

696
01:13:15,360 --> 01:13:16,634
for 80,000?

697
01:13:17,040 --> 01:13:18,075
Fast and in cash?

698
01:13:20,680 --> 01:13:21,874
Come on!

699
01:13:23,840 --> 01:13:25,637
Um... is an hour fast enough for you?

700
01:13:52,720 --> 01:13:54,836
Fuck you

701
01:14:04,160 --> 01:14:06,196
- You want to fuck us over?
- No!

702
01:14:06,400 --> 01:14:09,198
- She ain't getting money from us!
- No! We'll take the ticket from her!

703
01:14:11,360 --> 01:14:14,079
The ticket'll get you 120,000 francs.

704
01:14:14,280 --> 01:14:15,474
And then we're even.

705
01:14:23,800 --> 01:14:25,836
But if the girl fucks up,

706
01:14:26,040 --> 01:14:27,758
then you're both in trouble!

707
01:14:55,520 --> 01:14:58,353
I used to think you
were a good police officer.

708
01:15:01,480 --> 01:15:03,436
But this here is like kindergarten.

709
01:15:06,080 --> 01:15:08,560
And if you simply don't answer
the charges by Mrs. Mussafr

710
01:15:08,560 --> 01:15:09,595
and the others, then...

711
01:15:10,520 --> 01:15:12,078
then things look grim.

712
01:15:23,280 --> 01:15:25,920
Admit it! You stole
heroin from Mr. Mussafr,

713
01:15:25,920 --> 01:15:28,388
and there you really
picked on a weak one!

714
01:15:28,640 --> 01:15:30,995
And now he's got
the Albanians after him!

715
01:15:34,880 --> 01:15:35,880
And you don't remember

716
01:15:35,880 --> 01:15:38,519
why you stole the prescription
slips from Dr. Arbenz either.

717
01:15:39,640 --> 01:15:43,110
And then you didn't have anything to do
with the dead junkie in the bathroom.

718
01:15:47,800 --> 01:15:51,918
Well, I really don't see any other possibility
than to call in the prosecutor's office.

719
01:15:56,280 --> 01:15:58,840
Then what? What'll you tell them?

720
01:15:59,960 --> 01:16:02,952
That I stole a half-kilo
heroin from Beko?

721
01:16:03,400 --> 01:16:05,868
And where'd a small-time street dealer

722
01:16:06,080 --> 01:16:07,280
get a half-kilo of heroin?

723
01:16:07,280 --> 01:16:09,748
And anyway, you guys are
trailing Beko day and night.

724
01:16:10,360 --> 01:16:11,720
You never noticed anything?

725
01:16:11,720 --> 01:16:14,359
And you think the prosecutor's
going to believe you?

726
01:16:14,560 --> 01:16:16,710
Or believe a mom of
someone with a record?

727
01:16:17,160 --> 01:16:18,560
Do you still have it together or what?

728
01:16:18,560 --> 01:16:20,278
Don't you have anything
better to do? Know what?

729
01:16:20,480 --> 01:16:22,994
This is and always will be
a fucking lousy outfit, damn it!

730
01:16:24,880 --> 01:16:25,835
Sorry,

731
01:16:27,200 --> 01:16:29,077
Flaky Beat said Beko is

732
01:16:29,280 --> 01:16:31,316
out with another Albanian.

733
01:16:32,320 --> 01:16:33,753
And he said... I don't know,

734
01:16:33,960 --> 01:16:37,157
it doesn't make sense... he said
they'd picked up something at a kiosk,

735
01:16:37,360 --> 01:16:39,430
something with the lottery.

736
01:16:39,640 --> 01:16:42,200
And your babe was with them too.

737
01:16:46,560 --> 01:16:47,515
Shit. Know what?

738
01:16:47,800 --> 01:16:50,268
Go ahead and do whatever
you want with your prosecutor.

739
01:16:55,760 --> 01:16:59,912
- Hey, baby. Now show me the ticket.
- Now first you show me the 80,000.

740
01:17:00,280 --> 01:17:01,599
The girl's here.

741
01:17:01,840 --> 01:17:02,875
You idiot, what're you waiting for?

742
01:17:03,080 --> 01:17:05,878
You're always screwing up. Kill
her off and bring me the money!

743
01:17:06,080 --> 01:17:07,195
He's got the money.

744
01:17:11,040 --> 01:17:12,837
You got something?

745
01:17:14,520 --> 01:17:15,794
Sorry, Anz, not now.

746
01:17:16,040 --> 01:17:18,440
Then what're you doing
with that guy there?

747
01:17:18,440 --> 01:17:19,589
Hey, you guys crazy?

748
01:17:19,800 --> 01:17:21,836
Come on, now we're doing business.

749
01:17:24,440 --> 01:17:25,793
Get the ticket from her!

750
01:17:26,080 --> 01:17:27,832
What's this? Where's the cash?

751
01:17:30,920 --> 01:17:32,797
Give me the ticket and it'll be fine.

752
01:17:35,720 --> 01:17:37,278
The money, damn it!

753
01:17:37,560 --> 01:17:38,788
What is this shit?

754
01:17:39,040 --> 01:17:40,314
Or we're going up in smoke.

755
01:17:44,480 --> 01:17:45,993
Hey! Are you guys crazy?

756
01:17:49,760 --> 01:17:52,274
Get the ticket from her!
Come on, do it!

757
01:18:30,400 --> 01:18:31,799
Freeze!

758
01:18:40,280 --> 01:18:41,599
What are you doing here? Get lost!

759
01:18:41,960 --> 01:18:45,555
In a sec. But first let's do
that joke with Berisha's

760
01:18:45,760 --> 01:18:47,637
Mercedes.
- Have you lost it, man?

761
01:18:47,840 --> 01:18:50,559
You want to just fish around a little
or really catch one?

762
01:18:52,600 --> 01:18:54,511
Soon you'll be rid of Berisha too.

763
01:18:55,120 --> 01:18:56,917
Well, yeah, you said that before.

764
01:18:57,160 --> 01:18:59,958
Give me an hour.
And you take a look in the trunk.

765
01:19:22,880 --> 01:19:26,156
We could have easily kept
some dope for ourselves.

766
01:19:26,880 --> 01:19:30,316
A little less would have still
kept the guy in jail long enough.

767
01:19:32,800 --> 01:19:34,711
Too late now.

768
01:19:39,520 --> 01:19:41,750
Do you know the Smarties oracle?

769
01:19:43,480 --> 01:19:46,711
The first five you take
will tell you the future.

770
01:19:56,360 --> 01:19:58,191
And what does that mean now?

771
01:19:59,080 --> 01:20:01,469
Red's for love,
purple for wild times

772
01:20:02,120 --> 01:20:03,997
and brown for shit.

773
01:20:12,960 --> 01:20:15,349
Now you've got to eat them,
otherwise it won't work.

774
01:20:23,000 --> 01:20:24,274
So cool.
