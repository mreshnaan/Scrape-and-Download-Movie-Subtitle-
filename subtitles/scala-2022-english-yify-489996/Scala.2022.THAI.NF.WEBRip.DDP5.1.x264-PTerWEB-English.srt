1
00:00:59,583 --> 00:01:03,708
Hello! You are here by yourself?

2
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:47,458
Alright. Let it down.

3
00:01:47,541 --> 00:01:48,958
Bring it down slowly.

4
00:01:53,583 --> 00:01:54,875
Slowly.

5
00:02:19,333 --> 00:02:21,041
Give it to me.

6
00:02:31,708 --> 00:02:35,833
Slow down.
It's too fast for them to shoot.

7
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:44,083
No. It's like a construction site.
You take it down, and that's all.

8
00:02:44,166 --> 00:02:45,458
How many floors today?

9
00:02:45,541 --> 00:02:47,250
Every floor.

10
00:02:47,333 --> 00:02:51,125
I'm going to wash my hands.
Wash my hands so that...

11
00:02:51,208 --> 00:02:52,708
Yes, everything, including the frame.

12
00:02:55,333 --> 00:02:57,291
Hey, hey.

13
00:02:57,375 --> 00:02:58,958
Let's film this guy more.

14
00:03:00,541 --> 00:03:02,166
Shoot him more

15
00:03:03,125 --> 00:03:04,833
- Still won't shut up.
- At first,

16
00:03:04,916 --> 00:03:07,708
I didn't remember
you were Sakchai's daughter.

17
00:03:08,583 --> 00:03:10,041
What? Really?

18
00:03:10,125 --> 00:03:11,291
This is Sakchai's daughter.

19
00:03:11,375 --> 00:03:12,666
I don't remember at all.

20
00:03:14,083 --> 00:03:16,208
It's been so many years. How's miss Leka?

21
00:03:17,208 --> 00:03:19,541
- She's getting old now.
- Really?

22
00:03:19,625 --> 00:03:21,791
- Can she walk?
- She manages.

23
00:03:22,833 --> 00:03:24,250
You live with her, right?

24
00:03:25,291 --> 00:03:27,166
Do you still live with miss Leka?

25
00:03:29,750 --> 00:03:30,958
She changed a lot.

26
00:03:31,041 --> 00:03:32,166
Completely different.

27
00:03:32,250 --> 00:03:35,083
I remember her
as a little girl with glasses.

28
00:03:35,166 --> 00:03:37,416
Her face changed after she's grown.

29
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:21,208
<i>I think every cinema bans cats.</i>

30
00:04:22,166 --> 00:04:25,333
<i>But the multiplex cinemas in the shopping
malls might not have such problems.</i>

31
00:04:26,375 --> 00:04:28,333
<i>In the Siam cinema projection box,</i>

32
00:04:28,416 --> 00:04:33,000
<i>there's a sign on the door to the rooftop
that says, "keep cats out."</i>

33
00:04:33,916 --> 00:04:37,500
<i>One day, I found a cat
staring at me at my bedroom door,</i>

34
00:04:37,583 --> 00:04:41,166
<i>which means it would have had to walk
through the entire projection box.</i>

35
00:04:41,833 --> 00:04:43,500
<i>We stared into
each other's eyes for a while</i>

36
00:04:43,583 --> 00:04:46,208
<i>before I kicked it out
so no one would notice.</i>

37
00:04:47,541 --> 00:04:50,500
<i>Even with a label saying,
"do not feed the cats,"</i>

38
00:04:50,583 --> 00:04:53,291
<i>Auntie Cha-Um, the office janitor,</i>

39
00:04:53,375 --> 00:04:56,000
<i>would just keep feeding them
on the rooftops anyways.</i>

40
00:05:00,250 --> 00:05:03,208
It's stuck. I can't take it off.

41
00:05:10,250 --> 00:05:12,250
Do we still have to drive the cats out?

42
00:05:13,458 --> 00:05:14,833
No, not anymore

43
00:05:28,583 --> 00:05:31,000
Does your dad know
that they're tearing down Scala?

44
00:05:31,083 --> 00:05:32,458
Have you talked to him?

45
00:05:32,541 --> 00:05:33,875
No calls?

46
00:05:33,958 --> 00:05:36,291
I meant to call him too,
but I got too busy.

47
00:05:37,375 --> 00:05:40,250
I think it was in late 1973.

48
00:05:46,291 --> 00:05:51,375
It was 40, 45 years ago.

49
00:05:52,583 --> 00:05:53,791
Around 1974.

50
00:05:56,666 --> 00:05:59,666
In the beginning,
the Scala had 1,200 seats.

51
00:05:59,750 --> 00:06:02,791
It was the biggest one.

52
00:06:04,958 --> 00:06:07,791
Siam Cinema had 900 seats.

53
00:06:08,416 --> 00:06:09,958
The Lido Theater had 1,000 seats.

54
00:06:11,208 --> 00:06:12,750
This cinema had the most.

55
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:23,125
I think it's the end
of that October protest.

56
00:06:23,208 --> 00:06:25,458
So I started working here
at the end of 1973.

57
00:06:26,291 --> 00:06:28,250
It was December, I remember.

58
00:06:29,416 --> 00:06:31,916
But I actually was working
at Samyan cinema first.

59
00:06:32,458 --> 00:06:34,000
- Samyan?
- Samyan.

60
00:06:34,083 --> 00:06:37,583
It's the place where...

61
00:06:38,541 --> 00:06:41,291
There were Samyan cinemas
next to Hua Lamphong temple.

62
00:06:41,375 --> 00:06:43,208
You didn't know?

63
00:06:44,708 --> 00:06:46,500
It's a cinema screening Chinese movies.

64
00:06:46,583 --> 00:06:49,000
There are the Samyan and Rama cinemas.

65
00:06:49,750 --> 00:06:56,250
I worked there for over a year
before moving to Lido in 1975.

66
00:06:59,625 --> 00:07:02,708
I remember seeing you
and your father always arguing

67
00:07:02,791 --> 00:07:04,708
when I was working at the Siam Cinema.

68
00:07:05,291 --> 00:07:09,291
At first, you guys were able to
talk normally, and soon started arguing.

69
00:07:09,375 --> 00:07:11,208
That's why Ms. Leka always said,

70
00:07:12,375 --> 00:07:15,375
"If you can't take care of her,
give her to me. I will do it myself!"

71
00:07:15,458 --> 00:07:16,875
That's what she said.

72
00:07:23,125 --> 00:07:25,833
He was an ill-tempered man.

73
00:07:26,708 --> 00:07:28,833
He did not want your mother
to see or meet you.

74
00:07:28,916 --> 00:07:31,500
It's like he doesn't want you
to contact each other.

75
00:07:33,875 --> 00:07:35,250
So he had to...

76
00:07:35,333 --> 00:07:36,833
That's why you never saw her.

77
00:07:37,625 --> 00:07:40,500
I don't have a picture of her either.

78
00:07:41,375 --> 00:07:43,375
Back then, what should I say?

79
00:07:43,458 --> 00:07:49,041
Taking pictures wasn't easy.

80
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,875
<i>Uncle Nao was
a projectionist at Siam cinema.</i>

81
00:07:55,541 --> 00:07:57,958
<i>It was at the Siam cinema projection box
where I first met him.</i>

82
00:07:59,916 --> 00:08:03,708
<i>I don't remember
when I started living in the Siam cinema.</i>

83
00:08:03,791 --> 00:08:06,333
<i>Before I knew it,
I was already running around the place.</i>

84
00:08:07,791 --> 00:08:10,583
<i>But the Lido and the Scala,
I didn't really visit so much back then</i>

85
00:08:10,666 --> 00:08:14,041
<i>unless there was a film I wanted to see
that was not shown at our cinema.</i>

86
00:08:15,583 --> 00:08:19,375
<i>Although the Scala
may look prettier than her sisters,</i>

87
00:08:19,458 --> 00:08:23,375
<i>I didn't feel that they were
so different on the inside.</i>

88
00:09:35,416 --> 00:09:37,291
Go, go.

89
00:09:40,083 --> 00:09:43,125
Stop.

90
00:09:46,833 --> 00:09:51,541
They've been here since 8:30 a.m.

91
00:09:53,583 --> 00:09:57,208
They didn't have the scaffoldings.
They just started taking them off.

92
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,583
Yes, but...

93
00:10:02,875 --> 00:10:05,583
Yes, someone's assisting him.

94
00:10:08,958 --> 00:10:11,333
Yes, it seems all right now.

95
00:10:17,458 --> 00:10:19,375
<i>At this corner
of the Siam cinema projection room,</i>

96
00:10:19,458 --> 00:10:21,791
<i>there was a door to our bedroom.</i>

97
00:10:22,625 --> 00:10:24,750
<i>Our bed lied underneath
the huge air tubes.</i>

98
00:10:25,583 --> 00:10:28,916
<i>My sheets were the same fabric
as the curtains at the cinema's entrance.</i>

99
00:10:29,666 --> 00:10:32,958
<i>I remember because I liked to run
and brush these curtains with my hands</i>

100
00:10:33,041 --> 00:10:36,083
<i>while waiting for The Royal Anthem to end
so I could enjoy the film right away.</i>

101
00:10:41,708 --> 00:10:44,541
They can't start pulling the curtains down
because it might rip something.

102
00:10:44,625 --> 00:10:46,583
- They're expensive curtains.
- There's a procedure!

103
00:10:46,666 --> 00:10:48,958
- They're fireproof.
- No, it's...

104
00:10:49,041 --> 00:10:51,791
- No, just remove the hoops!
- Right.

105
00:10:52,291 --> 00:10:53,625
- Ready?
- Okay!

106
00:10:54,458 --> 00:10:57,166
- I will do it in slow-motion, okay?
- Okay!

107
00:10:57,708 --> 00:11:00,458
One, two, three.

108
00:11:13,208 --> 00:11:17,416
Maybe it can be recycled
into a prosthetic leg.

109
00:11:18,291 --> 00:11:20,958
- No, it's metal.
- It can't be.

110
00:11:21,041 --> 00:11:23,166
- It's metal?
- Metal!

111
00:11:24,291 --> 00:11:25,333
It will rust.

112
00:11:25,416 --> 00:11:27,666
- I thought it was aluminum.
- You sure?

113
00:11:28,416 --> 00:11:29,708
Damn, it's metal.

114
00:11:29,791 --> 00:11:32,250
- You want to get tetanus?
- Right.

115
00:12:03,833 --> 00:12:06,125
- Where's Yod?
- Come here.

116
00:12:06,208 --> 00:12:08,875
- Why don't you turn the light on?
- Pull it.

117
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,333
Can we rest a bit?

118
00:12:26,333 --> 00:12:28,000
Let's take a break.

119
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:31,833
Let's take a break.

120
00:12:33,583 --> 00:12:35,625
How about pulling this way?

121
00:12:35,708 --> 00:12:37,708
No, you have to go in an angle that way.

122
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:50,750
The rope broke.

123
00:12:50,833 --> 00:12:52,541
Even the rope broke.

124
00:13:14,416 --> 00:13:15,666
That's the last of it.

125
00:13:17,833 --> 00:13:19,625
Just move the rest of the curtains.

126
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:02,041
Are you making a review video?

127
00:14:03,916 --> 00:14:06,583
No, more like a documentary film.

128
00:14:07,958 --> 00:14:09,583
It's sad, isn't it?

129
00:14:10,583 --> 00:14:14,208
Some say they used to come here
when they were a child.

130
00:14:14,958 --> 00:14:19,291
People in their 30s
saying they used to come to the Scala.

131
00:14:20,708 --> 00:14:24,250
Some older folks came here,
just realizing that it's being demolished,

132
00:14:24,916 --> 00:14:28,125
and would say they came here since
they were in their teens.

133
00:14:32,625 --> 00:14:36,666
Well, times changed.
Things have to change too.

134
00:14:37,708 --> 00:14:39,625
What was new became something newer.

135
00:15:00,208 --> 00:15:02,708
Your side down, that side lifts.

136
00:15:09,583 --> 00:15:11,583
- That side first.
- Lift.

137
00:15:13,750 --> 00:15:16,916
Don't lift yet! Don't lift yet!

138
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,000
If you're not ready, just don't do it.

139
00:15:21,875 --> 00:15:23,125
Wait, wait.

140
00:15:39,291 --> 00:15:41,166
No one below to catch?

141
00:16:14,583 --> 00:16:16,208
- No.
- No.

142
00:16:17,041 --> 00:16:19,708
Did you see that court order?

143
00:16:19,791 --> 00:16:24,083
The opposition party won the vote
but did not get a seat.

144
00:16:26,958 --> 00:16:30,750
Just because
he makes small merits with the monks.

145
00:16:32,500 --> 00:16:37,083
Now the election committee just revoked
his seat in the parliament.

146
00:16:53,291 --> 00:16:57,291
How much did Yod win in the lotto?

147
00:16:57,375 --> 00:16:58,625
Three hundred?

148
00:17:15,833 --> 00:17:17,833
- This?
- This one first.

149
00:17:18,416 --> 00:17:19,375
Take it here.

150
00:17:20,416 --> 00:17:21,916
Where to go?

151
00:17:23,833 --> 00:17:25,833
- Where?
- Right here.

152
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,208
It's just a frame.

153
00:17:54,166 --> 00:17:59,000
So, I went to work with uncle Saiyud
at the Siam theater.

154
00:18:03,333 --> 00:18:07,625
Back then, all the Siam staff had quit.

155
00:18:08,500 --> 00:18:10,416
I think it was Sompoj, right?

156
00:18:12,625 --> 00:18:13,666
Sompoj.

157
00:18:14,875 --> 00:18:17,958
I was sent to help Sompoj,

158
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:22,125
and then I came back here.

159
00:18:24,500 --> 00:18:28,000
I remember seeing you
walk to school back then.

160
00:18:30,958 --> 00:18:36,541
THIS SITE, THEREFORE, HOLDS A HISTORICAL
IMPORTANCE IN THAI FILM HISTORY.

161
00:18:36,625 --> 00:18:42,583
THIS PLAQUE WAS INSTALLED HERE
ON WORLD AUDIOVISUAL HERITAGE DAY.

162
00:18:42,666 --> 00:18:46,750
OCTOBER 27TH, 2019

163
00:19:18,208 --> 00:19:21,791
It was only after the cinema closed
that I know how to change the lights.

164
00:19:21,875 --> 00:19:26,583
- Let me see.
- And now I'm an electrician.

165
00:19:26,666 --> 00:19:28,541
You still got it.

166
00:19:28,625 --> 00:19:30,041
Yes, but getting soft now.

167
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,000
Just learning to be an electrician now.

168
00:19:33,083 --> 00:19:36,666
How disappointed my parents would be.

169
00:19:38,041 --> 00:19:42,375
They said that to Gen.

170
00:19:42,458 --> 00:19:45,333
That's all you get
from working in Bangkok?

171
00:19:45,416 --> 00:19:47,666
Hold this, then. Yes, climb up.

172
00:19:47,750 --> 00:19:50,666
- Pull?
- No, you hold it from the right. Yes.

173
00:19:52,041 --> 00:19:54,333
Hang on, give me a second.
Big hammer go up.

174
00:19:55,208 --> 00:19:56,625
Hold it like this

175
00:19:57,750 --> 00:19:59,166
- Hey.
- Hey.

176
00:19:59,250 --> 00:20:01,958
- Blackout again?
- Blackout again.

177
00:20:02,041 --> 00:20:03,916
- Just let it go. I can't see.
- Okay.

178
00:20:04,958 --> 00:20:07,750
I can't see. Can you see, Gap?

179
00:20:09,916 --> 00:20:11,875
Who hit the light switch?

180
00:20:21,833 --> 00:20:26,458
<i>The cinema employees were both Bangkokians
and people from other provinces.</i>

181
00:20:26,541 --> 00:20:28,916
<i>Most of them are probably
from the Northeastern region.</i>

182
00:20:30,041 --> 00:20:33,916
<i>When I first came,
I couldn't understand their dialect much.</i>

183
00:20:34,916 --> 00:20:37,375
<i>I started to understand after a while.</i>

184
00:20:39,500 --> 00:20:41,708
<i>Back when there were still
a lot of employees,</i>

185
00:20:41,791 --> 00:20:46,083
<i>at the end of the day, we would turn off
the air conditioners, close the doors,</i>

186
00:20:46,166 --> 00:20:48,458
<i>and spread out the sheet
to sleep in front of the screen.</i>

187
00:20:48,541 --> 00:20:50,791
<i>The air remained cool
until the next morning.</i>

188
00:20:52,583 --> 00:20:57,291
<i>We can talk about this...</i>

189
00:20:57,375 --> 00:20:59,125
<i>I love him because he said...</i>

190
00:20:59,208 --> 00:21:02,458
<i>it's not about gender...</i>

191
00:21:03,916 --> 00:21:07,375
Don't know who won the lottery.

192
00:21:07,458 --> 00:21:13,750
PEKING DUCK

193
00:21:26,125 --> 00:21:27,083
Gen and Nao.

194
00:21:27,916 --> 00:21:29,208
And...

195
00:21:29,291 --> 00:21:31,000
Lee and Apaiwong.

196
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:33,541
How about Arun?

197
00:21:33,625 --> 00:21:34,958
Nao and Yo.

198
00:21:35,041 --> 00:21:40,041
- Arun?
- Arun is reporting for unemployment.

199
00:21:45,416 --> 00:21:48,541
<i>I attended primary school
at Wat Pathum Wanaram.</i>

200
00:21:49,416 --> 00:21:52,958
<i>Most of my friends are descendants of
the people who work around the Siam area.</i>

201
00:21:53,041 --> 00:21:56,000
<i>Some of them have homes
in the slums next to the school.</i>

202
00:21:56,916 --> 00:21:59,041
<i>One day, when I was in fourth grade,</i>

203
00:21:59,833 --> 00:22:02,666
<i>a friend shouted
that my house was on fire.</i>

204
00:22:03,791 --> 00:22:07,458
<i>We saw a huge smoke
rising from Siam Square.</i>

205
00:22:07,541 --> 00:22:10,458
<i>But I think the smoke
was most likely coming from the Lido.</i>

206
00:22:11,416 --> 00:22:14,333
<i>After school,
I hurried back to the Siam cinema,</i>

207
00:22:14,416 --> 00:22:16,666
<i>and turns out it was safe.</i>

208
00:22:17,583 --> 00:22:23,250
<i>After the fire, the Lido was renovated
into a three-screen multiplex cinema.</i>

209
00:22:32,375 --> 00:22:34,666
Oh, your camera is set up already.

210
00:22:34,750 --> 00:22:36,458
- Have you eaten yet?
- No.

211
00:22:36,541 --> 00:22:39,625
No? Not hungry?

212
00:22:39,708 --> 00:22:40,833
I'll eat later.

213
00:22:40,916 --> 00:22:42,208
DO NOT ENTER WITHOUT PERMISSION

214
00:22:42,291 --> 00:22:45,625
I just bought bread
but gave it all to the others.

215
00:22:47,625 --> 00:22:49,000
You can use the toilet too.

216
00:22:50,916 --> 00:22:54,333
Come, have some hot Ovaltine.
It's still warm.

217
00:22:54,416 --> 00:22:55,583
Oh, thank you.

218
00:22:55,666 --> 00:22:57,625
Someone brought me this cookie.

219
00:22:58,333 --> 00:23:00,666
It's quite good. Crispy and yummy.

220
00:23:02,083 --> 00:23:04,625
It's their snack.
Aunt Sarai brought it for them.

221
00:23:04,708 --> 00:23:06,708
They won a lotto, so they brought some.

222
00:23:08,875 --> 00:23:10,333
They actually won the lotto.

223
00:23:10,416 --> 00:23:12,083
They are so cute. And clever too.

224
00:23:12,166 --> 00:23:15,666
They will give whatever you ask for.

225
00:23:18,791 --> 00:23:20,208
They're cute, aren't they?

226
00:23:22,250 --> 00:23:27,375
<i>Back then, the aunties in the office
would bring food just like this.</i>

227
00:23:28,375 --> 00:23:32,041
<i>Auntie Ree, the head of the ticket office,
liked making stewed eggs,</i>

228
00:23:32,125 --> 00:23:35,250
<i>while auntie Leka, the accountant,
always brought steamed buns.</i>

229
00:23:38,375 --> 00:23:43,333
<i>I spent most of the time with those
office aunties while Dad was at work.</i>

230
00:23:45,041 --> 00:23:48,291
<i>At first, it was them
who brought me to the cinema.</i>

231
00:23:48,958 --> 00:23:51,916
<i>Now that I've grown up,
I prefer to go alone.</i>

232
00:23:56,750 --> 00:24:01,958
OUTSIDERS ARE PROHIBITED FROM ENTERING.

233
00:24:05,250 --> 00:24:09,416
BIRDS OF PREY

234
00:24:09,500 --> 00:24:13,666
BIRDS OF PREY

235
00:24:13,750 --> 00:24:18,916
I'm almost 60 years old.
Who would hire someone this old?

236
00:24:22,375 --> 00:24:25,000
So there is a saying
that over the age of 50,

237
00:24:25,083 --> 00:24:26,875
one can only be a security guard.

238
00:24:27,833 --> 00:24:29,916
But I can't stay awake that long.

239
00:24:31,916 --> 00:24:33,250
Too exhausting.

240
00:24:34,291 --> 00:24:38,083
So I have to stay as long as possible
before everyone departs back home.

241
00:24:39,541 --> 00:24:41,666
Your father
started working here before me.

242
00:24:45,125 --> 00:24:46,875
Did my father use to work at Scala first?

243
00:24:46,958 --> 00:24:51,291
Your dad worked
at the APEX company right over there.

244
00:24:51,375 --> 00:24:52,416
He was...

245
00:24:53,333 --> 00:24:57,458
a programmer. He booked films.

246
00:24:58,041 --> 00:25:00,708
His duties were different.

247
00:25:00,791 --> 00:25:04,958
Your dad's office was over there.
APEX was there.

248
00:25:05,041 --> 00:25:08,166
He took the film
to the censorship department,

249
00:25:08,250 --> 00:25:10,583
then to the film labs,
and then to the cinemas.

250
00:25:12,541 --> 00:25:17,541
But I started as an usher.

251
00:25:17,625 --> 00:25:20,000
I used to wear the yellow jackets.

252
00:25:20,083 --> 00:25:22,416
I'm that old.

253
00:25:22,500 --> 00:25:26,666
From usher to the chief.

254
00:25:27,375 --> 00:25:29,000
It took me 51 years.

255
00:25:31,375 --> 00:25:34,791
Back then, we were just like any teenager.

256
00:25:35,833 --> 00:25:40,458
We ate, drank, and hung out,
just like any normal teenager.

257
00:25:41,791 --> 00:25:45,416
And your mom worked
at the snack bar in her yellow uniform.

258
00:25:56,708 --> 00:25:59,000
The rope can't take the weight.

259
00:26:00,708 --> 00:26:03,625
It'll cut your hand if you pull it.

260
00:26:03,708 --> 00:26:07,000
- This is dangerous work, you know.
- Be careful.

261
00:26:26,583 --> 00:26:31,333
We all came after it opened.
How could we know?

262
00:26:31,416 --> 00:26:36,333
Even Gap's dad didn't know.
He came after the cinema opened.

263
00:26:36,416 --> 00:26:38,083
- After the cinema opened?
- Yes.

264
00:26:38,166 --> 00:26:41,166
Who knows who built this screen.

265
00:26:42,625 --> 00:26:46,916
But the guy
who brought the chandelier might know.

266
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:49,291
- Right, the owner of this thing.
- Girl.

267
00:26:49,375 --> 00:26:51,333
- Yes, the chandelier's owner.
- I saw...

268
00:26:51,416 --> 00:26:54,083
I saw him on the last day
of the screening. He could barely walk.

269
00:26:54,166 --> 00:26:56,375
Yes, he is that generation.

270
00:26:56,458 --> 00:27:00,125
Pull it away, Nao, Yod.

271
00:27:00,208 --> 00:27:02,416
Pull away. It's stuck here.

272
00:27:05,208 --> 00:27:06,708
Go sideways.

273
00:27:09,375 --> 00:27:13,041
Hey, do you mind if I ask you something?
Have you met your mother?

274
00:27:13,125 --> 00:27:14,625
- No.
- No?

275
00:27:14,708 --> 00:27:18,041
- Not since you were very young, right?
- Have you ever met my mother?

276
00:27:18,125 --> 00:27:22,166
Yes, I used to visit her at her house.

277
00:27:22,250 --> 00:27:24,666
The house near the mosque.

278
00:27:25,458 --> 00:27:30,208
I remember your mother had very fair skin.

279
00:27:30,291 --> 00:27:32,916
- She is from Phetchaburi, right?
- I don't know.

280
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:34,750
Don't you know?

281
00:27:34,833 --> 00:27:36,250
I've seen her live there.

282
00:27:38,583 --> 00:27:39,833
Disassemble this first.

283
00:27:39,916 --> 00:27:42,583
- Come here first.
- Shall I disassemble it?

284
00:27:43,791 --> 00:27:45,750
Can it disassemble?
Or should we move it like that?

285
00:27:45,833 --> 00:27:47,000
It can't.

286
00:27:55,958 --> 00:27:57,125
Move it.

287
00:28:00,125 --> 00:28:01,750
Where's that cat that likes taking photos?

288
00:28:01,833 --> 00:28:04,000
Probably got startled and ran away.

289
00:28:13,041 --> 00:28:16,958
<i>There were two large windows
in the Siam cinema office.</i>

290
00:28:17,041 --> 00:28:20,083
<i>From there,
you can see almost everyone downstairs.</i>

291
00:28:21,041 --> 00:28:23,416
<i>Next to the window was a table.</i>

292
00:28:23,500 --> 00:28:26,250
<i>There were six phones on the table.</i>

293
00:28:27,208 --> 00:28:30,375
<i>When it rang and no one was around,</i>

294
00:28:30,458 --> 00:28:33,625
<i>I would answer
and give some general information,</i>

295
00:28:33,708 --> 00:28:36,041
<i>such as the showtimes.</i>

296
00:28:37,625 --> 00:28:40,708
<i>One day,
auntie Ree brought me to that window.</i>

297
00:28:40,791 --> 00:28:43,958
<i>She pointed down to the popcorn cabinet
and asked if I could see my mom.</i>

298
00:28:44,041 --> 00:28:45,791
<i>"She's standing right there."</i>

299
00:28:47,083 --> 00:28:49,750
<i>I think I was becoming short-sighted then.</i>

300
00:28:50,750 --> 00:28:53,750
<i>All I saw was a blurry shape of a person.</i>

301
00:28:53,833 --> 00:28:57,083
<i>Auntie Ree also told me not to tell
my father about what had just happened.</i>

302
00:28:58,875 --> 00:29:01,750
<i>I was very curious
what would happen if he found out.</i>

303
00:29:02,583 --> 00:29:06,666
<i>So I told him
after he came back from work.</i>

304
00:29:07,625 --> 00:29:09,666
<i>He just left the room immediately.</i>

305
00:29:09,750 --> 00:29:12,166
<i>I never heard about my mother ever again.</i>

306
00:29:20,875 --> 00:29:22,375
It's burning.

307
00:29:36,208 --> 00:29:39,416
I can't fix this.

308
00:29:43,375 --> 00:29:44,583
You full already?

309
00:29:50,958 --> 00:29:54,208
Thirty-nine years.
If this was a big company...

310
00:29:54,291 --> 00:29:58,333
by now, I would have been
compensated enough to be rich.

311
00:29:58,416 --> 00:30:00,583
Why did you choose to work here?

312
00:30:01,666 --> 00:30:03,250
I didn't have an education.

313
00:30:04,791 --> 00:30:08,541
I didn't pursue an education back then.
I only finished the 4th grade.

314
00:30:08,625 --> 00:30:13,916
At that time, 30 or 40 years ago.

315
00:30:16,375 --> 00:30:22,333
Without any educational background,
I have to do whatever I can.

316
00:30:23,541 --> 00:30:29,458
I thought about leaving,
but there weren't any other jobs.

317
00:30:29,541 --> 00:30:36,000
I had no education or credentials.
Nothing to build upon.

318
00:30:37,333 --> 00:30:42,000
I had no choice. Nowhere to go.

319
00:30:42,083 --> 00:30:43,916
So I have to stay as long as I can.

320
00:30:46,541 --> 00:30:48,416
Long enough until I became the chief.

321
00:30:50,958 --> 00:30:53,666
From usher to the chief.

322
00:31:06,833 --> 00:31:10,458
Oh, didn't see you there.

323
00:31:16,541 --> 00:31:18,833
It's so dark today.

324
00:31:21,666 --> 00:31:24,041
- Isn't that a 50-Satang coin?
- Wow, a coin.

325
00:31:24,125 --> 00:31:26,125
Move the light, move the light.

326
00:31:27,166 --> 00:31:29,208
There's my one Baht.

327
00:31:30,666 --> 00:31:33,333
Got only a Baht today.

328
00:31:33,416 --> 00:31:35,833
Yesterday, I found a ten Baht coin.

329
00:31:38,583 --> 00:31:41,666
Like picking coins
from a Krathong at the festival.

330
00:31:47,916 --> 00:31:49,666
Is that a cigarette butt?

331
00:31:49,750 --> 00:31:51,375
Since when?

332
00:31:51,458 --> 00:31:55,791
- Around 30 years?
- It was legal 30, 40 years ago.

333
00:31:57,333 --> 00:32:00,291
People in the past were able
to smoke cigarettes in movie theaters.

334
00:32:00,375 --> 00:32:03,291
The ban on smoking in cinemas
was only passed in 1979.

335
00:32:03,375 --> 00:32:05,791
Before that,
they hadn't banned smoking in cinemas yet.

336
00:32:10,875 --> 00:32:12,625
Please tell
those three-fingered protesters

337
00:32:12,708 --> 00:32:14,500
to go to Ratchadamnoen Road.

338
00:32:16,666 --> 00:32:19,875
No, they already changed their plans.

339
00:32:19,958 --> 00:32:21,750
They are coming here.

340
00:32:24,083 --> 00:32:28,708
See? They turn the police into clowns.

341
00:32:28,791 --> 00:32:32,916
After 10:00 p.m., the protesters go home.
What can the police do?

342
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:37,791
Spend 200 million Baht
to chase protestors like this?

343
00:32:39,333 --> 00:32:43,916
- They took the soldiers from everywhere.
- And who knows how many soldiers came.

344
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:48,291
- What a waste of money.
- Yes, a waste of money. They said...

345
00:32:48,375 --> 00:32:50,666
Be careful not to talk about politics.

346
00:32:52,250 --> 00:32:55,125
Cut it out of the film, okay, Gap?

347
00:32:55,208 --> 00:32:57,791
I guess I've already sworn a lot anyways.

348
00:33:07,875 --> 00:33:11,041
- I can't even catch my breath.
- Again? Watch your head.

349
00:33:18,208 --> 00:33:19,750
Watch yourselves. Watch yourselves.

350
00:33:19,833 --> 00:33:21,416
Don't pass through yet.

351
00:33:22,250 --> 00:33:23,666
How reckless.

352
00:33:29,916 --> 00:33:32,208
Put it down, now.

353
00:33:39,625 --> 00:33:41,041
Let it go.

354
00:33:41,833 --> 00:33:43,333
We'll see it later.

355
00:33:52,708 --> 00:33:55,166
Why don't you just let it go?

356
00:33:55,250 --> 00:33:56,791
It might hit someone.

357
00:33:56,875 --> 00:33:59,375
Well, that's their fault.

358
00:34:05,583 --> 00:34:08,083
<i>This person looks like uncle Vinai.</i>

359
00:34:08,166 --> 00:34:11,125
<i>Since COVID-19,
I can hardly recognize people's faces.</i>

360
00:34:12,500 --> 00:34:15,041
<i>I often ran into him
when my father took me for breakfast</i>

361
00:34:15,125 --> 00:34:17,708
<i>at the Chula University's
Dentistry faculty Canteen.</i>

362
00:34:18,416 --> 00:34:19,791
<i>Besides the canteen,</i>

363
00:34:19,875 --> 00:34:23,416
<i>there was an alley behind Bangkok Bank
just next to Siam Cinema</i>

364
00:34:23,500 --> 00:34:25,875
<i>and the allies by the Scala,</i>

365
00:34:25,958 --> 00:34:28,166
<i>where people
who work around here ate regularly</i>

366
00:34:28,250 --> 00:34:29,666
<i>since the price is not so expensive.</i>

367
00:34:30,541 --> 00:34:34,291
<i>The rest are more restaurants
for tourists and shoppers.</i>

368
00:34:40,708 --> 00:34:43,000
Come on, breakfast.

369
00:34:43,833 --> 00:34:45,333
Rice noodles.

370
00:34:46,500 --> 00:34:48,708
Grab a plate and join me.

371
00:34:49,583 --> 00:34:51,583
Not eating? Are you sure?

372
00:34:52,833 --> 00:34:55,250
You'll regret it.

373
00:34:55,333 --> 00:34:56,666
I had a banana.

374
00:34:56,750 --> 00:34:57,875
All right.

375
00:35:18,583 --> 00:35:21,625
<i>If I remember correctly,
my first time visiting the Scala</i>

376
00:35:21,708 --> 00:35:25,791
<i>was when my aunt brought me here
for the owner's birthday party.</i>

377
00:35:25,875 --> 00:35:28,333
<i>It was a Western-Chinese-style restaurant.</i>

378
00:35:28,416 --> 00:35:30,333
<i>The recommended menu was Peking Duck.</i>

379
00:35:31,791 --> 00:35:35,500
<i>Sometimes, the head of the cinema
would bring the Scala's Peking duck ribs</i>

380
00:35:35,583 --> 00:35:38,458
<i>to fry with garlic and pepper
and ate it along with liquor</i>

381
00:35:38,541 --> 00:35:40,041
<i>on the Siam cinema rooftop.</i>

382
00:35:41,833 --> 00:35:45,625
<i>Later, a Siam Skytrain station was built.</i>

383
00:35:45,708 --> 00:35:48,333
<i>The platform is as high as the rooftop,</i>

384
00:35:49,125 --> 00:35:53,166
<i>and the passengers who waited
for the train could see us all.</i>

385
00:35:53,250 --> 00:35:55,458
<i>Since then,
I rarely went out to the roof again.</i>

386
00:35:57,083 --> 00:35:58,541
Put it up.

387
00:36:20,916 --> 00:36:23,625
He worked too much.

388
00:36:24,458 --> 00:36:26,083
He has pain in his legs.

389
00:36:51,375 --> 00:36:54,000
Where were you yesterday?

390
00:36:54,083 --> 00:36:55,583
I was sick.

391
00:36:59,291 --> 00:37:00,916
Stomach ache?

392
00:37:06,666 --> 00:37:13,666
At least, I have land at home upcountry.
My house is there.

393
00:37:14,875 --> 00:37:17,833
I'm here just for work.

394
00:37:17,916 --> 00:37:20,500
I have a house here, too,

395
00:37:20,583 --> 00:37:26,000
but my land is back there.

396
00:37:31,250 --> 00:37:32,833
What province?

397
00:37:32,916 --> 00:37:33,958
Kalasin.

398
00:37:35,333 --> 00:37:37,750
It's far. Have you ever been? I guess not.

399
00:37:38,916 --> 00:37:40,000
You might get lost.

400
00:37:50,208 --> 00:37:54,875
<i>In the cinema, there was a row
of chairs called spare chairs.</i>

401
00:37:54,958 --> 00:37:58,416
<i>It was a row of chairs reserved in case
of any ticket problems,</i>

402
00:37:58,500 --> 00:38:01,333
<i>such as duplicate seat numbers.</i>

403
00:38:01,416 --> 00:38:06,375
<i>They are among
the most expensive seat in the back rows.</i>

404
00:38:06,458 --> 00:38:10,041
<i>Any employee who wanted
to watch a movie could sit there.</i>

405
00:38:10,125 --> 00:38:12,250
<i>I sat there as well.</i>

406
00:38:13,250 --> 00:38:18,041
<i>In the past, some movies were so popular
that they had to add extra chairs.</i>

407
00:38:18,833 --> 00:38:23,458
<i>I had to wait until fewer people came
before I could get back to my row.</i>

408
00:38:25,083 --> 00:38:28,500
<i>Sometimes they forbade me
to see certain films.</i>

409
00:38:28,583 --> 00:38:31,791
<i>But I would see it anyways just by
sitting quietly behind the projector.</i>

410
00:38:45,833 --> 00:38:48,916
Gap, who is the protagonist of your film?

411
00:38:50,083 --> 00:38:52,375
Or is it all of us?

412
00:38:54,583 --> 00:38:56,583
And that's the last person.

413
00:38:56,666 --> 00:38:57,916
The last chair.

414
00:39:00,166 --> 00:39:01,958
The last chair is done.

415
00:39:11,958 --> 00:39:15,000
<i>Lately, people don't come
to see movies like before</i>

416
00:39:15,083 --> 00:39:17,541
<i>Now they rent to watch at home.</i>

417
00:39:18,125 --> 00:39:20,458
<i>Or see a movie at the mall.</i>

418
00:39:20,541 --> 00:39:23,208
<i>Sometimes there was
only one person watching.</i>

419
00:39:24,375 --> 00:39:28,958
<i>When this started to happen more often,
they would have to cancel whole showtimes.</i>

420
00:39:29,041 --> 00:39:32,166
<i>The head of the cinema would then
have to apologize and refund the audience.</i>

421
00:39:36,583 --> 00:39:40,250
There's a huge air tube
above your bed in the Siam theater.

422
00:39:40,333 --> 00:39:44,250
The big air conditioner engine
is down there.

423
00:39:45,125 --> 00:39:46,625
It's an air vent.

424
00:39:47,375 --> 00:39:49,583
So cool air gets in here

425
00:39:50,666 --> 00:39:53,083
and goes over there. That's what we used.

426
00:39:53,166 --> 00:39:59,041
But at Siam,
that room is actually a cold room.

427
00:39:59,125 --> 00:40:01,541
That's why
there's a big tube over your bed.

428
00:40:09,208 --> 00:40:12,916
Yes, I know it's Yai's car,
but he'll drop by and shop first.

429
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:15,041
OUTSIDERS ARE PROHIBITED FROM ENTERING.

430
00:40:15,125 --> 00:40:17,416
No, I mean it's Yai's car, not a big car.

431
00:40:18,708 --> 00:40:22,083
- He's not come yet.
- No, he's coming later.

432
00:40:22,166 --> 00:40:23,666
It's a homonym.

433
00:40:23,750 --> 00:40:27,083
- So it's Yai's car, not a big car, huh?
- Okay, I get it.

434
00:40:27,166 --> 00:40:28,500
I know, I know.

435
00:40:28,583 --> 00:40:30,833
But they don't.

436
00:40:30,916 --> 00:40:32,583
They don't understand.

437
00:40:32,666 --> 00:40:34,166
Big car and Yai's car.

438
00:40:34,250 --> 00:40:35,916
It's different.

439
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:37,666
They'll get confused.

440
00:41:05,500 --> 00:41:07,625
The bread is moldy. Don't eat it.

441
00:41:39,708 --> 00:41:42,458
MONEY IS NOT VALUABLE.

442
00:41:42,541 --> 00:41:45,333
IT'S ALL USED UP ON BILLS,
ON KIDS, AND ON FOOD.

443
00:41:56,083 --> 00:41:57,708
It's 9:00 a.m. already.

444
00:41:59,250 --> 00:42:01,875
Take the air conditioner out now.

445
00:42:38,333 --> 00:42:40,791
That's good soil.

446
00:42:41,833 --> 00:42:44,166
- That plant helps with Gastritis.
- Oh, right.

447
00:42:45,541 --> 00:42:47,875
Would be good with curry.

448
00:43:00,708 --> 00:43:03,041
Do you want some turmeric?

449
00:43:03,125 --> 00:43:05,750
No, my land is all covered in concrete.

450
00:43:07,291 --> 00:43:10,458
And mine has no sun. Nothing grows.

451
00:43:11,416 --> 00:43:13,666
You can grow it again. I think...

452
00:43:13,750 --> 00:43:16,291
That's Nodding Clerodendrum.
But don't take it.

453
00:43:18,625 --> 00:43:23,416
Yan must think it was Chom's plant.
So he doesn't want to risk it.

454
00:43:23,500 --> 00:43:28,666
- Remember how Chom gets mad?
- When he curses, I can't bear to listen.

455
00:43:28,750 --> 00:43:32,416
- I can't catch up with what he says.
- Is that a Santol?

456
00:43:32,500 --> 00:43:38,791
- No, no need to take that.
- Would you like this turmeric?

457
00:43:38,875 --> 00:43:40,041
No.

458
00:43:40,125 --> 00:43:42,791
Why would I? It will just turn into junk.

459
00:43:42,875 --> 00:43:45,208
- Take this one.
- Don't have.

460
00:43:45,291 --> 00:43:48,708
Why take out the clothesline?
I still have to do laundry.

461
00:43:48,791 --> 00:43:54,750
- Put the clothesline back now.
- Calm down, I'll fix it.

462
00:43:54,833 --> 00:43:56,791
Take this right away.

463
00:43:56,875 --> 00:43:59,125
You can put it back. Calm down.

464
00:43:59,208 --> 00:44:02,250
<i>After the Tom Yum Kung financial crisis
in 1997,</i>

465
00:44:02,333 --> 00:44:04,875
<i>Chulalongkorn University, the landowner,</i>

466
00:44:04,958 --> 00:44:07,916
<i>increased the rent exponentially
every year.</i>

467
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:11,625
<i>The initial ten-year lease
was changed to a one-year lease.</i>

468
00:44:12,625 --> 00:44:15,083
<i>A movie that used to screen
for over a week.</i>

469
00:44:15,166 --> 00:44:18,208
<i>Now they have to
show multiple movies in one day.</i>

470
00:44:18,291 --> 00:44:21,708
The popcorn that used to be sold in front
of the cinema is no longer being sold.

471
00:44:21,791 --> 00:44:23,041
They sell only snacks instead.

472
00:44:23,125 --> 00:44:26,458
The younger employees
would quit to find other prospects.

473
00:44:27,291 --> 00:44:28,666
My dad got a new job.

474
00:44:29,375 --> 00:44:31,583
Auntie Ree left
to look after her grandchildren.

475
00:44:31,666 --> 00:44:34,041
As for me, I moved in with auntie Leka

476
00:44:34,125 --> 00:44:37,083
not long before the coup d'état in 2006.

477
00:45:02,291 --> 00:45:06,708
That is such a white shirt.

478
00:45:09,708 --> 00:45:13,458
He's snooping around.

479
00:45:14,458 --> 00:45:17,833
Ning, see? He walked this way.

480
00:45:20,083 --> 00:45:24,458
Ning, go check the other camera at
the stairs for me, but at this exact time.

481
00:45:25,916 --> 00:45:28,125
Here, the stairs, this camera.

482
00:45:28,208 --> 00:45:29,916
Camera number 28, then.

483
00:45:30,625 --> 00:45:31,458
Here. Play backward.

484
00:45:31,541 --> 00:45:33,583
Let me see the time first.

485
00:45:33,666 --> 00:45:36,916
He's wearing trousers.
Is he a driver trying to wake someone?

486
00:45:37,916 --> 00:45:39,125
- Here. Right here.
- Well...

487
00:45:39,833 --> 00:45:42,125
Come, come.

488
00:45:42,208 --> 00:45:43,541
He looks like Mr. Apaiwong.

489
00:45:43,625 --> 00:45:44,541
What?

490
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:51,541
I was on duty there.

491
00:45:51,625 --> 00:45:53,250
Stop and play.

492
00:45:53,333 --> 00:45:57,041
- This camera.
- At 5:29 a.m., who's that?

493
00:45:59,500 --> 00:46:02,833
- There's the phone. There.
- Looks like Miss Wang.

494
00:46:02,916 --> 00:46:05,750
- Who is that?
- She went down the stairs.

495
00:46:29,541 --> 00:46:31,416
Only three milk left.

496
00:46:33,833 --> 00:46:34,958
I didn't drink it.

497
00:46:35,041 --> 00:46:36,541
Drink it, then.

498
00:46:36,625 --> 00:46:40,125
If you're afraid it'll run out, drink it.

499
00:46:58,625 --> 00:47:01,333
One bag of sticky rice
is not enough anymore.

500
00:47:03,541 --> 00:47:05,208
How many do you need, then?

501
00:47:07,916 --> 00:47:09,000
Five Baht, right?

502
00:47:09,083 --> 00:47:12,625
Ten Baht per.
What sticky rice costs five Baht anyway?

503
00:47:15,500 --> 00:47:17,833
When was the last time
you had a five Baht sticky rice?

504
00:47:19,375 --> 00:47:21,583
I can buy at this price
because of those government apps.

505
00:47:22,541 --> 00:47:24,375
It was only ten Baht.

506
00:47:26,208 --> 00:47:28,375
No way it's ten Baht without that app.

507
00:47:29,125 --> 00:47:33,083
So that's five Baht.
The government pays five Baht.

508
00:47:33,166 --> 00:47:37,125
- What is this?
- What? What's up?

509
00:47:37,208 --> 00:47:40,416
It says,
"You've got a pillow. Let's go to bed."

510
00:47:40,500 --> 00:47:41,541
Let's shop.

511
00:47:42,458 --> 00:47:45,833
- Oh, shopping, huh?
- Again?

512
00:47:45,916 --> 00:47:47,916
<i>So that the officers can follow up</i>

513
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:51,000
<i>and arrest
the criminals for further prosecution...</i>

514
00:47:51,083 --> 00:47:52,666
And that's uncle Gen's house.

515
00:47:54,166 --> 00:47:55,333
Want some bananas?

516
00:47:57,083 --> 00:48:02,791
<i>Down with Feudalism, Long live the People!</i>

517
00:48:02,875 --> 00:48:09,875
<i>Down with Feudalism, Long live the People!</i>

518
00:48:09,958 --> 00:48:13,583
<i>Down with Feudalism, Long live the People!</i>

519
00:48:43,625 --> 00:48:44,791
Take this first.

520
00:48:46,416 --> 00:48:49,000
And then see
what all we can load on the truck.

521
00:48:52,541 --> 00:48:55,125
Yod. The coil, take it.

522
00:49:00,583 --> 00:49:02,333
Okay, just put it down.

523
00:49:45,125 --> 00:49:46,125
Has the truck come yet?

524
00:49:46,208 --> 00:49:47,166
Not yet.

525
00:49:59,041 --> 00:50:00,416
Can't wait for the rope.

526
00:50:01,500 --> 00:50:08,250
- Be careful, don't rush. Take it easy.
- The middle.

527
00:50:08,333 --> 00:50:09,625
Okay, right?

528
00:50:09,708 --> 00:50:12,375
That piece is for you anyway.

529
00:50:41,833 --> 00:50:43,916
Put it down.

530
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:46,625
- Go, go.
- Take the papers.

531
00:50:46,708 --> 00:50:48,375
Wrap them with the papers.

532
00:50:48,458 --> 00:50:50,250
Wrap them with two sheets of paper.

533
00:50:51,083 --> 00:50:52,750
Got to sleep today.

534
00:50:57,625 --> 00:50:58,750
- Drive to...
- Wait, wait.

535
00:52:12,666 --> 00:52:13,958
Shit.

536
00:52:15,791 --> 00:52:18,875
The whole fucking thing came down.

537
00:52:42,500 --> 00:52:45,625
<i>One evening in May 2010,</i>

538
00:52:45,708 --> 00:52:48,875
<i>I heard the news on television
that the Siam cinema was on fire.</i>

539
00:52:49,583 --> 00:52:52,666
<i>There were red-shirt protests rallying
at Ratchaprasong Intersection</i>

540
00:52:52,750 --> 00:52:57,125
<i>demanding Prime Minister
Abhisit's resignation since March.</i>

541
00:52:59,625 --> 00:53:03,416
<i>It was the last day
of the military crackdown.</i>

542
00:53:03,500 --> 00:53:07,833
<i>Live ammunition
was used to disperse the assembly,</i>

543
00:53:07,916 --> 00:53:11,000
<i>which resulted in at least 99 deaths.</i>

544
00:53:11,958 --> 00:53:15,125
<i>To this day, no one knows
who burned down Siam Cinema.</i>

545
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:18,791
<i>Later on, the Siam cinema
became a new department store.</i>

546
00:53:18,875 --> 00:53:22,166
<i>Auntie Leka didn't go back
to work ever again.</i>

547
00:53:22,250 --> 00:53:25,333
<i>When the Lido's lease expired in 2018,</i>

548
00:53:25,416 --> 00:53:28,916
<i>the remaining staff from both cinemas
went to work at the Scala,</i>

549
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:30,541
<i>the last standalone cinema.</i>

550
00:54:50,166 --> 00:54:52,791
I beg them not to remove the handrail yet.

551
00:54:52,875 --> 00:54:54,958
How am I getting up there, then?

552
00:54:55,041 --> 00:54:56,833
We said to do it later.

553
00:55:00,166 --> 00:55:01,375
Miss Peak, hello.

554
00:55:01,458 --> 00:55:02,416
Hello.

555
00:55:08,333 --> 00:55:10,833
They're here. Don't step on the wire.

556
00:55:10,916 --> 00:55:12,416
Careful not to trip.

557
00:55:16,166 --> 00:55:17,708
Here they come. Good.

558
00:55:58,416 --> 00:56:01,500
Have you seen your father lately?

559
00:56:01,583 --> 00:56:04,416
I just realized you are his daughter.

560
00:56:04,500 --> 00:56:07,791
So, have you seen him recently?

561
00:56:08,875 --> 00:56:12,875
So you lived
with miss Leka after that, right?

562
00:56:18,125 --> 00:56:20,583
Please tell your father
that Peak misses him.

563
00:56:20,666 --> 00:56:22,833
I used to be close to him.

564
00:56:22,916 --> 00:56:26,833
Tell him I am the Lido's accountant.

565
00:56:26,916 --> 00:56:29,166
We used to be close.

566
00:56:56,541 --> 00:56:58,333
What do you do for a living?

567
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:01,791
I make documentaries.

568
00:57:01,875 --> 00:57:03,500
Documentaries?

569
00:57:06,916 --> 00:57:10,541
Sometimes, I take photos at weddings.

570
00:57:15,250 --> 00:57:16,750
Is it okay?

571
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:19,666
Is it hard to make a living?

572
00:57:21,041 --> 00:57:23,208
With everything going on now, it's hard.

573
00:57:23,291 --> 00:57:26,916
I ask because I see people
selling things on live streaming.

574
00:57:27,791 --> 00:57:29,250
Is it hard?

575
00:57:30,333 --> 00:57:33,500
Well, not really. Any camera will do.

576
00:57:33,583 --> 00:57:35,250
Phone cameras?

577
00:57:35,333 --> 00:57:37,375
Yes, Front camera phones and internet.

578
00:57:41,125 --> 00:57:44,125
It's all about the product, right?

579
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:50,625
I'm tired.

580
00:57:50,708 --> 00:57:52,666
What are you going to sell?

581
00:57:52,750 --> 00:57:55,666
That's just it. I don't have any products.

582
00:59:31,750 --> 00:59:35,666
<i>Prayut, get out! Prayut, get out!</i>

583
00:59:35,750 --> 00:59:39,708
<i>Prayut, get out! Prayut, get out!</i>

584
00:59:39,791 --> 00:59:44,750
<i>Prawit, get out! Prawit, get out!</i>

585
01:00:31,333 --> 01:00:34,666
<i>Brothers and sisters.</i>

586
01:00:34,750 --> 01:00:37,250
<i>Free our friends.</i>

587
01:00:37,333 --> 01:00:39,416
<i>Draft a new constitution.</i>

588
01:00:39,500 --> 01:00:41,791
<i>Abolish 112.</i>

589
01:00:41,875 --> 01:00:48,708
<i>Prayut, get out! Prayut, get out!
Prayut must get out!</i>

590
