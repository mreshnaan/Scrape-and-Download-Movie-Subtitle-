1
00:01:44,563 --> 00:01:48,859
Are those red leaves under
the summer sunshine...

2
00:01:49,484 --> 00:01:52,904
The same that hung
weakly on the day I left?

3
00:01:55,365 --> 00:01:58,577
At that time it seemed that every leaf
the Autumn took away...

4
00:02:00,037 --> 00:02:01,747
Took away a piece of my life.

5
00:02:16,303 --> 00:02:19,890
I don't know if it's been a long time
or not since I left this house.

6
00:02:20,682 --> 00:02:23,185
Or what I've been doing. Or where.

7
00:02:24,645 --> 00:02:26,897
Or why my husband
decided that I had to leave.

8
00:02:39,451 --> 00:02:40,911
Be strong.

9
00:02:44,039 --> 00:02:46,667
You have to look normal for your husband.

10
00:02:49,044 --> 00:02:50,962
It was me who insisted on your return.

11
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:55,300
And I know it's not gonna be easy, martine.

12
00:02:58,178 --> 00:03:01,181
But you have to fight so everything
can be as you and I planned.

13
00:03:05,268 --> 00:03:07,896
So everything can be as you and I planned.

14
00:03:09,189 --> 00:03:11,775
That everything goes as wished.

15
00:03:12,317 --> 00:03:13,985
Good fortune be with us.

16
00:03:14,736 --> 00:03:18,615
To be good and honest,

17
00:03:19,408 --> 00:03:20,826
worship god.

18
00:03:21,368 --> 00:03:22,494
Paradise is waiting for us.

19
00:03:23,787 --> 00:03:25,787
Paradise.

20
00:03:25,914 --> 00:03:27,749
Which one is your cardinal point?

21
00:03:28,917 --> 00:03:30,917
Earth?

22
00:03:30,711 --> 00:03:32,003
Which is your hell?

23
00:03:33,296 --> 00:03:35,132
Who made the lists of the forbidden?

24
00:03:36,675 --> 00:03:38,802
Who took the role of judgment?

25
00:03:39,970 --> 00:03:43,056
At what moment does the
day end and the night begin?

26
00:03:43,932 --> 00:03:47,519
At what moment do
pride, ambition and desire

27
00:03:48,103 --> 00:03:50,439
begin to be flowers of sin?

28
00:03:53,024 --> 00:03:54,151
We're almost there.

29
00:03:55,444 --> 00:03:58,113
Keep taking your
medication like at the clinic.

30
00:04:04,369 --> 00:04:08,582
If you need me, tell Wanda to call me.

31
00:04:16,673 --> 00:04:19,342
Miss, miss martine!

32
00:04:22,846 --> 00:04:24,765
Miss martine has arrived.

33
00:04:32,606 --> 00:04:35,650
Good morning, miss.
Did you have a good journey?

34
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:39,988
We're so happy to see you.

35
00:05:03,595 --> 00:05:07,265
This is your house. This is where we'll
live happily ever after.

36
00:05:08,391 --> 00:05:10,578
My father carried my mother
and they lived happy together

37
00:05:10,602 --> 00:05:13,063
until death took them apart.

38
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:15,480
I love you, Armando.

39
00:05:15,190 --> 00:05:17,150
I pray to god you'll never stop loving me.

40
00:05:17,692 --> 00:05:18,985
Never, ever.

41
00:05:20,195 --> 00:05:22,195
What are you doing there?

42
00:05:21,404 --> 00:05:23,404
I was waiting for you.

43
00:05:22,572 --> 00:05:24,783
- Where have you been?
- That's none of your business.

44
00:05:25,075 --> 00:05:26,355
Dear god! What's wrong with you?

45
00:05:26,660 --> 00:05:28,340
I barely see you, and even
when you're home

46
00:05:28,537 --> 00:05:30,872
I feel you're so distant.

47
00:05:32,999 --> 00:05:35,085
Miss martine, I'm so
happy to see you again.

48
00:05:35,377 --> 00:05:38,713
Miss martine. We've missed you
so much all these months.

49
00:05:43,677 --> 00:05:44,803
Goodbye, doctor.

50
00:05:45,679 --> 00:05:47,848
You're coming to visit next week, right?

51
00:05:53,854 --> 00:05:55,772
I didn't allow anyone to enter your room.

52
00:05:56,648 --> 00:05:58,900
Everything is still like the day you left.

53
00:05:59,192 --> 00:06:01,236
Hydrangeas. Thank you, Wanda.

54
00:06:21,882 --> 00:06:23,508
Is the Marquis at home?

55
00:06:25,719 --> 00:06:30,974
No, ma'am, he's out with that
young man he's been seeing lately.

56
00:06:33,977 --> 00:06:35,977
Who is he?

57
00:06:36,062 --> 00:06:37,814
I don't really know, ma'am.

58
00:06:38,148 --> 00:06:39,983
I only know his name is flor.

59
00:06:40,525 --> 00:06:43,987
He's undoubtedly a distinguished young man,

60
00:06:44,362 --> 00:06:46,382
although neither his character
or manners are those of a good person.

61
00:06:46,406 --> 00:06:48,450
I don't know what's wrong with the Marquis.

62
00:06:55,707 --> 00:07:03,707
Since you left, he's been seeing
some people of questionable morality.

63
00:08:00,271 --> 00:08:04,859
So what! You've seen me, so what? It's
not the first time you've seen me naked.

64
00:08:05,485 --> 00:08:08,405
Or are you disturbed to see
my young friend naked?

65
00:08:09,155 --> 00:08:11,157
He has a beautiful body, don't you think?

66
00:08:12,033 --> 00:08:14,285
Wouldn't you like to touch it?

67
00:08:15,412 --> 00:08:20,625
I like his mouth wide open like a pussy.
Inviting me to unknown pleasures.

68
00:08:21,084 --> 00:08:23,545
Martine! Martine!

69
00:08:25,547 --> 00:08:28,341
I like your mouth wide open like a pussy.

70
00:08:28,675 --> 00:08:30,885
Inviting me to unknown pleasures.

71
00:08:31,219 --> 00:08:33,722
Martine! Martine!

72
00:08:43,606 --> 00:08:47,318
Wait! Wait!

73
00:08:48,695 --> 00:08:54,701
Don't make me run. Don't make me run
anymore, darling. Wait!

74
00:08:56,453 --> 00:08:59,205
Flor! Flor!

75
00:09:01,875 --> 00:09:03,875
Wait, flor!

76
00:09:04,461 --> 00:09:08,631
Darling! Flor, darling. Wait.

77
00:09:10,341 --> 00:09:16,431
Don't run away again, my darling.

78
00:09:17,098 --> 00:09:19,434
Flor! Wait, wait.

79
00:09:20,727 --> 00:09:22,937
Wait. Flor, wait for me.

80
00:09:24,189 --> 00:09:26,189
Flor.

81
00:09:27,192 --> 00:09:29,192
Flor.

82
00:09:29,027 --> 00:09:30,361
Wait for me. Wait for me.

83
00:09:33,740 --> 00:09:36,117
Don't run so fast.

84
00:09:37,202 --> 00:09:38,995
- You can't get me!
- Wait.

85
00:09:41,039 --> 00:09:42,290
You can't get me.

86
00:09:44,292 --> 00:09:45,332
I will get you in the end.

87
00:09:46,336 --> 00:09:49,005
No, you won't.

88
00:09:49,380 --> 00:09:51,299
You rascal! Rascal!

89
00:09:55,595 --> 00:09:56,846
You won't get me.

90
00:09:58,598 --> 00:10:00,598
I'll get you! I promise.

91
00:09:59,891 --> 00:10:02,769
You cannot get me!

92
00:10:03,061 --> 00:10:04,854
Rascal! You're killing me!

93
00:10:07,190 --> 00:10:08,191
You cannot get me!

94
00:10:18,368 --> 00:10:21,079
Wait a second! Stop for a moment!

95
00:10:21,371 --> 00:10:24,040
- Don't be a rascal.
- You can't get me! No!

96
00:10:24,916 --> 00:10:27,752
Got you! Got you! Almost got you!
Come here, rascal.

97
00:10:28,336 --> 00:10:32,382
Come here flor, wait. I can't keep
going, wait. Wait, flor!

98
00:10:33,091 --> 00:10:34,592
Armando! Armando!

99
00:10:35,677 --> 00:10:37,053
There's a woman lying on the road.

100
00:10:49,983 --> 00:10:51,109
It's a nun.

101
00:10:51,943 --> 00:10:53,945
What bad taste to come here
and die on my land.

102
00:10:55,488 --> 00:10:57,488
She isn't dead.

103
00:10:57,157 --> 00:10:59,617
- Just passed out.
- What happened to her?

104
00:11:01,452 --> 00:11:04,330
I don't know.
It's just a kid, a novice.

105
00:11:05,623 --> 00:11:07,125
George! George!

106
00:11:21,598 --> 00:11:22,891
She's hurt.

107
00:11:29,272 --> 00:11:31,691
Maybe she's been raped, she's bleeding.

108
00:11:35,486 --> 00:11:37,486
What do we do with her?

109
00:11:40,575 --> 00:11:41,576
We'll take her home.

110
00:11:42,535 --> 00:11:44,579
Let's do it. Let's do it.

111
00:13:01,823 --> 00:13:03,700
How long has that young man been here?

112
00:13:08,788 --> 00:13:11,124
Afew months, and god forgive me...

113
00:13:15,378 --> 00:13:17,005
But I think that young man flor...

114
00:13:21,050 --> 00:13:22,427
Has been sent from hell.

115
00:13:24,304 --> 00:13:28,057
He is very young, pale, and attractive.
His beauty is so feminine.

116
00:13:28,766 --> 00:13:30,059
I don't know where he came from.

117
00:13:30,351 --> 00:13:32,312
One morning, I found
him in your husband's bed.

118
00:13:32,645 --> 00:13:35,325
He was completely naked. I asked him
who he was and what did he say?

119
00:13:35,398 --> 00:13:37,398
Tell me, Wanda.

120
00:13:38,568 --> 00:13:39,986
What did he say?

121
00:13:42,363 --> 00:13:43,990
That he was the lover of the Marquis.

122
00:13:45,199 --> 00:13:48,202
His lover? My husband never
had a sex drive.

123
00:13:51,122 --> 00:13:55,501
Then he laughed without
even covering himself.

124
00:15:17,542 --> 00:15:18,584
Do you like her, flor?

125
00:15:29,303 --> 00:15:32,807
She has soft and smooth skin.
This little nun is a temptation.

126
00:15:36,227 --> 00:15:38,521
My lady, I think it's true what flor said.

127
00:15:38,813 --> 00:15:40,773
That young man and your husband are lovers.

128
00:15:41,524 --> 00:15:45,403
I'm sorry to tell you,
I'm sorry to cause you sorrow.

129
00:15:45,695 --> 00:15:47,905
That perverted young man has possessed...

130
00:15:48,489 --> 00:15:50,366
Mr. Armando's will.

131
00:15:59,584 --> 00:16:01,127
Who are you? Where am I?

132
00:16:01,419 --> 00:16:05,298
You are at seteais palace.
Property of the Marquis of bressac.

133
00:16:05,590 --> 00:16:10,636
And I am the Marquis, a great fanatic of
hunting young slaves with smooth skin.

134
00:16:10,928 --> 00:16:11,929
Let me go! Let me go!

135
00:16:12,221 --> 00:16:14,301
- What were you doing on my property?
- I don't know.

136
00:16:14,474 --> 00:16:15,914
You escaped from the convent, right?

137
00:16:16,142 --> 00:16:18,745
With a young boy that dumped
you after having a good time with you?

138
00:16:18,769 --> 00:16:21,331
- Do you want me to get you back to the convent?
- No, please, no!

139
00:16:21,355 --> 00:16:23,357
Or do you prefer to stay with us?

140
00:16:24,275 --> 00:16:26,110
I prefer to stay with you.

141
00:16:26,402 --> 00:16:27,602
The little nun has good taste.

142
00:16:27,695 --> 00:16:28,905
Let's try her.

143
00:16:34,577 --> 00:16:38,122
A little rough tasting.
A peasant, without a doubt.

144
00:16:52,136 --> 00:16:55,306
C'mon Armando, it seems you like her.

145
00:17:00,186 --> 00:17:04,815
That young man has dragged the Marquis to the most
spiteful scandals and most sinful indulgences.

146
00:17:05,733 --> 00:17:07,733
Give me some!

147
00:17:11,989 --> 00:17:13,032
You must talk to him.

148
00:17:13,491 --> 00:17:15,326
This cannot be, ma'am.

149
00:17:20,081 --> 00:17:22,083
What can I do?

150
00:17:23,459 --> 00:17:25,711
He has not even greeted
me since my arrival.

151
00:17:38,808 --> 00:17:41,102
- Enough!
- My turn.

152
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:49,902
You have to stop those scandals
in your own house.

153
00:17:50,236 --> 00:17:51,529
And stop him from wasting money.

154
00:18:31,152 --> 00:18:34,113
Do it for the respect of your ancestors.

155
00:18:36,115 --> 00:18:41,954
Martine, I have a few
minutes left. I can't hide

156
00:18:42,663 --> 00:18:45,082
the truth from you.

157
00:18:46,167 --> 00:18:50,004
Since past generations...

158
00:18:50,338 --> 00:18:55,426
Our family has been suffering from
a shameful congenital disease.

159
00:18:55,718 --> 00:18:58,304
All have died from it.

160
00:18:59,055 --> 00:19:00,681
And you will too.

161
00:19:03,726 --> 00:19:05,061
I can't fight anymore.

162
00:19:06,771 --> 00:19:09,440
I don't even have self respect.

163
00:19:11,942 --> 00:19:16,030
And I can't feel anything else
for him but love.

164
00:19:17,156 --> 00:19:19,116
A hopeless love.

165
00:19:19,408 --> 00:19:21,035
Without illusions.

166
00:19:22,078 --> 00:19:24,288
Blind, I feel a savage desire.

167
00:19:25,206 --> 00:19:27,416
I'm filled with his scent.

168
00:19:29,001 --> 00:19:30,921
When somebody talks to me,
I only hear his voice.

169
00:19:37,134 --> 00:19:40,262
Do you understand me?

170
00:19:42,932 --> 00:19:44,350
What can I do?

171
00:19:49,230 --> 00:19:50,940
I'm in love.

172
00:19:54,819 --> 00:19:55,861
Do you understand me?

173
00:20:04,995 --> 00:20:06,995
What can I do?

174
00:20:15,798 --> 00:20:17,508
I love you, Armando.

175
00:20:19,427 --> 00:20:21,804
Why have you left me alone all this time?

176
00:20:23,556 --> 00:20:24,796
I know it was you who wanted...

177
00:20:26,225 --> 00:20:29,937
Me to be in that horrible place.

178
00:20:31,939 --> 00:20:34,734
Not for having an incurable illness,

179
00:20:36,444 --> 00:20:38,195
but to get rid of me.

180
00:20:39,822 --> 00:20:41,822
Why?

181
00:20:42,658 --> 00:20:44,160
I gave you everything.

182
00:20:46,078 --> 00:20:49,415
I let you drive me through turbulent roads.

183
00:20:51,333 --> 00:20:54,754
Now you leave me with
my body soaked in desire.

184
00:20:56,172 --> 00:20:59,633
After a long time dreaming of my return.

185
00:21:01,135 --> 00:21:04,597
To feel your skin against mine.

186
00:21:06,724 --> 00:21:08,350
Why, lord?

187
00:21:13,522 --> 00:21:18,486
Lord, bring him back to me.

188
00:21:19,695 --> 00:21:21,614
May he desire me like I desire him.

189
00:21:23,991 --> 00:21:27,161
Our father! Bring him to me.

190
00:21:28,871 --> 00:21:29,872
Our father.

191
00:21:30,581 --> 00:21:33,501
May his wet cock moisten my dry pussy.

192
00:21:35,669 --> 00:21:38,631
His cock, inside me...

193
00:21:39,131 --> 00:21:41,091
Forgive me, oh lord,
for talking to you like that.

194
00:21:48,599 --> 00:21:51,227
But I can't take it anymore.

195
00:21:51,602 --> 00:21:54,313
Have mercy on your daughter,
for she is consumed

196
00:21:54,605 --> 00:21:57,316
by love and desire. You understand
everything, oh lord! I need him.

197
00:22:19,088 --> 00:22:20,631
It's him, I need to meet him.

198
00:22:22,883 --> 00:22:26,136
I will knee! To him.

199
00:22:26,971 --> 00:22:28,556
I will beg him. I need love,

200
00:22:29,139 --> 00:22:31,559
or I will go truly crazy.

201
00:24:28,759 --> 00:24:33,222
Martine! I know you're there.

202
00:24:35,182 --> 00:24:38,435
Don't hide, come here!
Watch and learn from my friend.

203
00:24:39,061 --> 00:24:40,688
He really knows how to please me.

204
00:24:43,857 --> 00:24:45,857
Well, leave then!

205
00:24:45,234 --> 00:24:49,279
If you're in heat, go and look for
the maid. She consents to everything.

206
00:24:58,956 --> 00:25:06,956
Keep going, like that, like that...

207
00:26:33,467 --> 00:26:36,720
- Who are you?
- My name is Norma.

208
00:26:39,056 --> 00:26:41,433
The Marquis brought me here.

209
00:26:42,893 --> 00:26:44,853
Are you his wife? The Marquis?

210
00:26:48,232 --> 00:26:50,025
You're so pretty, Norma.

211
00:26:52,277 --> 00:26:55,447
Have you ever made love?
Tell me the truth.

212
00:26:57,658 --> 00:26:58,909
Yes, ma'am.

213
00:27:01,161 --> 00:27:02,788
But it hurt me so much.

214
00:27:08,627 --> 00:27:09,670
It doesn't always hurt.

215
00:27:15,592 --> 00:27:17,511
It doesn't hurt when a woman does it.

216
00:27:20,264 --> 00:27:22,891
Please, my lady.

217
00:27:25,602 --> 00:27:28,272
I love that sound.

218
00:27:29,690 --> 00:27:31,066
Like a scared birdie.

219
00:27:34,153 --> 00:27:36,572
And that little girl's
skin. And these tights.

220
00:27:41,660 --> 00:27:44,288
No, my lady, no.

221
00:27:55,716 --> 00:27:57,676
Relax.

222
00:27:59,469 --> 00:28:02,306
What do you feel?

223
00:28:04,433 --> 00:28:05,517
I feel a lot of heat.

224
00:28:13,525 --> 00:28:19,323
It's a great sin, please lady.

225
00:30:09,141 --> 00:30:13,645
Get out of here! Skank!

226
00:30:28,076 --> 00:30:29,536
Armando!

227
00:30:29,828 --> 00:30:31,788
Do it to me!

228
00:30:38,253 --> 00:30:40,172
Make love to me, Armando.

229
00:30:49,931 --> 00:30:52,934
Make love to me.

230
00:30:56,855 --> 00:30:58,482
I can't take it anymore.

231
00:31:03,320 --> 00:31:06,281
Get out of this room! You whore!

232
00:31:06,573 --> 00:31:08,909
Get out! Get out of here! Get out!

233
00:31:13,789 --> 00:31:15,789
Don't lock me up! No!

234
00:31:17,459 --> 00:31:19,459
I can't take it anymore.

235
00:31:20,212 --> 00:31:23,757
Do what you please with me,
but don't leave me alone again.

236
00:32:38,832 --> 00:32:42,294
- Good morning, my lady.
- Good morning, Norma.

237
00:32:46,214 --> 00:32:48,550
Did you sleep well? You look tired.

238
00:32:50,969 --> 00:32:52,969
I didn't sleep at all.

239
00:32:54,139 --> 00:32:56,139
Last night was horrible.

240
00:32:56,224 --> 00:32:58,560
What are you talking about?

241
00:33:00,270 --> 00:33:01,790
I wasn't myself, I was so mean to you.

242
00:33:03,023 --> 00:33:05,025
You have to forgive me.

243
00:33:06,860 --> 00:33:08,403
Why are you apologizing?

244
00:33:09,154 --> 00:33:11,948
I was deeply asleep.
I don't know what happened.

245
00:33:13,033 --> 00:33:15,410
I don't understand your apologies.

246
00:33:22,375 --> 00:33:23,710
I've been sick.

247
00:33:25,462 --> 00:33:26,880
I have an illness.

248
00:33:29,007 --> 00:33:30,258
I am very sick.

249
00:33:31,176 --> 00:33:32,552
Will you be patient?

250
00:33:33,303 --> 00:33:37,891
A pleasure to serve you, my lady. And I
don't see why I should change my mind.

251
00:33:41,102 --> 00:33:45,815
I am at your service, Marquis.
Your wishes are my commands.

252
00:33:51,071 --> 00:33:54,991
- We'll have our secrets, nobody will ever know it.
- Yes, ma'am.

253
00:33:56,660 --> 00:33:58,537
- You can leave now.
- Yes, ma'am.

254
00:35:07,147 --> 00:35:08,273
Good morning, my lady.

255
00:35:10,692 --> 00:35:14,112
Your husband called me, urgently.

256
00:35:14,404 --> 00:35:17,157
He said you had a nervous
breakdown last night.

257
00:35:18,074 --> 00:35:20,118
What happened?
Aren't you feeling well?

258
00:35:21,202 --> 00:35:24,539
Are you noticing some hostility around?

259
00:35:50,190 --> 00:35:52,359
You must relax, darling.

260
00:35:52,651 --> 00:35:56,446
Reality is sometimes hard,
difficult to manage.

261
00:35:57,197 --> 00:36:03,119
If you have another breakdown, the Marquis
will send you back to my clinic.

262
00:36:03,703 --> 00:36:06,039
Perhaps that's what he wants, right?

263
00:36:09,250 --> 00:36:13,713
- But that is not what we want.
- Do you think he wants to send me back?

264
00:36:14,005 --> 00:36:17,467
Of course. I'm sure.

265
00:36:19,219 --> 00:36:22,514
You have to be strong,
keep taking the medication.

266
00:36:24,432 --> 00:36:28,103
Follow my plan, step by step.

267
00:36:29,104 --> 00:36:30,397
I don't know, doctor.

268
00:36:31,564 --> 00:36:34,275
You have to fight! Fight, my lady!

269
00:36:35,068 --> 00:36:36,194
If I only knew how.

270
00:36:38,446 --> 00:36:41,241
Hold on to the idea of a better future.

271
00:36:41,741 --> 00:36:43,201
You still love him, right?

272
00:36:44,869 --> 00:36:49,165
You have to defeat that feeling.
Otherwise, we have little to do.

273
00:36:50,625 --> 00:36:52,625
Goodbye.

274
00:37:40,133 --> 00:37:41,801
George! Come here.

275
00:37:42,469 --> 00:37:43,749
- Yes, Marquis.
- Get the doctor.

276
00:37:54,689 --> 00:37:57,150
- Doctor, please come.
- What's going on?

277
00:37:58,610 --> 00:38:02,530
The Marquis wants to talk to you.
He is waiting in the main hall.

278
00:38:06,409 --> 00:38:10,789
- Yes, Marquis.
- I have some questions for you.

279
00:38:11,331 --> 00:38:15,960
In the new diagnosis you gave me,
besides the proper medication,

280
00:38:16,753 --> 00:38:19,631
there are some notes.

281
00:38:20,340 --> 00:38:23,301
Like martine can't experience
sociological

282
00:38:23,927 --> 00:38:26,513
and physical emotions.

283
00:38:27,180 --> 00:38:29,500
- Otherwise, any excitement could be fatal?
- That's right.

284
00:38:29,641 --> 00:38:33,436
- So, any strong emotion could kill her?
- Exactly.

285
00:38:33,853 --> 00:38:36,439
Also, sexual activity is not allowed?

286
00:38:37,273 --> 00:38:39,273
Correct.

287
00:38:40,109 --> 00:38:45,824
If by any reason I can't control her behavior,
and we have to face the fatal outcome,

288
00:38:46,199 --> 00:38:49,160
would I be charged with negligence?

289
00:38:50,203 --> 00:38:52,203
That's right.

290
00:38:54,624 --> 00:39:01,714
My father, the Marquis of bressac,
took your father out of ruin.

291
00:39:02,507 --> 00:39:04,676
That's why his unfortunate son was able

292
00:39:05,385 --> 00:39:08,012
to make a career, open a clinic,

293
00:39:08,805 --> 00:39:10,085
and be embraced by high society.

294
00:39:11,015 --> 00:39:13,518
I suppose you haven't forgotten all that.

295
00:39:15,144 --> 00:39:19,357
No, Marquis, that's why
I took care of your wife,

296
00:39:19,732 --> 00:39:24,696
kept her at my clinic for 8 months,
and I refused to accept any payment.

297
00:39:25,154 --> 00:39:28,324
That's very honorable,
but it doesn't matter to me.

298
00:39:28,950 --> 00:39:31,750
If I have to remind you of the things the
bressac family did for yours,

299
00:39:31,786 --> 00:39:35,832
it's because after my
wife's breakdown last night,

300
00:39:36,207 --> 00:39:38,960
it's probable she'll die some time soon.

301
00:39:39,878 --> 00:39:42,088
In that case, I expect you can extend

302
00:39:42,630 --> 00:39:48,136
a certificate to exonerate me of all
negligence that can affect me.

303
00:39:51,890 --> 00:39:54,267
These are hard times, doctor.

304
00:39:54,642 --> 00:40:00,732
Lots of corrupt public servants would be
so happy to denigrate the aristocracy.

305
00:40:01,774 --> 00:40:03,568
I hope that isn't your case, doctor.

306
00:40:04,027 --> 00:40:12,027
And that you will keep
the diagnosis between us.

307
00:40:13,953 --> 00:40:17,415
Otherwise, it will look like I caused her
death to seize her father's great fortune.

308
00:40:17,874 --> 00:40:22,754
And don't forget, the bressacs still have enough
power to ruin you. Do you understand, doctor?

309
00:40:24,172 --> 00:40:26,172
Yes, sir.

310
00:40:32,639 --> 00:40:40,063
- Miss, please, calm down.
- I can't, Wanda.

311
00:40:44,275 --> 00:40:49,113
Armando, Armando, listen to me.

312
00:40:49,822 --> 00:40:52,408
Why don't you come in?
Why are you evading me?

313
00:40:53,034 --> 00:40:55,914
Why don't you talk to me? Don't forget
I'm your wife. Can't you remember?

314
00:40:56,537 --> 00:40:58,457
Unfortunately, I haven't
been able to forget it.

315
00:41:08,841 --> 00:41:12,887
A dried Rose in a buttonhole.
The last page of an old, unfinished diary.

316
00:41:13,388 --> 00:41:17,642
A guitar missing strings. A clock without a
pendulum. A weather vane without an arrow.

317
00:41:18,309 --> 00:41:21,938
I am all that without you, martine.
Do you like it? Tell me.

318
00:41:28,569 --> 00:41:34,617
Here is my dear wife. We are honored
to have her presence.

319
00:41:35,827 --> 00:41:37,827
Thank you.

320
00:41:37,036 --> 00:41:39,747
Today it's a very special date.

321
00:41:40,623 --> 00:41:43,918
It's the 3rd anniversary of
her first mental breakdown.

322
00:41:46,254 --> 00:41:48,254
Cheers!

323
00:41:51,884 --> 00:41:54,137
Martine is a very unique woman,

324
00:41:54,721 --> 00:41:56,472
as is her madness, schizophrenia.

325
00:41:58,766 --> 00:42:01,686
Produced by congenital syphilis.

326
00:42:02,395 --> 00:42:03,604
Hush Armando, please.

327
00:42:10,653 --> 00:42:16,117
I will not shut up. I want my friends to be
aware of all your attributes, darling.

328
00:42:22,665 --> 00:42:26,961
That's the reason you stayed tonight?
To use me as the target of your cynicism.

329
00:42:27,712 --> 00:42:29,464
Not at all, darling.

330
00:42:31,215 --> 00:42:33,843
Correct me if I'm wrong. She's a model
for a married woman.

331
00:42:40,641 --> 00:42:44,645
And almost the perfect lover.

332
00:42:50,485 --> 00:42:52,153
Right, my love?

333
00:42:55,073 --> 00:43:02,205
Delicate alabaster skin, like a
pale fruit ripped from a greenhouse.

334
00:43:04,749 --> 00:43:11,172
A sweet soft fruit, but also one who
will be quickly filled with worms.

335
00:43:34,779 --> 00:43:38,825
The most devoted painter would dream to
paint those two apples of temptation.

336
00:43:39,659 --> 00:43:41,659
Thank you!

337
00:43:57,260 --> 00:43:58,761
I'm afraid she got mad.

338
00:44:04,600 --> 00:44:06,978
Cheers to the most stupid wife!

339
00:44:47,268 --> 00:44:55,268
Norma, my little one. You must help me, help us.
Our lives will be a paradise when she's gone.

340
00:45:09,665 --> 00:45:12,084
Also we'll be rich, the 3 of us.

341
00:45:13,169 --> 00:45:14,253
What do you want me to do?

342
00:45:21,761 --> 00:45:26,557
- She's very nice to me.
- Very nice to you, but very bad to your master.

343
00:45:27,475 --> 00:45:28,684
She's a crazy bitch.

344
00:45:30,937 --> 00:45:38,152
Maybe she has been nice in recent days, but she
can change suddenly, and turn into a cruel monster.

345
00:45:38,653 --> 00:45:39,779
What do you want me to do?

346
00:45:40,947 --> 00:45:43,908
You have to help us to get rid of her.

347
00:45:44,825 --> 00:45:46,786
- Kill her?
- Yes.

348
00:45:47,828 --> 00:45:51,624
I know it's an unpleasant word.

349
00:45:53,417 --> 00:45:55,417
How?

350
00:46:00,758 --> 00:46:02,927
It's very simple, she trusts you.

351
00:46:04,887 --> 00:46:06,305
You always serve her food.

352
00:46:07,139 --> 00:46:13,145
- Yes, but Wanda is the one who cooks it.
- You will hide this little box in her room.

353
00:46:21,279 --> 00:46:22,280
Is this poison?

354
00:46:25,366 --> 00:46:29,620
No, it's a stimulant, a strong one.

355
00:46:30,162 --> 00:46:33,624
You will put it in her morning coffee
or in a glass of milk.

356
00:46:36,502 --> 00:46:37,920
She will die peacefully.

357
00:46:39,380 --> 00:46:40,881
Without evidence.

358
00:46:43,551 --> 00:46:47,179
Nobody would accuse you of anything.

359
00:46:47,763 --> 00:46:51,142
Will you do it? Tell me you will
do it, little one.

360
00:46:53,686 --> 00:46:56,314
Say yes, beautiful.

361
00:46:57,606 --> 00:47:03,195
It will be so easy and after...

362
00:47:05,740 --> 00:47:10,077
It will be paradise for the 3 of us.

363
00:47:20,671 --> 00:47:25,885
And love, and fortune.

364
00:51:11,902 --> 00:51:14,363
My lady! Are you ok?

365
00:51:34,675 --> 00:51:36,675
My lady!

366
00:51:42,725 --> 00:51:45,352
My lady! Where are you?

367
00:52:04,079 --> 00:52:08,208
- Let's go, Eros. To the clinic of doctor louys.
- Yes, madam.

368
00:52:40,783 --> 00:52:43,619
- Where is Wanda going?
- To the house of doctor louys.

369
00:52:44,119 --> 00:52:47,665
- How do you know?
- I heard her giving instructions to the rider.

370
00:52:52,252 --> 00:52:54,380
And she thinks he is going to help?

371
00:53:10,771 --> 00:53:15,401
- The Marquis knows you're here?
- No, doctor.

372
00:53:15,901 --> 00:53:18,070
You know those are
very serious accusations.

373
00:53:18,362 --> 00:53:21,990
You are telling me the
Marquis is a murderer.

374
00:53:22,741 --> 00:53:24,741
Yes, doctor.

375
00:53:23,909 --> 00:53:27,204
And what proof do you have of it?
Besides overhearing through a door,

376
00:53:27,705 --> 00:53:31,792
and assuming you're not mistaken?

377
00:53:32,167 --> 00:53:33,669
I'm sure of it.

378
00:53:34,044 --> 00:53:36,672
The bressacs have always
been a role model couple.

379
00:53:38,424 --> 00:53:40,424
Just appearances.

380
00:53:40,384 --> 00:53:43,303
I live there and if you don't
help her, she could die.

381
00:53:44,972 --> 00:53:46,682
The Marquis is an honorable man.

382
00:53:47,516 --> 00:53:51,979
And very powerful. I should have known
you would never confront him.

383
00:53:52,813 --> 00:53:54,898
Excuse me for wasting your time, doctor.

384
00:54:37,399 --> 00:54:39,610
- Good afternoon, Norma.
- Good afternoon.

385
00:54:40,944 --> 00:54:43,739
- Do you mind if I sit here?
- I don't mind at all.

386
00:54:44,948 --> 00:54:47,284
Sometimes it's much better to be alone.

387
00:54:48,327 --> 00:54:52,748
At those times the presence of
anyone disturbs me.

388
00:54:55,250 --> 00:54:59,546
- But sometimes it's better to vent our feelings.
- I regret some things.

389
00:55:01,548 --> 00:55:02,800
That's a sincere feeling.

390
00:55:06,220 --> 00:55:09,348
I stopped caring about
others a long time ago.

391
00:55:13,268 --> 00:55:16,522
When I was a little kid and my father
started to call me flor just for fun.

392
00:55:20,609 --> 00:55:23,070
And he dressed me like a girl to
expose me to his friends.

393
00:55:25,113 --> 00:55:26,365
I used to hate him for a while,

394
00:55:27,032 --> 00:55:29,326
but then I enjoyed it.

395
00:55:31,537 --> 00:55:32,788
Now I'm so confused.

396
00:55:37,835 --> 00:55:40,128
- I think I'm in love with you.
- Me too.

397
00:55:44,341 --> 00:55:49,888
Thank you for telling me. But if that's the
case you have to put sentimentality aside.

398
00:55:50,597 --> 00:55:52,015
If that woman dies, we win.

399
00:55:52,516 --> 00:55:54,726
And maybe one day we could run away.

400
00:55:55,644 --> 00:56:00,858
You and I, together without
Armando de bressac.

401
00:56:01,567 --> 00:56:04,611
Deep inside, we both hate him to death.

402
00:56:12,119 --> 00:56:15,163
I love you, Armando.

403
00:56:16,248 --> 00:56:19,126
Tonight I will look for you,
and I will be as you wish,

404
00:56:20,168 --> 00:56:22,629
more indecent than ever.
You will take me in your arms.

405
00:56:50,240 --> 00:56:58,240
You will take me to the bed.
Uncover my breasts.

406
00:57:06,423 --> 00:57:09,176
You have always loved 'em.

407
00:57:12,262 --> 00:57:16,141
You will caress them.

408
00:57:19,770 --> 00:57:23,649
First softly and gently.

409
00:57:24,650 --> 00:57:31,782
Then your hands will turn
violent against my flesh.

410
00:57:44,503 --> 00:57:49,132
Then you'll descend slowly...

411
00:57:49,758 --> 00:57:57,641
To my pussy, and you will touch it
with uncontrollable desire.

412
00:58:29,006 --> 00:58:37,006
The first Marquis of bressac.
What an idiot! What an idiot!

413
00:58:42,352 --> 00:58:45,439
The Marquis of the idiots!

414
00:58:47,941 --> 00:58:49,317
Poor bressac.

415
00:58:51,862 --> 00:58:53,196
Hated by everybody.

416
00:58:55,198 --> 00:58:58,160
Even by his stupid housekeeper.

417
00:59:34,112 --> 00:59:35,781
Open the door, Wanda.

418
00:59:40,660 --> 00:59:43,705
- Good evening, Wanda.
- Good evening, Marquis. What do you want?

419
00:59:48,168 --> 00:59:49,795
You still have a hideous body...

420
00:59:50,420 --> 00:59:54,424
Like the last time we fucked.

421
00:59:55,926 --> 00:59:57,511
Don't worry, I'm not here to make love,

422
00:59:58,637 --> 00:59:59,846
but to kill you.

423
01:00:05,185 --> 01:00:06,228
Bitch!

424
01:00:28,333 --> 01:00:30,585
You thought the doctor wouldn't tell me?

425
01:00:31,628 --> 01:00:35,674
Everybody hates me, but
at the end I step on them.

426
01:00:36,049 --> 01:00:39,761
Like I'm stepping on you right now, Wanda.

427
01:02:24,324 --> 01:02:26,701
- Good morning, martine. How are you?
- Same, doctor.

428
01:02:28,745 --> 01:02:30,622
It seems you had a relapse yesterday.

429
01:02:32,582 --> 01:02:34,582
Yes, I did.

430
01:02:45,178 --> 01:02:48,056
We don't have much time.
Besides, they could be listening.

431
01:02:48,348 --> 01:02:51,643
Your husband told me that you have
imagined seeing Wanda strangled.

432
01:02:51,935 --> 01:02:55,897
But the truth is, she has vanished after
a few hours of visiting my clinic

433
01:02:56,189 --> 01:02:58,692
and accusing him of trying to kill you.

434
01:02:59,234 --> 01:03:02,988
- Martine, are you ready to follow my plans?
- Yes.

435
01:03:04,572 --> 01:03:07,492
Calm down, rest and avoid excitement.

436
01:03:10,662 --> 01:03:14,124
And of course keep taking the medication.
It seems your condition hasn't worsened.

437
01:03:18,878 --> 01:03:25,468
I'll read your document carefully, martine.
I hope you agree to my ideas.

438
01:03:32,475 --> 01:03:34,475
Have a nice day.

439
01:03:55,874 --> 01:04:01,838
Martine, listen to me. That bastard
doesn't deserve to live.

440
01:04:02,464 --> 01:04:07,344
He has destroyed your life, like everything
that crosses his path. Don't you want revenge?

441
01:04:49,386 --> 01:04:53,098
Here my lady, your glass of milk.
It's hot.

442
01:05:00,230 --> 01:05:04,275
Leave it there. Norma, tell me.

443
01:05:05,276 --> 01:05:07,654
- Do you love me?
- Yes, ma'am.

444
01:06:03,835 --> 01:06:05,545
Don't you like me instead, martine?

445
01:06:43,958 --> 01:06:50,465
Yes, Armando, come here my love.
Finally, finally.

446
01:06:51,341 --> 01:06:53,341
Come here.

447
01:07:34,384 --> 01:07:36,135
George, come here with us.

448
01:07:56,281 --> 01:07:58,825
No! Why?

449
01:08:18,428 --> 01:08:25,268
Poor thing. My sweet wife has died.
Ego te absolvo a peccatis tuis.

450
01:08:37,864 --> 01:08:42,076
Poor martine! Poor martine!

451
01:08:42,744 --> 01:08:47,081
- Poor martine!
- Poor martine.

452
01:08:48,708 --> 01:08:50,376
Poor martine.

453
01:08:51,878 --> 01:08:54,797
Poor martine, she's dead.

454
01:08:55,381 --> 01:08:57,467
- Poor martine.
- Poor martine.

455
01:08:58,468 --> 01:08:59,802
Poor martine.

456
01:09:00,553 --> 01:09:02,680
Poor martine.

457
01:11:51,599 --> 01:11:54,602
Look at them Marquis, the two lovers.

458
01:11:56,229 --> 01:11:58,229
What a romantic scene.

459
01:12:00,274 --> 01:12:03,319
Did you imagine the young flor
being that enamored?

460
01:12:12,203 --> 01:12:16,624
Yes, he is a kid, he doesn't have a
sense of honesty and loyalty.

461
01:12:18,042 --> 01:12:24,882
And you have no right to be that nosy.

462
01:13:15,850 --> 01:13:23,850
I love you! I love you! Yes! Yes!

463
01:20:05,801 --> 01:20:10,222
You! You came back from hell!

464
01:20:10,848 --> 01:20:14,893
Are you here to help me
or to drag me to my ruin?

465
01:20:15,477 --> 01:20:18,355
- I've returned to see you die.
- Are you alive?

466
01:20:18,814 --> 01:20:20,774
Or a ghost in my mind?

467
01:20:21,442 --> 01:20:23,442
You're alive!

468
01:20:28,407 --> 01:20:30,407
It's true.

469
01:20:30,826 --> 01:20:33,746
Now you are going to pay once and for all.

470
01:20:40,711 --> 01:20:41,795
What are you gonna do?

471
01:20:48,635 --> 01:20:50,929
The blood is still fresh.

472
01:20:55,559 --> 01:20:57,603
Yes, thank you for coming.

473
01:21:03,942 --> 01:21:06,403
Do it, martine. Do it.

474
01:21:08,614 --> 01:21:09,894
Do it. What are you waiting for?

475
01:21:10,449 --> 01:21:13,160
Do it! Do it! Do it!

476
01:22:16,682 --> 01:22:18,267
Louys.

477
01:22:23,605 --> 01:22:26,900
My love, be brave.
It's a new beginning for you.

478
01:22:27,359 --> 01:22:28,861
I'm scared.

479
01:22:30,070 --> 01:22:33,323
I destroyed your death
certificate. Everything is in order.

480
01:22:33,657 --> 01:22:35,657
They will not charge you.

481
01:22:35,325 --> 01:22:38,537
I will write a certificate.

482
01:22:41,790 --> 01:22:43,417
This is horrible.

483
01:22:44,460 --> 01:22:45,794
Just for a few months.

484
01:22:46,336 --> 01:22:49,715
Then we are heading far
away with all your money.

485
01:22:51,008 --> 01:22:55,721
Until you forget these sad
walls and this sad story.
