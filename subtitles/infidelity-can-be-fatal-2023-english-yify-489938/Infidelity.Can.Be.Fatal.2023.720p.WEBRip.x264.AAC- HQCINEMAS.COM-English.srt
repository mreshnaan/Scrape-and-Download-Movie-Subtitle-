3
00:01:29,045 --> 00:01:30,699
- What am I supposed to do now?

4
00:01:30,829 --> 00:01:32,396
- I'm sorry, Mrs. Cutler.

5
00:01:32,527 --> 00:01:33,832
I know these are hard to see.

6
00:01:33,963 --> 00:01:37,967
- 20 years of marriage.
20. Thrown away for what?

7
00:01:38,098 --> 00:01:39,969
A cheap fling?

8
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:44,408
I have leave him now, I mean...
I have to leave him.

9
00:01:44,539 --> 00:01:48,020
- Now, Mrs. Cutler, that's...
That's really not for us to say.

10
00:01:48,151 --> 00:01:50,197
- Well, what do
your other clients do?

11
00:01:51,110 --> 00:01:53,591
- Some people leave,
some people stay.

12
00:01:53,722 --> 00:01:55,463
Everybody reacts
differently.

13
00:01:55,593 --> 00:01:57,551
The main thing right now,
Mrs. Cutler,

14
00:01:57,682 --> 00:01:59,119
is that you have
all the information,

15
00:01:59,249 --> 00:02:00,990
which means you have
all the power.

16
00:02:01,121 --> 00:02:05,255
- Power? Do I look like
I have power?

17
00:02:05,386 --> 00:02:08,127
- Just because you're hurt
doesn't mean you're powerless.

18
00:02:08,258 --> 00:02:10,434
You're armed with
everything you need

19
00:02:10,565 --> 00:02:12,001
to make an informed decision.

20
00:02:12,132 --> 00:02:13,655
So you hold all the cards.

21
00:02:16,701 --> 00:02:19,400
- I just knew that he was
messing around behind my back.

22
00:02:19,530 --> 00:02:22,446
I knew it. But now
that I know for sure...

23
00:02:25,406 --> 00:02:27,843
I just feel so worthless.

24
00:02:29,236 --> 00:02:31,412
- You are not worthless.

25
00:02:32,587 --> 00:02:35,938
Hey, you were smart enough
to come in here

26
00:02:36,067 --> 00:02:38,636
and ask a question you maybe
didn't want the answer to.

27
00:02:39,420 --> 00:02:41,161
But you did it.

28
00:02:41,291 --> 00:02:44,555
And that takes guts.
And strength.

29
00:02:44,686 --> 00:02:48,255
And yes, being betrayed
by somebody you love,

30
00:02:48,385 --> 00:02:52,084
somebody you thought you knew;
that hurts.

31
00:02:52,215 --> 00:02:54,174
But that is not on you.

32
00:02:54,304 --> 00:02:56,088
That is on him.

33
00:02:56,219 --> 00:02:58,047
It is always on them.

34
00:02:58,178 --> 00:03:00,963
Men cheat;

35
00:03:01,093 --> 00:03:03,966
they break promises,
but now, you get to decide,

36
00:03:04,096 --> 00:03:06,925
is this a man that you can learn
to trust again?

37
00:03:07,056 --> 00:03:10,842
Or do you move on,
knowing what you know now?

38
00:03:10,973 --> 00:03:13,105
You stand in that power

39
00:03:13,236 --> 00:03:15,804
and you make that decision
for yourself.

40
00:03:20,025 --> 00:03:21,984
- You're right.
I've done nothing wrong.

41
00:03:22,114 --> 00:03:24,116
- No, you didn't.

42
00:03:24,247 --> 00:03:26,075
Never take the fall for
someone else's wrongdoing.

43
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:29,383
- I have a lot to think about.

44
00:03:31,211 --> 00:03:32,690
- Thank you.

45
00:03:32,821 --> 00:03:35,215
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

46
00:03:35,954 --> 00:03:37,347
- You've been helpful.

47
00:03:45,399 --> 00:03:48,402
- 10 bucks says she stays.
- Nah.

48
00:03:48,531 --> 00:03:50,230
She's gonna bleed him dry.

49
00:03:52,667 --> 00:03:55,539
- Lucy Thompson?
- Who's asking?

50
00:03:55,670 --> 00:04:00,022
- My name is Clive Cassel.
You came highly recommended.

51
00:04:00,152 --> 00:04:01,676
- Yes, Mr. Cassel. I believe

52
00:04:01,806 --> 00:04:03,417
I spoke to your assistant.
- That's right.

53
00:04:03,547 --> 00:04:05,549
- What can I do for you,
Mr. Cassel?

54
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:08,117
- Please, call me Clive.
- What can I do for you, Clive?

55
00:04:08,248 --> 00:04:10,424
- I think my wife
is having an affair

56
00:04:10,554 --> 00:04:12,774
and I would need
your help proving it.

57
00:04:12,904 --> 00:04:15,429
It's not always
the man who cheats...

58
00:04:16,298 --> 00:04:17,866
- Of course.

59
00:04:17,995 --> 00:04:20,129
Uh, please, have a seat.

60
00:04:21,696 --> 00:04:23,306
August, aren't you
going to join us?

61
00:04:23,437 --> 00:04:24,960
- No, I've got an interview
to get to.

62
00:04:25,090 --> 00:04:26,135
You can bring me up
to speed later.

63
00:04:26,266 --> 00:04:27,267
- Sure.

64
00:04:28,398 --> 00:04:30,139
Can I get you a coffee?

65
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:31,445
- Please.

66
00:04:34,274 --> 00:04:36,928
Adriana was
my interior designer.

67
00:04:38,278 --> 00:04:41,672
We met shortly after
I sold my first start-up.

68
00:04:41,803 --> 00:04:44,893
We've been together
just under eight years now.

69
00:04:45,023 --> 00:04:48,462
The first six, happy.
The rest...

70
00:04:50,246 --> 00:04:52,422
Well, I'm here, aren't I?

71
00:04:52,553 --> 00:04:56,426
It was the closest I'd ever come
to love at first sight.

72
00:04:57,427 --> 00:04:58,950
And now, she's got me wondering

73
00:04:59,081 --> 00:05:00,561
whether she ever
loved me at all.

74
00:05:01,388 --> 00:05:02,911
- A lot of people wonder that

75
00:05:03,041 --> 00:05:04,695
when they suspect
their spouse is cheating.

76
00:05:04,826 --> 00:05:05,957
- Right.

77
00:05:07,742 --> 00:05:10,962
- So, what initially made you
question her fidelity?

78
00:05:11,093 --> 00:05:13,704
- Oh, the usual stuff, I guess.

79
00:05:13,835 --> 00:05:15,793
Gradually, throughout
the years,

80
00:05:15,924 --> 00:05:17,404
I could sense her pulling away.

81
00:05:17,534 --> 00:05:19,406
I know I can take
some of the blame for that,

82
00:05:19,536 --> 00:05:22,713
I travel a lot for work
and she's always busy too.

83
00:05:22,844 --> 00:05:25,063
It's hard to find time
to be together.

84
00:05:25,194 --> 00:05:30,417
But when we do make
the time, it's... different.

85
00:05:30,547 --> 00:05:33,071
- Different how?

86
00:05:33,202 --> 00:05:34,943
- Well, for starters,
we stopped having sex.

87
00:05:36,074 --> 00:05:40,775
And she became difficult
to get a hold of,

88
00:05:40,905 --> 00:05:42,777
screening my calls,

89
00:05:42,907 --> 00:05:47,042
she started having
private conversations
behind closed doors.

90
00:05:47,172 --> 00:05:48,870
She never used to do that.

91
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,351
She's an interior designer.

92
00:05:51,481 --> 00:05:53,831
What could possibly be
so confidential?

93
00:05:54,876 --> 00:05:57,139
Do you need me to continue?

94
00:05:57,269 --> 00:06:00,708
- No. From the sounds of it,
you're completely justified

95
00:06:00,838 --> 00:06:03,232
in feeling the way you do.
- Oh, thanks.

96
00:06:03,363 --> 00:06:05,495
It's nice to know
I'm not losing my mind.

97
00:06:06,496 --> 00:06:08,411
- You're not. In my experience,

98
00:06:08,542 --> 00:06:10,848
it's always best
to trust your instincts.

99
00:06:12,633 --> 00:06:16,637
- Well, it'll be
a relief to finally get
to the bottom of this.

100
00:06:16,767 --> 00:06:18,856
Whatever the truth is.

101
00:06:18,987 --> 00:06:20,728
- I understand.

102
00:06:20,858 --> 00:06:24,906
- So, how does this work?
Do I have to sign something?

103
00:06:25,036 --> 00:06:27,778
- Uh, do you have
any questions for me?

104
00:06:27,909 --> 00:06:29,780
Am I the first investigator
you've met with?

105
00:06:29,911 --> 00:06:32,957
- No. I met with
Rudy Davis last week.

106
00:06:33,088 --> 00:06:36,657
- Oh, Rudy. How'd that go?
- He's a hack.

107
00:06:36,787 --> 00:06:39,094
- Wasn't gonna say.
- I've done my research.

108
00:06:39,224 --> 00:06:41,270
I've explored a few
other options and...

109
00:06:42,053 --> 00:06:43,403
I want you.

110
00:06:44,534 --> 00:06:46,014
- What makes you so sure?

111
00:06:47,755 --> 00:06:50,279
- Let's just say
I'm trusting my instincts.

112
00:06:52,107 --> 00:06:53,674
- I'll have August
send over a contract

113
00:06:53,804 --> 00:06:55,066
and we'll go from there.

114
00:06:55,197 --> 00:06:58,113
- Wonderful. Thank you.

115
00:07:36,586 --> 00:07:39,415
- Hey, Cami.
- Happy almost birthday.

116
00:07:39,546 --> 00:07:41,286
- Do you have to remind me?

117
00:07:41,417 --> 00:07:42,897
- What would you do without me?

118
00:07:43,027 --> 00:07:45,159
- Not have a birthday party,
for starters.

119
00:07:45,290 --> 00:07:47,641
- Oh, don't be such
a party pooper!

120
00:07:47,771 --> 00:07:50,382
This is your 35th! We have
to do something special.

121
00:07:50,513 --> 00:07:53,037
I've kind of invited someone
I want you to meet.

122
00:07:53,777 --> 00:07:55,866
- You know I don't do setups.

123
00:07:55,997 --> 00:07:59,870
- Look, sweetie, I know you
don't trust anyone.

124
00:08:00,001 --> 00:08:02,960
I get it. You're exposed
to a lot of bad guys

125
00:08:03,091 --> 00:08:04,788
doing what you do every day.

126
00:08:04,919 --> 00:08:07,704
But, not everybody cheats.

127
00:08:07,835 --> 00:08:09,837
I mean, just look
at Charles and I.

128
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:14,363
If you just let someone in,
just for once,

129
00:08:14,494 --> 00:08:16,147
maybe you can be
as happy as we are.

130
00:08:20,369 --> 00:08:21,936
How bad could it be?

131
00:08:22,066 --> 00:08:23,633
If I'm wrong,
I will leave you alone.

132
00:08:23,764 --> 00:08:25,461
No more setups.

133
00:08:28,725 --> 00:08:32,033
Hello? You there?

134
00:08:32,163 --> 00:08:34,209
- Alright, fine.
You can invite him.

135
00:08:34,338 --> 00:08:35,602
- Yes!

136
00:08:35,732 --> 00:08:37,038
- But if he turns out

137
00:08:37,168 --> 00:08:38,779
to be another dud,
you leave me alone?

138
00:08:38,909 --> 00:08:39,866
- Scout's honor.

139
00:08:41,172 --> 00:08:43,479
- I'll see you Friday.
- Love you!

140
00:08:43,610 --> 00:08:45,046
- Love you too.

141
00:11:48,446 --> 00:11:51,145
- Who you texting?
- Just Lucy.

142
00:11:51,275 --> 00:11:54,714
You ever meet Adriana or
Clive Cassel at the CATC ball?

143
00:11:54,844 --> 00:11:57,238
- Not that I know of, why?

144
00:11:57,368 --> 00:11:59,022
- Must be for a case
or something.

145
00:12:00,981 --> 00:12:02,678
- Uh, I got to get to work.

146
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:07,335
Hey.

147
00:12:08,075 --> 00:12:11,078
I love you.
- Love you, too.

148
00:12:24,874 --> 00:12:29,183
- Hey! Uh, just my usual.
And uh,

149
00:12:29,313 --> 00:12:30,706
a round for my friends.

150
00:12:32,229 --> 00:12:35,363
I can't believe it,
she's wearing a dress.

151
00:12:35,493 --> 00:12:39,715
- Nice. I should set you up
on blind dates more often.

152
00:12:39,846 --> 00:12:43,066
- No, you shouldn't.
This was so much work.

153
00:12:43,197 --> 00:12:44,851
- Can you grab...?
- Yeah.

154
00:12:48,115 --> 00:12:50,552
- Happy Birthday!
- Happy Birthday, Lucy.

155
00:12:52,380 --> 00:12:55,296
You guys!

156
00:12:56,906 --> 00:13:00,388
I love them!
These will come in handy!

157
00:13:00,518 --> 00:13:02,694
Thank you both so much.

158
00:13:02,825 --> 00:13:07,047
So, tell me about Mr. Wonderful.
- What? Remi?

159
00:13:07,177 --> 00:13:09,745
Well, he's... He's...

160
00:13:09,876 --> 00:13:11,094
He's wonderful.

161
00:13:13,488 --> 00:13:16,186
Unless you're already
spoken for, that is.

162
00:13:16,317 --> 00:13:18,319
I'm pretty sure he's kind of
the monogamous type.

163
00:13:18,449 --> 00:13:21,931
- Oh, that is August,
my new associate,

164
00:13:22,062 --> 00:13:23,541
wishing me a happy birthday.

165
00:13:23,672 --> 00:13:25,239
He has been a lifesaver,

166
00:13:25,369 --> 00:13:27,154
I honestly don't know how I did
anything without him.

167
00:13:30,810 --> 00:13:32,507
Thank you.

168
00:13:34,335 --> 00:13:36,032
Well, cheers.

169
00:13:36,163 --> 00:13:38,643
To best friends.
Thank you guys for doing this.

170
00:13:38,774 --> 00:13:40,863
- We love you, Lucy.
- Cheers.

171
00:13:40,994 --> 00:13:43,518
- So, seriously,
tell me about this guy.

172
00:13:43,648 --> 00:13:45,302
What's wrong with him?
Why is he single?

173
00:13:45,433 --> 00:13:47,870
- Well, I occasionally snore,

174
00:13:48,001 --> 00:13:51,091
casually drink and I may have
a slight shoe fetish.

175
00:13:51,221 --> 00:13:54,442
- Uh, well, those look like
regular old shoes to me.

176
00:13:56,052 --> 00:13:57,575
- I like her.

177
00:13:57,706 --> 00:13:59,360
Remi.

178
00:13:59,490 --> 00:14:01,797
- Lucy.
- Nice to meet you.

179
00:14:01,928 --> 00:14:03,581
- Well, there it is,
ladies and gentlemen.

180
00:14:03,712 --> 00:14:05,714
Love at first slight.

181
00:14:07,672 --> 00:14:12,025
Hey, I'm just really glad
the two of you got off
on the right foot!

182
00:14:12,155 --> 00:14:13,940
- Ugh!
- Wow.

183
00:14:14,070 --> 00:14:15,724
- Yeah.
- What?

184
00:14:16,681 --> 00:14:18,640
- Well, what do you think?

185
00:14:20,207 --> 00:14:23,863
He's nice, right? He likes you,
he asked me for your number.

186
00:14:23,993 --> 00:14:26,648
- I will admit,
I had a good time.

187
00:14:26,778 --> 00:14:28,650
- So, you gonna see him again?

188
00:14:29,390 --> 00:14:31,218
Charles can 100 % vouch for him.

189
00:14:31,348 --> 00:14:35,396
- Cami, I don't know.
- Take a chance!

190
00:14:35,526 --> 00:14:39,052
Life is full of unknowns,
but risks like this are
worth taking!

191
00:14:40,357 --> 00:14:42,794
Lucy, how many times
do I have to tell you

192
00:14:42,925 --> 00:14:46,015
they are not all bad guys?
- Okay! Fine!

193
00:14:46,146 --> 00:14:48,670
If you stop badgering me,
then I'll go out with him again.

194
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:50,324
- Now wasn't that easy?

195
00:14:51,455 --> 00:14:53,762
Your chariot awaits.

196
00:14:53,893 --> 00:14:54,850
- Ladies...

197
00:15:03,250 --> 00:15:04,555
- Thank you.

198
00:15:20,963 --> 00:15:22,617
- Sorry, boss.
Didn't mean to scare you.

199
00:15:24,271 --> 00:15:26,142
- That lunch?
- Yeah.

200
00:15:26,273 --> 00:15:28,492
- Then, I won't fire you.
- Thanks.

201
00:15:28,623 --> 00:15:30,625
If you need anything else,
I'll be at the office.

202
00:15:30,755 --> 00:15:31,931
- Thank you!

203
00:15:42,811 --> 00:15:44,639
Where are you going?

204
00:17:01,063 --> 00:17:02,673
And who might you be?

205
00:17:04,806 --> 00:17:06,199
Surprise!

206
00:17:23,128 --> 00:17:24,913
- Thank you for meeting me.

207
00:17:25,044 --> 00:17:26,654
- Of course.

208
00:17:26,784 --> 00:17:28,221
- What are you drinking?

209
00:17:29,091 --> 00:17:31,398
- Uh, I really shouldn't.

210
00:17:31,528 --> 00:17:33,530
I'm charging you
by the hour, remember?

211
00:17:34,270 --> 00:17:36,881
Uh... Manhattan.

212
00:17:38,579 --> 00:17:39,928
- On me.

213
00:17:40,059 --> 00:17:41,408
- Thanks.

214
00:17:41,538 --> 00:17:43,279
So, uh...

215
00:17:44,715 --> 00:17:47,414
Sorry to say I've been tailing
Adriana for a week

216
00:17:47,544 --> 00:17:49,285
and I have nothing
to show for it.

217
00:17:49,416 --> 00:17:50,982
- Oh?

218
00:17:51,113 --> 00:17:54,029
- There's no suspicious
activity.

219
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:55,596
Her phone log is clean,

220
00:17:55,726 --> 00:17:57,250
she goes to and from work
most days,

221
00:17:57,380 --> 00:18:00,514
consultations,
a homecoming party...

222
00:18:01,515 --> 00:18:02,820
I don't know what to tell you.

223
00:18:02,951 --> 00:18:04,692
I don't think
you need to keep me on.

224
00:18:05,649 --> 00:18:08,783
- Well, I appreciate
your honesty.

225
00:18:10,567 --> 00:18:11,786
- Thanks.

226
00:18:13,004 --> 00:18:15,181
- But, I want you to stay on.

227
00:18:16,443 --> 00:18:17,835
- You would?

228
00:18:17,966 --> 00:18:19,620
- She's up to something.

229
00:18:19,750 --> 00:18:22,057
You've only been
on the case for a week.

230
00:18:22,188 --> 00:18:24,190
I'm sure if you stay on longer,
something will come up.

231
00:18:24,842 --> 00:18:26,235
Call it intuition.

232
00:18:27,367 --> 00:18:29,412
- You really don't trust her.

233
00:18:29,543 --> 00:18:33,808
- Well, a wise woman once
told me to follow my instincts.

234
00:18:41,511 --> 00:18:42,556
Typical.

235
00:18:47,996 --> 00:18:49,084
- Someone you know?

236
00:18:49,215 --> 00:18:50,868
- No.

237
00:18:50,999 --> 00:18:52,783
Turns out,
I don't know him at all.

238
00:18:53,567 --> 00:18:55,917
- And what does that mean?

239
00:18:56,047 --> 00:18:57,353
- You don't want to know.

240
00:18:57,484 --> 00:18:58,789
- Try me.

241
00:19:00,791 --> 00:19:04,447
- Okay. Um...
We met last week.

242
00:19:04,578 --> 00:19:05,666
Thought he was interested.

243
00:19:08,451 --> 00:19:11,411
- Well, for what it's worth,
he's obviously an idiot.

244
00:19:13,152 --> 00:19:16,242
- Thank you.
But I'm the idiot.

245
00:19:16,372 --> 00:19:21,029
I let my friend convince me
to let my guard down

246
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:23,901
despite my better judgement,
I did.

247
00:19:24,032 --> 00:19:25,207
Serves me right.

248
00:19:25,338 --> 00:19:27,340
- No one deserves
to be deceived.

249
00:19:28,732 --> 00:19:30,517
- I know that better
than anyone.

250
00:19:30,647 --> 00:19:32,214
Look at what I do.

251
00:19:32,345 --> 00:19:33,998
- Right.

252
00:19:34,129 --> 00:19:38,655
So, what got you
into all of this?

253
00:19:38,786 --> 00:19:40,701
Private investigating?

254
00:19:43,660 --> 00:19:45,314
- Well...

255
00:19:45,445 --> 00:19:47,925
My dad left when I was little.

256
00:19:48,056 --> 00:19:51,494
Ran off with his secretary,
believe it or not.

257
00:19:52,626 --> 00:19:56,543
Blindsided my mom,
left her with nothing.

258
00:19:57,848 --> 00:19:59,850
Just seemed like the best way
to make sure

259
00:19:59,981 --> 00:20:01,200
it didn't happen
to someone else.

260
00:20:02,201 --> 00:20:04,464
- So, it's personal.
- Yeah.

261
00:20:05,856 --> 00:20:08,294
That and I always thought
I had killer instincts.

262
00:20:08,424 --> 00:20:09,991
Until now, that is.

263
00:20:10,121 --> 00:20:12,907
- Oh hey, don't let this guy
make you doubt yourself.

264
00:20:13,037 --> 00:20:15,649
We all misjudge people
once in a while.

265
00:20:17,128 --> 00:20:18,565
- I should have known better.

266
00:20:18,695 --> 00:20:20,393
This is why I don't date.

267
00:20:22,830 --> 00:20:24,092
- Ever?

268
00:20:24,223 --> 00:20:26,660
- I always saw trust
as a weakness.

269
00:20:29,097 --> 00:20:31,230
- That's a little harsh,
don't you think?

270
00:20:32,840 --> 00:20:34,885
- This coming from the guy
who asked me to follow his wife?

271
00:20:39,586 --> 00:20:41,109
I'm sorry.
That was uncalled for.

272
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:44,112
- No, don't apologize,
you're right.

273
00:20:45,679 --> 00:20:47,420
- Well, I should get going.
Thank you for the drink.

274
00:20:47,550 --> 00:20:49,900
- Stay.
- I really shouldn't.

275
00:20:50,031 --> 00:20:51,946
- Don't make me eat alone.

276
00:21:00,171 --> 00:21:03,740
- So, you don't eat alone.

277
00:21:03,871 --> 00:21:05,438
What's that about?

278
00:21:05,568 --> 00:21:07,178
- Oh I didn't say I don't.

279
00:21:07,309 --> 00:21:09,268
I just prefer not to.

280
00:21:12,096 --> 00:21:15,448
What? Is that so hard
to believe?

281
00:21:15,578 --> 00:21:17,319
- I don't know,
I just had you down

282
00:21:17,450 --> 00:21:18,668
as the independent type of guy.

283
00:21:18,799 --> 00:21:21,280
- Oh no, you've got me
all wrong.

284
00:21:21,410 --> 00:21:22,933
Total codependent.

285
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:26,110
- Really?
- I'm kidding.

286
00:21:27,808 --> 00:21:30,985
Though, I'm starting to think
no one is as independent as you.

287
00:21:31,899 --> 00:21:33,335
- How do you figure?

288
00:21:33,466 --> 00:21:35,598
- You live alone,
you don't date ever,

289
00:21:35,729 --> 00:21:37,383
you see trust as a weakness.

290
00:21:37,513 --> 00:21:39,950
- Okay. Point taken.

291
00:21:40,081 --> 00:21:43,171
- But come on, there must be
someone you can trust.

292
00:21:46,087 --> 00:21:47,567
- Cami.

293
00:21:47,697 --> 00:21:50,396
We've been best friends
since college.

294
00:21:50,526 --> 00:21:55,444
She's been by my side
despite my... intensity.

295
00:21:56,837 --> 00:21:59,100
Through thick and thin,
no matter what.

296
00:22:00,493 --> 00:22:02,843
For years it was me and Cami
against the world.

297
00:22:04,323 --> 00:22:05,498
- Was?

298
00:22:07,064 --> 00:22:09,371
- She married her husband
Charles a few years back.

299
00:22:09,502 --> 00:22:11,199
- Charles?

300
00:22:11,330 --> 00:22:14,333
And how do we feel
about Charles?

301
00:22:16,291 --> 00:22:19,816
- At first, I had my doubts,
as you can imagine.

302
00:22:21,209 --> 00:22:22,819
But he's actually become
a really good friend.

303
00:22:22,950 --> 00:22:25,082
And they're great together.

304
00:22:25,213 --> 00:22:27,171
They're like
the perfect couple.

305
00:22:27,302 --> 00:22:30,349
If there's anyone who could
convince me that...

306
00:22:32,568 --> 00:22:35,441
Never mind.
- What?

307
00:22:35,571 --> 00:22:37,530
- No, it's nothing.
It's stupid.

308
00:22:37,660 --> 00:22:40,315
- Come on, say it.
- No. Really.

309
00:22:40,446 --> 00:22:42,361
- You know I won't let up.

310
00:22:42,491 --> 00:22:43,840
- You are shockingly persistent.

311
00:22:45,929 --> 00:22:47,583
I was just gonna say,

312
00:22:47,714 --> 00:22:49,672
if there's anybody who could
make me believe in true love,

313
00:22:49,803 --> 00:22:51,239
it would be them.

314
00:22:52,893 --> 00:22:54,547
That was even sappier
out loud.

315
00:22:57,027 --> 00:22:58,725
- I think it's nice.

316
00:23:03,643 --> 00:23:08,082
I'm starting to think
you're more of a romantic
than you let on.

317
00:23:19,049 --> 00:23:20,399
You're sure it was him?

318
00:23:20,529 --> 00:23:23,663
- Positive.
- Damn, Luce. I'm sorry.

319
00:23:23,793 --> 00:23:27,710
I totally misjudged him.
- Yeah well, I did too.

320
00:23:27,841 --> 00:23:30,583
I'm just glad it ended before
it even started, you know?

321
00:23:30,713 --> 00:23:34,021
- What were you doing
at The Waverley, anyway?

322
00:23:34,151 --> 00:23:36,066
- I was meeting a client.

323
00:23:36,197 --> 00:23:38,852
- At The Waverley? Fancy.

324
00:23:38,982 --> 00:23:42,508
- Yeah, well, he insisted.
Actually, he um...

325
00:23:43,770 --> 00:23:45,946
He made me feel better
about the whole thing.

326
00:23:46,076 --> 00:23:48,470
We had dinner, talked.
It was nice.

327
00:23:48,601 --> 00:23:49,993
- Having dinner with a client?

328
00:23:50,124 --> 00:23:51,647
I never would've thought
I'd see the day.

329
00:23:51,778 --> 00:23:53,301
- Like I said, he insisted.

330
00:23:53,432 --> 00:23:54,998
- Hey, Luce.

331
00:23:55,129 --> 00:23:57,174
Cami mentioned a Cassel
the other day,

332
00:23:57,305 --> 00:23:58,785
is that the client?

333
00:23:59,699 --> 00:24:01,309
- His name is Clive.

334
00:24:03,006 --> 00:24:04,443
I don't know, there's like
something about him.

335
00:24:04,573 --> 00:24:06,532
I just feel like
I can talk to him.

336
00:24:06,662 --> 00:24:08,229
- Are you sure
this is a good idea, Lucy?

337
00:24:08,359 --> 00:24:09,796
Fraternizing with a client?

338
00:24:09,926 --> 00:24:11,580
He's obviously going
through a lot.

339
00:24:11,711 --> 00:24:14,583
Maybe you should just move
away from this one.

340
00:24:14,714 --> 00:24:16,846
- What are you talking about?
A job's a job!

341
00:24:16,977 --> 00:24:18,457
They just had dinner.
What's the big deal?

342
00:24:18,587 --> 00:24:20,850
- He's a married man, Cami.

343
00:24:20,981 --> 00:24:22,983
What do you even know
about this guy anyway?

344
00:24:23,113 --> 00:24:24,637
- She's a professional, babe.

345
00:24:24,767 --> 00:24:25,986
She's done her due diligence.

346
00:24:26,116 --> 00:24:27,378
Right, Luce?

347
00:24:27,509 --> 00:24:29,163
- Obviously.

348
00:24:29,293 --> 00:24:31,687
Look, I gotta get ready work.
I'll talk to you guys later.

349
00:24:31,818 --> 00:24:32,819
Bye.

350
00:24:41,697 --> 00:24:43,264
- What?

351
00:24:43,394 --> 00:24:44,874
- I really don't think
it's a good idea.

352
00:24:45,484 --> 00:24:46,615
- She knows what she's doing.

353
00:24:48,095 --> 00:24:49,183
- You're right.

354
00:24:50,140 --> 00:24:51,359
Okay.

355
00:24:53,317 --> 00:24:54,754
Love you.

356
00:24:54,884 --> 00:24:56,843
Oh, hey, I've got
that meeting tonight.

357
00:24:56,973 --> 00:24:58,497
So I'm gonna
be home late. Okay?

358
00:24:58,627 --> 00:25:00,847
- Yup. Love you too.
- Bye.

359
00:25:02,718 --> 00:25:04,198
- Have a good day!

360
00:25:49,678 --> 00:25:51,114
- Good work everyone.
Keep it up.

361
00:25:51,245 --> 00:25:53,508
Let's go! Let's go!
Train hard, let's go! Again!

362
00:25:53,639 --> 00:25:55,292
Alright, let's go, come on.

363
00:25:55,423 --> 00:25:57,077
Hard, let's go.
Come on, train hard.

364
00:25:57,207 --> 00:25:58,992
Cross, jab, cross, jab. Come on!

365
00:25:59,122 --> 00:26:00,515
Cross, jab, cross, jab.

366
00:26:00,646 --> 00:26:03,649
One, two, three, four!
Good, keep going.

367
00:26:03,779 --> 00:26:05,215
Come on, come on!

368
00:26:05,346 --> 00:26:07,261
Hey, Clive, you made it.
Come in.

369
00:26:08,567 --> 00:26:10,220
- Sorry I'm late.
- It's all good.

370
00:26:10,351 --> 00:26:12,092
Alright, let's go.

371
00:26:12,701 --> 00:26:14,660
Come on, guys, let's go!

372
00:26:14,790 --> 00:26:16,966
Come on, guys.
Let's keep training!

373
00:26:17,097 --> 00:26:18,402
Let's go, let's go, come on!

374
00:26:18,533 --> 00:26:20,143
Train hard, let's go,
come on!

375
00:26:20,274 --> 00:26:21,449
Ten more, come on!

376
00:26:25,279 --> 00:26:26,846
Next combination.

377
00:26:29,849 --> 00:26:32,373
Let's go, Lucy! Come on, hard!
Come on! Don't slack off.

378
00:26:32,503 --> 00:26:34,941
Come on! 10 more! 10 more!

379
00:26:35,071 --> 00:26:36,464
Let's go!

380
00:26:36,595 --> 00:26:39,598
Okay, listen up,
time to pair up.

381
00:26:39,728 --> 00:26:42,035
Try and team up with someone you
haven't worked with yet, okay?

382
00:26:42,165 --> 00:26:43,602
Let's go, find somebody.

383
00:26:43,732 --> 00:26:45,516
Let's go, come on,
don't waste time.

384
00:26:45,647 --> 00:26:46,822
- Hey!

385
00:26:48,215 --> 00:26:50,957
So what do you say?
Partners?

386
00:26:52,349 --> 00:26:53,742
- Sure.
- Alright.

387
00:26:56,005 --> 00:26:57,528
- Jab, cross!
Again, two more times.

388
00:26:57,659 --> 00:26:59,879
Jab, cross.
Let's go, let's go!

389
00:27:00,009 --> 00:27:01,707
Okay, next combo, Lucy,
next combo.

390
00:27:01,837 --> 00:27:04,318
Right cross, left hook,
right cross.

391
00:27:04,448 --> 00:27:05,928
Don't give up, come on,
everybody!

392
00:27:06,059 --> 00:27:07,495
Come on, I see you slacking
back there, come on!

393
00:27:08,975 --> 00:27:11,455
Get your ass in gear,
let's go, come on, guys!

394
00:27:11,586 --> 00:27:13,501
There it is, yeah, you got it.

395
00:27:17,026 --> 00:27:19,812
- That's quite
the right hook you've got.

396
00:27:20,856 --> 00:27:22,292
- It comes in handy.

397
00:27:22,423 --> 00:27:23,990
You'd be surprised the number
of unsavory characters

398
00:27:24,120 --> 00:27:25,208
I've had to use it on.

399
00:27:25,731 --> 00:27:27,297
- I don't doubt it.

400
00:27:27,428 --> 00:27:29,648
- I've never seen you here
before. New hobby?

401
00:27:30,431 --> 00:27:31,650
- That obvious, huh?

402
00:27:32,694 --> 00:27:34,304
- You held your own.

403
00:27:34,435 --> 00:27:37,917
- Yeah, well, I'm thinking
about investing in the studio.

404
00:27:38,047 --> 00:27:40,180
So, figured I'd come
check it out.

405
00:27:40,920 --> 00:27:42,182
- And?

406
00:27:43,966 --> 00:27:46,360
- I can definitely see
the appeal.

407
00:27:49,058 --> 00:27:50,669
- Well, I should get going.

408
00:27:50,799 --> 00:27:52,758
I don't want my employer
to think I'm slacking off.

409
00:27:52,888 --> 00:27:54,194
- Yeah. Of course.

410
00:27:55,804 --> 00:27:57,676
Nice running into you,
Lucy Thompson.

411
00:28:48,814 --> 00:28:50,250
- Have a good night.
Thank you.

412
00:29:12,402 --> 00:29:13,621
- I know you're following me.

413
00:29:15,666 --> 00:29:17,103
I don't want to hear it,

414
00:29:17,233 --> 00:29:19,409
I know Clive put you up to this.

415
00:29:19,540 --> 00:29:22,456
You're not the first person he's
hired to chase me around town.

416
00:29:22,586 --> 00:29:24,327
He's not who you think he is.

417
00:29:25,067 --> 00:29:26,416
I'd be careful if I were you.

418
00:32:00,048 --> 00:32:03,269
- Dean Calvet plus one, bar.

419
00:32:30,165 --> 00:32:31,645
Clive. Hi.

420
00:32:31,775 --> 00:32:33,777
- Hi. I hope I'm not
calling too early.

421
00:32:33,908 --> 00:32:35,823
- No, not at all.
I'm actually at the office.

422
00:32:35,954 --> 00:32:37,999
- Wow. The reviews online
weren't kidding

423
00:32:38,130 --> 00:32:40,045
when they said
you were dedicated.

424
00:32:40,175 --> 00:32:42,134
I was going to see
if you wanted a coffee.

425
00:32:42,264 --> 00:32:44,701
- Yeah, actually,
that would be great.

426
00:32:44,832 --> 00:32:47,487
Um, there's been
a development with your wife,

427
00:32:47,617 --> 00:32:49,184
I'm just not sure
what it is yet.

428
00:32:49,315 --> 00:32:51,882
Do you know a Dean Calvet?

429
00:32:52,013 --> 00:32:55,147
- Uh, no. Why?

430
00:32:55,277 --> 00:32:56,539
- She had dinner with him
last night.

431
00:32:56,670 --> 00:32:58,019
I was hoping maybe
you knew who he was.

432
00:32:58,150 --> 00:33:00,674
- No. I've never heard
that name before.

433
00:33:00,804 --> 00:33:02,676
- I've got a couple photos.

434
00:33:02,806 --> 00:33:04,069
Maybe you could come by
and identify him?

435
00:33:04,199 --> 00:33:06,201
- Absolutely.
I'll be by shortly

436
00:33:06,332 --> 00:33:07,376
with your coffee
and take a look.

437
00:33:07,507 --> 00:33:08,856
- Great.

438
00:33:11,163 --> 00:33:14,209
They didn't so much
as kiss goodbye.

439
00:33:14,340 --> 00:33:17,125
So they're definitely not
romantically involved,

440
00:33:17,256 --> 00:33:20,302
but she did hand him an envelope
right before he got in the Uber.

441
00:33:20,433 --> 00:33:22,913
So you're right,
there's something going on,

442
00:33:23,044 --> 00:33:24,437
I just don't know
what it is yet.

443
00:33:24,567 --> 00:33:27,701
- Well, I don't
recognize him, but...

444
00:33:28,963 --> 00:33:31,096
What happened after
the envelope?

445
00:33:31,226 --> 00:33:34,360
- He just got in the Uber
and then I followed her home.

446
00:33:36,014 --> 00:33:38,668
- What?
So, you were at my place?

447
00:33:39,278 --> 00:33:40,322
- Yeah.

448
00:33:41,193 --> 00:33:42,194
Why?

449
00:33:43,978 --> 00:33:45,327
- Did you see me?

450
00:33:46,937 --> 00:33:47,895
- Yeah.

451
00:33:49,375 --> 00:33:52,378
She came in, went straight
to the kitchen,

452
00:33:52,508 --> 00:33:55,207
kissed you.
That's when I left.

453
00:33:56,251 --> 00:33:57,557
- Lucy...

454
00:33:59,994 --> 00:34:01,343
Nothing happened.

455
00:34:03,128 --> 00:34:06,044
- It doesn't matter.
She's your wife.

456
00:34:07,306 --> 00:34:09,221
- We're not in love anymore.

457
00:34:12,614 --> 00:34:14,878
- Then why do you care
if she's having an affair?

458
00:34:15,009 --> 00:34:16,750
Why don't you just leave her?

459
00:34:17,533 --> 00:34:19,187
- It's not that simple.

460
00:34:20,536 --> 00:34:22,495
I need to prove
she's cheating

461
00:34:22,625 --> 00:34:25,759
or else she'll fight me
for everything in the divorce.

462
00:34:27,021 --> 00:34:28,543
- So, it's about the money.

463
00:34:31,156 --> 00:34:32,722
- It was...

464
00:34:35,725 --> 00:34:37,945
But it's not anymore.

465
00:34:41,079 --> 00:34:42,428
- What's it about?

466
00:34:51,001 --> 00:34:54,440
- Lucy... it's about you.

467
00:34:59,227 --> 00:35:00,750
- I think you should go.

468
00:35:03,318 --> 00:35:04,624
- Yeah.

469
00:35:05,407 --> 00:35:06,930
Right. I'm sorry.

470
00:35:07,061 --> 00:35:08,802
- No. I'm sorry.
- It's just...

471
00:35:11,979 --> 00:35:15,113
I've never felt this way
about anyone.

472
00:35:16,114 --> 00:35:17,767
- Clive, I...

473
00:35:19,334 --> 00:35:20,466
- What?

474
00:35:23,556 --> 00:35:25,297
- I can't cross this line.

475
00:35:31,607 --> 00:35:33,131
- I understand.

476
00:35:35,002 --> 00:35:36,134
I'll go.

477
00:35:41,661 --> 00:35:43,837
- I'll let you know if I find
anything else about your wife.

478
00:35:43,967 --> 00:35:45,012
- Yeah.

479
00:37:20,107 --> 00:37:21,064
- Lucy!

480
00:37:24,459 --> 00:37:25,765
Sorry I'm late.

481
00:37:25,895 --> 00:37:28,333
The line-up at the coffee bar
was nuts.

482
00:37:28,463 --> 00:37:30,160
Damn hipsters!

483
00:37:30,291 --> 00:37:32,728
I'm in here. Come on in.

484
00:37:34,730 --> 00:37:36,863
- Oh, Mr. Cassel,
good morning.

485
00:37:38,386 --> 00:37:40,214
I'd have brought you a coffee
if I knew you were here.

486
00:37:40,345 --> 00:37:41,998
- Clive brought coffee.

487
00:37:42,129 --> 00:37:43,565
I got some pictures
of this guy last night

488
00:37:43,696 --> 00:37:45,872
and Clive was kind enough
to drop by last minute.

489
00:37:46,002 --> 00:37:48,788
- Thanks, August.
I really do need to get going.

490
00:37:48,918 --> 00:37:50,964
- Thanks for coming by.
- Not a problem.

491
00:37:55,577 --> 00:37:58,450
- You okay?
- Yeah, I'm good.

492
00:37:59,233 --> 00:38:01,061
Dean Calvet. Got these photos

493
00:38:01,191 --> 00:38:03,063
of him with Adriana Cassel
last night.

494
00:38:03,193 --> 00:38:05,283
I need you to help me figure out
how they know each other.

495
00:38:06,240 --> 00:38:08,634
- Okay. I'll do some digging.

496
00:39:10,304 --> 00:39:11,218
Ah!

497
00:39:26,973 --> 00:39:29,236
- Okay, you ready?
Come on, let's go! Jab!

498
00:39:30,237 --> 00:39:32,979
Double jab! Good, okay.

499
00:39:33,109 --> 00:39:35,808
Ready? Let's go, fast!
Right hand

500
00:39:35,938 --> 00:39:37,505
Duck! Here we go again!

501
00:39:43,859 --> 00:39:44,904
Ah!

502
00:39:46,384 --> 00:39:49,256
- I'm so sorry!
- What's wrong with you?!

503
00:39:49,387 --> 00:39:51,171
- I was distracted, I'm sorry.
Are you okay?

504
00:39:51,301 --> 00:39:53,303
- Yeah, it's okay.

505
00:39:53,434 --> 00:39:55,958
Alright, everyone,
let's switch partners.

506
00:39:56,089 --> 00:39:57,264
Come on, let's go!

507
00:40:10,408 --> 00:40:11,757
Charles?

508
00:40:11,887 --> 00:40:13,280
Charles!

509
00:40:19,286 --> 00:40:20,548
- Luce! Hey.

510
00:40:21,375 --> 00:40:23,377
What are you doing here?

511
00:40:23,508 --> 00:40:25,597
- I just finished boxing.

512
00:40:25,727 --> 00:40:27,642
Why are you
on this side of town?

513
00:40:27,773 --> 00:40:29,775
- Oh, I'm just meeting
a potential client.

514
00:40:31,080 --> 00:40:32,734
- Here?
- Yeah. He insisted.

515
00:40:32,865 --> 00:40:34,867
He owns a couple
of these places.

516
00:40:34,997 --> 00:40:38,392
- Ah, an underground gambling
ring leader.

517
00:40:38,523 --> 00:40:40,176
Say no more.
- Yeah.

518
00:40:40,307 --> 00:40:42,135
That's why they pay me
the big bucks.

519
00:40:43,702 --> 00:40:45,181
- Well, I won't keep you.
- Nice seeing you.

520
00:40:45,312 --> 00:40:46,444
Hey, Luce?

521
00:40:49,011 --> 00:40:52,101
Would you just mind not telling
Cami about this?

522
00:40:52,885 --> 00:40:54,452
You know how she worries.

523
00:40:56,584 --> 00:40:59,805
- Sure. Okay.
- Great.

524
00:42:20,276 --> 00:42:21,539
- Hey!

525
00:42:31,636 --> 00:42:35,161
- I just don't think
this is something John Cutler
would be capable of.

526
00:42:35,291 --> 00:42:37,903
- Yeah, me neither,
just doesn't fit the profile.

527
00:42:39,382 --> 00:42:43,561
- Well, then, it leaves us
with Dimitri Alexander.

528
00:42:45,606 --> 00:42:46,781
What's his story?

529
00:42:46,912 --> 00:42:49,567
- Last I checked,
Dimitri was in jail.

530
00:42:49,697 --> 00:42:50,959
- Okay. What happened?

531
00:42:51,438 --> 00:42:53,048
- I put him there.

532
00:42:53,179 --> 00:42:55,529
This was years ago when
I was doing surveillance

533
00:42:55,660 --> 00:42:57,183
for the police department.

534
00:42:57,313 --> 00:42:58,967
They had me tailing him
for weeks to gather evidence

535
00:42:59,098 --> 00:43:00,926
against him
in a drug-related incident.

536
00:43:01,056 --> 00:43:03,102
Turns out he wasn't just
into drugs.

537
00:43:04,146 --> 00:43:05,495
He had a thing
for beating his wife.

538
00:43:07,019 --> 00:43:10,109
I testified against him.
Put him away for a long time.

539
00:43:10,239 --> 00:43:12,285
Well, interesting.

540
00:43:13,416 --> 00:43:14,592
- What?

541
00:43:16,855 --> 00:43:18,944
- Well, it says here
Dimitri Alexander was let out
on parole last week.

542
00:43:19,945 --> 00:43:22,774
- Are you kidding me?
- No.

543
00:43:24,602 --> 00:43:26,299
Wait a minute, where you going?
- I'm going to El Caballito.

544
00:43:26,429 --> 00:43:27,953
That's the bar he used to run

545
00:43:28,083 --> 00:43:29,302
his business out of.
- Hold on.

546
00:43:29,432 --> 00:43:30,695
- I'm not leaving this
to the cops.

547
00:43:30,825 --> 00:43:32,174
They couldn't put him away
without me last time.

548
00:43:32,305 --> 00:43:33,567
I'm not trusting them
to do it now.

549
00:43:33,698 --> 00:43:35,308
- Okay, Lucy, sit down. Please.

550
00:43:40,835 --> 00:43:43,882
Listen, just leave this
to me, alright?

551
00:43:44,012 --> 00:43:46,798
Take the day. I will go
through the files,

552
00:43:46,928 --> 00:43:48,538
I'll come up
with some questions.

553
00:43:48,669 --> 00:43:50,845
It's not gonna get us anywhere
if you go over there

554
00:43:50,976 --> 00:43:52,717
and get hurt by a violent
wife-beater

555
00:43:52,847 --> 00:43:54,457
who has a personal vendetta
against you.

556
00:43:56,024 --> 00:43:56,938
- You're right.

557
00:43:58,766 --> 00:44:01,551
- Now, go home, take the day.
You've been through a lot.

558
00:44:01,682 --> 00:44:03,728
- I can't go home.

559
00:44:03,858 --> 00:44:06,382
I've got to get back
to the Cassel case.

560
00:44:06,513 --> 00:44:08,602
Adriana's supposed
to be going out of town
with her sister tonight

561
00:44:08,733 --> 00:44:10,125
and I still don't know
who that guy was

562
00:44:10,256 --> 00:44:11,561
she went out for dinner
with the other night.

563
00:44:11,692 --> 00:44:12,780
- Lucy, breathe.

564
00:44:13,955 --> 00:44:15,653
I'm sure Clive will
understand

565
00:44:15,783 --> 00:44:17,829
if you take one day
for yourself.

566
00:47:12,481 --> 00:47:13,613
- Who's there?

567
00:47:13,743 --> 00:47:14,962
- It's Clive.

568
00:47:22,535 --> 00:47:23,536
- Hi.

569
00:47:24,493 --> 00:47:25,886
What are you doing here?

570
00:47:26,669 --> 00:47:29,194
- I just needed to see you.

571
00:47:31,761 --> 00:47:33,024
You alright?

572
00:47:35,200 --> 00:47:36,375
Hey...

573
00:47:44,687 --> 00:47:46,820
- I don't know what to do.

574
00:47:46,951 --> 00:47:49,214
I don't even feel safe
in my own home anymore.

575
00:47:49,344 --> 00:47:51,042
- It's completely
understandable.

576
00:47:51,172 --> 00:47:53,261
Someone breaks into
your house

577
00:47:53,392 --> 00:47:55,089
and with this Dimitri guy
out there...

578
00:47:55,220 --> 00:47:57,048
- Yeah.

579
00:47:57,178 --> 00:47:58,701
And then,
there's the nightmares.

580
00:47:58,832 --> 00:48:01,139
I feel like I'm losing my mind.

581
00:48:01,269 --> 00:48:03,576
- You're not losing your mind,
Lucy.

582
00:48:03,706 --> 00:48:06,013
Hey. Look at me.

583
00:48:07,101 --> 00:48:08,842
You're being personally
targeted.

584
00:48:08,973 --> 00:48:11,889
This is stressful and scary

585
00:48:12,019 --> 00:48:14,195
and this guy is obviously
deranged.

586
00:48:14,326 --> 00:48:16,415
Something like this would be
enough to rattle anyone.

587
00:48:19,287 --> 00:48:20,898
- So what do I do?

588
00:48:23,248 --> 00:48:25,728
- You could get out of town
for a few days.

589
00:48:25,859 --> 00:48:29,254
At least until August gets some
information out of this guy.

590
00:48:30,081 --> 00:48:33,084
- So what, just... up and leave?

591
00:48:34,041 --> 00:48:36,696
What about your wife?
What about the case?

592
00:48:36,826 --> 00:48:39,177
- You know, Adriana is
out of town with her sister

593
00:48:39,307 --> 00:48:40,395
for the next few days.

594
00:48:40,830 --> 00:48:42,397
- Or so she says.

595
00:48:43,181 --> 00:48:45,183
This could be our smoking gun.

596
00:48:45,313 --> 00:48:47,402
Don't you want to know
where she's really going?

597
00:48:47,533 --> 00:48:50,753
- She's going to Vale to see
her sister and her nieces.

598
00:48:50,884 --> 00:48:53,669
She goes every year, she'll be
posting about it all weekend.

599
00:48:53,800 --> 00:48:55,106
- Yeah, but...

600
00:48:56,107 --> 00:48:58,936
- You can take a break from
the case, Lucy.

601
00:49:00,111 --> 00:49:01,460
Seriously.

602
00:49:05,290 --> 00:49:06,769
It can wait.

603
00:49:09,642 --> 00:49:12,471
- Well...
Where would we even go?

604
00:49:17,389 --> 00:49:18,477
- Trust me.

605
00:49:28,226 --> 00:49:30,489
- August, hi.

606
00:49:30,619 --> 00:49:33,144
- I'm just calling to let
you know that Dimitri no longer

607
00:49:33,274 --> 00:49:34,623
runs his business
out of El Caballito.

608
00:49:35,755 --> 00:49:38,149
- Damn.
- No, no, it's okay.

609
00:49:38,279 --> 00:49:41,021
I've managed to find
where his new front is.

610
00:49:41,152 --> 00:49:42,936
It's a nightclub called
The Blue Grotto.

611
00:49:43,067 --> 00:49:44,285
I'm gonna pay him a visit
later tonight.

612
00:49:44,416 --> 00:49:45,939
- Nice work.

613
00:49:46,070 --> 00:49:47,549
I should come with you.

614
00:49:47,680 --> 00:49:49,160
- No, no.
It's better if I go alone.

615
00:49:49,290 --> 00:49:50,900
He doesn't know who I am

616
00:49:51,031 --> 00:49:52,728
and he won't know I'm connected
to you in any way.

617
00:49:52,859 --> 00:49:56,428
- Right.
Okay, well, be careful.

618
00:49:56,558 --> 00:49:57,733
- Yeah. Of course.

619
00:49:57,864 --> 00:49:59,474
- I, uh... I should let you know

620
00:49:59,605 --> 00:50:01,302
I'm gonna be out of town
for the next few days.

621
00:50:01,433 --> 00:50:02,956
- Oh. That sounds great.

622
00:50:03,087 --> 00:50:04,740
That should be good for you.

623
00:50:04,871 --> 00:50:06,786
- Yeah. At least until you get
something out of Dimitri.

624
00:50:06,916 --> 00:50:09,528
- Yeah. Couldn't agree more.
Where you heading?

625
00:50:09,658 --> 00:50:12,270
- A cabin in Meadowbrooke.

626
00:50:12,400 --> 00:50:13,880
- Nice. You're renting?

627
00:50:14,011 --> 00:50:17,275
- No, it's... it's a friend's.

628
00:50:17,405 --> 00:50:19,059
- Nice friend.

629
00:50:20,452 --> 00:50:22,193
I've heard there's some pretty
fancy cottages out that way.

630
00:50:22,323 --> 00:50:24,543
- Yeah. For sure.

631
00:50:25,718 --> 00:50:27,372
- You okay?

632
00:50:27,894 --> 00:50:29,765
- All things considered?

633
00:50:29,896 --> 00:50:32,116
Yeah. I'm good.

634
00:50:32,246 --> 00:50:34,161
- Alright.
Enjoy the countryside. And...

635
00:50:34,292 --> 00:50:35,771
I'll give you a call after
I talk to Dimitri.

636
00:50:35,902 --> 00:50:37,860
- Sounds good.

637
00:50:37,991 --> 00:50:39,688
Everything okay?

638
00:50:39,819 --> 00:50:42,474
- Yeah. I don't know...

639
00:50:42,604 --> 00:50:44,215
I just feel like he knows
I'm hiding something.

640
00:50:44,345 --> 00:50:46,130
- Well, I wouldn't worry
about him.

641
00:50:46,260 --> 00:50:47,653
You're the boss.

642
00:50:47,783 --> 00:50:50,177
If he finds out, he'll just
have to deal with it.

643
00:51:08,978 --> 00:51:10,241
- This is amazing.

644
00:51:11,372 --> 00:51:12,765
- Thanks.

645
00:51:14,245 --> 00:51:16,247
It's been in my family
for generations.

646
00:51:17,987 --> 00:51:20,077
Oh, it's one of
my favorite places.

647
00:51:22,992 --> 00:51:25,169
- Thank you for
bringing me here.

648
00:51:55,590 --> 00:51:57,026
- Name?
- Hey. No.

649
00:51:57,157 --> 00:51:59,899
I'm not on your list.
I'm here to see Dimitri.

650
00:52:00,029 --> 00:52:02,206
- No one gets in
if they're not on the list.

651
00:52:02,336 --> 00:52:03,729
- I'm one of
his business partners.

652
00:52:03,859 --> 00:52:05,209
He's expecting me.

653
00:52:05,339 --> 00:52:06,688
- Yeah, well, Dimitri
is not here right now.

654
00:52:06,819 --> 00:52:09,169
- Oh yeah?

655
00:52:09,300 --> 00:52:12,129
Why don't you let me go inside
and have a look for myself?

656
00:52:12,259 --> 00:52:15,828
- Like I said, no one gets in if
they're not on the list.

657
00:52:17,308 --> 00:52:19,266
- Right.

658
00:52:27,840 --> 00:52:29,233
Dimitri.

659
00:52:29,363 --> 00:52:30,843
I need to talk to you.

660
00:52:33,062 --> 00:52:34,107
Damn!

661
00:53:10,274 --> 00:53:11,710
- Hmm.

662
00:53:47,224 --> 00:53:48,921
So, what do you think?

663
00:53:49,051 --> 00:53:51,184
Oh, I'm sorry.

664
00:53:51,315 --> 00:53:53,534
You're obviously
still a little on edge.

665
00:53:53,665 --> 00:53:56,885
Well, why don't I put
on a fire

666
00:53:57,016 --> 00:53:58,800
and you can pour us some wine?

667
00:53:58,931 --> 00:54:00,759
- That sounds great.
- Okay.

668
00:54:00,889 --> 00:54:02,239
I'm sorry.

669
00:54:16,905 --> 00:54:18,690
- What?

670
00:54:18,820 --> 00:54:20,692
I'm just looking at you.

671
00:54:24,565 --> 00:54:27,786
Oh, my God. That smile
is gonna be the death of me.

672
00:54:33,182 --> 00:54:34,793
- What is it about you?

673
00:54:36,577 --> 00:54:37,404
- What do you mean?

674
00:54:40,538 --> 00:54:42,757
- I never let my guard down.

675
00:54:45,369 --> 00:54:46,805
But around you...

676
00:54:49,068 --> 00:54:50,983
I know I just met you.

677
00:54:54,334 --> 00:54:56,293
I don't know,
it just feels like...

678
00:54:58,991 --> 00:55:00,775
- Like an instinct?

679
00:55:02,821 --> 00:55:04,779
- Yeah.

680
00:55:52,392 --> 00:55:53,654
- Come on, Dimitri.

681
00:55:53,785 --> 00:55:55,700
I know you're down there.

682
00:56:01,096 --> 00:56:02,881
- What do you want, man?

683
00:56:04,230 --> 00:56:05,623
- I just wanna talk to you.

684
00:56:05,753 --> 00:56:07,364
- What do you wanna know?

685
00:56:09,583 --> 00:56:11,368
- Where were you the night
of April 27th?

686
00:56:17,025 --> 00:56:18,462
Let me phrase it another way.

687
00:56:18,592 --> 00:56:20,333
Did you break into
Lucy Thompson's house?

688
00:56:20,464 --> 00:56:21,726
- Yeah.

689
00:56:21,856 --> 00:56:23,249
- Why?

690
00:56:24,206 --> 00:56:25,773
- I was paid by some guy
to mess with her.

691
00:56:25,904 --> 00:56:28,646
That bitch ruined my life,
seemed like a win-win.

692
00:56:28,776 --> 00:56:31,213
- Someone paid you to break
into her house?

693
00:56:31,344 --> 00:56:35,827
- Yeah, some guy named Clive,
gave me 10 grand,

694
00:56:35,957 --> 00:56:38,003
said it was time for the hunter
to become the hunted

695
00:56:38,133 --> 00:56:40,571
or some crap like that.
- Clive...

696
00:56:47,142 --> 00:56:48,709
- Hey!

697
00:56:48,840 --> 00:56:50,102
Who are you?

698
00:56:51,190 --> 00:56:52,757
Who the hell are you?

699
00:56:57,196 --> 00:56:58,850
- Lucy, pick up the phone.

700
00:56:58,980 --> 00:57:00,591
- Hi, you've reached
Lucy Thompson...

701
00:57:00,721 --> 00:57:02,375
- Lucy, pick up the phone!

702
00:57:02,506 --> 00:57:04,246
- Please leave a detailed
message and I'll get back...

703
00:57:31,665 --> 00:57:32,927
- Meadowbrooke?

704
00:57:42,589 --> 00:57:44,461
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

705
00:57:51,119 --> 00:57:52,991
- How are you feeling?

706
00:57:54,079 --> 00:57:55,602
- I'm feeling a lot better.

707
00:57:56,777 --> 00:57:58,475
- This place has that effect.

708
00:57:59,650 --> 00:58:01,608
- I think you have that effect.

709
00:58:01,739 --> 00:58:03,828
Do I?

710
00:58:12,837 --> 00:58:14,142
Coffee?

711
00:58:14,926 --> 00:58:16,841
Thanks.

712
00:58:17,929 --> 00:58:19,017
- I'll be right back.

713
00:58:44,912 --> 00:58:45,870
- Come on.

714
00:58:47,001 --> 00:58:48,437
- There you are.
- Hey.

715
00:58:48,568 --> 00:58:50,222
Ooh.

716
00:58:50,352 --> 00:58:52,529
Didn't mean to sneak up on you.
Everything okay down here?

717
00:58:52,659 --> 00:58:54,356
- No! August left me a voicemail

718
00:58:54,487 --> 00:58:56,271
and I can't check it
because I have no signal.

719
00:58:56,402 --> 00:58:58,491
- Yeah, the reception here
is pretty awful.

720
00:58:58,622 --> 00:59:00,014
- I don't know what to do.

721
00:59:00,145 --> 00:59:02,626
This could be important.
It could be about Dimitri.

722
00:59:03,714 --> 00:59:06,020
I shouldn't have come here.
- Oh, hey, hey.

723
00:59:06,151 --> 00:59:07,892
It's a good thing you came.

724
00:59:08,022 --> 00:59:09,937
You needed this. Remember?

725
00:59:10,068 --> 00:59:11,722
- I need to get back
to the city.

726
00:59:14,072 --> 00:59:16,378
- I know where we can get
a signal. Come on.

727
00:59:19,599 --> 00:59:21,035
Try now.

728
00:59:23,560 --> 00:59:24,865
- Two bars.

729
00:59:25,692 --> 00:59:27,259
That should do it.

730
00:59:29,566 --> 00:59:31,132
You don't have to wait for me
if you don't want to.

731
00:59:31,263 --> 00:59:32,264
- No, I'll wait.

732
00:59:32,394 --> 00:59:33,918
I want to know what he said.

733
00:59:51,849 --> 00:59:53,111
What did he say?

734
00:59:55,287 --> 00:59:57,594
Lucy, hey! Hey!

735
00:59:59,073 --> 01:00:01,728
Lucy, what did he say? Lucy!

736
01:00:01,859 --> 01:00:03,600
Just talk to me!
- It was you!

737
01:00:03,730 --> 01:00:06,646
You paid Dimitri.
I can't believe I trusted you.

738
01:00:06,777 --> 01:00:09,170
- I've never even met Dimitri.
Lucy, stop! I love you.

739
01:00:18,136 --> 01:00:19,572
- Oh, my God.

740
01:00:19,703 --> 01:00:21,618
No!

741
01:00:24,533 --> 01:00:25,839
Oh, my God!

742
01:00:28,625 --> 01:00:29,800
- Lucy!

743
01:00:30,757 --> 01:00:32,977
What did you do?

744
01:00:39,984 --> 01:00:41,333
Come on.

745
01:00:57,131 --> 01:00:58,350
- Thanks.

746
01:01:03,355 --> 01:01:04,922
- What's going on?

747
01:01:05,052 --> 01:01:06,793
- Self-defense.
They're not gonna hold me.

748
01:01:06,924 --> 01:01:09,013
- Great, then come on.
Let's get out of here.

749
01:01:15,672 --> 01:01:18,196
So... you were sleeping
with the client.

750
01:01:20,589 --> 01:01:22,853
I'm sorry. I'm just trying
to make sense of all this.

751
01:01:22,983 --> 01:01:25,029
- It was stupid, I know.

752
01:01:26,813 --> 01:01:28,380
I can't talk about it
right now.

753
01:01:28,510 --> 01:01:30,034
- Okay.

754
01:01:32,601 --> 01:01:35,866
- Thank you... for warning me.

755
01:01:37,694 --> 01:01:40,000
Who knows what would have
happened if I'd stayed there
with him.

756
01:01:41,045 --> 01:01:42,350
- Hey.

757
01:01:42,960 --> 01:01:44,701
We're in this together.

758
01:02:19,605 --> 01:02:22,303
- Lucy, where the hell were you?

759
01:02:22,434 --> 01:02:24,044
I tried calling.

760
01:02:24,175 --> 01:02:25,872
- Thank you for being there.

761
01:02:26,003 --> 01:02:28,266
- Of course. Get some rest.

762
01:02:29,702 --> 01:02:32,618
- Uh, August,
this is my best friend Cami.

763
01:02:33,184 --> 01:02:34,838
- It's nice to finally meet you!

764
01:02:34,968 --> 01:02:36,491
- Pleasure to meet you.

765
01:02:36,622 --> 01:02:38,450
I should go.

766
01:02:38,580 --> 01:02:40,191
Call me if you need anything.

767
01:02:40,321 --> 01:02:41,627
- I will.

768
01:02:44,151 --> 01:02:46,110
- What's going on?

769
01:02:47,894 --> 01:02:50,114
- Clive's dead.

770
01:02:50,244 --> 01:02:52,029
- What?!

771
01:02:52,159 --> 01:02:53,682
- It was an accident.

772
01:02:53,813 --> 01:02:55,380
I was defending myself.

773
01:02:55,510 --> 01:02:57,425
He wasn't who I thought
he was at all.

774
01:02:58,339 --> 01:03:00,211
I was at his cabin.

775
01:03:00,341 --> 01:03:02,604
He was the one behind
the break-in.

776
01:03:03,780 --> 01:03:05,564
He was after me the whole time.

777
01:03:05,694 --> 01:03:07,218
- Oh, honey.

778
01:03:07,348 --> 01:03:08,654
Let's get you inside.

779
01:03:09,350 --> 01:03:10,787
Come on.

780
01:03:15,879 --> 01:03:17,663
So, what happens next?

781
01:03:20,100 --> 01:03:21,319
- I don't know.

782
01:03:24,539 --> 01:03:26,280
But right now, we drink.

783
01:03:56,180 --> 01:03:57,355
Hey.

784
01:03:58,617 --> 01:04:00,314
What's going on? You okay?

785
01:04:01,663 --> 01:04:03,840
- I'm fine.

786
01:04:03,970 --> 01:04:06,059
I'm sorry. You don't need
to hear this right now.

787
01:04:06,190 --> 01:04:08,235
- Cami, something
is clearly bothering you.

788
01:04:08,366 --> 01:04:10,063
Talk to me.

789
01:04:10,194 --> 01:04:12,239
- You've just been
through so much.

790
01:04:12,370 --> 01:04:15,721
Now is not the time.
- I'm here for you, always.

791
01:04:16,591 --> 01:04:17,592
What's going on?

792
01:04:17,723 --> 01:04:19,377
- It's Charles.

793
01:04:20,465 --> 01:04:21,988
- What about him?

794
01:04:23,511 --> 01:04:25,165
- I just...

795
01:04:29,343 --> 01:04:31,041
I think I might need
to hire you.

796
01:04:33,521 --> 01:04:36,394
- You think Charles
is cheating?

797
01:04:36,524 --> 01:04:38,744
Where is this coming from?

798
01:04:38,875 --> 01:04:41,660
- He's been acting differently.

799
01:04:41,790 --> 01:04:44,837
Going out to see clients, coming
home at five in the morning.

800
01:04:44,968 --> 01:04:47,187
I never know where he is.

801
01:04:47,318 --> 01:04:50,060
- His job has always been
demanding, though, right?

802
01:04:51,322 --> 01:04:52,758
- Not like this.

803
01:04:54,412 --> 01:04:57,763
These past few weeks,
he's been totally withdrawn.

804
01:04:59,808 --> 01:05:03,856
He can't even look at me,
let alone touch me.

805
01:05:03,987 --> 01:05:06,380
The other day, he came home
blackout drunk

806
01:05:06,511 --> 01:05:08,687
with a busted lip.

807
01:05:08,817 --> 01:05:11,255
I think he might be
gambling now. I just...

808
01:05:11,995 --> 01:05:14,432
I don't know what to believe.

809
01:05:16,260 --> 01:05:18,566
- When was that?

810
01:05:18,697 --> 01:05:20,917
- Thursday, I think. Why?

811
01:05:23,745 --> 01:05:25,878
- Okay, I'm gonna
tell you something

812
01:05:26,009 --> 01:05:28,185
and I need you to understand

813
01:05:28,315 --> 01:05:30,796
that it did not seem
like a big deal at the time.

814
01:05:33,930 --> 01:05:35,192
- What do you...

815
01:05:35,322 --> 01:05:37,934
What do you mean?
What are you saying?

816
01:05:38,064 --> 01:05:41,546
- I saw Charles in the Slaphouse
District on Thursday.

817
01:05:41,676 --> 01:05:43,635
- You what?

818
01:05:43,765 --> 01:05:46,290
- He said he was meeting
a client.

819
01:05:46,420 --> 01:05:48,814
He asked me not to say
anything.

820
01:05:48,945 --> 01:05:51,686
- So you listened to Charles
over telling your best friend?

821
01:05:51,817 --> 01:05:53,862
- He said he didn't want you
to worry.

822
01:05:53,993 --> 01:05:55,473
I had no idea.

823
01:05:55,603 --> 01:05:57,736
- Lucy, this is huge!

824
01:05:57,866 --> 01:05:59,825
How could you not have
said anything?

825
01:05:59,956 --> 01:06:01,566
- I didn't think there was
anything to say.

826
01:06:01,696 --> 01:06:05,004
Obviously, I was wrong.

827
01:06:05,135 --> 01:06:08,877
This might explain his behavior
for the last few weeks.

828
01:06:09,008 --> 01:06:11,097
Cami, I'm sorry.

829
01:06:11,228 --> 01:06:12,969
- I have to go.

830
01:06:14,187 --> 01:06:16,973
- Hey. Let's figure this out
together.

831
01:06:18,496 --> 01:06:21,325
- Honestly, Lucy,
I think you've done enough.

832
01:07:07,284 --> 01:07:09,112
Lucy, talk to me!
- It was you!

833
01:07:09,242 --> 01:07:11,897
You paid Dimitri.
I can't believe I trusted you.

834
01:07:12,028 --> 01:07:13,681
- I've never even met Dimitri.
Lucy, stop! I love you.

835
01:07:17,033 --> 01:07:18,947
- No!

836
01:07:36,139 --> 01:07:39,011
- Lucy... I wasn't
expecting you today.

837
01:07:39,881 --> 01:07:42,058
- I need to figure out
what the hell is going on.

838
01:07:45,583 --> 01:07:48,281
- Okay, he hires you
to follow his wife,

839
01:07:48,412 --> 01:07:50,066
so he has tabs on you
at all times,

840
01:07:50,196 --> 01:07:52,633
then, he seduces you,

841
01:07:52,764 --> 01:07:55,375
then hires Dimitri
to terrorize you.

842
01:07:55,506 --> 01:07:58,335
- Yeah. I've been going over it
again and again.

843
01:07:58,465 --> 01:08:00,772
And I just keep asking myself
"why".

844
01:08:03,775 --> 01:08:07,213
- I think it all goes back
to this sick obsession.

845
01:08:07,344 --> 01:08:09,607
It's clear that he had
this fixation with you.

846
01:08:11,043 --> 01:08:12,653
- Yeah. But he had me.

847
01:08:12,784 --> 01:08:14,786
- Yeah. Not until
after the break-in.

848
01:08:16,569 --> 01:08:19,486
- He kept insisting that he'd
never seen Dimitri in his life.

849
01:08:19,617 --> 01:08:22,576
- Hey, it's perfectly normal
to second-guess yourself

850
01:08:22,707 --> 01:08:24,709
after such a traumatic event.

851
01:08:24,839 --> 01:08:27,014
But, Lucy, you did what
you had to do.

852
01:08:27,146 --> 01:08:29,104
Who knows what he might have
done to you?

853
01:08:31,019 --> 01:08:33,065
I don't know.

854
01:08:33,805 --> 01:08:35,719
The more I replay it in my mind,

855
01:08:35,850 --> 01:08:39,550
the more I think he just
was genuinely confused.

856
01:08:39,680 --> 01:08:42,857
Like, he had no idea about
the break-in or any of it.

857
01:08:42,987 --> 01:08:44,555
- Yeah, well, the only way
to prove that

858
01:08:44,684 --> 01:08:46,469
would be to ask Dimitri.

859
01:08:50,517 --> 01:08:53,607
- August, there's a lot
that's not adding up.

860
01:08:53,737 --> 01:08:56,131
Dimitri is the only one that
can answer these questions.

861
01:08:56,262 --> 01:08:58,568
- Okay, you're the boss.

862
01:08:58,699 --> 01:09:00,136
I'm going with you.

863
01:09:01,180 --> 01:09:03,226
- Good.

864
01:09:37,346 --> 01:09:38,565
- Nice place.

865
01:09:38,696 --> 01:09:40,306
- Yeah, you should've been here
last week.

866
01:09:41,438 --> 01:09:42,874
- What are you looking at?

867
01:09:44,528 --> 01:09:45,877
- Nothing.

868
01:09:48,619 --> 01:09:50,273
Huh, great.

869
01:09:50,403 --> 01:09:51,883
- You know him?

870
01:09:52,013 --> 01:09:53,841
- Yeah. Let's just say that.

871
01:09:53,971 --> 01:09:55,843
- Well, look who it is.

872
01:09:55,974 --> 01:09:58,368
- Yeah, good to see you.

873
01:10:12,817 --> 01:10:15,080
- I should have known
you two were working together.

874
01:10:16,647 --> 01:10:19,084
- Hi, Dimitri.
- What do you want?

875
01:10:19,215 --> 01:10:22,000
- I need to tell me who hired
you to break into my house.

876
01:10:22,130 --> 01:10:23,654
- I already told this guy.

877
01:10:23,784 --> 01:10:25,090
His name was Clive.

878
01:10:28,353 --> 01:10:29,921
- You mean this guy, Clive?

879
01:10:35,535 --> 01:10:37,885
- What do I get
for ID'ing this person?

880
01:10:38,016 --> 01:10:38,930
Why should I help you?

881
01:10:41,148 --> 01:10:44,544
- If you don't cooperate,
I press charges

882
01:10:44,675 --> 01:10:47,939
and you get sent away again,
for a very long time.

883
01:10:54,162 --> 01:10:56,469
- I've never seen this guy
in my life.

884
01:11:00,691 --> 01:11:02,736
- You're sure?
- Positive.

885
01:11:02,867 --> 01:11:07,611
The Clive I met was shorter...
Trying to grow a moustache.

886
01:11:10,962 --> 01:11:12,616
Leave me alone.

887
01:11:26,064 --> 01:11:28,022
- It doesn't make any sense.

888
01:11:28,632 --> 01:11:32,112
- It's... It's just not
adding up.

889
01:11:34,333 --> 01:11:36,422
Hang on a sec.

890
01:11:59,706 --> 01:12:02,709
- Lucy! You okay?

891
01:12:02,840 --> 01:12:05,495
I'll be right out.

892
01:12:19,422 --> 01:12:21,206
What have you done?

893
01:12:24,252 --> 01:12:25,818
I killed him.

894
01:12:26,907 --> 01:12:29,040
I killed the wrong guy.

895
01:12:29,170 --> 01:12:30,911
- You thought you were
in danger.

896
01:12:31,041 --> 01:12:33,261
Anyone else would have done
the same thing.

897
01:12:33,392 --> 01:12:35,655
- He was in love with me

898
01:12:35,786 --> 01:12:37,353
and I killed him.

899
01:12:39,224 --> 01:12:41,879
How could I have gotten
everything so wrong?

900
01:12:46,273 --> 01:12:47,710
- Wait a minute.

901
01:12:48,799 --> 01:12:50,670
Maybe you were supposed to.

902
01:12:52,933 --> 01:12:54,370
Hear me out.

903
01:12:55,719 --> 01:12:57,590
Whoever got Dimitri
to break into your house

904
01:12:57,721 --> 01:12:59,679
knew you were going
to find out it was Clive,

905
01:13:00,463 --> 01:13:03,030
and then that you would
confront him.

906
01:13:05,903 --> 01:13:07,557
- You think Adriana
would have wanted him dead?

907
01:13:07,687 --> 01:13:10,168
- He was a very wealthy man.

908
01:13:10,298 --> 01:13:13,432
People do bad things for money.
Really bad things.

909
01:13:13,563 --> 01:13:15,565
- Got any pings on that guy
she went out for dinner with

910
01:13:15,695 --> 01:13:17,567
the other night?
- None.

911
01:13:19,568 --> 01:13:22,267
- What was the description of
that guy Dimitri actually met?

912
01:13:22,398 --> 01:13:24,008
Can you see if there's
anything there?

913
01:13:24,138 --> 01:13:26,271
- Alright. Will do.
- I'm gonna go to The Regent.

914
01:13:26,402 --> 01:13:28,795
That's where he was staying.
See if I can get any info there.

915
01:13:28,925 --> 01:13:31,362
- Okay and I'll go to Adriana's,
see if I find anything.

916
01:13:31,494 --> 01:13:33,583
- Be careful.
- Yeah, you too.

917
01:14:31,641 --> 01:14:32,468
- Lucy?

918
01:14:34,644 --> 01:14:35,645
Lucy!

919
01:16:12,306 --> 01:16:13,699
- Lucy saw you with him.

920
01:16:15,745 --> 01:16:17,224
We'll deal with her later.

921
01:16:17,355 --> 01:16:19,139
Did you get the passports?

922
01:16:19,270 --> 01:16:22,490
- You are now...

923
01:16:22,621 --> 01:16:25,318
Vanessa Armando.

924
01:16:27,407 --> 01:16:29,106
- Do you think
I can pull it off?

925
01:16:36,156 --> 01:16:39,682
- Did you...
drain all of his accounts?

926
01:16:39,812 --> 01:16:42,467
- Now that Clive is dead,
it all belongs to us.

927
01:16:52,999 --> 01:16:55,306
- Did you use the routing number
that Dean set up?

928
01:16:57,308 --> 01:16:58,831
- Right... the routing number.

929
01:16:59,876 --> 01:17:03,575
- Adriana, that
one's untraceable, right?

930
01:17:03,706 --> 01:17:06,577
We cannot leave until
the funds are in that account.

931
01:17:06,709 --> 01:17:09,233
- I'm sorry! I put the funds
in my account.

932
01:17:09,362 --> 01:17:11,278
I didn't think it would matter.
- Well, it does!

933
01:17:14,804 --> 01:17:16,893
You want people
to be able to find us?

934
01:17:17,023 --> 01:17:18,503
What's your password?

935
01:17:18,634 --> 01:17:19,809
- I think someone's out there.

936
01:17:22,768 --> 01:17:24,987
- Adriana, your password.

937
01:17:29,209 --> 01:17:30,689
Want some more wine?

938
01:17:30,820 --> 01:17:31,995
- Of course.

939
01:18:00,937 --> 01:18:01,981
- To us.

940
01:18:02,112 --> 01:18:04,680
To us.

941
01:18:09,554 --> 01:18:12,383
I love you so much.

942
01:18:12,513 --> 01:18:16,648
I cannot wait to start this next
chapter of our lives.

943
01:18:16,779 --> 01:18:18,389
Together.

944
01:18:34,579 --> 01:18:38,322
Finally free,
without Cami or Clive.

945
01:18:38,975 --> 01:18:41,717
Just you and me, together.

946
01:18:44,763 --> 01:18:47,070
- Yeah, I don't think
that's gonna happen.

947
01:18:50,202 --> 01:18:51,901
- What?

948
01:18:59,865 --> 01:19:01,606
- He's changed
all his passwords.

949
01:19:50,394 --> 01:19:53,136
- After everything I've been
through to get here.

950
01:19:54,964 --> 01:19:58,358
The strings I pulled!
Clive is dead!

951
01:19:58,489 --> 01:20:01,666
- Don't lie to yourself.
You wanted him gone.

952
01:20:02,972 --> 01:20:04,712
If he would've found out
about us,

953
01:20:04,843 --> 01:20:06,496
he would have left you
with nothing.

954
01:20:07,193 --> 01:20:08,673
- The money.

955
01:20:13,068 --> 01:20:14,200
- What are you doing?

956
01:20:14,331 --> 01:20:16,202
- I'm stopping
the funds transfer.

957
01:20:16,333 --> 01:20:18,204
- Hey. I can't let you do that.

958
01:20:18,335 --> 01:20:20,337
- This isn't your money,
Charles.

959
01:20:30,651 --> 01:20:32,305
What did you do?

960
01:20:35,264 --> 01:20:36,788
But I love you.

961
01:21:04,772 --> 01:21:06,731
Oh no. No, no, no.

962
01:21:29,232 --> 01:21:31,669
- Hi, you've reached
Lucy Thompson of
Thompson Investigations.

963
01:21:31,799 --> 01:21:33,714
Please leave a detailed
message and I'll get back
to you shortly.

964
01:21:33,844 --> 01:21:35,847
It's me!

965
01:21:35,978 --> 01:21:37,849
I'm sorry I overreacted
the other day.

966
01:21:37,980 --> 01:21:40,243
I should not have blamed you for
what Charles has done.

967
01:21:42,853 --> 01:21:45,161
It turns out he was hiding a lot
more from me than I thought.

968
01:21:45,291 --> 01:21:46,902
I'm kicking him out!

969
01:21:48,338 --> 01:21:50,906
I love you. Call me back.

970
01:22:25,244 --> 01:22:28,594
Lucy. Hey!

971
01:22:36,342 --> 01:22:37,952
Lucy!

972
01:22:53,228 --> 01:22:54,447
Lucy!

973
01:22:59,017 --> 01:23:00,452
Damn it!

974
01:23:01,977 --> 01:23:04,153
- August! It was Charles
and Adriana.

975
01:23:04,282 --> 01:23:05,981
I think he killed her.
Call me when you get this.

976
01:23:08,548 --> 01:23:09,680
Cami!

977
01:23:09,809 --> 01:23:11,943
- I'm here.

978
01:23:12,074 --> 01:23:14,598
- Okay. Hey... Hey, listen.

979
01:23:14,728 --> 01:23:16,382
I just watched Charles
kill Adriana.

980
01:23:16,513 --> 01:23:18,471
- What are you talking about?
- He wants to kill me now.

981
01:23:18,602 --> 01:23:20,559
Let's go.
- Lucy!

982
01:23:20,691 --> 01:23:22,127
Cami.
- Get out!

983
01:23:22,258 --> 01:23:23,650
- What?! No...
- Get out!

984
01:23:23,781 --> 01:23:25,217
- Cami, no, I can explain.

985
01:23:25,348 --> 01:23:26,610
Don't listen to Lucy,
she's crazy.

986
01:23:26,740 --> 01:23:28,394
- I know you're cheating
on me, Charles.

987
01:23:28,525 --> 01:23:30,353
And the gambling?
I know we're broke!

988
01:23:30,483 --> 01:23:32,442
You are the reason
Clive is dead!

989
01:23:32,572 --> 01:23:34,183
- No. Lucy is trying
to tear us apart.

990
01:23:34,313 --> 01:23:36,750
She's always been jealous
of what we have!

991
01:23:36,880 --> 01:23:39,144
- You're a murderer and
I need you to get

992
01:23:39,275 --> 01:23:41,190
the hell out of my house
and out of my life.

993
01:23:41,320 --> 01:23:43,627
Get out!
- This is all your fault!

994
01:23:43,757 --> 01:23:45,281
- No, Charles.
This is your fault!

995
01:23:45,411 --> 01:23:47,282
You're going to prison!

996
01:23:47,413 --> 01:23:49,589
- Don't listen to her.
Just don't listen to her, okay?

997
01:23:49,719 --> 01:23:52,157
I came back.
Look at this life we have, huh?

998
01:23:52,288 --> 01:23:54,594
I did this to protect that.
I did it all for you.

999
01:23:54,725 --> 01:23:56,509
- You're insane.

1000
01:23:56,639 --> 01:23:58,555
- You don't understand,

1001
01:23:59,556 --> 01:24:01,253
Cami, look.

1002
01:24:01,384 --> 01:24:05,779
Look, just forget everything.
Alright? Yeah?

1003
01:24:05,910 --> 01:24:07,651
I solved our money problems.

1004
01:24:07,781 --> 01:24:09,740
Okay? We can be happy together.
I love you.

1005
01:24:09,870 --> 01:24:12,743
- Okay, Charles... It's over.

1006
01:24:19,967 --> 01:24:21,230
- Charles, wait!

1007
01:24:22,231 --> 01:24:23,449
Stop!

1008
01:24:23,580 --> 01:24:24,885
911, what is
your emergency?

1009
01:24:25,016 --> 01:24:26,452
- Listen to me, listen to me.

1010
01:24:26,583 --> 01:24:28,672
You came back.
That's all that matters.

1011
01:24:28,802 --> 01:24:31,327
Hey, hey! You did
what you had to do for us.

1012
01:24:31,457 --> 01:24:34,330
Look at me.
I see that now. Okay?

1013
01:24:34,460 --> 01:24:36,375
Alright, baby?

1014
01:24:36,984 --> 01:24:38,464
For better for worse, right?

1015
01:24:38,594 --> 01:24:40,423
Yeah.

1016
01:24:49,519 --> 01:24:50,955
Lucy! Lucy!

1017
01:24:53,784 --> 01:24:55,786
Ah!

1018
01:24:57,831 --> 01:24:58,963
- You're okay.

1019
01:25:00,486 --> 01:25:01,966
Hey, it's okay.

1020
01:25:28,471 --> 01:25:30,516
- This guy was fast.
I was out of breath.

1021
01:25:32,083 --> 01:25:34,085
- I've got news!
They love it.

1022
01:25:34,216 --> 01:25:36,043
- Uh... Who loves what?

1023
01:25:36,174 --> 01:25:38,002
- The publisher?
- They literally want to buy

1024
01:25:38,133 --> 01:25:40,657
the rights to your story after
reading the first twenty pages.

1025
01:25:40,787 --> 01:25:42,267
Lucy, this book is going
to be huge.

1026
01:25:42,398 --> 01:25:45,183
- Seriously?
- Yeah. Our story is incredible.

1027
01:25:45,314 --> 01:25:46,880
People are going
to want to hear it.

1028
01:25:47,011 --> 01:25:48,186
- This is so exciting.

1029
01:25:48,317 --> 01:25:49,927
- How is the rest
of the book coming?

1030
01:25:50,057 --> 01:25:51,885
- It's going really well.

1031
01:25:52,016 --> 01:25:53,931
It's been cathartic putting it
all down on paper.

1032
01:25:54,061 --> 01:25:56,151
So, wait, what happens now?

1033
01:25:56,281 --> 01:25:58,544
- Well, the publishers are going
to send over a contract

1034
01:25:58,675 --> 01:26:00,938
and all you have to do is sign!

1035
01:26:01,068 --> 01:26:03,245
You are going to love
the deal I got you.

1036
01:26:03,375 --> 01:26:05,160
- I don't doubt that.
You're a shark.

1037
01:26:05,290 --> 01:26:06,900
I am, aren't I?

1038
01:26:07,031 --> 01:26:08,250
- So I'll see you
for dinner tonight?

1039
01:26:08,380 --> 01:26:09,555
- You know it.
Are you coming, August?

1040
01:26:09,686 --> 01:26:10,991
- Of course. I'll be there.

1041
01:26:11,121 --> 01:26:12,514
- Amazing. Love you.

1042
01:26:13,168 --> 01:26:14,691
- Love you.

1043
01:26:14,821 --> 01:26:17,650
- Wow.
Lucy, congratulations!

1044
01:26:17,781 --> 01:26:19,130
- Yeah, she thinks we've
really got something here.

1045
01:26:19,261 --> 01:26:22,481
- Yeah, so do I. And I, for one,
can't wait to read it.

1046
01:26:22,612 --> 01:26:24,701
- I have a feeling we're about
to get very busy.

1047
01:26:24,831 --> 01:26:26,746
- Yeah. I think so!

1048
01:26:26,877 --> 01:26:28,094
- Ready to dive in, partner?

1049
01:26:28,226 --> 01:26:30,097
- I will do you proud,
Lucy Thompson.

1050
01:26:30,228 --> 01:26:31,708
- I know you will.
Now, go back to work.
