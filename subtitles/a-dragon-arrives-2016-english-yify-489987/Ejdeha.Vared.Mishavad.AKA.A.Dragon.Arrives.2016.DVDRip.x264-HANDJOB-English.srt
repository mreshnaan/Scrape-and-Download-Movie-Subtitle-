1
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:12,590
Should I start?

2
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:19,632
How long have we been here?

3
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:21,559
I've been here since last night.

4
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:27,911
I'd have shaved in the morning.

5
00:00:29,720 --> 00:00:31,154
So five or six days at least.

6
00:00:31,360 --> 00:00:32,760
Maybe even a week.

7
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:37,397
I've been here for a week?

8
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:39,194
Tell me the story.

9
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:44,073
Jahangiri, I'm talking to you.

10
00:00:44,560 --> 00:00:46,870
I've been unconscious for a week?

11
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:49,552
What did you drug us with?

12
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:52,314
Start at the beginning.

13
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:54,079
I'll tell you the rest,

14
00:00:54,280 --> 00:00:56,272
from the moment you passed out.

15
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:03,272
You know the beginning.

16
00:01:04,840 --> 00:01:05,876
It started with you.

17
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:08,394
I know the whole story.

18
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:10,751
But it has to be recorded.

19
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:16,199
On Sunday morning,

20
00:01:18,440 --> 00:01:20,955
January 23, 1965,

21
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:24,550
Major...

22
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:33,755
Saeed Jahangiri ordered me to come here

23
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:36,393
to the island of Qeshm.

24
00:01:41,960 --> 00:01:44,350
- Are we still on Qeshm?
- Yes.

25
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:55,199
An exiled prisoner had hanged himself.

26
00:01:58,280 --> 00:01:59,509
Mustafa Samei.

27
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:03,831
I knew it was common

28
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:06,077
for exiles to commit suicide.

29
00:02:07,720 --> 00:02:10,519
But Mustafa Samei was different.

30
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:15,352
He only had two months left.

31
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:19,075
Only 62 days to freedom.

32
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:24,270
One day before, the Prime Minister

33
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:26,517
was killed in front of the parliament.

34
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:30,552
The case seemed suspicious.

35
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:34,392
Major Jahangiri ordered me

36
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:35,755
to come to Qeshm,

37
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:41,597
to examine the body

38
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:42,800
and to bury it.

39
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:49,836
What ensued did not accord

40
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:51,474
with those orders.

41
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:36,149
- Mr. Charaki?
- Hello Major.

42
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:37,960
- I'm Babak Hafizi.
- Pleased to meet you.

43
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:39,120
You too.

44
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:40,435
I owned a Chevrolet Impala

45
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:43,314
in Tehran when I was young, a beige one.

46
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:45,080
But yours looks better.

47
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:46,873
Thanks. Get in.

48
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:48,309
I've brought a worker

49
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:50,039
to help with the burial.

50
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:52,918
- Straight ahead?
- Straight ahead.

51
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:58,552
He asked to be moved from the village.

52
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:01,956
That was a while ago, almost three years.

53
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:05,119
They re-examined his file in Tehran

54
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:06,879
and did as he requested.

55
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:09,357
On Saturdays he'd come to the station,

56
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:11,392
sign in and return to the cemetery.

57
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:12,829
On foot.

58
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:15,557
It's 3.5 hours by foot.

59
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:17,594
You won't believe me,

60
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:18,916
but he was mad.

61
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:22,230
- Did he have visitors?
- Never.

62
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:24,719
No one at all.

63
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:26,549
He was alone.

64
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:28,672
Did anyone contact him from Tehran?

65
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,719
His mother.

66
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:32,149
She sent him books

67
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:34,359
and journals.

68
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:36,711
One time she sent a plastic bag

69
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:39,276
with small black seeds.

70
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:40,960
It was suspicious.

71
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:43,037
I threw them out the window.

72
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:44,799
A bunch of basil sprouted.

73
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:47,520
What about the village?

74
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:48,720
Did he socialize?

75
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:52,478
- With whom?
- The grocer, for instance.

76
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Or anyone.

77
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:55,833
No one mixes with the exiles here.

78
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:57,390
It's asking for trouble.

79
00:04:57,560 --> 00:04:58,560
So all these years

80
00:04:58,640 --> 00:05:00,836
he spoke to no one?

81
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:03,510
He'd talk to me. Gibberish.

82
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:05,480
I'm telling you,

83
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:07,552
he wanted to live on the cemetery.

84
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:10,394
He was insane.

85
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:13,314
He's better off dead.

86
00:06:21,640 --> 00:06:22,640
Hello.

87
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:26,480
Get him down.

88
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:30,994
Place him on this table.

89
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:49,720
Cut the rope.

90
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:54,239
Here we go...

91
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:10,636
Let us begin.

92
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:14,834
- Burial...
- We can't bury him here.

93
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:17,236
The village cemetery isn't far from here.

94
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:19,272
What difference does it make?

95
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:21,079
There's a thousand stories involved.

96
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:22,794
No one buries their dead here now.

97
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:25,158
I'll take care of the body myself.

98
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:26,510
I won't trouble you.

99
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:28,120
I have to bury him

100
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:29,640
and file my report.

101
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
I've travelled far.

102
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:32,435
Just bury him.

103
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:34,359
It'll be dark soon. It's a sin

104
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:36,279
to bury the dead after sunset.

105
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:38,756
This man was a Marxist-Leninist.

106
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:41,194
Just bury him.

107
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:51,355
I knew at once

108
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:53,040
that the suicide was a cover up.

109
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:55,993
He'd been murdered.

110
00:07:57,520 --> 00:08:00,115
They'd strangled him with a rope,

111
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,957
and then hanged him.

112
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:10,194
Should I elaborate?

113
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:11,836
Yes.

114
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:15,672
The bruise on his neck was horizontal.

115
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:20,230
It ran from below the throat

116
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:21,476
to the back of the neck.

117
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:25,433
If someone's hanged,

118
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:27,874
bruising isn't horizontal.

119
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:30,352
It runs from the larynx

120
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:31,994
up to the ears.

121
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:36,354
I know that, you know that...

122
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:38,600
Lieutenant Charaki

123
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:40,114
would have known it, too.

124
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:43,356
Only, why didn't he report it?

125
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:48,116
He said he'd touched nothing.

126
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:49,470
But you could tell that

127
00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:50,790
without investigating.

128
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:56,834
There was nonsense

129
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:59,271
written all over the walls,

130
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:02,032
lines from a story,

131
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:04,269
daily events,

132
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:08,310
he'd used the walls as a diary.

133
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:12,720
Let's go.

134
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:14,196
I said a prayer for him.

135
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:16,156
I'll stay the night

136
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:17,390
and take the first boat.

137
00:09:18,280 --> 00:09:19,919
- You can't stay here.
- Why not?

138
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:23,760
- It's a cemetery.
- It's very pleasant.

139
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:26,192
You go ahead. It'll be dark.

140
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:29,440
- Aren't you afraid all alone?
- No.

141
00:09:30,280 --> 00:09:34,559
- Write and file your report.
- Okay.

142
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:37,596
Mr. Charaki, what is this?

143
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:39,757
The photo, the geomancy and astrolabe?

144
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:41,917
The cemetery keeper used to live here.

145
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:43,554
It all belongs to him,

146
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:45,274
and the photo is of his daughter.

147
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:47,199
He killed his daughter.

148
00:09:47,560 --> 00:09:50,075
It's said her ghost haunts the place.

149
00:09:50,280 --> 00:09:52,556
A load of nonsense...

150
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:55,639
That's what I meant by a thousand stories.

151
00:09:56,840 --> 00:09:57,840
Goodbye.

152
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:00,920
Goodbye.

153
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,000
Sahib,

154
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:18,040
don't stay here.

155
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:20,074
Don't stay.

156
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:22,877
You'll be swallowed by the earth.

157
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:25,390
When a corpse goes into the ground,

158
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:27,637
the earth opens its mouth.

159
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:29,435
There'll be an earthquake.

160
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:31,279
This place is haunted.

161
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:33,677
Ghosts have no business with me.

162
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:36,674
Leave this place.

163
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:38,959
What did the worker say?

164
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:40,952
"... the earth opens its mouth

165
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:42,160
and there's a quake."

166
00:10:42,520 --> 00:10:43,520
You stayed

167
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:45,273
to see the earth open its mouth.

168
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:47,200
I stayed to read

169
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:48,874
what he'd written on the walls.

170
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,435
There was a book on the table:

171
00:10:53,080 --> 00:10:54,400
"Paradise".

172
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:57,636
He'd copied parts of it on the walls.

173
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:00,395
It was getting dark.

174
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:02,159
I stayed to read the book.

175
00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:29,750
<i>Last Wednesday at 11 o'clock...</i>

176
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:42,551
<i>a ghost entered Mr. Mavedat's body.</i>

177
00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:46,714
<i>It's easy to imagine</i>

178
00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:49,480
<i>Mr. Mavedat's shock at this event,</i>

179
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,798
<i>given the fact</i>

180
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,354
<i>that his face always</i>

181
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:59,635
<i>looks happy and surprised.</i>

182
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:06,109
<i>On that pleasant, moonlit evening,</i>

183
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:09,398
<i>Mr. Mavedat and three of his friends</i>

184
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:13,591
<i>had spread out a feast in the garden.</i>

185
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,275
<i>It was full moon,</i>

186
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:21,269
<i>a poetic light was cast over everything,</i>

187
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:24,560
<i>which threw mysterious shadows</i>

188
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:27,235
<i>and glistening sparkles on the river,</i>

189
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:31,716
<i>as if eternity were being created.</i>

190
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:46,273
A DRAGON ARRIVES!

191
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:50,994
A film by Mani Haghighi

192
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:54,113
Based on a true story

193
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:14,518
A pipe burst in my grandmother's house.

194
00:13:14,840 --> 00:13:17,116
The story begins before that,

195
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:19,471
but to me it began when the pipe burst.

196
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:22,798
Winter 2006.

197
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:25,312
A pipe had burst

198
00:13:25,520 --> 00:13:26,840
right over the room

199
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:29,714
where Father's movies were stored.

200
00:13:30,760 --> 00:13:34,151
I was worried about the films.

201
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:38,559
I called Mani, asked him to move them.

202
00:13:38,920 --> 00:13:40,400
I hurried to my grandmother's.

203
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:43,359
My brother helped me get the films out.

204
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:45,919
Ebrahim Golestan's films

205
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:47,156
were all in that room,

206
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:49,232
his industrial films, documentaries,

207
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:50,590
unfinished films,

208
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:51,800
and all the copies

209
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,480
of "The Brick and The Mirror".

210
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:57,435
I found a box there

211
00:13:57,640 --> 00:13:59,154
at the back of a closet.

212
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:01,556
A metal box about this big.

213
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:03,837
It was locked and there was no key.

214
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:05,756
Mani asked for the key.

215
00:14:05,960 --> 00:14:07,713
I'd never seen the box before.

216
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:11,391
I told him to break the lock

217
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:13,193
to see what was inside.

218
00:14:14,040 --> 00:14:16,600
There were a couple of tapes,

219
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:19,110
and some notebooks with German writing,

220
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:21,471
a piece of bone that we later

221
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:24,189
found out was a jackal's jawbone.

222
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:26,517
Some brass plates

223
00:14:26,680 --> 00:14:29,832
with prayers etched on them.

224
00:14:30,040 --> 00:14:32,714
A weekly literary journal

225
00:14:32,920 --> 00:14:36,231
with Bahram Sadeghi's "Paradise".

226
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:38,159
And a few pictures

227
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:41,319
of three young men with a baby.

228
00:14:41,960 --> 00:14:43,872
Why were these things in our house?

229
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:46,276
I recognized one of the men.

230
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:48,756
It was Keyvan Haddad with a beard.

231
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:51,912
He was the assistant sound engineer

232
00:14:52,120 --> 00:14:53,600
on "The Brick and The Mirror".

233
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:56,713
He had suddenly disappeared.

234
00:14:56,920 --> 00:14:57,990
The secret police had

235
00:14:58,160 --> 00:14:59,435
allegedly arrested him.

236
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:02,593
I knew someone at the State Archives.

237
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:05,395
All we had was a picture and a name.

238
00:15:05,560 --> 00:15:07,597
They sent us to the Prison Archives

239
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:09,877
of the Anti-terror Committee,

240
00:15:10,120 --> 00:15:12,157
where we finally found some clues.

241
00:15:12,760 --> 00:15:15,514
We found the most important clue

242
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:18,599
at the Anti-terror Prison Archives.

243
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:21,558
The arrest files of the three men

244
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:24,229
on the island of Qeshm in 1964,

245
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:27,478
the year Keyvan Haddad disappeared.

246
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:30,514
There we found the interrogation tapes

247
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:33,872
of the three men on the island.

248
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:35,080
It was clear

249
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:36,993
that this film had to be made.

250
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:38,873
The story

251
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:42,313
of my grandfather's sound engineer,

252
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:44,711
who'd disappeared while shooting

253
00:15:44,920 --> 00:15:47,754
"The Brick and The Mirror".

254
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:17,520
This is all okay.

255
00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:18,949
Back up to "This child

256
00:16:19,160 --> 00:16:21,197
is a piece of someone's heart."

257
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:27,430
<i>She got in the cab. I didn't see the baby.</i>

258
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:28,600
<i>She paid and got out.</i>

259
00:16:28,760 --> 00:16:30,240
<i>Then I heard the baby crying.</i>

260
00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:32,079
<i>I got out and called after her,</i>

261
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:33,720
<i>but she was gone.</i>

262
00:16:34,640 --> 00:16:35,790
Jalal?

263
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:38,350
Mr. Moghaddam?

264
00:16:40,920 --> 00:16:42,559
Where did he go again?

265
00:16:42,760 --> 00:16:44,752
<i>He'll be right back. Here he is.</i>

266
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:46,195
<i>Sorry, I'm back again.</i>

267
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:47,629
Where you say, "This child

268
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:49,160
is a piece of someone's heart."

269
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:50,640
<i>The line sounded good.</i>

270
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:53,759
<i>- Not on my recording.
- Play it back.</i>

271
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:03,636
It's very interesting.

272
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:06,553
The poor woman...

273
00:17:07,120 --> 00:17:08,349
The poor woman...

274
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:12,396
How awful she must feel right now.

275
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:17,389
This child is a piece of her heart.

276
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,640
- Long time no see!
- I'm here now.

277
00:17:24,840 --> 00:17:27,958
We're honored by your presence!

278
00:17:28,120 --> 00:17:29,270
Does this film never end?

279
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:30,440
It just started.

280
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:31,920
You're even wearing earrings!

281
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:34,311
Is that my necklace? Stop it!

282
00:17:34,560 --> 00:17:35,755
That friend of yours...

283
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:37,314
Are you here to work?

284
00:17:37,680 --> 00:17:39,637
- The geologist.
- He's a civil engineer.

285
00:17:39,920 --> 00:17:40,920
Our honeymoon...

286
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,195
Hafizi is looking for him.

287
00:17:42,360 --> 00:17:43,760
- Who? Behnam?
- Yes.

288
00:17:44,520 --> 00:17:45,954
He's straight.

289
00:17:46,120 --> 00:17:47,554
He's only been back two weeks.

290
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:48,760
Don't worry.

291
00:17:48,920 --> 00:17:50,115
Don't get him involved.

292
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:51,595
We just have a few questions.

293
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,150
Hafizi was away on business.

294
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:54,874
There was an earthquake.

295
00:17:55,040 --> 00:17:56,190
It's mysterious...

296
00:17:56,360 --> 00:17:57,360
The Intelligence Agency

297
00:17:57,480 --> 00:17:58,550
has specific questions?

298
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:00,757
The Agency has nothing to do with it.

299
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:03,236
Hafizi hasn't reported anything yet.

300
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:05,999
He just has a few questions

301
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:07,160
about the quake.

302
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:09,795
Somewhere safe. Your father's print shop.

303
00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:12,115
Please. Do it for my sake.

304
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:15,030
For me.

305
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:16,754
This is something

306
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:20,636
that's tormented me for years.

307
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:24,877
If I hadn't insisted

308
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,913
that he did it for my sake,

309
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:31,589
maybe none of it would've happened.

310
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:33,800
And everyone would now

311
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,150
be somewhere else.

312
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:38,239
Jahangiri was an interesting case.

313
00:18:38,440 --> 00:18:40,272
There aren't many like him.

314
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:44,269
At least none that I know of.

315
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:45,675
To be able to infiltrate

316
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:47,832
the Secret Police Agency so deeply

317
00:18:48,040 --> 00:18:50,999
and to put together

318
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:52,634
his own group of people.

319
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:54,752
Especially with his biography,

320
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:57,077
having been born in northern Iran...

321
00:18:57,280 --> 00:19:01,240
All this made him a fascinating figure.

322
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:02,715
And that name!

323
00:19:02,920 --> 00:19:03,920
Hozvaresh!

324
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:08,199
I still don't know what it means.

325
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:09,400
Back then we thought

326
00:19:09,560 --> 00:19:10,676
it was an abbreviation.

327
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:14,592
Hozvaresh are Aramaic words

328
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:16,234
in Pahlavi script

329
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:18,199
which appear in Middle Persian texts.

330
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:20,712
If you read them in Farsi,

331
00:19:20,920 --> 00:19:22,559
they make no sense.

332
00:19:22,760 --> 00:19:24,717
That is, unless you memorize them.

333
00:19:24,920 --> 00:19:27,435
There are some 1000 Hozvaresh

334
00:19:27,640 --> 00:19:30,200
in Middle Persian texts.

335
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:34,189
"Ruler", for instance, is "Malka",

336
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:37,677
"Man" is "Gabra",

337
00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:40,873
"Night" is "Laylay".

338
00:19:41,080 --> 00:19:44,471
It was a system of writing

339
00:19:44,680 --> 00:19:46,592
that not everyone could learn.

340
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,354
The interesting thing is,

341
00:19:48,560 --> 00:19:51,075
these members of Hozvaresh

342
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:54,591
would pass on secret information

343
00:19:54,840 --> 00:19:55,840
from within,

344
00:19:55,960 --> 00:19:59,032
to all opposition groups, regardless:

345
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:01,311
To the Islamic groups, the Communists,

346
00:20:01,560 --> 00:20:03,916
the Nationalists, everyone.

347
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:05,834
I'm not saying a thing.

348
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:08,875
Hafizi told it to Shahrzad,

349
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:12,319
and she believed him.

350
00:20:12,520 --> 00:20:15,194
- How is Shahrzad?
- She's vigilant.

351
00:20:15,680 --> 00:20:17,592
A secret agent told Shahrzad...

352
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:19,280
- Hafizi's not an agent.
- No?

353
00:20:19,480 --> 00:20:20,550
I already told you.

354
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:24,032
Then an infiltrator told Shahrzad that...

355
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:26,199
Mr. Haddad?

356
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:28,232
- Babak, come on up.
- Hello.

357
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:36,233
- Hello.
- How are you, Keyvan?

358
00:20:36,440 --> 00:20:37,556
Are you well?

359
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:40,916
- My friend Behnam Shokouhi.
- Hello.

360
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:47,829
I'm sorry we have to meet here.

361
00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:49,315
The matter is a bit delicate.

362
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:51,193
He'll have told you that already.

363
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:53,238
Yes, but my question is...

364
00:20:53,480 --> 00:20:54,960
I know. You're right.

365
00:20:55,160 --> 00:20:56,560
It's hard to believe.

366
00:20:56,760 --> 00:20:58,558
This is not about belief.

367
00:20:58,760 --> 00:21:00,717
My question relates to you yourself.

368
00:21:00,920 --> 00:21:03,560
- Behnam is not a problem.
- No...

369
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:05,717
Not in the least.

370
00:21:05,920 --> 00:21:07,673
I am very grateful.

371
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:09,274
I don't have a problem, either.

372
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:11,193
I just have a question for you.

373
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:15,956
What? Am I being too frank?

374
00:21:16,160 --> 00:21:19,278
- Let him speak first.
- Okay.

375
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:22,196
He explained everything.

376
00:21:22,360 --> 00:21:25,114
It was hard to believe at first.

377
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,000
I looked him in the eye

378
00:21:29,160 --> 00:21:31,277
while he told the story.

379
00:21:32,360 --> 00:21:34,795
I said to myself he wasn't lying.

380
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,480
He may be making a mistake,

381
00:21:36,680 --> 00:21:37,909
but he's not lying.

382
00:21:38,120 --> 00:21:39,713
Why didn't you file a report?

383
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:41,196
Why come to me?

384
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:43,750
Otherwise I won't learn what happened.

385
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:46,157
Such are the risks and dangers.

386
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:47,320
I don't want you

387
00:21:47,480 --> 00:21:49,312
to do anything or fix anything.

388
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:51,591
I just want a specialist to see

389
00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:53,871
the things I witnessed there.

390
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:55,594
Two specialists.

391
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:57,354
You can't go without me.

392
00:22:37,240 --> 00:22:40,790
<i>He loved to play with sounds.</i>

393
00:22:41,080 --> 00:22:43,276
<i>He'd say, "Listen to the rain</i>

394
00:22:43,480 --> 00:22:44,596
<i>if you're feeling hot.</i>

395
00:22:45,160 --> 00:22:47,675
<i>It'll cool you."</i>

396
00:22:48,160 --> 00:22:50,391
<i>He had a collection of silences</i>

397
00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:52,239
<i>from all around the world.</i>

398
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:54,870
<i>He said: "Put the tape in</i>

399
00:22:55,240 --> 00:22:57,516
<i>and let it roll,</i>

400
00:22:57,720 --> 00:23:01,270
<i>I'll tell you where the sound is from."</i>

401
00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:04,518
<i>I played the tape.</i>

402
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:06,552
<i>You couldn't hear a thing.</i>

403
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:08,717
<i>Keyvan listened and told me</i>

404
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:11,349
<i>this was Ali Sadr cave,</i>

405
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:17,157
<i>or the tomb of some mystic writer,</i>

406
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:19,517
<i>or the Chattanooga Restaurant</i>

407
00:23:19,720 --> 00:23:22,633
<i>at 2 in the morning.</i>

408
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:26,152
<i>That's how I fell in love with him.</i>

409
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:08,437
<i>We hadn't been together long</i>

410
00:24:08,800 --> 00:24:10,792
<i>when I had a bad car accident.</i>

411
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:14,238
<i>I was bedridden for a while.</i>

412
00:24:15,040 --> 00:24:18,795
<i>He'd come and record</i>

413
00:24:19,960 --> 00:24:23,158
<i>my breathing as I slept,</i>

414
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:25,750
<i>so as to listen to it back at home.</i>

415
00:24:26,760 --> 00:24:30,037
<i>Wouldn't you fall in love with him?</i>

416
00:25:23,160 --> 00:25:25,629
- What are you doing?
- Research.

417
00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:34,989
<i>The first thing I saw</i>

418
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:36,714
<i>was the writing on the walls.</i>

419
00:25:36,920 --> 00:25:38,752
<i>I couldn't believe it.</i>

420
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:41,555
<i>His handwriting was just like mine.</i>

421
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:44,514
<i>Not just similar. Exactly the same.</i>

422
00:25:45,640 --> 00:25:46,960
<i>As if, for three years,</i>

423
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:49,112
<i>I'd been locked up on this ship.</i>

424
00:25:50,560 --> 00:25:52,279
<i>As if they were my own memoirs</i>

425
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:53,480
<i>on the walls.</i>

426
00:25:53,960 --> 00:25:56,111
<i>As if I'd been asleep for three years</i>

427
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:58,472
<i>and could now read all my dreams here</i>

428
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:00,996
<i>and remember who I really was.</i>

429
00:26:01,920 --> 00:26:03,639
<i>We'd only just arrived,</i>

430
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:06,791
<i>but it was as if I were coming home.</i>

431
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:08,270
What's wrong?

432
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:11,560
I think some things have been moved about.

433
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:12,876
Like what?

434
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:15,193
I was reading a book.

435
00:26:30,520 --> 00:26:31,670
There was an earthquake.

436
00:26:31,880 --> 00:26:33,155
You're kidding.

437
00:26:33,320 --> 00:26:34,640
But there was only cracking

438
00:26:34,800 --> 00:26:35,800
at the cemetery.

439
00:26:35,920 --> 00:26:36,920
What do you mean?

440
00:26:37,160 --> 00:26:38,753
There was a 5 Richter earthquake,

441
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:40,000
but only at the cemetery.

442
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:41,395
The earth a few meters away

443
00:26:41,560 --> 00:26:42,560
is undisturbed.

444
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:43,875
- Is that possible?
- No.

445
00:26:44,680 --> 00:26:46,194
But it happened.

446
00:26:46,520 --> 00:26:48,591
What exactly did the worker say to you?

447
00:26:48,840 --> 00:26:50,399
When a body is buried,

448
00:26:50,600 --> 00:26:52,557
the earth opens its mouth and quakes.

449
00:26:53,160 --> 00:26:54,958
So we need a body now.

450
00:26:55,400 --> 00:26:57,790
He said: "We need a body"

451
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,469
as if we were talking about a screwdriver.

452
00:27:02,440 --> 00:27:03,760
Simple as that.

453
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:05,832
A corpse, in that hell.

454
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:07,275
As I already said,

455
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:10,311
there was only cracking at the cemetery.

456
00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:14,079
This is impossible in an earthquake.

457
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:17,795
Earthquakes are huge.

458
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:19,400
If there's an earthquake here,

459
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:22,320
the ground is shaken over kilometers

460
00:27:22,520 --> 00:27:24,352
and you can see its traces.

461
00:27:24,560 --> 00:27:26,791
But this one was limited to the cemetery.

462
00:27:28,560 --> 00:27:30,552
I know it sounds strange,

463
00:27:30,760 --> 00:27:33,434
but to figure out what was going on

464
00:27:33,640 --> 00:27:35,871
we needed a body

465
00:27:36,800 --> 00:27:39,360
that we could bury at that cemetery.

466
00:27:39,560 --> 00:27:41,756
He walked around the graves,

467
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:45,076
tasting the earth in different places.

468
00:27:45,680 --> 00:27:47,399
When there's a crack in the earth,

469
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:49,034
it tastes different

470
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:50,953
due to gas coming from the ground.

471
00:27:53,040 --> 00:27:54,269
Then...

472
00:27:58,400 --> 00:27:59,629
he saw that huge ship

473
00:27:59,800 --> 00:28:02,520
and didn't ask why it was there.

474
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:03,960
We later found out

475
00:28:04,120 --> 00:28:05,952
he knew the story of the ship.

476
00:28:06,160 --> 00:28:08,391
Or pretended to know it.

477
00:28:09,080 --> 00:28:10,196
He's a master of deception.

478
00:28:10,760 --> 00:28:12,672
You never know if he's lying or not.

479
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:14,872
Do you know the story?

480
00:28:15,720 --> 00:28:16,949
What story?

481
00:28:17,320 --> 00:28:18,320
Of the ship and

482
00:28:18,400 --> 00:28:20,153
William Baffin's 231 victims.

483
00:28:20,800 --> 00:28:22,473
- Do you know it?
- Yes.

484
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:24,234
Britain's William Baffin

485
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:25,675
discovered Greenland.

486
00:28:25,880 --> 00:28:29,078
In 1622 the East India Company hires him

487
00:28:29,280 --> 00:28:30,475
to come to Iran

488
00:28:30,680 --> 00:28:32,911
and sign a silk trade agreement.

489
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:36,800
William Baffin convinces Shah Abbas

490
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:38,559
to expel the Portuguese

491
00:28:38,760 --> 00:28:40,194
from the Strait of Hormuz.

492
00:28:40,600 --> 00:28:43,160
Shah Abbas is to attack from land,

493
00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:45,920
and the British forces from the sea.

494
00:28:46,120 --> 00:28:48,032
They send William Baffin to Qeshm

495
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:50,675
to scout out the Portuguese forces.

496
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:52,030
They say that with

497
00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:53,759
only five British soldiers,

498
00:28:53,960 --> 00:28:56,236
William Baffin captured a Portuguese ship

499
00:28:56,400 --> 00:28:57,914
with 231 sailors on board.

500
00:28:58,120 --> 00:28:59,759
He forces them

501
00:28:59,960 --> 00:29:02,156
to pull their ship onto dry land,

502
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:06,998
all the way over to this cemetery.

503
00:29:07,640 --> 00:29:10,838
Then he decapitates all 231,

504
00:29:11,720 --> 00:29:13,598
and buries them right behind you.

505
00:29:15,280 --> 00:29:17,397
The next day the Portuguese attack

506
00:29:17,560 --> 00:29:19,438
and kill William Baffin.

507
00:29:19,640 --> 00:29:22,360
One of these graves must be his.

508
00:29:43,680 --> 00:29:46,149
<i>To find a corpse</i>

509
00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:48,551
<i>you need to know people.</i>

510
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:51,396
<i>I knew Charaki.</i>

511
00:29:51,800 --> 00:29:54,235
<i>I went out in search of him.</i>

512
00:29:54,520 --> 00:29:55,920
<i>They said he'd gone</i>

513
00:29:56,120 --> 00:29:57,713
<i>to see an ophthalmologist.</i>

514
00:29:57,880 --> 00:29:59,473
<i>I asked where that was.</i>

515
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:01,160
<i>They gave me an address,</i>

516
00:30:01,560 --> 00:30:04,200
<i>an hour and a half outside the village.</i>

517
00:30:04,440 --> 00:30:07,080
<i>The guy looked like anything but a doctor.</i>

518
00:30:09,480 --> 00:30:11,278
How many people live in the village?

519
00:30:13,240 --> 00:30:15,232
I haven't counted.

520
00:30:16,440 --> 00:30:18,432
Are any of them close to death?

521
00:30:24,040 --> 00:30:25,190
Close to death.

522
00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:27,511
Are any of them about to die?

523
00:30:28,600 --> 00:30:31,354
An old man? A sick child?

524
00:30:33,920 --> 00:30:35,991
Answer me, Charaki.

525
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:40,436
It'll happen sooner or later.

526
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:43,036
Why?

527
00:30:43,520 --> 00:30:45,352
What was that guy doing to you?

528
00:30:45,560 --> 00:30:47,631
Almas? He's an ophthalmologist.

529
00:30:48,800 --> 00:30:51,474
He hunts sharks, does circumcisions,

530
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:54,199
and is an ophthalmologist, too.

531
00:30:56,200 --> 00:30:58,920
He was treating my eyes.

532
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:02,074
He takes shark oil in his mouth

533
00:31:02,440 --> 00:31:04,636
and applies it to my eyes with his tongue.

534
00:31:05,680 --> 00:31:08,070
It's soothing. You should try it.

535
00:31:08,560 --> 00:31:09,560
No, thanks.

536
00:31:19,040 --> 00:31:21,236
I need a corpse.

537
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:23,319
Find me one.

538
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:25,274
<i>Day 1001.</i>

539
00:31:26,680 --> 00:31:28,911
<i>Today I went to the Valley of Stars.</i>

540
00:31:30,040 --> 00:31:31,793
<i>Someone was waiting for me.</i>

541
00:31:32,840 --> 00:31:35,036
<i>He was wearing a gray raincoat</i>

542
00:31:35,480 --> 00:31:37,551
<i>and he shot me in the neck.</i>

543
00:31:38,760 --> 00:31:40,831
<i>He felt sorry for me.</i>

544
00:31:41,280 --> 00:31:42,919
<i>He didn't give me the opportunity to say</i>

545
00:31:43,120 --> 00:31:44,873
<i>he'd left something behind.</i>

546
00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:48,317
<i>Day 743.</i>

547
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:50,439
<i>I decided to have breakfast today.</i>

548
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:52,757
<i>I walked to the station.</i>

549
00:31:53,080 --> 00:31:56,073
<i>Charaki had two eggs. He gave me one.</i>

550
00:31:56,760 --> 00:31:58,353
<i>I said: "Charaki, on this island</i>

551
00:31:58,560 --> 00:31:59,914
<i>there are no chickens.</i>

552
00:32:00,120 --> 00:32:02,715
<i>Where did you get the eggs?"</i>

553
00:32:03,400 --> 00:32:05,198
<i>"Damn you", he said."With those words</i>

554
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:07,875
<i>you sent me straight into the abyss."</i>

555
00:32:09,080 --> 00:32:10,912
<i>Day 67.</i>

556
00:32:12,840 --> 00:32:15,480
<i>I killed a fly as it was airborne.</i>

557
00:32:16,840 --> 00:32:18,718
<i>It's what they call a good death.</i>

558
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:21,397
<i>The last image it had of life</i>

559
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:22,670
<i>was of flying.</i>

560
00:32:24,080 --> 00:32:26,675
<i>What'll be the last image I see?</i>

561
00:33:51,400 --> 00:33:52,800
What's that for?

562
00:33:54,960 --> 00:33:56,314
Photography.

563
00:34:07,920 --> 00:34:09,240
What did he write?

564
00:34:09,400 --> 00:34:11,551
<i>What'll be the last image I see?</i>

565
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:14,832
<i>A stranded ship?</i>

566
00:34:15,360 --> 00:34:17,875
<i>An abandoned, haunted cemetery?</i>

567
00:34:18,520 --> 00:34:20,989
<i>964 crumbling headstones</i>

568
00:34:21,920 --> 00:34:24,913
<i>over an ocean of crushed bones?</i>

569
00:34:25,320 --> 00:34:26,879
<i>Does it make a difference?</i>

570
00:34:29,160 --> 00:34:31,311
<i>Day 1021.</i>

571
00:34:31,840 --> 00:34:32,990
<i>It's afternoon.</i>

572
00:34:33,240 --> 00:34:34,640
<i>I think it's July.</i>

573
00:34:35,200 --> 00:34:36,200
<i>I've been on this island</i>

574
00:34:36,360 --> 00:34:37,360
<i>almost three years</i>

575
00:34:37,480 --> 00:34:39,153
<i>and have never gone swimming.</i>

576
00:34:40,280 --> 00:34:41,475
<i>I'm lying in bed</i>

577
00:34:41,680 --> 00:34:43,194
<i>and think about swimming.</i>

578
00:34:43,400 --> 00:34:45,835
<i>I exercise my brain.</i>

579
00:34:46,040 --> 00:34:48,396
<i>But I wish I were a shark hunter, too.</i>

580
00:34:50,680 --> 00:34:52,592
<i>Day 313.</i>

581
00:34:53,440 --> 00:34:56,035
<i>Today I heard a motorcycle going by.</i>

582
00:34:56,320 --> 00:34:58,880
<i>It was nice, I liked it.</i>

583
00:35:03,080 --> 00:35:04,992
<i>Day 1201.</i>

584
00:35:05,800 --> 00:35:07,792
<i>She brought me some basil today.</i>

585
00:35:08,120 --> 00:35:10,760
<i>She was wearing a yellow floral dress.</i>

586
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:13,160
<i>We went out on deck together</i>

587
00:35:13,360 --> 00:35:14,840
<i>and looked at the graves.</i>

588
00:35:15,040 --> 00:35:17,475
<i>We ate bread, cheese and basil.</i>

589
00:35:54,040 --> 00:35:55,633
You're in luck.

590
00:35:55,840 --> 00:35:57,194
When she puts red oil

591
00:35:57,400 --> 00:35:59,039
on the forehead it's all over.

592
00:36:00,720 --> 00:36:02,552
Tell them we'll bury the body

593
00:36:02,760 --> 00:36:04,194
in the other cemetery.

594
00:36:04,560 --> 00:36:06,631
Don't tell them that.

595
00:36:07,360 --> 00:36:08,919
Why? It's just a cemetery.

596
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:10,794
It's not just any cemetery.

597
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:12,320
No one's been buried there

598
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:13,480
for a 100 years.

599
00:36:14,080 --> 00:36:15,309
Samei only went there

600
00:36:15,520 --> 00:36:17,477
so no one would disturb him.

601
00:36:17,680 --> 00:36:19,672
Just tell them. Offer them money.

602
00:36:19,880 --> 00:36:20,996
It's not that.

603
00:36:21,160 --> 00:36:22,674
Tell me what you want it for,

604
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:23,880
then we'll see.

605
00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:26,757
This man was once a village elder,

606
00:36:27,120 --> 00:36:29,396
he can't be buried in the devil's ground.

607
00:36:29,800 --> 00:36:31,200
Do you want to bury another person

608
00:36:31,400 --> 00:36:33,119
so the earth quakes again?

609
00:36:33,520 --> 00:36:35,830
Wasn't one earthquake enough?

610
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:37,070
I went to the ship

611
00:36:37,240 --> 00:36:38,754
when you left for Tehran.

612
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:40,873
You didn't report back to the Agency.

613
00:36:41,520 --> 00:36:43,591
- That's bold of you.
- Charaki...

614
00:36:44,920 --> 00:36:46,434
think it through.

615
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:47,870
A corpse.

616
00:36:48,080 --> 00:36:49,992
If not this one, then another.

617
00:36:50,200 --> 00:36:52,237
Or it'll be you and that'll be no fun.

618
00:36:57,400 --> 00:36:59,232
<i>The ground is like the sea,</i>

619
00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:01,033
<i>constantly in motion,</i>

620
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:02,998
<i>always shaking.</i>

621
00:37:03,160 --> 00:37:04,992
<i>Sometimes the shaking is stronger,</i>

622
00:37:05,200 --> 00:37:06,520
<i>they call it an earthquake.</i>

623
00:37:07,120 --> 00:37:09,589
<i>Sometimes it only shakes a little,</i>

624
00:37:09,800 --> 00:37:11,280
<i>like a slight itch,</i>

625
00:37:11,480 --> 00:37:13,711
<i>you can't tell if it's really there.</i>

626
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:15,718
<i>There's no name for this.</i>

627
00:37:16,600 --> 00:37:18,592
<i>I was searching for this,</i>

628
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:20,439
<i>for this nameless motion.</i>

629
00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:11,356
Babak!

630
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:14,120
Look at this.

631
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:19,960
What is it?

632
00:38:20,120 --> 00:38:22,351
A symbol. I think it's a name.

633
00:38:23,520 --> 00:38:24,590
Look.

634
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:26,075
<i>Halimeh.</i>

635
00:38:26,280 --> 00:38:27,680
Someone visited him here.

636
00:38:27,880 --> 00:38:29,030
It's on the walls too.

637
00:38:29,240 --> 00:38:30,720
He was in love.

638
00:38:33,560 --> 00:38:35,233
Charaki,

639
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:37,432
is there a Halimeh in the village?

640
00:38:38,920 --> 00:38:40,115
There are many Halimehs here.

641
00:38:40,920 --> 00:38:42,320
One that Samei knew?

642
00:38:44,120 --> 00:38:45,713
There was one. Almas's daughter.

643
00:38:46,280 --> 00:38:48,556
- Who's Almas?
- You met him.

644
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:49,880
He was cleaning my eyes.

645
00:38:50,240 --> 00:38:51,833
What was his daughter doing here?

646
00:38:52,640 --> 00:38:55,030
I never saw her here.

647
00:38:55,440 --> 00:38:57,238
- It was just talk.
- What kind of talk?

648
00:38:58,120 --> 00:38:59,474
Just gossip.

649
00:38:59,840 --> 00:39:02,230
What sort of gossip? Where is she now?

650
00:39:02,480 --> 00:39:04,153
She disappeared.

651
00:39:04,360 --> 00:39:06,636
She's dead, at least that's what they say.

652
00:39:06,880 --> 00:39:08,439
- I don't know.
- Look at me.

653
00:39:09,040 --> 00:39:11,077
What do you mean, you don't know?

654
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:13,078
It's their business.

655
00:39:13,280 --> 00:39:14,280
We keep out of it.

656
00:39:15,480 --> 00:39:16,720
And you're telling me this now?

657
00:39:17,600 --> 00:39:18,750
A girl disappeared and

658
00:39:18,920 --> 00:39:20,036
you didn't investigate?

659
00:39:20,280 --> 00:39:22,749
Lots of girls run away from here.

660
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:25,111
They take the night ferry for Bandar Abbas

661
00:39:26,080 --> 00:39:28,072
or for Ras al-Khaimah.

662
00:39:28,560 --> 00:39:30,836
Ask Almas about his daughter.

663
00:39:31,040 --> 00:39:33,794
He'll make mincemeat of you.

664
00:39:36,280 --> 00:39:38,033
<i>I went to see Almas,</i>

665
00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:40,550
<i>the ophthalmologist and shark hunter.</i>

666
00:39:41,640 --> 00:39:42,960
<i>He wasn't home.</i>

667
00:39:43,160 --> 00:39:45,231
<i>His house wasn't a home, either.</i>

668
00:39:45,440 --> 00:39:47,193
<i>It was a long corridor</i>

669
00:39:47,400 --> 00:39:49,278
<i>with an oil extraction lab on one side,</i>

670
00:39:49,480 --> 00:39:51,312
<i>and a doctor's practice on the other.</i>

671
00:39:51,840 --> 00:39:53,194
<i>It smelled strange,</i>

672
00:39:53,400 --> 00:39:56,757
<i>somewhere between sulfur and cloves.</i>

673
00:39:57,920 --> 00:39:59,320
<i>Charaki was right.</i>

674
00:40:00,360 --> 00:40:01,794
<i>I didn't belong there.</i>

675
00:40:07,560 --> 00:40:08,676
Hello.

676
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:13,199
Sorry, it was so hot I went inside.

677
00:40:14,080 --> 00:40:15,992
- Let me give you a hand.
- No need.

678
00:40:19,160 --> 00:40:20,230
I'm Charaki's colleague.

679
00:40:23,120 --> 00:40:24,395
I know you.

680
00:40:25,960 --> 00:40:27,314
But that isn't a shark.

681
00:40:27,520 --> 00:40:29,398
They say you're a shark hunter.

682
00:40:31,360 --> 00:40:33,352
It's not shark season now.

683
00:40:35,320 --> 00:40:37,551
Do you eat that? It looks weird.

684
00:40:39,040 --> 00:40:41,111
We coat ferries with its oil

685
00:40:41,520 --> 00:40:43,079
to make them waterproof.

686
00:40:43,320 --> 00:40:44,320
How many ferries

687
00:40:44,480 --> 00:40:45,755
do they build here a year?

688
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:48,354
Enough to make a living?

689
00:40:48,600 --> 00:40:49,954
God is merciful.

690
00:40:51,960 --> 00:40:53,713
How many children do you have?

691
00:40:54,600 --> 00:40:56,034
None.

692
00:40:56,280 --> 00:40:57,919
What about Halimeh?

693
00:41:02,480 --> 00:41:04,358
She is dead.

694
00:41:07,160 --> 00:41:08,355
Charaki only said

695
00:41:08,560 --> 00:41:10,916
- she is missing.
- She's dead.

696
00:41:11,480 --> 00:41:12,960
Charaki said she was missing.

697
00:41:13,480 --> 00:41:14,709
Where did you look for her?

698
00:41:16,480 --> 00:41:19,040
You don't look for a runaway.

699
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:21,434
How do you know she's dead?

700
00:41:21,640 --> 00:41:25,077
They all die. They run away at night

701
00:41:25,240 --> 00:41:26,594
and are eaten by wolves.

702
00:41:26,760 --> 00:41:28,399
And if they get to Ras al-Khaimah,

703
00:41:28,560 --> 00:41:29,960
it's worse than death.

704
00:41:32,840 --> 00:41:34,877
You knew Mustafa Samei.

705
00:41:37,720 --> 00:41:39,279
Mustafa Samei.

706
00:41:40,200 --> 00:41:41,600
The haunted cemetery.

707
00:41:41,800 --> 00:41:43,712
I don't know anyone.

708
00:41:44,040 --> 00:41:45,440
I hunt sharks.

709
00:41:49,880 --> 00:41:51,200
Go inside.

710
00:46:04,960 --> 00:46:06,155
Sit down.

711
00:46:06,560 --> 00:46:07,630
Sit down.

712
00:46:25,480 --> 00:46:26,516
Smoke this.

713
00:46:31,080 --> 00:46:32,080
Smoke it.

714
00:46:34,240 --> 00:46:35,560
You won't understand me

715
00:46:35,760 --> 00:46:37,558
until you smoke it.

716
00:46:39,080 --> 00:46:41,117
<i>She said: "You won't understand me</i>

717
00:46:41,320 --> 00:46:42,595
<i>until you smoke it."</i>

718
00:46:42,840 --> 00:46:44,593
<i>I lit a match.</i>

719
00:46:48,840 --> 00:46:49,840
<i>She said:</i>

720
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:51,753
<i>"I know you're looking for my Halimeh.</i>

721
00:46:52,160 --> 00:46:54,152
<i>Go to the Valley of Stars.</i>

722
00:46:54,400 --> 00:46:55,400
<i>Behind the opening</i>

723
00:46:55,520 --> 00:46:57,079
<i>that you looked through</i>

724
00:46:57,280 --> 00:46:58,794
<i>someone's waiting for you.</i>

725
00:46:59,440 --> 00:47:00,920
<i>Its leg is broken.</i>

726
00:47:01,440 --> 00:47:03,955
<i>Put five bullets in its brain</i>

727
00:47:04,160 --> 00:47:05,310
<i>and release it.</i>

728
00:47:05,520 --> 00:47:08,115
<i>Bury it in the haunted cemetery.</i>

729
00:47:08,320 --> 00:47:10,198
<i>Wait. The grave will say</i>

730
00:47:10,360 --> 00:47:11,635
<i>where Halimeh is."</i>

731
00:47:13,840 --> 00:47:14,910
<i>That's what she said.</i>

732
00:47:15,120 --> 00:47:17,157
<i>At least, that's what I think she said.</i>

733
00:47:17,400 --> 00:47:20,279
<i>I don't know if it was a dream.</i>

734
00:49:43,080 --> 00:49:44,275
Fetch hot water

735
00:49:44,480 --> 00:49:46,870
and the leather bag from my suitcase!

736
00:50:06,800 --> 00:50:08,280
Take her.

737
00:50:20,680 --> 00:50:22,956
I held the baby in my arms.

738
00:50:26,080 --> 00:50:28,151
Her mother was down there.

739
00:50:32,040 --> 00:50:34,953
They pulled her body out.

740
00:50:36,120 --> 00:50:37,270
Babak said:

741
00:50:37,480 --> 00:50:39,711
"Here's the corpse you were looking for."

742
00:50:39,880 --> 00:50:42,031
She told me her father had killed Samei.

743
00:50:42,400 --> 00:50:43,880
She was whispering.

744
00:50:44,080 --> 00:50:46,390
I brought my head closer. She took my hand

745
00:50:46,600 --> 00:50:49,399
and said Almas had killed Samei.

746
00:50:49,760 --> 00:50:51,558
We can lay out her body,

747
00:50:51,760 --> 00:50:52,830
take it to the village,

748
00:50:53,040 --> 00:50:54,235
to the station,

749
00:50:54,440 --> 00:50:56,159
and go after Almas.

750
00:50:56,840 --> 00:50:58,797
He'd come to kill them both,

751
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:01,276
but she'd hidden in the cellar.

752
00:51:05,160 --> 00:51:07,072
Does it make a difference

753
00:51:07,280 --> 00:51:09,317
if I take this body and arrest Almas?

754
00:51:10,240 --> 00:51:11,913
Does it?

755
00:51:13,680 --> 00:51:16,115
I want to know what's going on down there.

756
00:51:17,600 --> 00:51:19,273
Let's bury her.

757
00:51:36,080 --> 00:51:37,673
Don't be afraid.

758
00:51:40,560 --> 00:51:42,074
Don't be scared.

759
00:51:45,920 --> 00:51:47,991
I'll stay with you forever.

760
00:51:50,480 --> 00:51:51,596
I promise.

761
00:51:57,280 --> 00:51:59,511
<i>An Indian worker said:</i>

762
00:51:59,720 --> 00:52:01,837
<i>"When a corpse goes into the ground,</i>

763
00:52:02,720 --> 00:52:03,836
<i>the earth opens its mouth</i>

764
00:52:04,040 --> 00:52:05,554
<i>and there's an earthquake."</i>

765
00:52:07,080 --> 00:52:09,470
<i>This is what they call a superstition.</i>

766
00:52:11,520 --> 00:52:13,273
<i>The corpse had been buried</i>

767
00:52:13,480 --> 00:52:15,472
<i>and the earth had shaken.</i>

768
00:52:15,680 --> 00:52:16,680
<i>Hafizi said</i>

769
00:52:16,840 --> 00:52:18,911
<i>he'd seen it with his own eyes.</i>

770
00:52:19,120 --> 00:52:21,237
<i>This is what they call a quotation.</i>

771
00:52:22,760 --> 00:52:24,831
<i>Now I had buried Halimeh</i>

772
00:52:25,040 --> 00:52:26,554
<i>with my own hands.</i>

773
00:52:27,360 --> 00:52:28,589
<i>I was afraid,</i>

774
00:52:28,800 --> 00:52:30,712
<i>as if there was another earthquake,</i>

775
00:52:32,360 --> 00:52:35,034
<i>it'd be what they call a nightmare.</i>

776
00:54:22,360 --> 00:54:24,477
There was an earthquake again.

777
00:54:24,680 --> 00:54:25,680
Really.

778
00:54:28,760 --> 00:54:30,160
You can laugh here,

779
00:54:30,440 --> 00:54:32,193
but you would've pissed yourself there.

780
00:54:32,560 --> 00:54:33,755
When the sun rose,

781
00:54:33,960 --> 00:54:35,679
we got into the Impala

782
00:54:35,880 --> 00:54:38,520
and drove all round the area.

783
00:54:39,040 --> 00:54:42,192
The earth had five new cracks

784
00:54:42,400 --> 00:54:44,312
and both seismometers

785
00:54:44,520 --> 00:54:47,115
showed a 6.2 Richter earthquake.

786
00:54:47,320 --> 00:54:49,710
But 200 meters away, it was again

787
00:54:49,920 --> 00:54:51,673
as if nothing had happened.

788
00:54:51,880 --> 00:54:53,200
We had to excavate to find out

789
00:54:53,440 --> 00:54:55,830
what was going on down there.

790
00:54:56,200 --> 00:54:58,237
There was no other way.

791
00:54:58,440 --> 00:55:01,114
You could've made a report to us.

792
00:55:01,320 --> 00:55:03,471
No, that wasn't an option.

793
00:55:03,640 --> 00:55:05,359
You'd have found out what was going on,

794
00:55:05,600 --> 00:55:06,600
we wouldn't have.

795
00:55:06,920 --> 00:55:09,276
The locals wouldn't have helped,

796
00:55:09,520 --> 00:55:11,637
and Babak didn't want anyone else.

797
00:55:11,800 --> 00:55:13,996
We brought workers from Bandar Abbas.

798
00:55:14,360 --> 00:55:16,477
When they heard the cemetery's name,

799
00:55:16,680 --> 00:55:18,717
they ran away.

800
00:55:19,680 --> 00:55:21,876
They wouldn't even talk to me.

801
00:55:24,160 --> 00:55:27,039
On the way back I met some Indians.

802
00:55:28,600 --> 00:55:29,920
They were musicians,

803
00:55:30,320 --> 00:55:32,437
they were just sitting around.

804
00:55:33,400 --> 00:55:34,400
They'd left India

805
00:55:34,600 --> 00:55:36,319
and were heading for Lebanon.

806
00:55:37,240 --> 00:55:38,276
They'd run out of money

807
00:55:38,520 --> 00:55:40,432
so they'd sold their instruments.

808
00:55:40,640 --> 00:55:42,438
They were stuck.

809
00:55:43,160 --> 00:55:46,153
I begged them and offered them money

810
00:55:46,320 --> 00:55:47,959
and they finally agreed.

811
00:55:48,160 --> 00:55:50,038
We boarded the ferry.

812
00:57:09,320 --> 00:57:10,320
This is the ship

813
00:57:10,520 --> 00:57:13,035
and this is the road you took here.

814
00:57:13,560 --> 00:57:15,995
I want your guys to dig here,

815
00:57:17,280 --> 00:57:18,634
here...

816
00:57:19,160 --> 00:57:20,799
and here.

817
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:25,995
And your guys will dig here and here.

818
00:57:27,320 --> 00:57:29,835
I want one person to dig over here.

819
00:57:36,920 --> 00:57:38,070
<i>As we left the port</i>

820
00:57:38,280 --> 00:57:40,431
<i>I could tell we were being watched.</i>

821
00:57:40,640 --> 00:57:41,756
<i>I didn't see anything,</i>

822
00:57:41,960 --> 00:57:43,633
<i>but I had a strange feeling.</i>

823
00:57:44,520 --> 00:57:47,877
<i>I thought someone was following us.</i>

824
00:57:49,840 --> 00:57:52,639
<i>I didn't see anyone when I turned round.</i>

825
00:57:53,360 --> 00:57:55,795
<i>I saw them when we got to the cemetery.</i>

826
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:58,560
<i>They were standing behind the cliffs</i>

827
00:57:58,760 --> 00:58:00,274
<i>and peering out.</i>

828
00:58:01,400 --> 00:58:03,437
<i>They were wearing jackets.</i>

829
00:58:03,600 --> 00:58:05,398
<i>Black jackets.</i>

830
00:58:05,880 --> 00:58:07,917
<i>One of them had a beard.</i>

831
00:58:08,320 --> 00:58:10,232
<i>His glasses reflected the light.</i>

832
00:58:10,440 --> 00:58:13,080
<i>When I looked again they were gone.</i>

833
00:58:15,480 --> 00:58:16,709
<i>They were there for a second</i>

834
00:58:16,960 --> 00:58:18,713
<i>and gone the next, like djinns.</i>

835
00:58:20,200 --> 00:58:22,920
<i>Then they'd appear somewhere else.</i>

836
00:58:23,400 --> 00:58:25,756
<i>I can't say how many there were.</i>

837
00:58:26,960 --> 00:58:28,599
<i>They were everywhere,</i>

838
00:58:29,680 --> 00:58:31,319
<i>and nowhere.</i>

839
00:58:31,960 --> 00:58:33,110
Behnam!

840
00:58:37,920 --> 00:58:39,832
- What is it?
- Come here.

841
00:58:44,200 --> 00:58:45,475
I'll mention a place,

842
00:58:45,720 --> 00:58:47,439
but don't look at it yet.

843
00:58:47,680 --> 00:58:49,080
In front of us, above the cliff,

844
00:58:49,280 --> 00:58:51,272
there's a crescent formation.

845
00:58:51,520 --> 00:58:54,080
Look at it but don't raise your head.

846
00:58:55,800 --> 00:58:56,836
What is it?

847
00:58:57,040 --> 00:59:00,556
- Can you see two people there?
- No.

848
00:59:01,160 --> 00:59:03,914
I think I saw two people there.

849
00:59:04,080 --> 00:59:06,037
Let's get a bit closer.

850
00:59:06,720 --> 00:59:10,157
Pretend we're having a lively discussion.

851
00:59:13,600 --> 00:59:15,796
Has the Agency got wind of it?

852
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:18,799
I doubt they could have this fast.

853
00:59:19,880 --> 00:59:21,633
But maybe Charaki...

854
00:59:21,840 --> 00:59:22,876
I saw someone.

855
00:59:23,080 --> 00:59:24,309
Is it him?

856
00:59:24,520 --> 00:59:26,193
I can't tell. He's too far away.

857
00:59:26,400 --> 00:59:27,754
A glint of eyeglasses, beard?

858
00:59:27,920 --> 00:59:30,196
He was wearing a jacket. I don't know.

859
00:59:33,800 --> 00:59:35,075
Maybe they were trailing me

860
00:59:35,280 --> 00:59:36,919
even before your arrival.

861
00:59:37,120 --> 00:59:38,918
The Hozvaresh Ring?

862
00:59:39,760 --> 00:59:41,717
There he is again!

863
00:59:43,080 --> 00:59:44,309
Charaki.

864
00:59:45,440 --> 00:59:46,874
Charaki is here.

865
00:59:58,720 --> 00:59:59,720
Hello.

866
00:59:59,920 --> 01:00:02,037
Where did you find these scrawny guys?

867
01:00:02,400 --> 01:00:03,993
Cold water!

868
01:00:04,200 --> 01:00:07,079
I've got cold water. Come over here!

869
01:00:07,320 --> 01:00:09,551
Hurry up and break this ice.

870
01:00:09,760 --> 01:00:10,876
Hello Charaki.

871
01:00:11,080 --> 01:00:13,800
I could have got workers for you.

872
01:00:15,400 --> 01:00:18,040
There are lots of unemployed men

873
01:00:18,200 --> 01:00:19,200
at the dock.

874
01:00:19,400 --> 01:00:22,438
The dock workers wouldn't come here.

875
01:00:22,920 --> 01:00:25,594
Anyway, I've brought you some cold water.

876
01:00:25,800 --> 01:00:28,076
Come drink some cool water.

877
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:30,434
Hurry up.

878
01:00:32,320 --> 01:00:34,755
Here's some cool water.

879
01:00:35,360 --> 01:00:37,556
It gets as hot as hell here.

880
01:00:41,200 --> 01:00:42,714
Wait.

881
01:00:50,680 --> 01:00:52,160
That's enough.

882
01:00:54,720 --> 01:00:56,598
Let the others drink, too.

883
01:00:58,280 --> 01:01:00,636
- Is Haddad in the ship?
- Yes.

884
01:01:02,280 --> 01:01:05,000
- What's he doing here?
- I don't know.

885
01:01:05,200 --> 01:01:06,953
And those two up there?

886
01:01:08,080 --> 01:01:10,151
Drink up and get to work.

887
01:01:10,360 --> 01:01:11,919
Go and see what he wants,

888
01:01:12,120 --> 01:01:13,998
I'll ask what these guys know.

889
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:18,469
Darshan, come here.

890
01:01:18,680 --> 01:01:20,637
Come drink some water.

891
01:01:21,400 --> 01:01:22,754
I already drank some.

892
01:01:22,960 --> 01:01:25,520
Don't be shy, come and drink.

893
01:01:25,720 --> 01:01:26,720
I'm not being shy.

894
01:01:26,920 --> 01:01:28,718
I was the first one to drink.

895
01:01:33,640 --> 01:01:35,871
Darshan!

896
01:01:38,080 --> 01:01:39,560
Someone get a rope,

897
01:01:39,760 --> 01:01:41,558
there's some behind the ship!

898
01:02:04,200 --> 01:02:05,680
Rope, rope!

899
01:02:09,160 --> 01:02:11,914
<i>They let me down on a rope.</i>

900
01:02:12,280 --> 01:02:13,714
<i>The deeper I went,</i>

901
01:02:14,840 --> 01:02:16,957
<i>the further I got from myself.</i>

902
01:02:21,000 --> 01:02:22,150
<i>I ended up not knowing</i>

903
01:02:22,320 --> 01:02:23,320
<i>where I was anymore.</i>

904
01:02:23,520 --> 01:02:26,513
<i>I'd have liked to stay there forever,</i>

905
01:02:26,680 --> 01:02:28,558
<i>in the darkness.</i>

906
01:02:28,880 --> 01:02:29,880
<i>I wanted to untie</i>

907
01:02:30,040 --> 01:02:31,997
<i>the rope around my waist</i>

908
01:02:32,400 --> 01:02:34,437
<i>when someone took my hand.</i>

909
01:02:35,840 --> 01:02:39,197
<i>He said, "Darshan, don't be scared.</i>

910
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:41,400
<i>I'm here."</i>

911
01:02:41,600 --> 01:02:43,796
<i>Then he hugged me tightly</i>

912
01:02:44,080 --> 01:02:45,080
<i>and pulled me out.</i>

913
01:02:45,400 --> 01:02:46,516
Pull him out.

914
01:02:51,880 --> 01:02:52,880
Careful.

915
01:02:53,040 --> 01:02:54,599
Fetch some water.

916
01:02:54,800 --> 01:02:55,800
Careful.

917
01:03:04,080 --> 01:03:05,150
Darshan?

918
01:03:46,880 --> 01:03:48,678
What does that mean?

919
01:03:49,200 --> 01:03:50,634
I saw a strange creature

920
01:03:50,840 --> 01:03:53,594
with scales as black as tar,

921
01:03:54,160 --> 01:03:57,870
and eyes red like fiery coal.

922
01:04:00,360 --> 01:04:02,192
He said this in German?

923
01:04:02,400 --> 01:04:03,629
He was in shock himself,

924
01:04:03,840 --> 01:04:05,320
like he couldn't understand

925
01:04:05,480 --> 01:04:06,480
what he was saying.

926
01:04:06,600 --> 01:04:08,671
It was like a tape recorder

927
01:04:08,920 --> 01:04:10,320
was playing someone's voice

928
01:04:10,520 --> 01:04:12,159
from within his body.

929
01:04:12,360 --> 01:04:14,477
I turned around

930
01:04:15,480 --> 01:04:17,995
and saw the workers talking to each other.

931
01:04:18,200 --> 01:04:20,112
They were scared.

932
01:04:20,320 --> 01:04:22,437
But I was even more scared

933
01:04:24,160 --> 01:04:25,355
because I could understand

934
01:04:25,600 --> 01:04:27,159
what they were saying.

935
01:04:27,360 --> 01:04:29,750
They were speaking in Urdu,

936
01:04:30,880 --> 01:04:32,155
and I could understand

937
01:04:32,320 --> 01:04:33,595
every word they said.

938
01:04:35,640 --> 01:04:38,109
As if under the ground,

939
01:04:38,360 --> 01:04:41,717
inside that well, something had shifted.

940
01:04:42,480 --> 01:04:44,199
Charaki came and introduced himself,

941
01:04:45,760 --> 01:04:48,229
saying he was Babak's colleague.

942
01:04:48,440 --> 01:04:50,591
He said he'd brought me some water.

943
01:04:50,800 --> 01:04:52,632
He handed me a small green flask

944
01:04:52,840 --> 01:04:54,593
and said it was cool water.

945
01:04:54,800 --> 01:04:56,678
I drank it,

946
01:04:58,000 --> 01:05:00,071
and asked how he'd found ice

947
01:05:00,240 --> 01:05:01,833
in this hellhole.

948
01:05:02,800 --> 01:05:04,951
He made a joke

949
01:05:06,480 --> 01:05:07,800
and said:

950
01:05:08,960 --> 01:05:10,189
"Just wait."

951
01:05:10,840 --> 01:05:13,912
"You haven't seen hell yet."

952
01:05:15,200 --> 01:05:18,193
Then he laughed and disappeared.

953
01:05:20,680 --> 01:05:22,239
I felt dizzy.

954
01:05:22,440 --> 01:05:25,080
I wanted to call the guys.

955
01:05:25,240 --> 01:05:27,596
Valieh felt like a huge stone in my arms.

956
01:05:27,800 --> 01:05:29,314
I couldn't get up.

957
01:05:30,240 --> 01:05:32,596
Then I saw myself standing at the door...

958
01:05:34,280 --> 01:05:35,475
calling Babak.

959
01:05:35,680 --> 01:05:38,240
I clearly remember, I called him twice.

960
01:05:40,840 --> 01:05:42,194
I thought, if it's me

961
01:05:42,400 --> 01:05:45,234
standing at the door and calling out,

962
01:05:45,440 --> 01:05:47,272
who's leaning against the wall

963
01:05:47,480 --> 01:05:49,073
and watching him?

964
01:05:49,600 --> 01:05:52,593
In the midst of this chaos I heard Haddad.

965
01:05:53,800 --> 01:05:55,314
He called my name.

966
01:05:55,840 --> 01:05:59,038
I turned around. There was no one there.

967
01:06:02,880 --> 01:06:05,520
I remember a wind was blowing,

968
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:08,560
or at least I could hear the wind.

969
01:06:09,600 --> 01:06:10,795
I heard him again.

970
01:06:12,840 --> 01:06:14,832
I walked towards the ship.

971
01:06:18,920 --> 01:06:21,071
When and how much did you drink?

972
01:06:22,520 --> 01:06:23,636
Water?

973
01:06:58,480 --> 01:06:59,960
Keyvan, what's wrong?

974
01:07:00,600 --> 01:07:01,829
Keyvan!

975
01:07:19,680 --> 01:07:21,034
Behnam!

976
01:07:28,920 --> 01:07:30,070
Behnam!

977
01:07:35,080 --> 01:07:37,640
Did you not see him?

978
01:07:41,280 --> 01:07:44,079
Did you not see our Sheikh?

979
01:07:46,440 --> 01:07:48,909
Did you not see our master?

980
01:07:52,480 --> 01:07:55,040
I can smell him but I cannot find him.

981
01:07:55,400 --> 01:07:56,470
Get up.

982
01:07:57,440 --> 01:07:58,669
Get up.

983
01:07:58,880 --> 01:08:00,109
Lift him up.

984
01:08:14,040 --> 01:08:16,111
Thank you, you can go.

985
01:08:25,880 --> 01:08:27,792
Would you like some water?

986
01:08:28,000 --> 01:08:29,514
Where is Valieh?

987
01:08:29,720 --> 01:08:31,200
- Who's Valieh?
- The baby.

988
01:08:31,360 --> 01:08:32,360
Don't worry. She's safe.

989
01:08:32,560 --> 01:08:34,199
I am worried. Where is she?

990
01:08:34,360 --> 01:08:36,352
- With her family.
- She has none.

991
01:08:36,560 --> 01:08:38,233
I'm her family.

992
01:08:38,440 --> 01:08:40,397
She's with her grandfather.

993
01:08:41,320 --> 01:08:43,198
With Almas?

994
01:08:44,560 --> 01:08:46,358
You took her to Almas?

995
01:08:46,560 --> 01:08:48,756
You gave her to Almas? You bastards!

996
01:08:48,960 --> 01:08:50,758
- How could you do that!
- Mr. Charaki.

997
01:08:50,960 --> 01:08:51,960
She's my child.

998
01:08:52,080 --> 01:08:53,434
Why did you give her to Almas?

999
01:08:53,600 --> 01:08:55,000
Let go of me!

1000
01:08:55,240 --> 01:08:59,200
You bastards, Charaki, you son of a bitch!

1001
01:09:01,440 --> 01:09:02,999
Where have you taken him?

1002
01:09:03,200 --> 01:09:05,431
Don't worry about that. Just answer me.

1003
01:09:07,720 --> 01:09:08,720
Where is Hafizi?

1004
01:09:09,880 --> 01:09:12,952
I ask the questions, you answer.

1005
01:09:13,560 --> 01:09:15,950
I won't say a thing until I see Hafizi.

1006
01:09:16,840 --> 01:09:18,320
Hafizi's already talked.

1007
01:09:18,480 --> 01:09:19,596
Now it's your turn.

1008
01:09:19,800 --> 01:09:23,271
Hafizi's talked? Play it back to me.

1009
01:09:31,120 --> 01:09:33,271
<i>I remember a wind was blowing,</i>

1010
01:09:33,480 --> 01:09:35,949
<i>or at least I could hear the wind.</i>

1011
01:09:36,520 --> 01:09:38,477
<i>I couldn't hear clearly.</i>

1012
01:09:39,120 --> 01:09:40,839
<i>I heard him again.</i>

1013
01:09:41,960 --> 01:09:43,758
<i>I walked towards the ship.</i>

1014
01:09:45,120 --> 01:09:47,840
<i>When and how much did you drink?</i>

1015
01:09:49,160 --> 01:09:50,310
<i>Water?</i>

1016
01:09:52,040 --> 01:09:54,953
<i>Jahangiri, forget about this stuff.</i>

1017
01:09:55,640 --> 01:09:57,040
<i>What was going on down there?</i>

1018
01:09:57,240 --> 01:10:00,199
I ask the questions and you answer them.

1019
01:10:00,920 --> 01:10:02,354
Saeed!

1020
01:10:04,200 --> 01:10:06,039
The interrogation breaks off here.

1021
01:10:06,240 --> 01:10:08,038
We listened to all the tapes

1022
01:10:08,280 --> 01:10:09,430
but found nothing.

1023
01:10:09,640 --> 01:10:10,915
We even went back to the

1024
01:10:11,160 --> 01:10:12,560
Anti-terror Committee's Archives,

1025
01:10:12,760 --> 01:10:14,672
thinking maybe we'd missed a tape.

1026
01:10:14,880 --> 01:10:16,997
But there was nothing.

1027
01:10:17,200 --> 01:10:20,477
The story would have remained open.

1028
01:10:21,760 --> 01:10:25,720
But an employee at the Archives

1029
01:10:25,920 --> 01:10:29,152
told one of my assistants

1030
01:10:29,400 --> 01:10:31,392
that Saeed Jahangiri was still alive.

1031
01:10:31,760 --> 01:10:34,195
I asked: "How can that be?"

1032
01:10:34,360 --> 01:10:37,114
He was an interrogator fifty years ago.

1033
01:10:37,600 --> 01:10:40,399
Then we found out he was born in 1943.

1034
01:10:40,600 --> 01:10:42,034
He'd been only 23 then.

1035
01:10:42,400 --> 01:10:45,837
Mr. Haghighi asked me to play myself.

1036
01:10:46,040 --> 01:10:48,680
I said I'm not an actor.

1037
01:10:48,880 --> 01:10:50,519
Back then I was twenty years old,

1038
01:10:50,840 --> 01:10:51,840
I was a kid!

1039
01:10:52,000 --> 01:10:53,673
After all, it's 50 years ago.

1040
01:10:54,760 --> 01:10:56,080
Mr. Haghighi said

1041
01:10:56,240 --> 01:10:58,277
that age wasn't an issue,

1042
01:10:58,480 --> 01:10:59,480
that I knew best

1043
01:10:59,640 --> 01:11:01,393
what had happened in that room.

1044
01:11:01,760 --> 01:11:03,194
The age of the interrogator

1045
01:11:03,400 --> 01:11:05,756
in the film wasn't important to me.

1046
01:11:05,960 --> 01:11:07,519
But having a real person

1047
01:11:07,720 --> 01:11:10,872
play himself fifty years later

1048
01:11:11,080 --> 01:11:12,833
was very appealing.

1049
01:11:13,200 --> 01:11:15,351
All I could do back then was let them know

1050
01:11:15,560 --> 01:11:17,153
that they were in danger:

1051
01:11:17,400 --> 01:11:19,153
they were being taken to their deaths.

1052
01:11:19,360 --> 01:11:21,875
I sadly couldn't help Mr. Haghighi.

1053
01:11:22,080 --> 01:11:24,072
I don't really know what happened next.

1054
01:11:24,240 --> 01:11:26,835
Perhaps Shahrzad Besharat knows.

1055
01:11:27,400 --> 01:11:29,278
Hozvaresh had five members.

1056
01:11:29,480 --> 01:11:30,596
One was Saeed Jahangiri,

1057
01:11:30,840 --> 01:11:32,718
who's still alive.

1058
01:11:32,880 --> 01:11:34,633
One was Babak Hafizi,

1059
01:11:34,800 --> 01:11:36,598
whose fate is unknown.

1060
01:11:37,240 --> 01:11:40,074
Two members were Isfahan agents.

1061
01:11:40,280 --> 01:11:42,749
They were Morudijan und Peyman Hariri.

1062
01:11:43,080 --> 01:11:45,675
But I believe the most important person

1063
01:11:45,880 --> 01:11:47,758
was Shahrzad Besharat.

1064
01:11:48,240 --> 01:11:52,075
She turned her back on politics

1065
01:11:52,280 --> 01:11:54,556
and worked in theater.

1066
01:11:56,160 --> 01:12:01,872
She worked with well-known directors.

1067
01:12:02,240 --> 01:12:04,994
In '67 and '68 I no longer had

1068
01:12:05,200 --> 01:12:07,920
a connection to the Agency.

1069
01:12:09,160 --> 01:12:11,994
I spent my time with theater people.

1070
01:12:12,200 --> 01:12:14,157
I was a stage assistant

1071
01:12:14,360 --> 01:12:17,671
and sometimes played small parts.

1072
01:12:18,640 --> 01:12:23,317
In '68, Abbas Nalbandian's play

1073
01:12:23,760 --> 01:12:28,551
won the National Radio and TV Award

1074
01:12:28,760 --> 01:12:31,355
for the best script.

1075
01:12:32,080 --> 01:12:34,197
The play's title was:

1076
01:12:34,520 --> 01:12:39,231
"A Deep, Vast and New Insight

1077
01:12:39,640 --> 01:12:40,960
into Fossils of

1078
01:12:41,120 --> 01:12:43,396
the 25th Geological Cycle."

1079
01:12:43,960 --> 01:12:46,350
On the opening night

1080
01:12:46,560 --> 01:12:48,199
everything changed for me.

1081
01:12:48,400 --> 01:12:50,676
There is a secret between you all.

1082
01:12:56,280 --> 01:12:59,034
Oh you thieves!

1083
01:13:00,560 --> 01:13:02,791
You have stolen his scent.

1084
01:13:03,040 --> 01:13:04,952
You have stolen a proud breeze

1085
01:13:05,160 --> 01:13:06,719
bearing his scent.

1086
01:13:06,920 --> 01:13:08,320
What are you saying?

1087
01:13:08,520 --> 01:13:10,671
Our patience is at an end!

1088
01:13:25,560 --> 01:13:27,711
We have packed our belongings.

1089
01:13:32,600 --> 01:13:35,240
Are you seeking someone?

1090
01:13:39,240 --> 01:13:41,994
You seem like an absolute stranger.

1091
01:13:45,120 --> 01:13:46,873
Are you seeking a woman?

1092
01:13:47,080 --> 01:13:50,471
How pained you look!

1093
01:13:50,680 --> 01:13:53,149
As if you haven't rested in months

1094
01:13:53,360 --> 01:13:55,591
in a woman's warm bed.

1095
01:14:09,080 --> 01:14:13,438
Fog fills and empties the stage.

1096
01:14:22,320 --> 01:14:27,634
<i>Oh trace of the holy One</i>

1097
01:14:28,000 --> 01:14:32,870
<i>Why do you flee from us?</i>

1098
01:14:33,080 --> 01:14:38,394
<i>You know the fate of your devotees</i>

1099
01:14:38,600 --> 01:14:42,879
<i>From the other world</i>

1100
01:14:43,880 --> 01:14:48,557
<i>For the sake of my warm tears</i>

1101
01:14:48,720 --> 01:14:53,715
<i>For the sake of my ashen face</i>

1102
01:14:56,440 --> 01:14:57,556
Behnam?

1103
01:14:58,480 --> 01:14:59,630
Hello.

1104
01:15:00,280 --> 01:15:03,159
Shahrzad, I have to tell you something.

1105
01:15:03,360 --> 01:15:04,760
Say nothing, ask nothing.

1106
01:15:04,960 --> 01:15:06,519
- Where is Keyvan?
- Listen to me.

1107
01:15:06,720 --> 01:15:08,632
I've found a way to leave Iran.

1108
01:15:08,840 --> 01:15:10,194
They're waiting for me below.

1109
01:15:10,360 --> 01:15:12,591
- Where is Keyvan?
- I know where he is.

1110
01:15:12,800 --> 01:15:14,120
I'll tell you,

1111
01:15:14,320 --> 01:15:15,754
but first you have to listen to me.

1112
01:15:15,960 --> 01:15:17,394
Tell Keyvan the following.

1113
01:15:17,560 --> 01:15:19,279
Will you listen?

1114
01:15:19,440 --> 01:15:21,477
Tell him everything's in Halimeh's grave.

1115
01:15:21,680 --> 01:15:23,080
- Meaning what?
- Do you understand?

1116
01:15:23,240 --> 01:15:24,240
Repeat it.

1117
01:15:24,440 --> 01:15:27,035
- Everything is in Halimeh's grave.
- Good.

1118
01:15:27,240 --> 01:15:28,879
What did you all do on Qeshm?

1119
01:15:29,200 --> 01:15:31,795
The less you know the better.

1120
01:15:32,160 --> 01:15:34,959
Keyvan is in Isfahan...

1121
01:15:35,160 --> 01:15:36,913
They might follow you. Be careful.

1122
01:15:37,120 --> 01:15:38,918
I'm crossing the border tomorrow.

1123
01:15:39,560 --> 01:15:41,199
Give me 24 hours.

1124
01:15:41,440 --> 01:15:42,635
Go to Isfahan tomorrow night.

1125
01:15:42,840 --> 01:15:43,990
Give Keyvan the message.

1126
01:15:44,840 --> 01:15:46,320
He'll follow you.

1127
01:15:46,520 --> 01:15:47,590
Repeat the sentence again.

1128
01:15:48,400 --> 01:15:49,993
Everything is in Halimeh's grave.

1129
01:16:52,480 --> 01:16:53,630
Behnam!

1130
01:16:56,480 --> 01:16:58,870
Hide it in Halimeh's grave!

1131
01:17:00,120 --> 01:17:01,998
A can of baby formula, please.

1132
01:17:08,200 --> 01:17:09,714
Excuse me.

1133
01:17:09,880 --> 01:17:11,758
You dropped this.

1134
01:17:18,160 --> 01:17:20,550
<i>Everything is in Halimeh's grave.</i>

1135
01:18:10,800 --> 01:18:12,598
<i>When he got back from Qeshm,</i>

1136
01:18:12,800 --> 01:18:14,075
<i>he visited me.</i>

1137
01:18:15,120 --> 01:18:17,680
<i>I'd waited for him for three years,</i>

1138
01:18:18,920 --> 01:18:21,196
<i>but now I didn't want to see him.</i>

1139
01:18:21,760 --> 01:18:24,036
<i>I was scared of him.</i>

1140
01:18:26,120 --> 01:18:29,113
<i>In the box that he had found</i>

1141
01:18:29,640 --> 01:18:32,155
<i>were some negatives.</i>

1142
01:18:32,680 --> 01:18:35,752
<i>He asked me if I could get him</i>

1143
01:18:35,960 --> 01:18:39,510
<i>the keys to the Golestan Studio.</i>

1144
01:18:40,680 --> 01:18:43,320
<i>He wanted to develop the negatives</i>

1145
01:18:43,520 --> 01:18:46,877
<i>in the darkroom there.</i>

1146
01:18:48,200 --> 01:18:52,114
<i>That was the last time I saw him.</i>

1147
01:18:55,520 --> 01:18:57,876
- Were you followed?
- No.

1148
01:18:59,240 --> 01:19:00,799
Are you going out?

1149
01:19:03,760 --> 01:19:05,160
What did Behnam say exactly?

1150
01:19:05,360 --> 01:19:06,360
I already told you.

1151
01:19:06,600 --> 01:19:08,751
He said everything is in Halimeh's grave.

1152
01:19:08,960 --> 01:19:10,280
Is that all?

1153
01:19:10,880 --> 01:19:12,872
There's nothing in this box.

1154
01:19:13,640 --> 01:19:15,472
The negatives are all destroyed,

1155
01:19:15,640 --> 01:19:17,359
the rest are just souvenir pictures.

1156
01:19:17,520 --> 01:19:19,716
- Take a look.
- I don't want to see.

1157
01:19:23,360 --> 01:19:25,477
A piece of bone,

1158
01:19:25,680 --> 01:19:27,080
"Paradise",

1159
01:19:28,120 --> 01:19:30,589
Behnam's notes are all destroyed.

1160
01:19:32,480 --> 01:19:34,711
What was I to find here?

1161
01:19:34,920 --> 01:19:37,071
He didn't want you to give up on the case.

1162
01:19:37,240 --> 01:19:39,277
You are to finish what he couldn't.

1163
01:19:41,960 --> 01:19:44,031
Did he tell you anything else?

1164
01:19:46,080 --> 01:19:48,834
Did he say what happened to us that night?

1165
01:19:49,080 --> 01:19:51,720
He said it's better I don't know.

1166
01:19:52,440 --> 01:19:53,874
Sit down a minute.

1167
01:19:54,040 --> 01:19:55,440
They're waiting for me.

1168
01:19:55,640 --> 01:19:56,756
Sit.

1169
01:20:15,080 --> 01:20:17,117
I don't want to know anything.

1170
01:20:18,160 --> 01:20:19,833
They arrested all of us,

1171
01:20:20,040 --> 01:20:21,360
harassed us.

1172
01:20:22,120 --> 01:20:24,589
Jahangiri is still in jail.

1173
01:20:24,760 --> 01:20:26,638
I didn't say a thing.

1174
01:20:27,160 --> 01:20:30,358
But now I want to go. I want to live.

1175
01:20:32,080 --> 01:20:34,311
Are you going so as to now live?

1176
01:20:38,680 --> 01:20:41,752
- Did you speak to your source?
- Yes.

1177
01:20:42,560 --> 01:20:45,120
He didn't know a thing about the cemetery,

1178
01:20:45,320 --> 01:20:47,073
except they'd excavated something

1179
01:20:47,280 --> 01:20:48,350
after you all left.

1180
01:20:48,600 --> 01:20:50,876
- What?
- He didn't know.

1181
01:20:51,080 --> 01:20:53,356
A living thing. A creature.

1182
01:20:53,920 --> 01:20:55,991
He asked me to tell you to leave it be.

1183
01:20:56,200 --> 01:20:58,317
You can't find out anything else...

1184
01:20:59,480 --> 01:21:01,597
you have no possibilities.

1185
01:21:01,800 --> 01:21:03,951
He said they're still after you.

1186
01:21:04,120 --> 01:21:06,191
Whatever you did there

1187
01:21:06,680 --> 01:21:08,353
is still a serious issue for them.

1188
01:21:09,160 --> 01:21:11,470
He showed me a thick file

1189
01:21:12,200 --> 01:21:14,192
on your activities at the cemetery.

1190
01:21:15,960 --> 01:21:18,156
He made an allusion.

1191
01:21:18,400 --> 01:21:21,040
They obviously knew of Behnam's escape.

1192
01:21:21,560 --> 01:21:23,358
He's in Europe.

1193
01:21:23,640 --> 01:21:26,200
He went to Aachen for a few days,

1194
01:21:27,440 --> 01:21:28,590
stayed with old schoolmates.

1195
01:21:28,800 --> 01:21:30,598
Then he disappeared again.

1196
01:21:32,160 --> 01:21:34,834
He just wanted to show he could escape.

1197
01:21:35,680 --> 01:21:37,080
My source says

1198
01:21:37,280 --> 01:21:39,237
you should pretend to escape.

1199
01:21:42,680 --> 01:21:44,478
I won't run away.

1200
01:21:46,040 --> 01:21:47,156
Write me a letter.

1201
01:21:47,480 --> 01:21:49,312
In your own handwriting.

1202
01:21:49,520 --> 01:21:51,830
They read my letters. All of them.

1203
01:21:52,720 --> 01:21:54,234
I'll find a way to have

1204
01:21:54,400 --> 01:21:55,675
it sent from abroad.

1205
01:21:57,280 --> 01:21:58,794
It's easy.

1206
01:21:59,000 --> 01:22:00,320
This way they'll read the letter

1207
01:22:00,520 --> 01:22:02,876
and think you've also escaped.

1208
01:22:03,240 --> 01:22:04,640
Shahrzad...

1209
01:22:05,760 --> 01:22:07,797
I want to be with you.

1210
01:22:09,640 --> 01:22:11,677
I won't write a letter.

1211
01:22:13,520 --> 01:22:14,520
What?

1212
01:22:15,000 --> 01:22:17,071
I didn't hear from you for three years!

1213
01:22:17,440 --> 01:22:19,113
Everyone thought you were dead.

1214
01:22:19,320 --> 01:22:20,959
They were looking for your corpse.

1215
01:22:21,320 --> 01:22:23,312
I've left you, Keyvan.

1216
01:22:23,520 --> 01:22:25,432
You need to understand this.

1217
01:22:25,640 --> 01:22:28,474
- Understand me.
- No, you understand me!

1218
01:22:32,640 --> 01:22:33,790
Very well.

1219
01:22:34,000 --> 01:22:35,354
There's paper there.

1220
01:22:35,560 --> 01:22:37,040
I'll put myself in your place.

1221
01:22:37,240 --> 01:22:38,720
Write.

1222
01:22:39,480 --> 01:22:42,200
April 5, 1969.

1223
01:22:44,040 --> 01:22:46,077
Dear Shahrzad. Hello.

1224
01:22:46,960 --> 01:22:48,872
I hope you're well.

1225
01:22:49,080 --> 01:22:50,833
- Write!
- I'll write it myself.

1226
01:22:57,760 --> 01:23:00,275
April 5, 1969.

1227
01:23:03,960 --> 01:23:05,713
Dear Shahrzad.

1228
01:23:07,080 --> 01:23:08,309
Hello.

1229
01:23:11,240 --> 01:23:13,391
I hope you're well.

1230
01:23:15,600 --> 01:23:18,513
I hope you're as radiant as your smile.

1231
01:23:20,520 --> 01:23:23,035
I hope your smile is like the one

1232
01:23:23,240 --> 01:23:25,357
I dreamt of for three long years.

1233
01:23:26,520 --> 01:23:29,194
This is the beginning of a penance for me.

1234
01:23:29,400 --> 01:23:31,198
I never got the chance...

1235
01:23:33,640 --> 01:23:35,916
Life didn't give me the chance

1236
01:23:36,120 --> 01:23:37,839
to say goodbye to you.

1237
01:23:38,040 --> 01:23:39,633
Face to face.

1238
01:23:44,440 --> 01:23:46,193
They didn't give me the chance

1239
01:23:46,400 --> 01:23:48,437
to embrace you,

1240
01:23:52,080 --> 01:23:54,959
to tuck your hair behind your ears,

1241
01:23:58,160 --> 01:23:59,958
to kiss you,

1242
01:24:04,560 --> 01:24:06,597
to look at you,

1243
01:24:07,560 --> 01:24:09,597
and say: "Shahrzad,

1244
01:24:12,800 --> 01:24:14,598
my dearest Shahrzad,

1245
01:24:18,200 --> 01:24:19,759
my love,

1246
01:24:21,760 --> 01:24:23,160
my lady,

1247
01:24:27,960 --> 01:24:29,713
I'm gone.

1248
01:24:31,120 --> 01:24:33,316
Gone, never to come back.

1249
01:24:36,400 --> 01:24:37,720
Goodbye."

1250
01:24:40,000 --> 01:24:41,070
Stop filming.

1251
01:24:41,280 --> 01:24:42,555
Or she'll kick us out.

1252
01:24:42,760 --> 01:24:45,150
Don't worry. We'll ask permission first.

1253
01:24:45,360 --> 01:24:48,876
- Ask her first.
- That's the doorbell.

1254
01:24:53,440 --> 01:24:54,440
<i>Hello?</i>

1255
01:24:54,640 --> 01:24:57,235
<i>- Mr. Haghighi sent us.
- Come in.</i>

1256
01:24:59,760 --> 01:25:01,240
The shoot

1257
01:25:01,440 --> 01:25:03,557
was interrupted for nine months

1258
01:25:03,760 --> 01:25:06,832
because Jahangiri and Shahrzad didn't know

1259
01:25:07,040 --> 01:25:09,271
what had become of those three.

1260
01:25:09,480 --> 01:25:12,791
I was stuck, not sure what to do.

1261
01:25:13,000 --> 01:25:14,878
Until one morning

1262
01:25:15,080 --> 01:25:17,914
when I was checking messages at work,

1263
01:25:18,120 --> 01:25:20,589
I heard a message from a woman

1264
01:25:20,800 --> 01:25:23,679
saying she knew we were making a movie

1265
01:25:24,040 --> 01:25:25,713
and that she could help us.

1266
01:25:25,920 --> 01:25:27,320
Back then we received

1267
01:25:27,480 --> 01:25:28,994
many messages like that,

1268
01:25:29,200 --> 01:25:31,396
so I didn't take it too seriously.

1269
01:25:31,600 --> 01:25:34,434
I sent my assistants to check it out.

1270
01:25:36,480 --> 01:25:38,631
I found this among my father's things.

1271
01:25:40,560 --> 01:25:43,314
There was a note on it saying

1272
01:25:43,480 --> 01:25:46,678
if anyone came asking about this affair,

1273
01:25:46,880 --> 01:25:48,473
I should hand it to them.

1274
01:25:48,920 --> 01:25:51,754
I read that you were making a movie

1275
01:25:52,000 --> 01:25:53,320
about three young men

1276
01:25:53,520 --> 01:25:57,434
doing research at a cemetery in 1964.

1277
01:25:58,320 --> 01:25:59,913
I thought this must be it.

1278
01:26:03,120 --> 01:26:05,680
- Your father...
- Keyvan Haddad.

1279
01:26:05,880 --> 01:26:07,519
But he didn't have a wife or kids.

1280
01:26:07,880 --> 01:26:09,280
We researched this.

1281
01:26:09,480 --> 01:26:11,711
No he didn't. My father never married.

1282
01:26:11,920 --> 01:26:13,274
He adopted me.

1283
01:26:14,080 --> 01:26:16,914
- So you must be Valieh?
- That's right.

1284
01:26:17,480 --> 01:26:19,437
- Did your father pass away?
- Yes...

1285
01:26:19,640 --> 01:26:21,120
in the '87 rocket attacks,

1286
01:26:21,280 --> 01:26:22,280
along with my son.

1287
01:26:26,680 --> 01:26:28,399
Here's the envelope.

1288
01:26:43,120 --> 01:26:44,395
<i>Testing.</i>

1289
01:26:45,960 --> 01:26:47,189
<i>One, two three...</i>

1290
01:26:48,520 --> 01:26:49,556
<i>Okay.</i>

1291
01:26:50,560 --> 01:26:51,835
<i>Tehran,</i>

1292
01:26:53,120 --> 01:26:55,635
<i>December 22, 1982,</i>

1293
01:26:56,760 --> 01:26:59,229
<i>3:45 pm.</i>

1294
01:27:00,320 --> 01:27:02,198
<i>I'm sitting in front of it.</i>

1295
01:27:02,440 --> 01:27:04,397
<i>I've loved silence all my life,</i>

1296
01:27:04,760 --> 01:27:06,638
<i>but I'm hoping for a sound now...</i>

1297
01:27:07,640 --> 01:27:09,916
<i>so you'll believe it exists.</i>

1298
01:27:11,440 --> 01:27:12,920
<i>Believe that it's in front</i>

1299
01:27:13,080 --> 01:27:14,080
<i>of me right now,</i>

1300
01:27:14,200 --> 01:27:16,032
<i>this old dragon.</i>

1301
01:27:17,160 --> 01:27:19,914
<i>I've been looking for it for 20 years.</i>

1302
01:27:20,280 --> 01:27:22,476
<i>I finally found it today.</i>

1303
01:27:22,680 --> 01:27:24,831
<i>In a dark cell, right here in Tehran.</i>

1304
01:27:25,720 --> 01:27:27,154
<i>Once it was able</i>

1305
01:27:27,360 --> 01:27:30,000
<i>to shake an entire cemetery,</i>

1306
01:27:30,200 --> 01:27:33,079
<i>crack the earth and spill out its guts.</i>

1307
01:27:33,280 --> 01:27:35,112
<i>I saw it with my own eyes.</i>

1308
01:27:35,440 --> 01:27:37,159
<i>But now it can't move.</i>

1309
01:27:37,360 --> 01:27:39,591
<i>Its breath is silent.</i>

1310
01:27:40,960 --> 01:27:43,429
<i>A huge snake that just looks at me.</i>

1311
01:27:43,840 --> 01:27:46,150
<i>It slowly blinks once in a while.</i>

1312
01:27:46,320 --> 01:27:48,277
<i>Too bad I don't have a gun.</i>

1313
01:27:49,720 --> 01:27:51,837
<i>I'd shoot five bullets in its head</i>

1314
01:27:52,040 --> 01:27:53,394
<i>and release it.</i>

1315
01:27:53,600 --> 01:27:56,195
<i>But all I have is this flimsy microphone.</i>

1316
01:27:56,400 --> 01:27:58,915
<i>You wouldn't even believe me</i>

1317
01:27:59,120 --> 01:28:01,396
<i>if it made a sound I could record.</i>

1318
01:28:01,600 --> 01:28:03,831
<i>Nor even if you were to see it.</i>

1319
01:28:04,040 --> 01:28:06,316
<i>You'd think you were dreaming.</i>

1320
01:28:06,880 --> 01:28:08,280
<i>Maybe I'm dreaming, too.</i>

1321
01:28:12,000 --> 01:28:14,993
<i>My problem is that I know.</i>

1322
01:28:15,160 --> 01:28:17,595
<i>I know I'm awake.</i>

1323
01:28:18,000 --> 01:28:20,640
<i>I know it's here in front of me</i>

1324
01:28:20,840 --> 01:28:23,355
<i>and I can only listen to its silence.</i>

1325
01:28:24,680 --> 01:28:26,717
<i>For God knows how long.</i>

1326
01:28:34,480 --> 01:28:36,949
There's nothing else on this side.

1327
01:28:37,160 --> 01:28:38,992
Just absolute silence.

1328
01:28:39,160 --> 01:28:42,073
But this is the B side,

1329
01:28:42,280 --> 01:28:45,432
and what you might not notice at first

1330
01:28:45,640 --> 01:28:46,835
is that it's labeled:

1331
01:28:47,360 --> 01:28:49,591
"He who turns me over

1332
01:28:49,760 --> 01:28:52,116
will know my secret."

1333
01:29:03,760 --> 01:29:05,592
<i>They separated us.</i>

1334
01:29:05,800 --> 01:29:08,793
<i>Took us separately to be interrogated.</i>

1335
01:29:09,000 --> 01:29:10,480
<i>Then they'd take us out again</i>

1336
01:29:10,840 --> 01:29:12,559
<i>and take another one in.</i>

1337
01:29:12,720 --> 01:29:15,792
<i>Suddenly Charaki came and said:</i>

1338
01:29:16,000 --> 01:29:18,117
<i>"We're to take you to Tehran."</i>

1339
01:29:19,080 --> 01:29:21,470
Jahangiri, forget about this stuff.

1340
01:29:21,680 --> 01:29:22,875
What was going on down there?

1341
01:29:23,240 --> 01:29:25,197
I ask the questions and you answer them.

1342
01:29:25,600 --> 01:29:26,875
Saeed!

1343
01:29:28,760 --> 01:29:30,592
- Don't ask questions.
- What do you mean?

1344
01:29:30,840 --> 01:29:32,513
- Listen.
- What's going on here?

1345
01:29:32,680 --> 01:29:33,680
It's serious.

1346
01:29:33,800 --> 01:29:35,519
They'll soon know who we are.

1347
01:29:35,720 --> 01:29:37,598
Excuse me, Major, orders from Tehran:

1348
01:29:37,800 --> 01:29:40,031
We transfer them immediately.

1349
01:29:40,240 --> 01:29:41,674
The ferry is waiting at the port.

1350
01:29:41,880 --> 01:29:42,880
Get up!

1351
01:29:43,040 --> 01:29:44,599
This is an interrogation room.

1352
01:29:44,760 --> 01:29:45,760
I'm working.

1353
01:29:46,040 --> 01:29:48,271
Orders from the head of the Agency.

1354
01:29:48,480 --> 01:29:50,312
Get up, Mr. Hafizi.

1355
01:29:51,040 --> 01:29:52,918
I'm talking to you! Get up!

1356
01:30:00,440 --> 01:30:02,557
I forgot my glasses in there.

1357
01:30:04,520 --> 01:30:06,830
He says he forgot his glasses in there.

1358
01:30:07,040 --> 01:30:09,396
Tell him to come in. He has to sign this.

1359
01:30:09,800 --> 01:30:10,916
Go in.

1360
01:30:18,840 --> 01:30:20,399
Sign this.

1361
01:30:27,720 --> 01:30:28,915
Sign here.

1362
01:35:55,800 --> 01:35:56,916
What's he saying?

1363
01:36:01,280 --> 01:36:03,749
He says we left something behind.

1364
01:36:03,960 --> 01:36:05,155
What?

1365
01:36:13,320 --> 01:36:14,834
Valieh!

1366
01:36:16,520 --> 01:36:17,590
We have to go back!

1367
01:36:17,800 --> 01:36:19,757
We left Valieh behind!

1368
01:36:56,960 --> 01:36:58,519
Should I go?

1369
01:36:59,960 --> 01:37:01,076
I'll go.

1370
01:37:01,520 --> 01:37:02,520
Give it to me.

1371
01:38:08,440 --> 01:38:10,955
You got my message.

1372
01:38:11,200 --> 01:38:12,200
I was waiting for you.

1373
01:38:14,080 --> 01:38:16,072
Give me the gun and take the baby.

1374
01:39:03,600 --> 01:39:05,512
<i>She gave me her granddaughter</i>

1375
01:39:05,720 --> 01:39:06,949
<i>and took Babak's gun.</i>

1376
01:39:08,320 --> 01:39:10,437
<i>She fired five bullets</i>

1377
01:39:11,640 --> 01:39:13,313
<i>and killed Almas in his sleep.</i>

1378
01:39:15,320 --> 01:39:16,320
<i>I never found out</i>

1379
01:39:16,520 --> 01:39:18,671
<i>what she did with the sixth bullet.</i>

1380
01:39:20,960 --> 01:39:23,316
<i>When I got in the car, Behnam said:</i>

1381
01:39:24,000 --> 01:39:25,320
<i>"He's gone."</i>

1382
01:39:27,120 --> 01:39:29,112
<i>I turned around.</i>

1383
01:39:30,640 --> 01:39:32,711
<i>Babak was dead.</i>

1384
01:39:34,200 --> 01:39:36,476
<i>His eyes were still open.</i>

1385
01:39:37,960 --> 01:39:40,429
<i>They shone in the light of the fire.</i>

1386
01:39:42,720 --> 01:39:44,837
<i>There was no time to bury him.</i>

1387
01:39:49,000 --> 01:39:50,992
<i>We drove to the gulf.</i>
