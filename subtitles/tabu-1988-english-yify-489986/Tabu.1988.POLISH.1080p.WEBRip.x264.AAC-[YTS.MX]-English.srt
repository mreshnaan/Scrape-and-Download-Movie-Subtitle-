tore my chest apart.</i>

00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,100
<i>You!</i>

7
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:48,560
<i>Never looked towards me
when I desired to meet you.</i>

8
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:52,780
<i>Now!</i>

00:00:54,560 --> 00:00:56,168
<i>I don't want to know you</i>

10

<i>or to meet you,</i>

11

Let me try.

28
00:04:58,120 --> 00:05:00,130
You're too big for such games.

29
00:05:04,879 --> 00:05:06,439
I'm not too big.

30
00:06:05,839 --> 00:06:08,500
Go home. Your mother is probably waiting.

31
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:10,100
Hurry up!

32
00:06:27,199 --> 00:06:29,560
It's a very old coin.

33
00:06:30,839 --> 00:06:32,339
I found it one day.

34
00:06:34,879 --> 00:06:36,379
Take it, Milka.

35
00:07:10,319 --> 00:07:12,079
Why are you back so late?

36
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:15,997
I was about to go look for you.

37
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:24,001
Get some bread and butter
from the cupboard.

38
00:07:29,319 --> 00:07:30,994
What's that in your hand?

39
00:07:36,759 --> 00:07:38,259
Show me.

40
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:43,620
Very well.

41
00:07:45,279 --> 00:07:46,779
Go to bed.

42
00:08:43,759 --> 00:08:46,639
You're so big.

43
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:50,620
<i>Oh, Lord!</i>

44
00:08:51,559 --> 00:08:55,440
<i>It feels like a sharp thorn
is hurting my heart.</i>

45
00:08:56,639 --> 00:08:58,279
<i>Remove it, oh Lord.</i>

46
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:01,049
<i>Don't lead me to suffering.</i>

47
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:05,082
<i>Protect me, so I don't have to
burn with shame.</i>

48
00:09:05,919 --> 00:09:07,519
<i>Enlighten me, oh Lord.</i>

49
00:09:23,559 --> 00:09:25,279
It's good that it rains.

50
00:09:27,679 --> 00:09:29,179
Rain rinses the earth,

51
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:31,820
cleans it.

52
00:09:35,919 --> 00:09:37,419
If there was no rain

53
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:40,039
there would be no sun.

54
00:09:44,759 --> 00:09:47,200
Everything's connected.

55
00:09:49,799 --> 00:09:51,299
One thing

56
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:53,620
depends on the other.

57
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:19,986
Did you have time to tell your mother?

58
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:21,700
No, I didn't.

59
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:28,559
Mother sends me.
- Mother!

60
00:10:29,799 --> 00:10:31,299
Are you sure?

61
00:10:34,159 --> 00:10:36,638
She doesn't know what to do with hay.

62
00:10:37,919 --> 00:10:39,862
It'll rot with all that rain.

63
00:10:40,759 --> 00:10:43,171
Nothing we can do. We can't haul it.

64
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,559
We have to wait.

65
00:10:53,519 --> 00:10:55,529
Why don't you repair the roof?

66
00:10:58,519 --> 00:11:01,559
Rain doesn't fall in, sun doesn't burn.

67
00:11:07,240 --> 00:11:08,740
Rain does fall in.

68
00:11:28,919 --> 00:11:30,419
Take it, Milka.

69
00:11:36,039 --> 00:11:37,539
It's pretty.

70
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:01,795
What are you waiting for?

71
00:12:01,919 --> 00:12:04,331
I'll wait. Maybe it'll stop raining.

72
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:07,820
It won't.

73
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:12,661
Who do you make it for?

74
00:12:14,759 --> 00:12:16,259
For sale.

75
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:22,220
Can I stay here until it stops
raining so I don't get wet?

76
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:23,820
You can't.

77
00:12:29,759 --> 00:12:31,259
So I'm going.

78
00:13:09,519 --> 00:13:11,019
Why are you mad?

79
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:14,580
I long for my father.

80
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:19,240
Your father rests in peace.

81
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:21,020
Don't be sad.

82
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:22,620
It won't do any good.

83
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:25,919
Such end awaits us all.

84
00:14:48,399 --> 00:14:49,899
You can do it.

85
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:52,100
If you want to.

86
00:15:02,759 --> 00:15:04,501
You don't like me anymore?

87
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:36,860
Milka!

88
00:15:37,679 --> 00:15:39,240
Come to dinner!

89
00:16:07,039 --> 00:16:08,539
Wait.

90
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:11,980
I will be your wife.

91
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:14,661
I care for no one else.

92
00:16:15,279 --> 00:16:18,279
You're still so young. You have time.

93
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:21,786
You will meet another man. A good man.

94
00:16:23,480 --> 00:16:26,900
I don't want you. I want to
keep living without a wife.

95
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,608
That suits me perfectly.

96
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:36,240
<i>My chest is on fire
which cannot be doused.</i>

97
00:16:37,919 --> 00:16:40,264
<i>I shall not ask it to stop burning.</i>

98
00:16:41,879 --> 00:16:43,220
<i>Oh, Lord...</i>

99
00:16:43,320 --> 00:16:45,600
<i>please let it burn.</i>

100
00:17:52,279 --> 00:17:53,880
Goodbye.

101
00:18:15,079 --> 00:18:18,119
Milka! Try on your dress.

102
00:18:29,599 --> 00:18:31,960
Take a walk.

103
00:18:39,079 --> 00:18:40,579
You are very pretty.

104
00:18:43,480 --> 00:18:45,691
Maybe I shouldn't be saying that.

105
00:18:47,759 --> 00:18:50,238
Take it off. It still needs altering.

106
00:18:51,640 --> 00:18:54,240
You'll wear it in the spring.

107
00:20:50,319 --> 00:20:54,406
Krystian, take back the buggy
and say thank you on our behalf.

108
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:56,220
May I go with him?

109
00:20:56,920 --> 00:20:58,420
You may.

110
00:20:58,599 --> 00:21:01,145
Just be careful not to soil the dress.

111
00:21:21,079 --> 00:21:23,440
If you were my little daughter.

112
00:21:26,039 --> 00:21:27,982
I'd make you a pretty cradle.

113
00:21:29,920 --> 00:21:31,680
I'd keep you warm.

114
00:21:34,279 --> 00:21:35,779
Rock you to sleep,

115
00:21:36,440 --> 00:21:37,940
sing you songs.

116
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:42,460
You'd be happy.

117
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:48,182
Someone would remember me.

118
00:21:50,319 --> 00:21:51,839
Even after I'm gone.

119
00:21:53,759 --> 00:21:56,359
I will never love anyone but you.

120
00:22:57,680 --> 00:22:59,180
Come.

121
00:23:07,559 --> 00:23:09,059
It's time for you.

122
00:23:11,039 --> 00:23:12,539
Leave.

123
00:23:54,759 --> 00:23:56,501
I'll leave the meadow now.

124
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:59,345
I'll make you two something to eat.

125
00:24:22,440 --> 00:24:23,940
Milka!

126
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:28,742
Don't you like me anymore?

127
00:24:33,799 --> 00:24:35,299
I love you.

128
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:55,799
I've talked to Krystian.

129
00:25:56,839 --> 00:25:59,251
He'll help us renovate the new room.

130
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:02,220
And you know what?

131
00:26:03,880 --> 00:26:06,091
He doesn't want any money for it.

132
00:26:09,279 --> 00:26:11,155
Will I get a room of my own?

133
00:26:13,640 --> 00:26:15,140
You will.

134
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:13,544
Till the renovations are over...

135
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:25,091
Krystian will be staying with us.

136
00:27:25,680 --> 00:27:28,092
No need for him to walk all this way

137
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:30,730
just to return in the morning.

138
00:28:31,319 --> 00:28:32,839
Can I live here?

139
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:37,380
Not just yet.

140
00:28:42,359 --> 00:28:43,859
There is still time.

141
00:28:52,119 --> 00:28:54,200
Maybe you'll move in next year?

142
00:29:21,880 --> 00:29:24,640
You aren't the town's

143
00:29:25,279 --> 00:29:26,779
organist anymore?

144
00:29:27,279 --> 00:29:28,779
No.

145
00:29:29,480 --> 00:29:31,691
After my wife died, I quit my job

146
00:29:32,519 --> 00:29:34,998
and came back here where I come from.

147
00:29:47,920 --> 00:29:50,265
Krystian brought the rocking chair.

148
00:29:50,599 --> 00:29:52,480
He was repairing it for you?

149
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:55,119
I've made it. It's brand new.

150
00:29:57,200 --> 00:29:59,344
And I'll be the first to try it.

151
00:30:05,240 --> 00:30:06,740
Is it comfortable?

152
00:30:07,920 --> 00:30:09,420
Can I try?

153
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:26,880
You brought the chair

154
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,144
and now it's time for you to go.

155
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:33,707
I have a matter to discuss with the lady.

156
00:30:55,440 --> 00:30:56,940
I will think about it.

157
00:30:57,440 --> 00:30:59,584
It's hard to decide on the spot.

158
00:31:00,920 --> 00:31:02,620
I'll give you my answer in a month.

159
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:05,739
Such an important step
must be considered properly.

160
00:31:05,839 --> 00:31:07,759
I'll be waiting impatiently.

161
00:31:09,319 --> 00:31:12,359
I hope I'll find your answer satisfying.

162
00:31:13,640 --> 00:31:15,315
If the good Lord permits!

163
00:31:18,400 --> 00:31:19,900
Milka,

164
00:31:20,440 --> 00:31:23,455
what would you say
if I was to be your father?

165
00:31:27,039 --> 00:31:28,920
Goodbye, sir.

166
00:32:30,200 --> 00:32:32,720
It's late.

167
00:32:33,680 --> 00:32:35,180
Not that late.

168
00:32:41,759 --> 00:32:44,104
Mother was angry with the organist.

169
00:32:45,119 --> 00:32:46,619
Don't talk about it.

170
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:50,700
Come to see us.

171
00:32:51,319 --> 00:32:52,819
I will, I will.

172
00:32:54,799 --> 00:32:58,160
Your mother wants
to thank me for the chair.

173
00:32:59,240 --> 00:33:00,740
It is beautiful.

174
00:33:05,519 --> 00:33:07,880
I've made it for you.

175
00:33:39,359 --> 00:33:40,859
I love you.

176
00:33:45,240 --> 00:33:46,740
I!

177
00:33:47,559 --> 00:33:49,059
!love you, too.

178
00:33:56,839 --> 00:33:59,160
Aren't you cold?

179
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:26,960
I know you want it.

180
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:28,940
And you don't?

181
00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:36,480
I can! handle it.

182
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:40,780
I won't die from it.

183
00:34:59,360 --> 00:35:01,800
You've been gone a long time.

184
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:05,820
He is not angry.

185
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:11,770
He'll come to see us tomorrow.

186
00:35:12,719 --> 00:35:14,219
See?

187
00:35:14,679 --> 00:35:16,179
He is a good man.

188
00:35:18,920 --> 00:35:20,800
Better than the organist.

189
00:38:10,039 --> 00:38:11,539
<i>Oh, Lord!</i>

190
00:38:13,239 --> 00:38:14,840
<i>Protect me from evil.</i>

191
00:38:16,519 --> 00:38:18,119
<i>You can do it,</i>

192
00:38:18,559 --> 00:38:21,574
<i>for everything happens
according to your will.</i>

193
00:39:09,159 --> 00:39:11,960
Maybe I'll get married soon.

194
00:39:13,679 --> 00:39:15,559
Maybe we'll have a baby.

195
00:39:17,559 --> 00:39:19,059
A brother for you.

196
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:26,665
You're thinking about the organist?

197
00:39:28,039 --> 00:39:30,519
No. I won't be accepting him.

198
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:34,008
I'll get someone better.

199
00:39:37,119 --> 00:39:39,464
Though only God knows if I get him.

200
00:40:20,199 --> 00:40:21,699
So, Mila...

201
00:40:22,039 --> 00:40:24,786
I hear you will have a new father, right?

202
00:40:26,760 --> 00:40:30,199
One has to admit that
he is an honorable man.

203
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:34,300
You're pretty.

204
00:40:34,920 --> 00:40:38,806
Mum doesn't care about the organist.
- Of course, she does.

205
00:40:38,960 --> 00:40:41,480
She doesn't! He's so old!

206
00:40:45,719 --> 00:40:47,219
Milka!

207
00:40:49,199 --> 00:40:50,699
Milka!

208
00:41:09,400 --> 00:41:11,360
Mother, the organist!

209
00:41:13,639 --> 00:41:15,599
I'd rather he stopped coming.

210
00:41:38,599 --> 00:41:41,239
Did you consider my proposal?

211
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:45,423
I did, indeed.

212
00:41:46,023 --> 00:41:47,523
But what of it?

213
00:41:48,119 --> 00:41:49,920
You think you can have me?

214
00:41:51,559 --> 00:41:53,059
I may be wrong but

215
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:56,345
you're at such an age that it's not

216
00:41:56,760 --> 00:41:58,971
necessary for you to have a wife.

217
00:41:59,480 --> 00:42:02,440
And my heart lacks feelings

218
00:42:02,559 --> 00:42:04,502
your future wife should have.

219
00:42:06,079 --> 00:42:09,920
You must think that since
my husband died long ago

220
00:42:10,519 --> 00:42:12,462
you'll seize the opportunity,

221
00:42:13,519 --> 00:42:15,462
for I must be desiring a man.

222
00:42:17,920 --> 00:42:20,440
Be it as it may, I don't want you.

223
00:42:22,039 --> 00:42:24,180
And if I'm being frank, I doubt

224
00:42:24,280 --> 00:42:26,692
you will find a woman who wants you.

225
00:43:02,239 --> 00:43:04,260
Maybe someone will push me away

226
00:43:04,360 --> 00:43:06,639
just like I turned him down?

227
00:43:24,320 --> 00:43:25,820
Who would you want?

228
00:43:29,719 --> 00:43:31,219
I'll tell you later.

229
00:43:33,360 --> 00:43:35,571
If God allows and if he wants me.

230
00:43:38,920 --> 00:43:41,079
It all depends on him.

231
00:43:49,800 --> 00:43:53,016
Who would remember about us
if it wasn't for you.

232
00:43:53,280 --> 00:43:56,360
All the others come wanting something.

233
00:43:57,800 --> 00:44:00,740
You're the only one who comes
as a true friend.

234
00:44:00,840 --> 00:44:03,119
But I want something, too.

235
00:45:21,079 --> 00:45:22,579
Very soon!

236
00:45:25,039 --> 00:45:26,580
You will have a father.

237
00:45:37,760 --> 00:45:39,260
Mila!

238
00:45:46,880 --> 00:45:48,622
You're thinking about him?

239
00:45:49,199 --> 00:45:50,699
Yes.

240
00:45:51,480 --> 00:45:52,980
Who would be better?

241
00:46:21,840 --> 00:46:23,480
Milka, what's wrong?

242
00:46:25,599 --> 00:46:27,877
Something happened to your mother?

243
00:46:36,599 --> 00:46:38,099
Don't you like me?

244
00:46:40,239 --> 00:46:42,280
Why are you turning me down?

245
00:46:43,440 --> 00:46:45,159
I am not.

246
00:46:46,159 --> 00:46:47,659
I am all yours.

247
00:46:55,960 --> 00:46:58,305
And yet, you're marrying my mother.

248
00:47:05,079 --> 00:47:06,579
Marry me.

249
00:47:33,679 --> 00:47:35,179
Mila,

250
00:47:36,480 --> 00:47:38,139
do you still have that silver coin

251
00:47:38,239 --> 00:47:40,360
I gave you? You didn't lose it?

252
00:47:40,559 --> 00:47:42,059
No.

253
00:47:44,880 --> 00:47:46,380
You'll put it inside

254
00:47:47,840 --> 00:47:49,539
and push the halves together

255
00:47:49,639 --> 00:47:51,840
so they close.

256
00:47:51,960 --> 00:47:54,037
And they will never open again.

257
00:47:55,480 --> 00:47:56,980
And inside,

258
00:47:57,239 --> 00:47:59,119
there will be your coin.

259
00:49:04,639 --> 00:49:06,139
What's inside?

260
00:49:08,519 --> 00:49:10,019
I don't know.

261
00:49:11,480 --> 00:49:13,356
The sphere cannot be opened.

262
00:49:22,960 --> 00:49:24,460
Maybe he'll tell me.

263
00:50:19,639 --> 00:50:21,139
I just hope!

264
00:50:21,800 --> 00:50:23,944
That nothing bad happens to him.

265
00:50:35,280 --> 00:50:36,800
Go there and see.

266
00:50:39,199 --> 00:50:40,699
Tell him to come.

267
00:50:42,639 --> 00:50:44,139
I have to talk to him.

268
00:50:47,519 --> 00:50:49,019
Wait.

269
00:51:02,840 --> 00:51:04,340
I'll come with you.

270
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:12,459
Good morning.

271
00:51:12,559 --> 00:51:14,059
I don't see you often.

272
00:51:15,360 --> 00:51:17,236
There's always so much work.

273
00:51:18,199 --> 00:51:20,000
Where are you rushing to?

274
00:51:21,559 --> 00:51:23,301
To the end of the village.

275
00:51:23,880 --> 00:51:26,024
I have a matter to attend there.

276
00:51:26,280 --> 00:51:29,400
Come to see us on your way back.

277
00:51:29,519 --> 00:51:32,139
Milka, come here,
I'll show you something.

278
00:51:32,239 --> 00:51:33,739
I don't have time.

279
00:51:34,480 --> 00:51:37,440
You could go. He's an adult now.

280
00:51:38,920 --> 00:51:42,199
He fancies you. You'd have a good boy.

281
00:52:27,480 --> 00:52:28,980
So!

282
00:52:30,239 --> 00:52:31,739
He left us?

283
00:52:43,440 --> 00:52:44,940
Abandoned us?

284
00:52:45,480 --> 00:52:46,980
Us?

285
00:53:21,239 --> 00:53:23,000
We have each other, Mila.

286
00:53:27,199 --> 00:53:28,699
That's just the way

287
00:53:30,199 --> 00:53:31,699
it should be.

288
00:53:37,280 --> 00:53:39,239
Maybe only the body is weak

289
00:53:40,159 --> 00:53:42,000
and misses him.

290
00:53:44,360 --> 00:53:46,236
Maybe only the body is weak.

291
00:53:47,400 --> 00:53:50,750
But God gives strength
so the soul would be mighty.

292
00:53:51,079 --> 00:53:52,840
So it could fight.

293
00:53:57,000 --> 00:53:58,760
Maybe God knows!

294
00:53:59,280 --> 00:54:00,780
What we

295
00:54:01,760 --> 00:54:03,760
cannot comprehend.

296
00:54:23,960 --> 00:54:25,960
Milka, child!

297
00:54:26,519 --> 00:54:28,019
Wait!

298
00:54:29,079 --> 00:54:30,579
We'll talk.

299
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:33,599
God be with you, child.

300
00:54:35,400 --> 00:54:37,209
How is your mother feeling?

301
00:54:37,840 --> 00:54:39,340
How is she?

302
00:54:39,719 --> 00:54:41,219
She is fine.

303
00:54:41,559 --> 00:54:43,059
I see.

304
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:45,809
Maybe she wants me to come?

305
00:54:48,599 --> 00:54:50,099
That's the way it is.

306
00:54:50,559 --> 00:54:52,059
Yes.

307
00:54:53,280 --> 00:54:55,159
You're an adult woman now.

308
00:54:56,400 --> 00:54:58,276
Give my best to your mother.

309
00:55:01,920 --> 00:55:03,420
Remember!

310
00:55:03,920 --> 00:55:05,420
Give my best to her!

311
00:55:07,199 --> 00:55:08,699
Milka!

312
00:55:09,639 --> 00:55:11,139
My little miss.

313
00:55:16,079 --> 00:55:17,800
God punished me

314
00:55:19,800 --> 00:55:21,810
for I was bad to the organist.

315
00:55:24,159 --> 00:55:25,901
But how am I supposed to!?

316
00:55:27,159 --> 00:55:29,239
He is over sixty.

317
00:55:31,280 --> 00:55:32,880
And I'm not even forty.

318
00:55:35,199 --> 00:55:37,142
How could I have married him?

319
00:55:40,280 --> 00:55:42,480
Tell me, Mila.

320
00:55:43,280 --> 00:55:45,156
Did I make the wrong choice?

321
00:55:48,599 --> 00:55:50,099
No.

322
00:55:53,760 --> 00:55:55,760
I wouldn't take him either.

323
00:55:58,719 --> 00:56:00,719
How strange is human life.

324
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:04,809
You want to do a good thing

325
00:56:08,199 --> 00:56:10,159
and it turns out to be bad.

326
00:56:12,719 --> 00:56:14,059
Sometimes!

327
00:56:14,159 --> 00:56:17,308
A shard of happiness
comes over you unexpectedly

328
00:56:18,480 --> 00:56:21,320
but fate takes it away so fast!

329
00:56:24,880 --> 00:56:27,694
When your father walked
through the village

330
00:56:28,880 --> 00:56:32,840
the girls blushed,
happy that he looked at them.

331
00:56:34,599 --> 00:56:36,099
And I!

332
00:56:36,760 --> 00:56:39,800
Became his without even trying.

333
00:56:41,719 --> 00:56:43,219
But was it for long?

334
00:56:44,239 --> 00:56:45,739
Death took him

335
00:56:47,360 --> 00:56:48,860
so unexpectedly.

336
00:56:51,880 --> 00:56:53,380
He was a good man,

337
00:56:54,480 --> 00:56:57,227
though maybe not as good
as the other one.

338
00:56:58,960 --> 00:57:01,238
Forgive me God for saying that but

339
00:57:02,239 --> 00:57:04,852
apparently there wasn't enough sadness.

340
00:57:06,360 --> 00:57:09,174
And this pain occurs now
to even the score.

341
00:57:12,039 --> 00:57:14,250
Strange is the human heart, Mila.

342
00:57:16,079 --> 00:57:17,579
Just when you think

343
00:57:18,400 --> 00:57:20,209
that it's already fulfilled

344
00:57:21,840 --> 00:57:24,320
it keeps desiring

345
00:57:25,719 --> 00:57:27,320
and is never done.

346
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:34,546
It's hard to foresee God's judgements.

347
00:57:37,719 --> 00:57:39,400
For God is judging us.

348
00:57:42,679 --> 00:57:46,079
He weighs the good against the evil.

349
00:57:50,039 --> 00:57:51,539
And nothing

350
00:57:54,599 --> 00:57:56,140
can be hidden from him.

351
00:58:12,199 --> 00:58:15,214
I came to ask if you
need help with haymaking.

352
00:58:38,440 --> 00:58:40,383
Why didn't you invite him in?

353
00:58:42,719 --> 00:58:44,219
Mila?

354
00:58:45,679 --> 00:58:48,225
Can't you see the way he looks at you?

355
00:58:49,440 --> 00:58:50,960
I don't care for him.

356
00:59:07,119 --> 00:59:08,619
Mila...

357
00:59:09,400 --> 00:59:11,119
Oh, Mila... I love you.

358
00:59:12,320 --> 00:59:13,840
Why are you like this?

359
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:17,059
I will marry you.
You won't find anyone better.

360
00:59:17,159 --> 00:59:19,638
Idiot! Let go or I'll call my mother.

361
00:59:29,000 --> 00:59:30,500
Mila!

362
00:59:32,320 --> 00:59:33,820
Milka!

363
00:59:57,480 --> 00:59:58,980
Milka...

364
01:00:01,599 --> 01:00:03,475
Why is your belly like that?

365
01:00:07,000 --> 01:00:08,500
Milka,

366
01:00:09,880 --> 01:00:11,380
who were you with?

367
01:00:12,119 --> 01:00:13,619
I'm not blind.

368
01:00:15,480 --> 01:00:16,980
Milka!

369
01:00:20,360 --> 01:00:21,860
But that's just

370
01:00:22,039 --> 01:00:23,539
impossible!

371
01:00:25,519 --> 01:00:27,639
She didn't have anyone.

372
01:00:28,760 --> 01:00:31,480
She didn't have anyone apart from him.

373
01:00:33,280 --> 01:00:34,780
Maybe!

374
01:00:36,280 --> 01:00:38,860
Maybe it was Stefek who slept with you.

375
01:00:38,960 --> 01:00:40,460
Or maybe Krystian.

376
01:00:43,199 --> 01:00:47,000
How is it possible that you! Milka?

377
01:00:47,679 --> 01:00:49,179
Milka,

378
01:00:49,360 --> 01:00:51,320
you're with child!

379
01:00:52,199 --> 01:00:54,519
Who were you with?

380
01:00:55,679 --> 01:00:57,179
I was with no one.

381
01:00:58,840 --> 01:01:00,340
Tell me!

382
01:01:00,760 --> 01:01:02,260
Tell me!

383
01:01:03,360 --> 01:01:06,320
Did you lie with him?

384
01:01:07,159 --> 01:01:09,159
Did you and him! Tell me!

385
01:01:11,159 --> 01:01:13,039
You visited Krystian often!

386
01:01:14,239 --> 01:01:15,920
What did you do there?

387
01:01:16,280 --> 01:01:18,519
Tell me. Tell me!

388
01:01:19,039 --> 01:01:20,780
What are you thinking about?

389
01:01:20,880 --> 01:01:23,320
Tell me you didn't do anything!

390
01:01:23,559 --> 01:01:25,960
Tell me you didn't!

391
01:01:26,440 --> 01:01:28,584
With Krystian. What is it about?

392
01:01:48,760 --> 01:01:51,239
You gave yourself to him, didn't you?

393
01:01:52,599 --> 01:01:54,099
You got undressed.

394
01:01:56,079 --> 01:01:57,579
Right?

395
01:01:58,960 --> 01:02:01,760
You spread your legs and gave!

396
01:02:06,039 --> 01:02:07,539
Milka!

397
01:02:13,400 --> 01:02:14,900
My Milka!

398
01:02:16,400 --> 01:02:17,900
My little daughter.

399
01:02:25,639 --> 01:02:27,247
I didn't sleep with him.

400
01:02:28,880 --> 01:02:30,519
I gave myself to no one.

401
01:02:32,920 --> 01:02:35,265
I don't know what you want from me.

402
01:02:36,840 --> 01:02:39,760
I lay with no one, no one caressed me.

403
01:02:42,039 --> 01:02:43,539
You are pregnant.

404
01:02:46,679 --> 01:02:48,800
You will have a baby.

405
01:02:50,400 --> 01:02:51,900
I didn't know.

406
01:02:57,639 --> 01:02:59,139
You spread your legs

407
01:03:01,360 --> 01:03:03,504
and gave yourself to him, right?

408
01:03:03,840 --> 01:03:05,340
You don't believe me?

409
01:03:09,360 --> 01:03:10,860
I do.

410
01:03:11,880 --> 01:03:13,380
I believe you.

411
01:03:16,719 --> 01:03:18,219
I wasn't laying!

412
01:03:18,920 --> 01:03:20,420
I wasn't!

413
01:04:12,440 --> 01:04:14,785
<i>I'm carrying a child under my heart</i>

414
01:04:15,519 --> 01:04:17,019
<i>and so I beg you Lord</i>

415
01:04:17,239 --> 01:04:19,880
<i>don't abandon us.</i>

416
01:04:20,920 --> 01:04:22,420
<i>Be a Father!</i>

417
01:04:23,159 --> 01:04:24,920
<i>Be my child's protection.</i>

418
01:04:25,840 --> 01:04:28,880
<i>Don't forsake us. Don't forget us.</i>

419
01:04:44,599 --> 01:04:46,760
You will manage hauling hay.

420
01:04:46,880 --> 01:04:48,380
The weather is good.

421
01:04:49,079 --> 01:04:52,295
I hope you'll manage
with the hay while it lasts.

422
01:04:59,280 --> 01:05:00,780
Is she sick?

423
01:05:03,000 --> 01:05:04,519
She's changed a lot.

424
01:05:26,559 --> 01:05:28,059
Your belly has grown.

425
01:05:33,239 --> 01:05:35,159
Why should people know?

426
01:06:15,079 --> 01:06:16,579
Leave us, Stefek!

427
01:06:16,760 --> 01:06:18,099
And you, Milka!

428
01:06:18,199 --> 01:06:19,699
Leave us for a moment.

429
01:06:20,159 --> 01:06:22,169
I want to talk to your mother.

430
01:06:22,679 --> 01:06:25,091
I have a matter to discuss with her.

431
01:06:25,519 --> 01:06:27,019
Let's sit.

432
01:06:32,960 --> 01:06:35,159
Come to the new room.
- No, come!

433
01:07:15,119 --> 01:07:16,619
Milka, what are you!?!

434
01:07:26,519 --> 01:07:28,019
I know.

435
01:07:29,119 --> 01:07:30,679
You will have a baby!

436
01:07:32,639 --> 01:07:34,139
Who's baby is it?

437
01:07:36,000 --> 01:07:37,500
Krystian's?

438
01:07:39,719 --> 01:07:41,219
Milka.

439
01:07:42,280 --> 01:07:43,780
Milka!

440
01:07:44,480 --> 01:07:46,222
What will you tell me now?

441
01:07:49,440 --> 01:07:51,048
You're talking nonsense!

442
01:07:55,840 --> 01:07:57,340
Mila!

443
01:07:58,519 --> 01:08:00,019
My Mila!

444
01:08:00,559 --> 01:08:02,636
Why didn't you let me kiss you?

445
01:08:09,119 --> 01:08:10,639
Take off your skirt!

446
01:08:12,239 --> 01:08:13,920
It's nothing to you.

447
01:08:15,000 --> 01:08:16,500
Take it off!

448
01:08:17,399 --> 01:08:18,899
We'll have some fun.

449
01:08:20,039 --> 01:08:22,359
Take off your skirt! You bitch!

450
01:08:26,439 --> 01:08:27,740
Bitch!

451
01:08:27,840 --> 01:08:29,340
Bitch!

452
01:08:56,840 --> 01:08:58,340
Maybe!

453
01:08:58,760 --> 01:09:02,159
Maybe! who knows if something's happened.

454
01:09:02,560 --> 01:09:04,060
Don't cry.

455
01:09:05,039 --> 01:09:07,159
It will all turn out all right.

456
01:09:09,520 --> 01:09:12,000
No matter what happens.

457
01:09:12,840 --> 01:09:15,079
Sit down, rest.

458
01:09:17,079 --> 01:09:19,620
I'll tell the landlady
to take those wet clothes.

459
01:09:19,720 --> 01:09:21,399
You'll catch a cold.

460
01:09:21,520 --> 01:09:24,079
My little miss!
- Don't call her.

461
01:09:25,920 --> 01:09:27,528
I won't be staying long.

462
01:09:27,960 --> 01:09:29,501
I'll be on my way soon.

463
01:09:29,800 --> 01:09:31,300
No need to call her.

464
01:09:55,239 --> 01:09:56,739
Is that possible?

465
01:09:57,199 --> 01:09:58,800
Are you with child?

466
01:09:59,680 --> 01:10:01,180
Tell me.

467
01:10:03,800 --> 01:10:05,300
I am.

468
01:10:05,760 --> 01:10:07,260
Yes, I am.

469
01:10:09,079 --> 01:10:10,579
Take me as you wife.

470
01:10:13,560 --> 01:10:15,299
It was probably like this.

471
01:10:15,399 --> 01:10:18,615
You had fun with a boy.
You forgot to be careful.

472
01:10:19,239 --> 01:10:20,739
It happens.

473
01:10:21,720 --> 01:10:23,540
Yes, I can see now.

474
01:10:23,640 --> 01:10:25,140
No.

475
01:10:25,359 --> 01:10:27,369
I wasn't with anyone. I swear.

476
01:10:28,479 --> 01:10:30,154
Why don't you believe me?

477
01:10:30,399 --> 01:10:31,620
Impossible.

478
01:10:31,720 --> 01:10:33,328
Such cases do not exist.

479
01:10:33,439 --> 01:10:34,939
You're mocking me.

480
01:10:35,920 --> 01:10:38,199
I'm too old for such stories.

481
01:10:38,319 --> 01:10:41,039
I am not lying. It's the truth.

482
01:10:47,880 --> 01:10:50,159
Take me as your wife!

483
01:10:52,439 --> 01:10:54,985
Take me as your wife, I'm begging you.

484
01:10:57,800 --> 01:10:59,300
Take me.

485
01:11:01,600 --> 01:11:03,141
Who would have thought?

486
01:11:03,600 --> 01:11:06,840
I asked for a mother,
and I'm getting a daughter.

487
01:11:07,640 --> 01:11:09,259
But how is it to be?

488
01:11:09,359 --> 01:11:12,720
Am I to be a husband so suddenly?

489
01:11:27,159 --> 01:11:28,659
You can lie down.

490
01:11:29,680 --> 01:11:31,180
You can take me.

491
01:11:37,119 --> 01:11:38,619
It's not proper.

492
01:11:39,319 --> 01:11:40,700
How could I?

493
01:11:40,800 --> 01:11:43,000
But, as it can be seen!

494
01:11:43,239 --> 01:11:44,739
I am!

495
01:11:45,279 --> 01:11:46,779
But I couldn't.

496
01:11:47,279 --> 01:11:48,779
I couldn't possibly.

497
01:11:51,079 --> 01:11:52,379
Get up, Milka.

498
01:11:52,479 --> 01:11:53,979
Get dressed.

499
01:11:54,560 --> 01:11:56,060
I see.

500
01:11:56,520 --> 01:11:59,399
Of course I know. That's why.

501
01:12:13,840 --> 01:12:15,340
Drink this.

502
01:12:18,479 --> 01:12:20,623
Drink so you don't catch a cold.

503
01:12:23,399 --> 01:12:25,880
You can still change your mind.

504
01:12:27,920 --> 01:12:29,420
You're still young.

505
01:12:31,039 --> 01:12:32,539
A little miss.

506
01:12:33,199 --> 01:12:34,699
Anyone can see.

507
01:12:57,199 --> 01:12:58,699
Thank you.

508
01:13:37,039 --> 01:13:39,786
Mother, the organist will come to see us.

509
01:13:42,079 --> 01:13:44,893
He gave me that coat.
He'll come to get it.

510
01:13:46,920 --> 01:13:49,399
You didn't tell him I don't want him?

511
01:13:50,039 --> 01:13:51,539
An old fart.

512
01:13:52,039 --> 01:13:53,539
He is a good man.

513
01:13:55,319 --> 01:13:56,819
Him too?

514
01:13:57,439 --> 01:14:00,186
It's possible that also he is a good man.

515
01:14:00,680 --> 01:14:02,180
What about me?

516
01:14:02,439 --> 01:14:03,939
Am I not good?

517
01:14:13,119 --> 01:14:14,619
I will marry him.

518
01:14:19,359 --> 01:14:20,859
Mother!

519
01:14:35,520 --> 01:14:37,061
We have to consider it.

520
01:14:38,439 --> 01:14:39,939
That's good.

521
01:14:41,399 --> 01:14:43,141
Of course, he'll take you.

522
01:14:43,319 --> 01:14:45,960
After all, you're a big girl now.

523
01:14:47,000 --> 01:14:48,541
You know perfectly well

524
01:14:49,720 --> 01:14:52,333
what should and what shouldn't be done.

525
01:14:54,520 --> 01:14:58,071
I was stricken with grief,
you understand that, right?

526
01:15:01,359 --> 01:15:04,106
A human being is a child until his death.

527
01:15:04,439 --> 01:15:06,640
He won't change or get wiser.

528
01:15:09,079 --> 01:15:10,579
It's windy.

529
01:15:12,079 --> 01:15:14,800
Despair can knock a person down

530
01:15:16,560 --> 01:15:19,000
like wind cuts flowers from bushes

531
01:15:20,079 --> 01:15:22,625
and spreads them around unnecessarily.

532
01:15:24,399 --> 01:15:26,939
There is no help. There is no saving us.

533
01:15:27,039 --> 01:15:29,585
There is no mercy for the unfortunate.

534
01:15:30,920 --> 01:15:32,863
I will take him as a husband.

535
01:15:34,920 --> 01:15:36,420
The organist.

536
01:15:37,680 --> 01:15:39,180
That's good.

537
01:15:39,960 --> 01:15:41,460
My poor child!

538
01:15:43,079 --> 01:15:44,888
Maybe it's better this way.

539
01:15:53,479 --> 01:15:54,979
Milka!

540
01:16:03,079 --> 01:16:04,579
Wait, don't go!

541
01:16:05,399 --> 01:16:07,580
I have nothing to say to you.

542
01:16:07,680 --> 01:16:08,780
Mila,

543
01:16:08,880 --> 01:16:10,880
if you promise me something

544
01:16:11,520 --> 01:16:14,066
I'll tell no one that you're pregnant.

545
01:16:14,720 --> 01:16:16,720
Everyone will know anyway.

546
01:16:17,560 --> 01:16:19,503
Besides, I'm getting married.

547
01:16:22,039 --> 01:16:23,539
To whom?

548
01:16:28,359 --> 01:16:30,302
When are you getting married?

549
01:16:30,880 --> 01:16:32,880
To whom?
- You'll see.

550
01:17:01,920 --> 01:17:03,420
Oh, well.

551
01:17:04,520 --> 01:17:06,020
Yes.

552
01:17:07,199 --> 01:17:08,807
God be with you, ladies.

553
01:17:11,720 --> 01:17:13,220
Sit down.

554
01:17:22,399 --> 01:17:23,940
This is where we stand.

555
01:17:24,880 --> 01:17:27,024
It's about my marriage to Milka.

556
01:17:27,399 --> 01:17:28,899
Miss Milka.

557
01:17:29,479 --> 01:17:31,556
If she hasn't changed her mind.

558
01:17:32,359 --> 01:17:34,600
I, well, I thought it through

559
01:17:35,439 --> 01:17:36,939
and I accept.

560
01:17:39,720 --> 01:17:41,220
What say you?

561
01:17:42,279 --> 01:17:44,039
What am I to say?

562
01:17:45,880 --> 01:17:49,800
Milka's state is obvious.

563
01:17:52,199 --> 01:17:55,199
Though she doesn't admit

564
01:17:55,640 --> 01:17:57,140
to being with anyone.

565
01:18:01,399 --> 01:18:02,899
God be with you.

566
01:18:03,720 --> 01:18:05,220
Yes.

567
01:18:08,319 --> 01:18:11,520
God will bless you.

568
01:18:14,000 --> 01:18:15,920
Yes!

569
01:18:17,359 --> 01:18:18,859
God will!

570
01:18:21,159 --> 01:18:23,303
He knows best how it really was.

571
01:18:24,000 --> 01:18:25,500
Who knows.

572
01:18:25,920 --> 01:18:30,007
The Bible teaches us that
something like that happened before.

573
01:18:31,439 --> 01:18:33,520
God works in mysterious ways!

574
01:18:50,920 --> 01:18:52,420
Goodbye.

575
01:18:53,000 --> 01:18:54,500
Milka, wait.

576
01:18:55,920 --> 01:18:59,079
Talk to Stefek. He needs you.

577
01:19:07,239 --> 01:19:09,960
Try reaching an understanding with him.

578
01:19:10,720 --> 01:19:12,220
He loves you.

579
01:20:17,079 --> 01:20:18,960
May Jesus have mercy on us.

580
01:20:21,079 --> 01:20:23,119
That's the way it is.

581
01:20:25,520 --> 01:20:28,119
My darling, God will have mercy.

582
01:21:40,720 --> 01:21:42,220
Milka!

583
01:21:44,520 --> 01:21:46,020
Little miss!

584
01:21:49,199 --> 01:21:50,699
My little wife!

585
01:21:51,920 --> 01:21:53,420
Do you hear?

586
01:21:58,640 --> 01:22:00,140
It's time!

587
01:22:02,319 --> 01:22:03,819
I can't.

588
01:22:05,359 --> 01:22:06,859
I can't.

589
01:22:15,720 --> 01:22:18,800
You're thinking to do it differently?

590
01:22:22,279 --> 01:22:23,779
Do you?

591
01:22:25,439 --> 01:22:26,939
Mila?

592
01:22:43,720 --> 01:22:45,220
Darling.

593
01:22:46,800 --> 01:22:48,300
I'm not mad.

594
01:22:49,720 --> 01:22:51,261
I understand perfectly.

595
01:22:52,399 --> 01:22:53,899
I'm forgiving.

596
01:22:54,960 --> 01:22:56,460
Oh, well.

597
01:22:57,520 --> 01:22:59,199
Maybe you're sensitive.

598
01:23:01,479 --> 01:23:02,979
Innocent.

599
01:23:03,119 --> 01:23:04,619
How should I say it!

600
01:23:14,880 --> 01:23:16,421
It will be winter soon,

601
01:23:17,319 --> 01:23:18,994
and we feel so good here.

602
01:23:20,359 --> 01:23:21,880
Marriage, my Milka!

603
01:23:22,960 --> 01:23:24,903
What can be better than that?

604
01:23:26,439 --> 01:23:28,680
It's where the happiness is.

605
01:23:29,560 --> 01:23:31,060
For sure.

606
01:23:31,800 --> 01:23:33,300
It's a fact.

607
01:23:36,119 --> 01:23:39,319
My first wife is dead and buried.

608
01:23:41,159 --> 01:23:44,079
There is also my name on that gravestone.

609
01:23:45,800 --> 01:23:47,300
We'll all go there.

610
01:23:58,760 --> 01:24:00,260
She was good.

611
01:24:01,720 --> 01:24:03,220
Yes.

612
01:24:05,960 --> 01:24:08,372
Doors of heaven were opened for her.

613
01:24:09,760 --> 01:24:11,279
She surely went there.

614
01:24:16,520 --> 01:24:18,061
I think it's like this:

615
01:24:18,960 --> 01:24:20,680
Marriage is sacred.

616
01:24:22,039 --> 01:24:24,987
Nothing can keep a person
warm like love can.

617
01:24:25,560 --> 01:24:27,760
That's pure warmth.

618
01:24:28,359 --> 01:24:29,859
Do you understand?

619
01:24:35,239 --> 01:24:38,600
<i>Oh, Lord, take bitterness
out of our hearts.</i>

620
01:24:39,439 --> 01:24:42,454
<i>Let the sun shine once more
through our souls.</i>

621
01:24:43,039 --> 01:24:44,560
<i>Don't forsake us.</i>

622
01:24:45,520 --> 01:24:47,760
<i>Bring peace to my mother's heart.</i>

623
01:24:48,560 --> 01:24:50,369
<i>Move away the sea of tears.</i>

624
01:24:50,640 --> 01:24:52,319
<i>Don't forget us.</i>

625
01:24:55,199 --> 01:24:56,720
Who will he look like?

626
01:25:01,039 --> 01:25:02,539
Who knows!

627
01:25:04,720 --> 01:25:06,220
Maybe it's a boy?

628
01:25:10,640 --> 01:25:12,140
He did it.

629
01:25:14,680 --> 01:25:16,180
He put it.

630
01:25:22,840 --> 01:25:24,340
He's so talented!

631
01:25:25,600 --> 01:25:27,279
Or here!

632
01:25:32,159 --> 01:25:33,659
It wasn't easy.

633
01:25:36,239 --> 01:25:37,739
But he managed.

634
01:25:38,640 --> 01:25:40,140
Yes.

635
01:25:40,600 --> 01:25:42,100
He knew how.

636
01:25:42,920 --> 01:25:45,640
He knew how, I know he did.

637
01:25:54,439 --> 01:25:56,479
Not everyone is like that.

638
01:25:58,600 --> 01:26:00,100
He's the best.

639
01:26:07,720 --> 01:26:09,680
He did this all by himself.

640
01:26:11,119 --> 01:26:12,619
Yes.

641
01:26:14,800 --> 01:26:16,300
He knew how.

642
01:26:25,640 --> 01:26:27,140
What's inside?

643
01:26:29,119 --> 01:26:30,660
It's buzzing strangely.

644
01:26:33,119 --> 01:26:34,619
He knows.

645
01:26:35,680 --> 01:26:38,279
He hid his secret there,

646
01:26:39,359 --> 01:26:41,101
so no one can discover it.

647
01:26:44,880 --> 01:26:46,756
It's a strange hiding place.

648
01:26:47,359 --> 01:26:51,119
No one can know what's inside.

649
01:26:55,319 --> 01:26:57,159
But do they have to know?

650
01:27:47,479 --> 01:27:48,979
When will it be born?

651
01:27:49,600 --> 01:27:51,100
I don't know.

652
01:27:51,520 --> 01:27:53,720
You have to know more or less.

653
01:27:55,399 --> 01:27:58,399
It's all right, no use talking about it.

654
01:27:58,840 --> 01:28:01,319
It'll be born when the time is right.

655
01:28:46,279 --> 01:28:48,000
Milka is having a baby.

656
01:28:49,680 --> 01:28:51,180
She's in labour.

657
01:28:52,880 --> 01:28:54,380
Her pain has started.

658
01:28:55,600 --> 01:28:57,680
I hope everything goes well.

659
01:28:58,960 --> 01:29:00,560
I was in labour once

660
01:29:00,680 --> 01:29:05,359
and I have to admit that
I wouldn't want to do it again.

661
01:29:07,119 --> 01:29:10,920
That's how God punishes
people since Paradise.

662
01:29:13,039 --> 01:29:16,680
There must be pain and tears.

663
01:30:17,119 --> 01:30:18,619
Milka!

664
01:30:34,039 --> 01:30:35,539
Milka!

665
01:30:37,039 --> 01:30:38,539
Milka!

666
01:30:39,319 --> 01:30:40,819
Come!

667
01:30:42,399 --> 01:30:43,899
Come here!

668
01:30:45,079 --> 01:30:46,579
Come!

669
01:30:47,359 --> 01:30:48,859
Milka.

670
01:30:51,159 --> 01:30:52,659
Milka.

671
01:31:20,439 --> 01:31:21,939
My son!

672
01:31:24,079 --> 01:31:25,579
My little boy!

673
01:31:25,840 --> 01:31:28,159
Look, that's the table.

674
01:31:28,920 --> 01:31:32,119
This here. It's a table.

675
01:31:32,840 --> 01:31:34,783
Of course he doesn't know it.

676
01:31:35,520 --> 01:31:37,920
A table; It's a table.

677
01:31:38,039 --> 01:31:39,539
Yes, yes.

678
01:31:40,439 --> 01:31:41,580
Of course.

679
01:31:41,680 --> 01:31:43,623
He'll learn when he's bigger.

680
01:31:44,920 --> 01:31:48,000
And here, look! Don't cry. Don't cry.

681
01:31:48,520 --> 01:31:50,020
Look here.

682
01:31:50,520 --> 01:31:52,159
It's a book.

683
01:31:52,760 --> 01:31:54,260
A book.

684
01:31:54,560 --> 01:31:56,680
Just a book.

685
01:31:58,319 --> 01:32:00,600
He doesn't understand that yet.

686
01:32:02,520 --> 01:32:04,560
Isn't he a beautiful child?

687
01:32:08,079 --> 01:32:09,579
My little boy.

688
01:32:10,560 --> 01:32:12,060
My son.

689
01:32:13,479 --> 01:32:15,239
He is like a flower.

690
01:32:17,000 --> 01:32:18,742
His cheeks are like roses.

691
01:32:19,520 --> 01:32:21,020
Like roses!

692
01:32:22,680 --> 01:32:25,720
Just think, in ten years
he will be a big boy.

693
01:32:26,239 --> 01:32:27,700
Strong, honest.

694
01:32:27,800 --> 01:32:29,300
I'm sure he will be.

695
01:32:30,039 --> 01:32:31,760
You can already see it.

696
01:32:33,760 --> 01:32:35,260
He'll be like a hawk.

697
01:32:36,479 --> 01:32:37,979
He looks like it.

698
01:32:55,720 --> 01:32:57,220
Krystian!

699
01:32:59,239 --> 01:33:00,960
We shall meet again.

700
01:33:07,119 --> 01:33:09,560
I might have forsaken my own hopes!

701
01:33:10,680 --> 01:33:12,180
Or are they still!

702
01:33:14,199 --> 01:33:16,039
Are they still within me?

703
01:33:26,800 --> 01:33:28,439
Don't count my sins.

704
01:33:30,039 --> 01:33:31,539
My beloved!

705
01:33:33,439 --> 01:33:34,939
My friend!

706
01:33:41,560 --> 01:33:45,319
He is! so beautiful.

707
01:33:46,800 --> 01:33:48,300
Yes, beautiful.

708
01:34:13,359 --> 01:34:14,880
I went to church.

709
01:34:16,640 --> 01:34:18,359
I met old friends.

710
01:34:20,680 --> 01:34:22,422
I stopped by the vicarage.

711
01:34:30,680 --> 01:34:34,000
He is the joy of my days.

712
01:34:36,039 --> 01:34:38,652
Who would believe that I'd be a father.

713
01:34:40,079 --> 01:34:42,199
He is all I can think about.

714
01:34:46,039 --> 01:34:49,359
My first wife, my darling Mila!

715
01:34:51,319 --> 01:34:52,860
We've tried every night

716
01:34:53,680 --> 01:34:55,891
but she couldn't give me a child.

717
01:34:57,079 --> 01:34:58,579
But you!

718
01:35:00,520 --> 01:35:02,530
In a month, guests will arrive

719
01:35:02,880 --> 01:35:04,380
for the christening.

720
01:35:05,051 --> 01:35:06,726
That's what I've decided.

721
01:35:22,914 --> 01:35:24,414
I'm so sorry.

722
01:35:25,840 --> 01:35:28,439
Could you rub my legs?

723
01:35:31,615 --> 01:35:34,764
I don't want to tire you.
You're tired yourself.

724
01:35:36,039 --> 01:35:37,539
I'm all right.

725
01:38:23,720 --> 01:38:25,720
<i>You didn't want to know me.</i>

726
01:38:27,159 --> 01:38:30,520
<i>You didn't want to take me in your arms.</i>

727
01:38:32,359 --> 01:38:35,880
<i>I've walked away from you.</i>

728
01:38:37,640 --> 01:38:40,760
<i>My spirit returned to me.</i>

729
01:38:42,399 --> 01:38:44,359
<i>My longing made me stronger.</i>

730
01:38:45,800 --> 01:38:47,439
<i>My heart grew strong.</i>

731
01:38:48,720 --> 01:38:52,119
<i>Pain and despair
allowed me to rise again.</i>

732
01:38:52,920 --> 01:38:56,239
<i>I leave you now.</i>
