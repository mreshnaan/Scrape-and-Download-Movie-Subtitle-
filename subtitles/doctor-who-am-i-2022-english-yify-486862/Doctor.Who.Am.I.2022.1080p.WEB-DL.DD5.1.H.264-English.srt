<i>I'm the Doctor.</i>

00:00:57,357 --> 00:00:58,258

[Doctor] <i>I'm not running away</i>

11
00:01:05,399 --> 00:01:06,534
<i>I'm running to them.</i>

[quiet, ambient music playing]

00:01:49,443 --> 00:01:50,712
[Matthew] Stand back.

20
00:01:54,414 --> 00:01:57,652

[Matthew sighing]

22
00:02:07,662 --> 00:02:10,364
This is my film school
graduation film.

23
00:02:13,501 --> 00:02:15,503
45 minutes of crap.

24
00:02:17,204 --> 00:02:19,707
More scripts. Oh!

25
00:02:19,841 --> 00:02:21,876
The very first draft

26
00:02:22,376 --> 00:02:24,812
of <i>The Emperor's New Groove,</i>

27
00:02:24,946 --> 00:02:27,180
when it was called
<i>Children of the Sun.</i>

28
00:02:27,314 --> 00:02:30,317
Oh, my God! Floppies.

29
00:02:31,853 --> 00:02:33,054
-[Stephanie] Do you want this?
-[Matthew] Jesus.

30
00:02:33,186 --> 00:02:34,756
It's like I was on the run.

31
00:02:34,889 --> 00:02:37,058
I got the lid,
'cause I have the pot.

32
00:02:37,190 --> 00:02:38,191
Okay.

33
00:02:38,325 --> 00:02:40,360
Finding this in the query pile?

34
00:02:41,763 --> 00:02:44,799
This would be just like
the meetings that we have,

35
00:02:44,932 --> 00:02:46,299
but with George Lucas.

36
00:02:49,504 --> 00:02:51,405
[bottles clatter]

37
00:02:57,045 --> 00:02:58,780
Oh, United States.

38
00:02:58,913 --> 00:03:01,348
No. Denial.

39
00:03:01,481 --> 00:03:03,117
[Matthew] Oh,
somebody gave me that.

40
00:03:03,250 --> 00:03:04,519
Do you want it?

41
00:03:05,753 --> 00:03:06,821
Not yet.

42
00:03:08,656 --> 00:03:10,925
-This is relevant.
-It's like Christmas.

43
00:03:11,059 --> 00:03:12,794
<i>Doctor Who: Regeneration.</i>

44
00:03:12,927 --> 00:03:15,495
This is all about my--
my Doctor.

45
00:03:15,630 --> 00:03:18,766
And, um,
it's written by Phil Segal,

46
00:03:19,232 --> 00:03:22,937
and he says some deeply personal
stuff about me in here,

47
00:03:23,071 --> 00:03:25,540
which is totally inaccurate.

48
00:03:26,808 --> 00:03:29,342
I was just a hired hand,
I was a writer,

49
00:03:29,476 --> 00:03:31,478
who came up with a good idea,

50
00:03:31,612 --> 00:03:35,516
which was, "Let's have
the Doctor lose his memory,

51
00:03:35,650 --> 00:03:39,053
and then have to try
and work out who he is,

52
00:03:39,187 --> 00:03:41,421
and that will introduce him

53
00:03:41,556 --> 00:03:43,490
to the American public."

54
00:03:43,991 --> 00:03:45,827
Yeah,
really bad special effects.

55
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:49,097
That light's meant to be coming
from his eyes,

56
00:03:49,229 --> 00:03:50,397
instead of him sitting up

57
00:03:50,531 --> 00:03:53,000
and peering
into my storage unit.

58
00:03:53,835 --> 00:03:56,704
<i>Doctor Who</i> was conceived
as a children's show

59
00:03:56,838 --> 00:03:58,573
in 1963,

60
00:03:58,706 --> 00:04:01,743
about a Time Lord
from the planet Gallifrey,

61
00:04:01,876 --> 00:04:04,779
who travels through time
and space saving people.

62
00:04:05,613 --> 00:04:07,982
And his spaceship
is called the TARDIS,

63
00:04:08,116 --> 00:04:12,252
T-A-R-D-I-S, Time and Relative
Dimension In Space.

64
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:15,288
It's bigger on the inside.

65
00:04:16,624 --> 00:04:18,893
He's an alien,
he looks like a human,

66
00:04:19,026 --> 00:04:20,728
but he has two hearts.

67
00:04:21,495 --> 00:04:23,765
You also can't kill him.

68
00:04:24,565 --> 00:04:26,366
He regenerates
and comes back to life

69
00:04:26,501 --> 00:04:29,336
as a different Doctor,
but the same Doctor.

70
00:04:29,871 --> 00:04:32,974
He's had about 12
or 13 lives so far,

71
00:04:33,107 --> 00:04:34,542
maybe 50, who knows?

72
00:04:34,675 --> 00:04:36,244
Depends
when you're watching this.

73
00:04:36,376 --> 00:04:37,678
[bangs on door]

74
00:04:37,812 --> 00:04:39,781
I wrote the Eighth Doctor,

75
00:04:41,015 --> 00:04:42,750
played by Paul McGann.

76
00:04:47,021 --> 00:04:50,158
Since the BBC
abandoned the show,

77
00:04:50,290 --> 00:04:51,692
nearly a decade before,

78
00:04:51,826 --> 00:04:54,461
my job was to write
a TV movie pilot

79
00:04:54,595 --> 00:04:55,863
with the hope
that it would spawn

80
00:04:55,997 --> 00:04:59,066
a new American
<i>Doctor Who</i> series.

81
00:04:59,700 --> 00:05:01,903
So we had Paul McGann
as the Eighth Doctor,

82
00:05:02,036 --> 00:05:05,740
we had Daphne Ashbrook
as his companion,

83
00:05:05,873 --> 00:05:07,608
we had Eric Roberts
as the Master.

84
00:05:07,742 --> 00:05:11,913
We were sure this could be
a long-running show.

85
00:05:13,446 --> 00:05:14,782
But our big mistake

86
00:05:14,916 --> 00:05:17,251
was to make the Doctor
half-human.

87
00:05:17,417 --> 00:05:19,921
The Doctor is half-human!

88
00:05:20,955 --> 00:05:22,123
No wonder.

89
00:05:22,256 --> 00:05:23,858
[Matthew] And we had him kiss.

90
00:05:25,526 --> 00:05:27,161
-What?
-What?

91
00:05:27,795 --> 00:05:29,063
[in slow-motion] What?

92
00:05:30,430 --> 00:05:32,099
[in slower slow-motion] What?

93
00:05:33,734 --> 00:05:35,570
[Matthew] Two fatal errors.

94
00:05:35,970 --> 00:05:38,105
And it wasn't picked up
as a series.

95
00:05:47,114 --> 00:05:48,549
I'd always assumed

96
00:05:48,683 --> 00:05:50,483
that maybe the reason
he wasn't doing conventions

97
00:05:50,618 --> 00:05:53,621
was perhaps he, um,

98
00:05:53,754 --> 00:05:55,355
was feeling defensive

99
00:05:55,488 --> 00:05:58,425
about fans asking questions
about the movie.

100
00:06:01,329 --> 00:06:04,131
Bad <i>Doctor Who</i> is better
than no <i>Doctor Who.</i>

101
00:06:06,934 --> 00:06:08,769
[interviewer] <i>Are you saying,</i>
<i>then, you liked the movie?</i>

102
00:06:08,903 --> 00:06:10,171
<i>'Cause if you didn't,</i>
<i>that's fine, too.</i>

103
00:06:10,304 --> 00:06:11,639
No, no, I di-- well, I'm aware

104
00:06:11,772 --> 00:06:13,975
that the writer's
within earshot, um...

105
00:06:16,177 --> 00:06:18,646
It was recognizable
as <i>Doctor Who.</i>

106
00:06:20,081 --> 00:06:21,515
[Matthew]
I didn't go to conventions

107
00:06:21,649 --> 00:06:23,017
for a very good reason.

108
00:06:23,684 --> 00:06:25,620
I thought
the fans would kill me.

109
00:06:28,556 --> 00:06:31,893
But my longtime collaborator
and friend, Vanessa Yuille,

110
00:06:32,026 --> 00:06:34,528
encouraged me
to accept invitations,

111
00:06:34,662 --> 00:06:37,497
and indeed,
make a film about my journey

112
00:06:37,632 --> 00:06:39,166
back into that world.

113
00:06:43,271 --> 00:06:46,741
Now, opportunity had arisen,
and I needed the money.

114
00:06:47,275 --> 00:06:51,411
People are gonna pay me
20 bucks for my signature.

115
00:06:51,545 --> 00:06:53,581
And now I'm beginning to wonder

116
00:06:53,714 --> 00:06:55,816
why I've never done this before.

117
00:06:56,416 --> 00:06:58,451
But also, this is the budget.

118
00:06:59,553 --> 00:07:00,955
So, over the next year,

119
00:07:01,088 --> 00:07:03,524
Vanessa dragged me
to conventions in Los Angeles,

120
00:07:04,058 --> 00:07:08,562
in New York,
and in and out of fans' homes.

121
00:07:09,597 --> 00:07:10,831
[Vanessa] Be nice.

122
00:07:11,999 --> 00:07:14,335
It sounds like I'm the only one
at the table here

123
00:07:14,467 --> 00:07:16,570
who actually saw your movie

124
00:07:16,704 --> 00:07:18,606
the night
it was broadcast on Fox.

125
00:07:18,739 --> 00:07:19,774
Well, I'm one of people
in America

126
00:07:19,907 --> 00:07:21,108
that did watch it, you know?

127
00:07:21,242 --> 00:07:23,010
We were hoping
this was the birth,

128
00:07:23,144 --> 00:07:24,812
the pilot to a series,

129
00:07:24,946 --> 00:07:26,814
that this was going to
launch us,

130
00:07:26,948 --> 00:07:28,916
that Doctor Who
was going to be back.

131
00:07:29,050 --> 00:07:30,551
I knew that <i>Doctor Who</i>
had been off the air,

132
00:07:30,685 --> 00:07:32,420
they'd stopped showing it
on PBS,

133
00:07:32,553 --> 00:07:34,055
and then this thing
was coming out

134
00:07:34,188 --> 00:07:36,624
and it was new,
and people were excited.

135
00:07:49,737 --> 00:07:51,005
There was a lot of enthusiasm

136
00:07:51,138 --> 00:07:53,708
around the movie coming back
in 1996, um,

137
00:07:53,841 --> 00:07:55,876
and people were really
putting all their hopes

138
00:07:56,010 --> 00:07:58,412
into it leading
to a new TV series,

139
00:07:58,546 --> 00:08:00,881
and I think a lot of people
were very devastated by the fact

140
00:08:01,015 --> 00:08:02,850
that it didn't lead
to a series at that point.

141
00:08:03,351 --> 00:08:06,654
[announcer] <i>It's 2005,</i>
<i>and the Doctor is finally back!</i>

142
00:08:07,288 --> 00:08:09,824
<i>Christopher Eccleston</i>
<i>stars as the Ninth Doctor,</i>

143
00:08:09,957 --> 00:08:12,660
<i>and he's ready</i>
<i>to save the world.</i>

144
00:08:13,194 --> 00:08:15,129
Since they brought
the series back in 2005,

145
00:08:15,262 --> 00:08:16,464
it's just taken off.

146
00:08:16,864 --> 00:08:19,000
Nobody really expected
<i>Doctor Who</i> to come back anytime

147
00:08:19,133 --> 00:08:20,701
at-- at any point
in the near future.

148
00:08:20,835 --> 00:08:22,737
And then when it did,
I think it was just--

149
00:08:22,870 --> 00:08:26,440
it was literally
the second wind in a life.

150
00:08:26,574 --> 00:08:28,376
-Hi, how're you doing, sir?
-[Matthew] Good, you?

151
00:08:28,509 --> 00:08:29,777
Good.

152
00:08:29,910 --> 00:08:31,812
It's a bit posey, isn't it?

153
00:08:31,946 --> 00:08:33,647
I don't look like a dork.

154
00:08:34,081 --> 00:08:35,516
-There you go.
-[crewmember] <i>There you go.</i>

155
00:08:35,649 --> 00:08:36,650
-[crewmember 2] <i>Yeah.</i>
-All right.

156
00:08:36,784 --> 00:08:37,618
[crewmember] <i>Good compromise.</i>

157
00:08:38,152 --> 00:08:39,620
[crewmember 2]
<i>Put your hand down.</i>

158
00:08:41,756 --> 00:08:43,657
The movie bridges the gap

159
00:08:43,791 --> 00:08:45,960
from the old series
to the new series.

160
00:08:46,093 --> 00:08:48,562
And it's--
it's very much a forerunner

161
00:08:48,696 --> 00:08:50,965
of what <i>Doctor Who</i>
has become now.

162
00:08:53,034 --> 00:08:54,668
[Matthew] This isn't Comic-Con.

163
00:08:55,870 --> 00:08:58,606
This is a very particular
kind of fair.

164
00:08:59,673 --> 00:09:01,542
These guys are fanatics,

165
00:09:01,675 --> 00:09:04,645
but they exist
within a special corner

166
00:09:04,779 --> 00:09:06,313
of American fandom.

167
00:09:06,447 --> 00:09:08,015
-Hi! Hi!
-How are you?

168
00:09:08,149 --> 00:09:09,717
-Good, how are you?
-Good.

169
00:09:09,850 --> 00:09:11,285
This is the thing,
this is like--

170
00:09:11,419 --> 00:09:14,989
I'm not a celebrity,
I don't have fans,

171
00:09:15,122 --> 00:09:17,691
but somehow, in this world?

172
00:09:18,259 --> 00:09:19,827
I'm suddenly a guest.

173
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:21,929
[announcer speaking
indistinctly]

174
00:09:22,063 --> 00:09:24,498
[crowd applauding, cheering]

175
00:09:24,632 --> 00:09:27,034
[announcer speaking
indistinctly]

176
00:09:31,806 --> 00:09:33,040
-[Matthew] No.
-Here all on me own?

177
00:09:33,174 --> 00:09:34,308
[Matthew]
Well, then you come back there.

178
00:09:36,243 --> 00:09:37,311
Right.

179
00:09:37,845 --> 00:09:40,081
I mean, it may seem like
I'm a dickhead,

180
00:09:40,214 --> 00:09:42,650
going around,
being followed by a camera,

181
00:09:42,783 --> 00:09:45,319
but-- but really, um... I'm--

182
00:09:45,453 --> 00:09:49,356
I'm hoping to deflect it
and find out about the fans.

183
00:09:51,225 --> 00:09:53,260
This is the best place
to drown your sorrows.

184
00:09:53,394 --> 00:09:54,829
You know?

185
00:09:54,962 --> 00:09:57,998
They're 3000 Whovians,
and lots and lots of booze.

186
00:09:58,132 --> 00:09:59,900
[cosplayer]
Ah, the American fans.

187
00:10:00,034 --> 00:10:01,503
They are the diehards.

188
00:10:01,635 --> 00:10:03,572
Balls-to-the-wall
kind of attitude.

189
00:10:03,704 --> 00:10:05,005
All through medical school,

190
00:10:05,139 --> 00:10:06,707
I was still kind of the--
the closet Whovian.

191
00:10:06,841 --> 00:10:08,943
But, no, yeah,
we're just a normal couple.

192
00:10:09,076 --> 00:10:10,778
We just got married
two years ago.

193
00:10:11,412 --> 00:10:12,680
I'm special.

194
00:10:12,813 --> 00:10:15,015
Please don't hurt me
because I am so special.

195
00:10:16,951 --> 00:10:18,385
[Shaun] This convention,
Gallifrey One,

196
00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:20,955
has been a part of my life,
my entire adult lives.

197
00:10:21,088 --> 00:10:23,691
I was 19 when we started this,
and I'm 46 now.

198
00:10:24,091 --> 00:10:26,026
I'm a-- I work at a restaurant,
I'm a food server,

199
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:29,598
and I also am a teacher
part-time, so, yeah.

200
00:10:29,730 --> 00:10:30,998
-[baby cooing]
-Ooh.

201
00:10:32,099 --> 00:10:33,868
Hello. And Piper's a baby.

202
00:10:34,001 --> 00:10:36,103
There's a whole community
of people that do this.

203
00:10:36,237 --> 00:10:38,305
That knit specifically
Tom Baker scarves.

204
00:10:38,439 --> 00:10:41,075
And we sit there and talk
to each other and stuff,

205
00:10:41,208 --> 00:10:43,711
and that I found
because this is what I did.

206
00:10:43,844 --> 00:10:47,616
I found myself working in toys,
I worked in industrial design,

207
00:10:47,748 --> 00:10:49,116
and then I ended up
in chocolate.

208
00:10:49,250 --> 00:10:51,620
So Anna and I
are sign language interpreters

209
00:10:51,785 --> 00:10:54,556
for an elementary
and a high school

210
00:10:54,688 --> 00:10:55,990
from where we're from.

211
00:10:56,123 --> 00:10:57,458
It's like, I will do anything
for anybody,

212
00:10:57,592 --> 00:10:58,893
I wanna make sure

213
00:10:59,026 --> 00:11:02,296
that people are okay
in their lives.

214
00:11:06,367 --> 00:11:08,836
-And I'm Andrew Skinner.
-Andrew Skinner!

215
00:11:08,969 --> 00:11:10,171
And that's a good
English accent.

216
00:11:10,304 --> 00:11:11,972
Oh, thank you,
I live in Syracuse.

217
00:11:12,106 --> 00:11:13,575
But I'd say
I'm the mad man with the box,

218
00:11:13,707 --> 00:11:16,210
'cause if I had a TARDIS,
I would be all over the place.

219
00:11:17,011 --> 00:11:20,247
It was very, very
in-the-closet, so to speak.

220
00:11:20,381 --> 00:11:23,017
When we were growing up,
holding a <i>Doctor Who</i> book meant

221
00:11:23,150 --> 00:11:26,187
"Please, please,
punch me in the face."

222
00:11:26,621 --> 00:11:27,855
Um, "Please--

223
00:11:27,988 --> 00:11:29,990
please reject me
every time I ask you out."

224
00:11:30,124 --> 00:11:32,259
You know, it was kinda tough
to be a fan in the '90s,

225
00:11:32,393 --> 00:11:34,596
because it was-- it's always
been a niche program,

226
00:11:34,728 --> 00:11:36,897
but-- but even then,
it was, you know,

227
00:11:37,031 --> 00:11:38,533
a niche within a niche.

228
00:11:38,667 --> 00:11:40,968
<i>Doctor Who</i> fans
are the people that, uh, they--

229
00:11:41,101 --> 00:11:43,137
the <i>Star Trek</i> fans
don't even appreciate very much.

230
00:11:43,270 --> 00:11:45,272
But now it's--
it's grown and it's--

231
00:11:45,406 --> 00:11:48,108
it's that freedom
to finally say,

232
00:11:48,242 --> 00:11:50,110
"Yes, <i>Doctor Who</i> is a thing,"

233
00:11:50,244 --> 00:11:53,047
whereas in Britain,
it's sort of always been there.

234
00:11:53,180 --> 00:11:55,449
The Brits have been enjoying it
for 50 years,

235
00:11:55,584 --> 00:11:57,384
and it's only been,
like, the last ten

236
00:11:57,519 --> 00:11:59,554
that Americans
have really caught on to it.

237
00:11:59,688 --> 00:12:00,854
I actually, um, well--

238
00:12:00,988 --> 00:12:03,424
not from the States,
I'm from Canada,

239
00:12:03,558 --> 00:12:04,858
so I think you have to

240
00:12:04,992 --> 00:12:07,596
change the name
of your documentary

241
00:12:08,229 --> 00:12:11,098
The-- the fans of America,
and one boy from Canada.

242
00:12:11,232 --> 00:12:12,601
-[audience member] Okay.
-[audience laughing]

243
00:12:12,733 --> 00:12:14,502
It's like,
this is our little TARDIS

244
00:12:14,636 --> 00:12:15,970
that's bigger on the inside,

245
00:12:16,103 --> 00:12:17,304
the entire world fits in here
for a weekend,

246
00:12:17,438 --> 00:12:19,173
-and then we all go off again.
-Yeah.

247
00:12:19,306 --> 00:12:20,374
I love it.

248
00:12:22,409 --> 00:12:25,379
<i>Doctor Who</i> has helped
a lot of people

249
00:12:25,513 --> 00:12:27,348
find who they are.

250
00:12:29,216 --> 00:12:30,585
Beg your pardon, sir.

251
00:12:30,719 --> 00:12:32,386
<i>"Doctor Who</i> am I?"
It's like identity.

252
00:12:32,520 --> 00:12:34,888
It's a line from the <i>Doctor Who</i>
movie, of course.

253
00:12:35,022 --> 00:12:38,192
<i>"Doctor Who</i> Am I?"
was the pitch

254
00:12:38,325 --> 00:12:41,529
that I made
to get the 1996 movie.

255
00:12:43,732 --> 00:12:47,034
It's a very iconic moment.
Um, it's a divisive moment.

256
00:12:47,167 --> 00:12:48,936
Some fans love it,
some fans hate it.

257
00:12:51,272 --> 00:12:52,806
The Eighth Doctor
just regenerated,

258
00:12:52,940 --> 00:12:54,108
and he's in the shroud--

259
00:12:54,241 --> 00:12:55,876
the Shroud of Turin,
as I call it.

260
00:12:56,310 --> 00:12:58,479
And he falls down to his knees,

261
00:12:58,613 --> 00:13:01,949
he doesn't know who he is,
and he says, "Who am I?"

262
00:13:07,656 --> 00:13:10,057
[Matthew] At some point or other
in our lives,

263
00:13:10,190 --> 00:13:12,926
we all ask the same question.

264
00:13:14,328 --> 00:13:15,296
Who am I?

265
00:13:15,429 --> 00:13:19,466
[crowd chattering]

266
00:13:21,536 --> 00:13:23,705
[Paul B] There haven't been
too many conversations about

267
00:13:23,837 --> 00:13:24,905
where Matthew is.

268
00:13:25,740 --> 00:13:28,842
But that's because people
seem to be more concentrating,

269
00:13:28,976 --> 00:13:31,345
I think,
on the kind of Doctor, right?

270
00:13:31,478 --> 00:13:32,547
And-- and the stars.

271
00:13:37,985 --> 00:13:41,355
So, then you came to the States

272
00:13:41,488 --> 00:13:45,727
in 1990--

273
00:13:45,859 --> 00:13:47,394
-Two.
-Two.

274
00:13:47,529 --> 00:13:48,495
Or three, yeah.

275
00:13:48,630 --> 00:13:50,164
1992, 1993.

276
00:13:50,297 --> 00:13:52,734
Are you an American citizen?

277
00:13:52,866 --> 00:13:55,469
No, I'm a resident alien.

278
00:13:55,603 --> 00:13:59,541
But that's just 'cause I'm lazy.
I could be a citizen.

279
00:13:59,907 --> 00:14:01,342
-Um...
-Would you be a citizen?

280
00:14:01,475 --> 00:14:02,544
Well...

281
00:14:09,016 --> 00:14:10,752
There's so much marketing.

282
00:14:10,884 --> 00:14:12,721
It's just,
America is in-your-face

283
00:14:12,853 --> 00:14:14,855
with the marketing,
I mean, everywhere you go,

284
00:14:14,988 --> 00:14:17,157
you're gonna see
David Tennant's face everywhere,

285
00:14:17,291 --> 00:14:18,992
because they know--
they know how to sell things

286
00:14:19,126 --> 00:14:20,427
here as well.

287
00:14:20,562 --> 00:14:22,196
And they're just very,
um, visual about it.

288
00:14:22,329 --> 00:14:23,798
[fan] Okay,
Daleks have no gender.

289
00:14:23,931 --> 00:14:25,933
-That's right. They're pulsing.
-[fan 2] Genderless.

290
00:14:26,066 --> 00:14:27,401
American conventions, you have--

291
00:14:27,535 --> 00:14:29,937
you have fans
re-enacting things in the lobby,

292
00:14:30,070 --> 00:14:32,841
you've probably seen groups
of people crowding round Daleks

293
00:14:32,973 --> 00:14:35,442
and people striking poses
and having photographs taken.

294
00:14:35,577 --> 00:14:37,945
That doesn't really go on
at UK conventions.

295
00:14:38,078 --> 00:14:39,446
[interviewer]
So what do they do?

296
00:14:39,581 --> 00:14:43,150
-[cameraman chuckling]
-Uh... [laughs] ...hmm.

297
00:14:43,283 --> 00:14:46,387
[Tara] American fans
are very enthusiastic.

298
00:14:46,855 --> 00:14:50,057
They like to do cosplay,
they like to dress up,

299
00:14:50,190 --> 00:14:51,526
they will wear a t-shirt, I--

300
00:14:51,659 --> 00:14:54,395
I did a couple of conventions
in the UK,

301
00:14:54,529 --> 00:14:56,997
and it looked as though
they had just rounded people up

302
00:14:57,131 --> 00:14:59,567
at the bus stop and--
and sent them in.

303
00:14:59,701 --> 00:15:01,669
No--
hardly anybody wore costumes,

304
00:15:01,803 --> 00:15:03,538
hardly anyone wore t-shirts.

305
00:15:03,671 --> 00:15:07,040
But here, almost everybody has
either a <i>Doctor Who</i> t-shirt on,

306
00:15:07,174 --> 00:15:10,578
or a scarf, or something to do
with <i>Doctor Who,</i>

307
00:15:10,712 --> 00:15:13,080
to proclaim that
they are a <i>Doctor Who</i> fan.

308
00:15:13,213 --> 00:15:16,618
[camera clicking]

309
00:15:16,751 --> 00:15:19,353
[Paul B] People come here
because they love this thing

310
00:15:19,486 --> 00:15:20,921
that society says

311
00:15:21,054 --> 00:15:22,657
you shouldn't love
as much as you do.

312
00:15:22,791 --> 00:15:24,291
And then you're surrounded
by other people

313
00:15:24,425 --> 00:15:26,994
who love it just as much,
if not more than you do.

314
00:15:27,461 --> 00:15:29,396
So, in some ways, being a fan

315
00:15:29,531 --> 00:15:31,331
is almost like
coming out of the closet

316
00:15:31,465 --> 00:15:33,167
when you come to a convention.

317
00:15:33,300 --> 00:15:35,503
Because you're allowed
to be who you are,

318
00:15:35,637 --> 00:15:38,138
and you're allowed
to kind of experience

319
00:15:38,272 --> 00:15:39,973
the things that
you want to experience, in--

320
00:15:40,107 --> 00:15:41,676
in-- in the safe space
that you can.

321
00:15:41,810 --> 00:15:43,377
[announcer]
We just have a couple more

322
00:15:43,511 --> 00:15:44,913
quick announcements
we want to share with you.

323
00:15:45,045 --> 00:15:46,213
I'm forgetting many,
many things,

324
00:15:46,346 --> 00:15:47,582
and I can't see
the schedule here,

325
00:15:47,715 --> 00:15:48,917
cause I'm blind as a bat.

326
00:15:49,049 --> 00:15:51,418
Americans feel religion
so strongly.

327
00:15:51,553 --> 00:15:55,122
Americans feel rights
and freedom so strongly.

328
00:15:55,255 --> 00:15:56,624
So, perhaps,
that's why there's--

329
00:15:56,758 --> 00:15:58,091
there's kind of
an unbridled feeling in fandom

330
00:15:58,225 --> 00:15:59,359
in America, too.

331
00:15:59,493 --> 00:16:01,763
[Matthew] In my opinion,
the American fan

332
00:16:01,896 --> 00:16:03,964
is a particularly

333
00:16:04,097 --> 00:16:06,967
more virulent species of fan.

334
00:16:07,100 --> 00:16:09,002
They practically
destroyed Mark Twain,

335
00:16:09,136 --> 00:16:11,171
Sherlock Holmes,
or any of those,

336
00:16:11,305 --> 00:16:13,340
they're making them
into cult figures.

337
00:16:13,474 --> 00:16:16,076
Oscar Wilde as well, actually,
he did an American tour

338
00:16:16,210 --> 00:16:19,046
and had lots of fans
following him, yeah.

339
00:16:25,052 --> 00:16:26,353
[Matthew]
What did you want to talk about?

340
00:16:26,821 --> 00:16:29,557
Oh, I-- I want to
talk about your movie.

341
00:16:29,691 --> 00:16:31,325
[Matthew] Okay,
did you ever see the movie?

342
00:16:31,458 --> 00:16:32,727
-Be honest.
-No.

343
00:16:32,861 --> 00:16:34,161
-[Matthew] Okay.
-No, I-- I-- I wouldn't lie.

344
00:16:34,294 --> 00:16:35,530
[Matthew] Oh, good.

345
00:16:35,663 --> 00:16:36,931
Lot of people
haven't seen the movie.

346
00:16:37,064 --> 00:16:39,366
Yeah, I don't have any hatred.

347
00:16:39,500 --> 00:16:42,971
You know, people hate RTV,
people hate Moffat,

348
00:16:43,103 --> 00:16:44,438
people hate,
with all due respect...

349
00:16:44,572 --> 00:16:46,340
-[Matthew] No.
-...your work.

350
00:16:47,407 --> 00:16:49,209
-[Matthew] Oh, hello!
-How's it going? I'm Kevin.

351
00:16:49,343 --> 00:16:51,445
-Hi, Kevin. Nice to meet you.
-Nice to meet you.

352
00:16:51,579 --> 00:16:53,013
And you've got
the paperback version--

353
00:16:53,146 --> 00:16:55,148
-Yeah, I got some questions.
-Yes?

354
00:16:55,282 --> 00:16:57,150
We're gonna talk later
about the TV movie.

355
00:16:57,552 --> 00:16:59,988
Okay.
Writer of the-- the TV movie.

356
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:01,321
1996.

357
00:17:01,455 --> 00:17:03,357
Uh, first of all,
you seem like a nice guy.

358
00:17:04,424 --> 00:17:08,161
Uh, the Doctor being half-human.
Is that you?

359
00:17:10,197 --> 00:17:12,667
It was--
I wrote it in the script...

360
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:14,002
-This interview's over.
-...and then--

361
00:17:14,134 --> 00:17:15,402
[all laughing]

362
00:17:15,537 --> 00:17:16,704
Yeah, I just wrote it off as,

363
00:17:16,838 --> 00:17:18,038
"Well,
Fox must have wanted that,"

364
00:17:18,171 --> 00:17:19,339
and-- and I just thought
it was--

365
00:17:19,473 --> 00:17:20,742
-[Kevin] But it wasn't Fox.
-Yeah.

366
00:17:20,875 --> 00:17:22,010
[Kevin] It was this guy,
I've learned this--

367
00:17:22,142 --> 00:17:23,477
But what's your problem with it?

368
00:17:23,611 --> 00:17:25,279
Oh, come on, he's the Doctor,
he's a Time Lord,

369
00:17:25,412 --> 00:17:26,581
he comes from Gallifrey.

370
00:17:26,714 --> 00:17:27,649
Ah, no, I hate it.

371
00:17:27,782 --> 00:17:29,283
I remember
the criticism at the time

372
00:17:29,416 --> 00:17:30,752
was it felt like Mr. Spock.

373
00:17:30,885 --> 00:17:32,620
Cause Mr. Spock
was half-Vulcan, half-human.

374
00:17:32,754 --> 00:17:35,823
Oh, yes, that's right,
I hadn't realized that.

375
00:17:35,957 --> 00:17:37,324
So, maybe subconsciously

376
00:17:37,457 --> 00:17:39,359
-I was ripping off <i>Star Trek.</i>
-There you go.

377
00:17:39,493 --> 00:17:41,228
...and half-human
on your mother's side

378
00:17:41,361 --> 00:17:44,197
is like-- is like saying
you're really Jewish.

379
00:17:45,365 --> 00:17:48,268
Um, and there's a lot of
references--

380
00:17:48,402 --> 00:17:52,205
I'm not Jewish, I'm half-Jewish
on my father's side.

381
00:17:53,273 --> 00:17:56,811
You should write
a Big Finish audio drama

382
00:17:56,945 --> 00:17:58,846
and title it "Half-Human."

383
00:17:59,581 --> 00:18:01,181
[Matthew] We-- Yeah,
it would be a big hit.

384
00:18:01,315 --> 00:18:02,482
It would be.

385
00:18:02,617 --> 00:18:05,152
Because everybody would tune in,
you know?

386
00:18:05,285 --> 00:18:07,254
They will be like--
they will be like,

387
00:18:07,387 --> 00:18:09,323
"He has to hide
his half-humanness."

388
00:18:09,456 --> 00:18:11,124
Just like,
you know, in Nazi Germany

389
00:18:11,258 --> 00:18:13,260
you have to hide
that you're Jewish.

390
00:18:13,393 --> 00:18:15,262
Do you see what I'm saying?

391
00:18:15,395 --> 00:18:17,230
When will you pay attention,
you know?

392
00:18:17,364 --> 00:18:19,067
And all those people
will think, you know,

393
00:18:19,199 --> 00:18:21,101
and he can't admit

394
00:18:21,234 --> 00:18:23,838
that, in fact,
he's not totally alien.

395
00:18:23,972 --> 00:18:26,273
And then he turns around
and he says, "Wait a minute...

396
00:18:27,075 --> 00:18:29,176
humans are aliens, too."

397
00:18:29,309 --> 00:18:30,578
Yeah.

398
00:18:36,918 --> 00:18:40,153
[woman] I have ventured
onto Tumblr, God help me.

399
00:18:40,855 --> 00:18:44,759
These are people that
absolutely flat-out refuse

400
00:18:44,892 --> 00:18:48,096
to watch any classic <i>Who.</i>

401
00:18:48,362 --> 00:18:49,329
'Cause it's boring.

402
00:18:49,463 --> 00:18:51,666
And they just keep nattering on.

403
00:18:52,066 --> 00:18:56,104
"David Tennant, David Tennant,
David Tennant, David Tennant."

404
00:18:56,504 --> 00:18:59,139
Do you watch the show?

405
00:18:59,272 --> 00:19:02,409
Do you know
what the show is about?

406
00:19:04,277 --> 00:19:06,681
You know, in very broad,
pretentious terms...

407
00:19:07,949 --> 00:19:10,350
you-- after Jesus dies,

408
00:19:10,484 --> 00:19:13,353
you start getting
religions and rules.

409
00:19:16,223 --> 00:19:17,491
[Kevin] Now I will ask you,

410
00:19:17,625 --> 00:19:21,194
the Doctor and Grace,
they share a kiss.

411
00:19:21,328 --> 00:19:23,463
-[Bob] More than one, actually.
-[Kevin] More than one!

412
00:19:23,598 --> 00:19:26,734
We went through
decades of <i>Doctor Who</i>

413
00:19:26,868 --> 00:19:28,168
with no kissing,

414
00:19:28,301 --> 00:19:29,971
and suddenly,
"Oh, look at this!"

415
00:19:30,104 --> 00:19:32,205
Well, maybe that's why
you were persecuted

416
00:19:32,339 --> 00:19:33,708
in the playground.

417
00:19:34,842 --> 00:19:37,045
-Ooh.
-See now-- See now--

418
00:19:37,177 --> 00:19:38,746
I still like you as a person...

419
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:40,414
[all laughing]

420
00:19:40,548 --> 00:19:41,816
...but you, you know,

421
00:19:41,949 --> 00:19:43,618
it-- it's not
to the George Lucas level,

422
00:19:43,751 --> 00:19:45,853
but a little bit,
you destroyed my childhood.

423
00:19:45,987 --> 00:19:50,223
[piano music playing]

424
00:19:53,895 --> 00:19:57,699
[Matthew] As I was writing
that Doctor,

425
00:19:57,832 --> 00:20:01,736
I was pouring myself
into that character.

426
00:20:01,869 --> 00:20:05,807
I was pouring my experience
of the Doctor as a child,

427
00:20:05,940 --> 00:20:09,242
and all the wit
and all the warmth

428
00:20:09,376 --> 00:20:11,311
and all that sort of love

429
00:20:11,445 --> 00:20:13,715
that the Doctor has of humans,

430
00:20:13,848 --> 00:20:16,918
I was pouring
into this character.

431
00:20:17,051 --> 00:20:18,720
And I was loving doing it.

432
00:20:21,421 --> 00:20:24,491
I was putting myself
on the line there.

433
00:20:25,793 --> 00:20:27,528
[Paul M] Someone wrote to me
and said...

434
00:20:28,361 --> 00:20:30,064
"You've got it
the wrong way round."

435
00:20:30,430 --> 00:20:31,866
-[Matthew] Yeah.
-[Paul M] Yeah.

436
00:20:31,999 --> 00:20:34,367
-[Matthew] I would--
-[Paul M] Don't need as long.

437
00:20:35,703 --> 00:20:38,539
My Doctor, the Eighth Doctor
has been mainly on audio

438
00:20:38,673 --> 00:20:39,941
-all these years.
-[Matthew] Right.

439
00:20:40,074 --> 00:20:41,642
[Paul M] So, I've played
the Doctor on the radio.

440
00:20:41,776 --> 00:20:43,410
[Matthew] You've been alive
for-- as a Doctor,

441
00:20:43,544 --> 00:20:44,712
you've been alive for longer
than any other Doctor.

442
00:20:44,846 --> 00:20:46,346
[Paul M] The longest
and the shortest,

443
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:47,915
it's become me.

444
00:20:51,519 --> 00:20:53,855
The idea of coming
to these fan shows,

445
00:20:54,287 --> 00:20:56,456
it's just-- I don't know, no.

446
00:20:56,591 --> 00:20:57,925
-[Matthew] Same-- same here.
-Creepy. Weird.

447
00:20:58,059 --> 00:20:59,193
Why would I want to--

448
00:20:59,326 --> 00:21:00,194
[Matthew]
I was invited on a cruise.

449
00:21:00,327 --> 00:21:01,495
Cause it had a kind of--

450
00:21:01,896 --> 00:21:04,431
it had a str--
it has a strange reputation.

451
00:21:05,199 --> 00:21:06,534
And some of it's merited.

452
00:21:06,934 --> 00:21:08,503
Um, and I thought,

453
00:21:08,636 --> 00:21:09,904
"Well, I wouldn't enjoy that.
Why would I--"

454
00:21:10,037 --> 00:21:11,539
So, I didn't do 'em
for a few years.

455
00:21:11,672 --> 00:21:13,406
And when I did,
I really did enjoy it.

456
00:21:13,541 --> 00:21:15,342
In a way, I mean, the simple--

457
00:21:15,777 --> 00:21:19,446
I suppose,
the simple feedback, um...

458
00:21:20,581 --> 00:21:21,849
it's just a pleasure.

459
00:21:22,216 --> 00:21:23,885
Oh, you got the script!

460
00:21:24,018 --> 00:21:25,887
I haven't even got
a copy of this.

461
00:21:26,020 --> 00:21:27,454
I gave it to my son.

462
00:21:27,588 --> 00:21:30,124
This is the first time
I started signing anything.

463
00:21:30,258 --> 00:21:31,324
-[fan] Really?
-[Matthew] Yeah.

464
00:21:31,859 --> 00:21:35,062
This is a real fan book
that you have here.

465
00:21:35,428 --> 00:21:37,899
But Philip Segal
is the wonderful person

466
00:21:38,032 --> 00:21:40,034
who's really responsible
for bringing...

467
00:21:40,168 --> 00:21:42,069
-[fan] Right, right.
-...the Eighth Doctor back.

468
00:21:42,203 --> 00:21:44,272
-Did you want me to write in it?
-Yes, I did.

469
00:21:44,404 --> 00:21:46,641
[Matthew] Or did you-- what--
what did you want me to write?

470
00:21:46,774 --> 00:21:48,075
Well, there's this--
oh, there it is.

471
00:21:48,209 --> 00:21:49,744
The Jacobs script.

472
00:21:50,545 --> 00:21:52,479
-[Matthew] Jacobs script.
-[fan] The Jacobs script.

473
00:21:52,613 --> 00:21:53,781
Dun dun dun!

474
00:21:53,915 --> 00:21:55,448
I don't know
if you got the criticism,

475
00:21:55,583 --> 00:21:58,653
and I know a lot of people
criticized the...

476
00:21:59,287 --> 00:22:00,688
-[Matthew] What, the shoes?
[fan] ...American--

477
00:22:00,822 --> 00:22:03,490
no, the Americanization stuff.

478
00:22:03,858 --> 00:22:05,560
[Matthew] We were making
an American film.

479
00:22:06,093 --> 00:22:08,129
-Yeah.
-[Matthew] What can you do?

480
00:22:08,262 --> 00:22:09,230
-Right.
-[Matthew] This.

481
00:22:09,362 --> 00:22:10,731
So it's 15.

482
00:22:10,865 --> 00:22:13,366
-Thank you so much.
-My pleasure.

483
00:22:13,868 --> 00:22:14,902
Okay.

484
00:22:16,604 --> 00:22:17,772
It seems to me,

485
00:22:17,905 --> 00:22:20,541
that everyone
connected with this show

486
00:22:20,675 --> 00:22:23,644
is trying to cash in
in some way.

487
00:22:23,778 --> 00:22:25,947
I'm in the middle
of the dealers' room here.

488
00:22:26,514 --> 00:22:28,749
There's a lot of rather,
sort of pathetic,

489
00:22:28,883 --> 00:22:32,019
middle-level writers,
like myself,

490
00:22:32,153 --> 00:22:35,289
and reduced us
to a narrative work.

491
00:22:35,723 --> 00:22:36,891
They're enjoying the fact

492
00:22:37,024 --> 00:22:38,259
that they're getting
this stardom.

493
00:22:38,391 --> 00:22:39,594
And I-- it's happening to me!

494
00:22:39,727 --> 00:22:41,329
I-- I feel that, too.

495
00:22:41,461 --> 00:22:44,031
This is the <i>Radio Times</i> cover.

496
00:22:45,533 --> 00:22:48,368
So it's all to do
with identity and ego.

497
00:22:48,836 --> 00:22:50,771
And pissing contests.

498
00:22:51,606 --> 00:22:54,275
I think, "Oh, my God,
am I part of that gang?"

499
00:22:54,642 --> 00:22:56,310
It's kind of-- little scary.

500
00:22:56,978 --> 00:22:59,647
-Nice to meet you at last, sir.
-Hey, nice to meet you.

501
00:22:59,780 --> 00:23:01,282
You won't be coming
to a dinner tomorrow night?

502
00:23:01,414 --> 00:23:03,117
-Yes, and I'll see you then.
-With-- with-- yeah, yeah.

503
00:23:03,251 --> 00:23:04,619
All right. Brilliant. Thanks.

504
00:23:04,752 --> 00:23:07,088
Oh, thank you, yes, yes, yes.
I just woke up.

505
00:23:12,593 --> 00:23:14,629
Couldn't be better,
you sit at a desk,

506
00:23:14,762 --> 00:23:15,997
people come over to you,

507
00:23:16,130 --> 00:23:17,665
they tell you
how much they love you,

508
00:23:17,798 --> 00:23:20,500
then they give you $15,
and then they walk away.

509
00:23:21,068 --> 00:23:22,837
It's the kind of relationship
we all need.

510

-Which was my dad.

677
00:30:09,544 --> 00:30:10,944
Yep. Yep.

678
00:30:12,279 --> 00:30:15,449
<i>Doctor Who</i> is present
throughout my life,

679
00:30:15,583 --> 00:30:18,052
or my conscious life,
for the most part,

680
00:30:18,185 --> 00:30:21,088
because it began in 1963.

681
00:30:22,022 --> 00:30:24,726
The same day
as Kennedy's assassination,

682
00:30:24,858 --> 00:30:26,493
and I was only about seven.

683
00:30:28,862 --> 00:30:32,266
And my father was an actor.
His name was Anthony Jacobs.

684
00:30:32,399 --> 00:30:34,501
He was
in an early <i>Doctor Who</i> adventure

685
00:30:34,636 --> 00:30:35,704
with the First Doctor,

686
00:30:35,836 --> 00:30:38,472
called "The Gunfighters"
in 1966.

687
00:30:38,606 --> 00:30:41,710
<i>How're you proposin' to handle</i>
<i>this little clamp matter?</i>

688
00:30:41,842 --> 00:30:43,177
<i>What is your way,</i>

689
00:30:43,310 --> 00:30:46,013
<i>Doctor Holliday, hmm?</i>

690
00:30:46,146 --> 00:30:47,515
[Matthew] Where the Doctor
travelled back

691
00:30:47,649 --> 00:30:49,083
to the O.K. Corral,

692
00:30:49,316 --> 00:30:52,152
and befriended Doc Holliday,
who was played by my father.

693
00:30:52,286 --> 00:30:53,887
<i>Oh, you don't owe me nothin',</i>
<i>mister.</i>

694
00:30:54,021 --> 00:30:56,256
<i>You're my first customer,</i>
<i>you have this one on the house.</i>

695
00:30:56,390 --> 00:30:57,659
<i>[grunts]</i>

696
00:30:57,792 --> 00:30:59,360
There was the mirror,
you know, the back of the bar,

697
00:30:59,493 --> 00:31:02,096
and when they wanted
an over-the-shoulder shot,

698
00:31:02,630 --> 00:31:03,798
they slid back the mirror

699
00:31:03,931 --> 00:31:05,600
and the camera
would poke through.

700
00:31:05,734 --> 00:31:07,901
And beside that camera was--

701
00:31:08,035 --> 00:31:09,504
I was there as,
little ten-year-old.

702
00:31:09,637 --> 00:31:12,707
They'd given me a chair
and in front of the chair,

703
00:31:12,841 --> 00:31:16,745
they'd put a little TV monitor
of the selected shots.

704
00:31:16,877 --> 00:31:18,546
It was my birthday treat.

705
00:31:18,680 --> 00:31:20,981
And I had a set of cans,

706
00:31:21,115 --> 00:31:22,650
and I was listening
to Rex Tucker,

707
00:31:22,784 --> 00:31:25,886
who sh-- who was the director
up in the gallery,

708
00:31:26,019 --> 00:31:28,021
calling the shots.

709
00:31:30,324 --> 00:31:32,493
And of course,
for me it was wonderful.

710
00:31:33,127 --> 00:31:34,461
You know, can you imagine,

711
00:31:34,596 --> 00:31:36,964
it was like being there
with my two heroes.

712
00:31:37,364 --> 00:31:40,501
This was my dad and the Doctor.

713
00:31:41,001 --> 00:31:42,737
And my dad was the doctor.

714
00:31:43,170 --> 00:31:44,138
[interviewer]
Even more confusing.

715
00:31:44,271 --> 00:31:45,540
Yeah, that was confusing,

716
00:31:45,673 --> 00:31:47,642
it's account of
my fucked-up childhood.

717
00:31:58,919 --> 00:32:02,256
So this is around the time
that I went with my father

718
00:32:02,389 --> 00:32:04,191
to see him shoot <i>Doctor Who,</i>

719
00:32:04,324 --> 00:32:07,327
and it's also trying to look
very much like hero.

720
00:32:08,095 --> 00:32:10,063
This is my dad taking us

721
00:32:10,197 --> 00:32:12,266
on a small vacation,

722
00:32:12,399 --> 00:32:15,035
in a very small tent.

723
00:32:18,305 --> 00:32:21,041
This is when I was writing
<i>Young Indiana Jones.</i>

724
00:32:21,408 --> 00:32:23,477
And I took the boys on set,

725
00:32:23,611 --> 00:32:26,013
and they met
Sean Patrick Flanery.

726
00:32:27,882 --> 00:32:31,553
And they hung out
with Indiana Jones for the day,

727
00:32:31,686 --> 00:32:35,088
so it was--
I was kind of doing for them

728
00:32:35,222 --> 00:32:38,358
what my dad did for me
with <i>Doctor Who,</i>

729
00:32:38,492 --> 00:32:40,562
which was-- was very sweet.

730
00:32:41,729 --> 00:32:43,997
We haven't taken this camera
out of this house, have we?

731
00:32:44,131 --> 00:32:45,533
<i>Hi, Dad.</i>

732
00:32:45,667 --> 00:32:47,334

<i>What have you got there, Josh?</i>

733
00:32:47,468 --> 00:32:48,870
<i>-What's that?</i>
<i>-This is my new pocket knife.</i>

734
00:32:49,002 --> 00:32:50,705

00:32:54,943 --> 00:32:56,644

[baby cooing]

739
00:33:03,417 --> 00:33:05,085
[Heather] Well,
this is my daughter, Piper.

740
00:33:05,219 --> 00:33:07,187
We named her after Billie Piper.

741
00:33:07,889 --> 00:33:10,290
And she's three months old

742
00:33:10,424 --> 00:33:12,259
and this is
her very first cosplay.

743
00:33:12,392 --> 00:33:15,262
[Stephan] She just came back
from her first convention,

744
00:33:15,395 --> 00:33:17,264
San Diego Comic-Con,
we just got back from.

745
00:33:17,397 --> 00:33:19,466
And, uh--
so she did really well.

746
00:33:19,601 --> 00:33:21,970
She was on the floor
every day, all day long

747
00:33:22,102 --> 00:33:24,371
with, you know, couple-- what,

748
00:33:24,506 --> 00:33:26,708
it's what, 75,000 people a day,
something like that?

749
00:33:26,841 --> 00:33:28,910
All the white noise,
all the people together

750
00:33:29,042 --> 00:33:31,111
kind of kept her soothed,

751
00:33:31,245 --> 00:33:32,814
-so, uh--
-She slept through a lot of it.

752
00:33:32,947 --> 00:33:35,683
Yeah, she slept through a lot.
But she cosplayed every day.

753
00:33:36,116 --> 00:33:37,484
[Heather]
This is all new for us.

754
00:33:37,619 --> 00:33:39,086
We've only been doing it
for what,

755
00:33:39,219 --> 00:33:40,420
-two years?
-[Stephan] Two, three years.

756
00:33:40,555 --> 00:33:41,956
Yeah, the cos--
the cosplay aspect.

757
00:33:42,089 --> 00:33:43,390
[Heather] It kind of
jumped on us.

758
00:33:43,525 --> 00:33:45,425
I made a costume for Halloween,

759
00:33:45,560 --> 00:33:47,862
and happened to wear it
to WonderCon.

760
00:33:48,796 --> 00:33:50,999
And it was such a hit
that we kind of went with it,

761
00:33:51,131 --> 00:33:53,267
and then
it just expanded from there.

762
00:33:53,400 --> 00:33:56,538
Her dress is really what got us
invited to Graham Norton.

763
00:34:05,580 --> 00:34:08,482
I'm just gonna rest it
on my head, if that's safe.

764
00:34:10,183 --> 00:34:12,419
What-- what that looks like?

765
00:34:16,056 --> 00:34:19,126
[Stephan] At San Diego,
I literally ran into Matt Smith

766
00:34:19,259 --> 00:34:20,494
in a hotel lobby.

767
00:34:20,628 --> 00:34:22,296
I was gonna have this--
a tattoo project.

770
00:34:32,139 --> 00:34:33,808
[Stephan] We picked the elbow,
which, thanks Matt,

771
00:34:33,942 --> 00:34:35,977
I don't know if you've ever had
your elbow tattooed.

772
00:34:36,109 --> 00:34:37,377
[Graham] Where's-- where's that?

773

[inaudible speaking]

774
00:34:39,914 --> 00:34:41,049
[Matthew] That's big.

775
00:34:41,181 --> 00:34:43,383
[Stephan]
The original idea was that

776
00:34:43,518 --> 00:34:44,886
I was gonna do
the TARDIS sleeve,

777
00:34:45,019 --> 00:34:46,821
and then if I ever happened to
run into David,

778
00:34:46,955 --> 00:34:48,388
there's a blank space

779
00:34:48,523 --> 00:34:49,924
in the middle of the vortex
there for his signature.

-Peter Capaldi--
-[Stephan] Yeah, well,

783
00:35:00,034 --> 00:35:01,536
it's also the newest, so it's--

784
00:35:01,669 --> 00:35:02,670
it's, uh--

785
00:35:02,804 --> 00:35:04,338
[Matthew] Oh,
that's why it's so sharp.

786
00:35:04,471 --> 00:35:06,340
We talk about
the <i>Doctor Who</i> in you,

787
00:35:06,473 --> 00:35:08,241
but you don't have
a <i>Doctor Who</i> in you,

-Yeah.

790
00:35:12,112 --> 00:35:13,781
[Stephan] Yeah, so I have--
I have every Doctor

791
00:35:13,915 --> 00:35:15,883
except for Chris Eccleston
right now.

792
00:35:20,989 --> 00:35:22,456
As a married couple,

793
00:35:23,091 --> 00:35:24,391
it's-- for me, anyway,

794
00:35:24,525 --> 00:35:25,927
I found that it's been important
to, you know,

795
00:35:26,060 --> 00:35:27,762
when we find something
we're both interested in,

796

-to, like, hang on to that...
-Exploit it.

797
00:35:30,130 --> 00:35:31,465
...and not let it go, ever.

798
00:35:31,599 --> 00:35:33,101
Um, cause it's really,
you know, strengthened

799
00:35:33,233 --> 00:35:34,702
our relationship considerably.

800
00:35:34,836 --> 00:35:36,871
I feel like I'm just--
I'm just a huge fan

801
00:35:37,005 --> 00:35:38,238
that loves this show,

802
00:35:38,372 --> 00:35:40,273
and brought me so much joy
in my life,

803
00:35:40,407 --> 00:35:41,475
and in our home.

804
00:35:41,943 --> 00:35:44,746
Just like he brings joy to me!

I just got married last year.

806
00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:47,982
Had a big fat gay wedding,

807
00:35:48,116 --> 00:35:50,417
and when we walked into
the reception, it was like...

[hums <i>Doctor Who</i> theme]

809
00:35:52,319 --> 00:35:53,521
...kind of disco thing,

810
00:35:53,655 --> 00:35:54,822
and everybody
was just on the floor.

811
00:35:54,956 --> 00:35:55,957
They're like,
"Yes, finally, finally."

812
00:35:56,090 --> 00:35:57,491
[Daphne] Finally!

813
00:35:59,761 --> 00:36:02,130
Oh, my God! Come in this house!

814
00:36:02,262 --> 00:36:03,765
-Aww.
-[Eric] Look who's here.

815
00:36:03,898 --> 00:36:05,700
-[Eliza] Great to see you.
-[Eric] I'm in love

816
00:36:05,833 --> 00:36:06,968
with being married.

817
00:36:07,101 --> 00:36:10,270
We've been together, now,
almost 30 years, and, uh,

818
00:36:10,404 --> 00:36:12,840
I've learned how to really
do this job

819
00:36:12,974 --> 00:36:14,042
of being the husband.

820
00:36:14,174 --> 00:36:15,275
-[Matthew] True.
-And I like it.

821
00:36:15,843 --> 00:36:19,047
We've been in, I don't know,
two dozen movies together.

822
00:36:19,514 --> 00:36:21,049
[Eliza]
We love working together.

823
00:36:21,181 --> 00:36:22,750
And we--
we're gonna do a count once

824
00:36:22,884 --> 00:36:24,852
of how many times
we've killed each other

825
00:36:24,986 --> 00:36:26,020
in various shows.

826
00:36:26,988 --> 00:36:29,891
Here's my relationship
to conventions.

827
00:36:30,024 --> 00:36:32,259
I go 'cause she tells me
to go for the fans.

828
00:36:32,392 --> 00:36:34,095
And I had the best time!

829
00:36:34,227 --> 00:36:35,495
I-- I effectively have fun,

830
00:36:35,630 --> 00:36:37,899
because of the fans
are havin' a great time,

831
00:36:38,398 --> 00:36:39,734
and they're dedicated!

832
00:36:42,302 --> 00:36:44,438
I think what's interesting

833
00:36:44,572 --> 00:36:46,406
about <i>Doctor Who</i> fandom is

834
00:36:46,541 --> 00:36:49,077
it fills this hole
of belief structure,

835
00:36:49,209 --> 00:36:50,678
that religion used to do.

836
00:36:50,812 --> 00:36:53,681
The Doctor's belief
of the attempt of non-violence,

837
00:36:53,815 --> 00:36:56,483
the bravery, and so, you know

838
00:36:56,617 --> 00:36:58,452
you can meet the right person

839
00:36:58,586 --> 00:37:00,788
and you know
that the people in the room

840
00:37:00,922 --> 00:37:03,758
are the right people
because they share your values.

841
00:37:04,491 --> 00:37:07,729
[Eric] Fandom
can be kind of religious.

842
00:37:08,129 --> 00:37:09,664
[Matthew] Mm-hmm.

843
00:37:09,797 --> 00:37:13,366
And religion can be sought
by the fans of that situation,

844
00:37:13,500 --> 00:37:15,368
which-- just weird.

845
00:37:15,737 --> 00:37:17,972
There is a worship thing
that goes on,

846
00:37:18,106 --> 00:37:19,173
there's no question about it.

847
00:37:19,841 --> 00:37:21,308
But I think
that you can find that

848
00:37:21,441 --> 00:37:22,877
in a million places.

849
00:37:24,979 --> 00:37:26,346
[Matthew] Amen.

850
00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:28,916
You know, we met the keeper
of the Holy Grail?

851
00:37:29,817 --> 00:37:31,986
There's a lot of people
who have memorabilia from shows,

852
00:37:32,120 --> 00:37:34,254
not just-- you know,
not just <i>Doctor Who,</i>

853
00:37:34,387 --> 00:37:35,790
that are very--
like, this is mine.

854
00:37:36,224 --> 00:37:38,425
You know, uh, I--
I don't feel that way, I-- I--

855
00:37:38,559 --> 00:37:40,360
I think it's--
the responsibility is to share.

856
00:37:40,494 --> 00:37:42,096
So, like, dynamic.

857
00:37:43,330 --> 00:37:47,101
This is the only TARDIS console
in the United States.

858
00:37:47,602 --> 00:37:50,705
And it's one of the only ones
in existence.

859
00:37:52,807 --> 00:37:55,042
I understand what that means.

860
00:37:57,178 --> 00:37:59,147
When we had
the <i>Doctor Who</i> movie reunion

861
00:37:59,279 --> 00:38:01,783
at the Gallifrey Convention,
Phil Segal was there.

862
00:38:01,916 --> 00:38:03,483
He thought
it had been destroyed.

863
00:38:03,618 --> 00:38:05,352
And he was really
emotionally touched by the fact

864
00:38:05,485 --> 00:38:08,723
that somebody had saved it,
and somebody had restored it.

865
00:38:09,624 --> 00:38:10,958
He looked down and he said,

866
00:38:11,092 --> 00:38:12,860
"Oh, you know,
I see you guys built a replica

867
00:38:12,994 --> 00:38:13,861
of the Doctor's bag.

868
00:38:13,995 --> 00:38:15,462
You know,
I have the original one."

869
00:38:15,596 --> 00:38:16,831
And I'm like,
"Oh, wow, that's great."

870
00:38:16,964 --> 00:38:17,932
He goes, "You know what?

871
00:38:18,065 --> 00:38:19,734
I-- I want you
to come to my place,

872
00:38:19,867 --> 00:38:21,569
and I'm gonna give you
some of the props

873
00:38:21,702 --> 00:38:23,204
I have left over from the show,

874
00:38:23,336 --> 00:38:25,606
'cause I want you-- I want 'em
to be with the console,

875
00:38:25,740 --> 00:38:28,776
I want you to sort of
be in charge of that.

876
00:38:29,143 --> 00:38:31,546
Be a curator of, sort of,
the <i>Doctor Who</i> movie."

877
00:38:31,679 --> 00:38:33,714
Which, of course, you know,
I'm sitting there going,

878
00:38:33,848 --> 00:38:35,415
"Hmm. That would be wonderful."

879
00:38:35,550 --> 00:38:38,318
And inside I'm going,
"Oh, my God! Oh, my God!"

880
00:38:40,588 --> 00:38:43,691
[Matthew] We're outside
Philip Segal's office.

881
00:38:44,058 --> 00:38:46,194
And Philip is now

882
00:38:46,326 --> 00:38:49,597
a major reality TV CEO,

883
00:38:49,730 --> 00:38:53,634
and so we've decided
to out-real the reality...

884
00:38:54,467 --> 00:38:55,736
TV guy.

885
00:38:56,971 --> 00:38:58,940
I'm really hoping this is good.

886
00:38:59,073 --> 00:39:01,943
I'm obviously
incredibly excited to see him,

887
00:39:02,076 --> 00:39:03,611
um, after all this time.

888
00:39:03,744 --> 00:39:05,680
A little trepidatious as well.

889
00:39:07,815 --> 00:39:10,785
He completely distanced himself
from the script.

890
00:39:11,185 --> 00:39:12,954
I see all of the things
that I wish

891
00:39:13,087 --> 00:39:15,656
I could've done better,
or wanted to change,

892
00:39:15,790 --> 00:39:17,758
or weren't supposed
to be the way they are.

893
00:39:19,160 --> 00:39:20,628
We sadly were in a time

894
00:39:20,761 --> 00:39:23,664
where we weren't allowed
to make the script

895
00:39:23,798 --> 00:39:25,833
as fantastic
as it could have been.

896
00:39:26,334 --> 00:39:27,668
[doorbell chiming]

897
00:39:31,606 --> 00:39:32,874
Hey there.

898
00:39:33,007 --> 00:39:34,374
-[receptionist] How are you--
-I'm good.

899
00:39:34,508 --> 00:39:35,977
It's Matthew Jacobs
for Philip Segal.

900
00:39:36,110 --> 00:39:37,578
Okay, let me call him.

901
00:39:37,712 --> 00:39:40,815
[Matthew] He's probably
the number one American fan.

902
00:39:40,948 --> 00:39:43,684
Without him,
there would be no <i>Doctor Who.</i>

903
00:39:43,818 --> 00:39:45,586
He is the reason, in my mind,

904
00:39:45,720 --> 00:39:47,154
that <i>Doctor Who</i>
has stayed alive.

905
00:39:47,288 --> 00:39:48,723
Philip, Matthew's here for you.

906
00:39:49,757 --> 00:39:51,726
-[Philip] Oh, my God.
-Hello, darling.

907
00:39:51,859 --> 00:39:53,294
-[Philip] How are you?
-Nice to see you.

908
00:39:53,426 --> 00:39:55,395
Good to see you.
You look terrific.

909
00:39:55,529 --> 00:39:56,898
-You haven't changed
-Same to you.

910
00:39:57,031 --> 00:39:58,199
-Well, maybe we both...
-You, you got taller.

911
00:39:58,332 --> 00:39:59,399
...few little gray hairs.

912
00:39:59,533 --> 00:40:00,835
-Yeah.
-It's the aggravation.

913
00:40:00,968 --> 00:40:02,435
-Why, it is.
-How are you?

914
00:40:02,570 --> 00:40:05,472
-I'm good. You've got taller.
-Have I?

915
00:40:05,606 --> 00:40:07,308
No, either that,
or I got smaller.

916
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:08,542
Better posture, I think.

917
00:40:08,676 --> 00:40:10,077
No, I think it's better posture.

918
00:40:10,211 --> 00:40:11,913
-I think it is.
-Oh, my God, what an operation.

919
00:40:12,046 --> 00:40:13,446
[Philip] Yeah, that was a gift
from Discovery Channel.

920
00:40:13,915 --> 00:40:16,651
For, uh,
shall we call <i>Deadliest Catch.</i>

921
00:40:16,784 --> 00:40:18,119
Well,
we did a show called <i>Ax Men,</i>

922
00:40:18,252 --> 00:40:20,121
and we've been doing it
for eight years now.

923
00:40:20,254 --> 00:40:21,389
We do a show called

924
00:40:21,522 --> 00:40:22,757
<i>-Ice Road Truckers.</i>
-Right.

925
00:40:22,890 --> 00:40:24,725
I mean,
who knew you could do a show

926
00:40:24,859 --> 00:40:28,629
about men sitting in a truck
driving at 15 miles an hour

927
00:40:28,763 --> 00:40:31,132
for 15 hours at a time,
doing nothing?

928
00:40:31,265 --> 00:40:33,334
-You did.
-We did.

929
00:40:33,466 --> 00:40:35,136
[Philip] This was a gift
from the BBC.

930
00:40:36,070 --> 00:40:38,973
If you pull the top up,
it used to have a lighter in it.

931
00:40:39,106 --> 00:40:42,576
We saw a Dalek that had a baby
in the middle there--

932
00:40:42,710 --> 00:40:43,878
-Oh, right.
-Don't know

933
00:40:44,011 --> 00:40:45,379
-if you have seen that one.
-Yeah.

934
00:40:45,513 --> 00:40:46,948
-No, but a real baby.
-Oh, right.

935
00:40:47,081 --> 00:40:48,716
Look at this.
It's got a wonderful detail.

936
00:40:48,849 --> 00:40:50,651
Look at the, uh, the face.

937
00:40:51,385 --> 00:40:52,485
He looks a little crazy.

938
00:40:52,620 --> 00:40:54,021
-Yes.
-Yeah.

939
00:40:54,155 --> 00:40:55,589
-No, you sit there.
-All right. I'll sit there.

940
00:40:55,723 --> 00:40:56,958
[Matthew] This is your thing.
Yeah.

941
00:40:57,091 --> 00:40:58,559
[Philip] I haven't seen you
in 20 years.

942
00:40:58,693 --> 00:41:00,528
Almost 20 years.

943
00:41:01,362 --> 00:41:02,930
-96. Yeah.
-Yeah.

944
00:41:03,064 --> 00:41:04,865
I'm left with an image
in my mind.

945
00:41:04,999 --> 00:41:06,734
-Yeah.
-And you're left with an image

946
00:41:06,867 --> 00:41:08,636
in your mind,
of a thinner Matthew

947
00:41:08,769 --> 00:41:11,372
-who probably wore glasses, so--
-Well, yes, you did.

948
00:41:11,505 --> 00:41:12,940
-You wore glasses.
-[Matthew] Yeah.

949
00:41:13,074 --> 00:41:15,910
And, um, but you always had
that impish smile, and...

950
00:41:16,777 --> 00:41:18,412
you looked curious at the world.

951
00:41:18,980 --> 00:41:21,415
-I was impish?
-[Philip] Oh, yeah. Absolutely.

952
00:41:21,549 --> 00:41:23,918
On The Seven-Year Itch,
you said--

953
00:41:24,051 --> 00:41:25,786
oh-- you said, "Oh, Matthew,
he's mad,

954
00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:29,023
he's completely mad,
he's totally mad."

955
00:41:29,156 --> 00:41:31,625
And I was thinking of it,
"Was I really mad?"

956
00:41:31,759 --> 00:41:33,394
No, was I insane?

957
00:41:33,527 --> 00:41:36,597
I-- no, looking back on it now,
that wasn't a fair statement.

958
00:41:36,731 --> 00:41:40,534
It wasn't mad.
It was passionate.

959
00:41:41,102 --> 00:41:42,570
-Driven.
-[Matthew] Passion, yeah, yeah.

960
00:41:42,703 --> 00:41:46,273
And, um, you--
you were really driven

961
00:41:46,407 --> 00:41:48,242
by what you saw in your head.

962
00:41:48,376 --> 00:41:49,777
-[Matthew] Right.
-Everything, you saw everything

963
00:41:49,910 --> 00:41:51,746
-in pictures, I think.
-[Matthew] Yeah.

964
00:41:51,879 --> 00:41:53,647
Everything was images
in your head,

965
00:41:53,781 --> 00:41:56,050
and you wanted to express that.

966
00:41:56,183 --> 00:42:00,721
When <i>Doctor Who</i> came out,
when our movie came out,

967
00:42:00,855 --> 00:42:04,492
right, I felt as though
I just-- it was like,

968
00:42:04,625 --> 00:42:06,027
even though there
was some nice reviews...

969
00:42:06,160 --> 00:42:07,862
-Mmm.
-...people universally

970
00:42:07,995 --> 00:42:09,397
-went after the script.
-Yes.

971
00:42:09,530 --> 00:42:12,867
People would say, "Lovely movie.
Shame about the script."

972
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:14,735
-Yes.
-And they would say--

973
00:42:14,869 --> 00:42:16,237
They were gonna say that
about any script.

974
00:42:16,370 --> 00:42:17,605
Any script.

975
00:42:17,738 --> 00:42:19,740
Uh, I was at a convention
in Chicago...

976
00:42:19,874 --> 00:42:21,142
-Yeah.
-...uh, right after

977
00:42:21,275 --> 00:42:22,910
it first came out,
they flew me out there

978
00:42:23,044 --> 00:42:24,812
and all this stuff,
but I got physically assaulted

979
00:42:24,945 --> 00:42:27,181
by someone
who was so angry at the idea

980
00:42:27,314 --> 00:42:30,718
that the Doctor
would kiss anyone.

981
00:42:31,552 --> 00:42:32,586
I mean, I-- yeah,
it was physically,

982
00:42:32,720 --> 00:42:34,088
I thought he was going to hu--

983
00:42:34,221 --> 00:42:36,257
-I was very scared.
-[Matthew] Yes.

984
00:42:37,725 --> 00:42:39,193
It was a very bizarre moment.

985
00:42:39,326 --> 00:42:41,128
[Matthew] But-- yeah,
I wanted to do the kiss.

986
00:42:41,262 --> 00:42:42,763
-Didn't you? It was like--
-Of course.

987
00:42:42,897 --> 00:42:44,131
[Matthew] I mean, the--
the whole idea was

988
00:42:44,265 --> 00:42:45,766
we were doing
a more romantic Doctor.

989
00:42:45,900 --> 00:42:47,468
Well, he w-- and he w--
he was half-human.

990
00:42:47,968 --> 00:42:49,370
[Matthew] Exactly.

991
00:42:49,504 --> 00:42:51,705
[both laughing]

992
00:42:51,839 --> 00:42:53,174
That's why
if he kisses somebody,

993
00:42:53,307 --> 00:42:55,076
then he no longer belongs
to everybody, does he?

994
00:42:55,209 --> 00:42:58,179
-He belongs to someone.
-That's right. That's right.

995
00:42:58,312 --> 00:43:01,048
That-- but, but it's cool now,
because there are--

996
00:43:01,182 --> 00:43:02,883
-there are women involved.
-That's right.

997
00:43:03,017 --> 00:43:04,919
There are girls involved.
And so now you can be romantic.

998
00:43:05,052 --> 00:43:06,387
-Yeah. Exactly. But it's all--
-But before,

999
00:43:06,521 --> 00:43:07,922
-it was an anorak boys thing.
-That's right.

1000
00:43:08,055 --> 00:43:09,256
And all the anorak
boys things were--

1001
00:43:09,390 --> 00:43:10,791
they were useless at chatting up
girls,

1002
00:43:10,925 --> 00:43:12,293
-and they had this hero.
-Exactly.

1003
00:43:12,426 --> 00:43:14,462
This guy who couldn't get laid,
and they went,

1004
00:43:14,595 --> 00:43:15,629
"Yay, he's just like me,

1005
00:43:15,763 --> 00:43:17,098
-he can't get laid!"
-Exactly.

1006
00:43:17,231 --> 00:43:18,567
We-- he'll never kiss anyone,
I don't know--

1007
00:43:18,699 --> 00:43:20,434
Exactly, I'm not
in the club anymore.

1008
00:43:21,268 --> 00:43:24,839
If you really don't understand
what <i>Doctor Who</i> is,

1009
00:43:24,972 --> 00:43:27,441
the essence of it--
and I think most people

1010
00:43:27,576 --> 00:43:31,045
who are not rabid fans, or fans,
or-- or really are into the,

1011
00:43:31,178 --> 00:43:32,746

00:51:23,885 --> 00:51:28,322
and all you need is
20,000 by the end of the week.

1179
00:51:28,455 --> 00:51:30,758
-Josh."
-[Vanessa laughing]

1180
00:51:41,636 --> 00:51:44,171
This thing
that I was gonna be part of

1181
00:51:44,304 --> 00:51:46,373
is-- is so big.

1182
00:51:47,041 --> 00:51:48,275
And...

1183
00:51:49,343 --> 00:51:52,513
and, uh, you know,
I got left behind.

1184
00:51:56,517 --> 00:52:00,088
And I got so close to, you know,

1185
00:52:00,220 --> 00:52:04,826
kind of being my ticket
to security.

1186
00:52:06,894 --> 00:52:08,161
[snorts]

1187
00:52:10,865 --> 00:52:14,134
[indistinct chatter]

1188
00:52:20,273 --> 00:52:21,643
[Ken Deep]
I'm so glad you're here.

1189
00:52:21,776 --> 00:52:23,410
-Huge fan of the '96 movie.
-[Matthew] Oh.

1190
00:52:23,544 --> 00:52:25,145
And here we are-- I-- I--
this is so cool!

1191
00:52:25,278 --> 00:52:26,446
It was lovely. It was so lovely.

1192
00:52:26,581 --> 00:52:30,450
And-- and I-- I'm a-- I--
you know, it's--

1193
00:52:30,585 --> 00:52:32,787
it's very meaningful
for me to be here.

1194
00:52:32,920 --> 00:52:34,656
[Ken] Two things
about being a <i>Doctor Who</i> fan.

1195
00:52:34,789 --> 00:52:38,392
One is to be able to make
that contact...

1196
00:52:38,526 --> 00:52:40,128
-[Matthew] Yeah.
-[Ken] ...with people I admire

1197
00:52:40,260 --> 00:52:41,796
-and all my heroes.
-[Matthew] Yeah.

1198
00:52:41,929 --> 00:52:44,498
And the second thing is,
to bring them to my home.

1199
00:52:44,632 --> 00:52:46,634
-Yes--
-They're not at my house,

1200
00:52:46,768 --> 00:52:48,435
but they're at my home,
they're on my island.

1201
00:52:48,569 --> 00:52:50,270
[Ken] You have now
come to Long Island,

1202
00:52:50,404 --> 00:52:52,205
you've seen things,
you've driven on a parkway

1203
00:52:52,339 --> 00:52:53,641
I drive-- drive on

1204
00:52:53,775 --> 00:52:54,976
-every day I go to work.
-[Matthew] Yeah, yeah.

1205
00:52:55,109 --> 00:52:56,309
I'm driving along, and I go,

1206
00:52:56,443 --> 00:52:58,613
"Wow! Matthew drove on this,"
right?

1207
00:53:03,216 --> 00:53:04,351
I'm starting to realize,

1208
00:53:04,484 --> 00:53:06,954
maybe it's not all about
the show at all.

1209
00:53:07,622 --> 00:53:10,390
It's about the--
the sense of community

1210
00:53:10,525 --> 00:53:14,896
and companionship
that they find with each other.

1211
00:53:19,399 --> 00:53:21,334
Do you have
the Eighth Doctor at all?

1212
00:53:21,468 --> 00:53:22,537
[vendor]
What, like an action figure?

1213
00:53:22,670 --> 00:53:24,371
-[Matthew] Yeah.
-[vendor] Um...

1214
00:53:25,807 --> 00:53:28,475
not sure, it'd be over there,
if it is.

1215
00:53:28,609 --> 00:53:30,078
[Matthew]
It would be over there.

1216
00:53:30,945 --> 00:53:32,312
-All right.
-Can't vouch for it,

1217
00:53:32,446 --> 00:53:33,981
-I'm sorry.
-Okay. No, no worries.

1218
00:53:34,716 --> 00:53:38,418
Now the question is,
am I finding that companionship

1219
00:53:38,553 --> 00:53:40,822
with this gang of people?

1220
00:53:46,426 --> 00:53:49,063
There's something
about the childlike,

1221
00:53:49,197 --> 00:53:54,535
uh, innocence and wonder
that <i>Doctor Who</i> gives us.

1222
00:53:54,669 --> 00:53:56,070
[Vanessa] What do you think
you're gonna be

1223
00:53:56,204 --> 00:53:58,271
-when you grow up?
-I'm really,

1224
00:53:58,405 --> 00:53:59,874
really want to be a scientist.

1225
00:54:00,007 --> 00:54:01,374
[Vanessa]
You want to be a scientist.

1226
00:54:01,509 --> 00:54:02,744
So tell me about that.

1227
00:54:03,511 --> 00:54:06,147
I have been studying rocks...

1228
00:54:06,781 --> 00:54:10,585
and minerals,
and I am also really in--

1229
00:54:10,718 --> 00:54:12,820
interested in finding fossils.

1230
00:54:14,956 --> 00:54:17,225
Putting aside your--
your dad's involvement

1231
00:54:17,390 --> 00:54:20,027
with being in <i>The Gunfighters,</i>
you were a <i>Doctor Who</i> fan.

1232
00:54:20,161 --> 00:54:22,329
You-- it was, it was a show
you knew and loved.

1233
00:54:22,462 --> 00:54:24,132
[actor on TV]
<i>Are you Doc Holliday?</i>

1234
00:54:24,264 --> 00:54:25,767
-[gunshot on TV]
-[woman screaming on TV]

1235
00:54:28,268 --> 00:54:31,105
[Matthew laughing] Sorry.

1236
00:54:31,806 --> 00:54:33,808
[interviewer]
He was a murdering maniac.

1237
00:54:33,941 --> 00:54:35,375
-[Matthew] Yeah.
-[interviewer] Yeah.

1238
00:54:35,510 --> 00:54:36,944
I think I was behind
the picture there.

1239
00:54:37,078 --> 00:54:38,613
[interviewer] Yes,
we finally get our first view

1240
00:54:38,746 --> 00:54:40,148
-of the saloon set.
-That's right.

1241
00:54:40,280 --> 00:54:41,682
[interviewer] It's down.
It's just starting to, sort of--

1242
00:54:41,816 --> 00:54:43,383
Suddenly
it's all starting to come back.

1243
00:54:43,518 --> 00:54:44,852
-[interviewer] Yes.
-Yes, no.

1244
00:54:44,986 --> 00:54:46,754
I have a wonderful
treat watching these, yes.

1245
00:54:46,888 --> 00:54:48,623
-[interviewer] Mm-hmm, do you--
-So, I wa-- yeah,

1246
00:54:48,756 --> 00:54:51,025
I was probably very pleased
that my dad was shooting people.

1247
00:54:51,159 --> 00:54:52,760
[interviewer] Jackie Lane
is famous, kind of,

1248
00:54:52,894 --> 00:54:54,327
for almost vanishing
from <i>Doctor Who</i> fandom,

1249
00:54:54,461 --> 00:54:55,997
and has never really done
a convention

1250
00:54:56,130 --> 00:54:58,431
or been interviewed about
her time on <i>Doctor Who.</i>

1251
00:54:58,566 --> 00:55:00,333
Do you remember
meeting her on set,

1252
00:55:00,467 --> 00:55:02,003
-or seeing her--
-[Matthew] Yes, yes,

1253
00:55:02,136 --> 00:55:03,638
-I did meet her.
-Mm-hmm.

1254
00:55:03,771 --> 00:55:07,642
This is strange story, I mean,
it's all a half memory,

1255
00:55:07,775 --> 00:55:11,846
but my father, um, uh,
my-- my father w--

1256
00:55:13,548 --> 00:55:15,950
my father was bipolar.

1257
00:55:16,449 --> 00:55:18,886
So sometimes he would be,
you know,

1258
00:55:19,020 --> 00:55:21,689
manic, and sometimes
he would be depressed,

1259
00:55:21,823 --> 00:55:25,492
and in those days it was
a perilous kind of illness.

1260
00:55:25,626 --> 00:55:30,531
And one day he put together
a village fete,

1261
00:55:30,665 --> 00:55:32,432
where we lived out in Essex,

1262
00:55:32,567 --> 00:55:37,004
and he invited her
to be the celebrity who came

1263
00:55:37,138 --> 00:55:39,540
and, you know,
opened the village fete.

1264
00:55:39,674 --> 00:55:42,977
Um, and so my memory was
us picking her up

1265
00:55:43,110 --> 00:55:46,547
from Harlow Town station,
and I was very excited.

1266
00:55:47,014 --> 00:55:49,116
And Dad had said,
"You! You-- you, Matthew

1267
00:55:49,250 --> 00:55:50,551
you know,
you can play the guitar,

1268
00:55:50,685 --> 00:55:53,087
and you can sing
Leonard Cohen songs.

1269
00:55:53,221 --> 00:55:55,656
Um, so you're gonna dress up
a minstrel.

1270
00:55:55,790 --> 00:55:58,793
Um, uh, and walk around
the fete singing,

1271
00:55:58,926 --> 00:56:01,729
'Suzanne took me down,'"
that kind of thing,

1272
00:56:01,863 --> 00:56:03,396
uh, which of course,
I was a little kid,

1273
00:56:03,531 --> 00:56:04,866
it was totally weird.

1274
00:56:04,999 --> 00:56:06,466
Everybody ignored me,
and I was very upset,

1275
00:56:06,601 --> 00:56:08,836
but she was, I think,
quite sympathetic.

1276
00:56:08,970 --> 00:56:10,771
[interviewer]
You are on hallowed ground.

1277
00:56:10,905 --> 00:56:12,707
You have actually been able to--
actually get to speak with her,

1278
00:56:12,840 --> 00:56:14,075
and, uh, have a relationship.

1279
00:56:14,208 --> 00:56:15,408
Well, I wonder why
she didn't turn up?

1280
00:56:15,543 --> 00:56:16,911
You know, maybe--

1281
00:56:17,044 --> 00:56:18,378
[interviewer]
I hope we didn't scare her off.

1282
00:56:18,512 --> 00:56:19,379
Maybe that's why
I kept away as well.

1283
00:56:19,513 --> 00:56:20,681
[interviewer] Possibly.

1284
00:56:20,815 --> 00:56:21,916
Being connected with my dad,
yeah.

1285
00:56:23,784 --> 00:56:25,586
[Matthew] I think
most of my work's intertwined

1286
00:56:25,720 --> 00:56:27,788
with my relationship
with my father,

1287
00:56:27,922 --> 00:56:31,959
and with a very turbulent era
of my life.

1288
00:56:32,360 --> 00:56:33,594
This is me.

1289
00:56:34,228 --> 00:56:37,832
Looking a little bit shocked,
basically.

1290
00:56:38,266 --> 00:56:42,603
Where the big shift
that happened around 1963,

1291
00:56:42,737 --> 00:56:44,672
which is when
my mother committed suicide.

1292
00:56:45,072 --> 00:56:49,310
And when the whole life shifted
in this giant gear.

1293
00:56:49,442 --> 00:56:53,014
And even though
it wasn't like I'm going around

1294
00:56:53,147 --> 00:56:56,217
every time I see <i>Doctor Who,</i>
I-- you know,

1295
00:56:56,350 --> 00:56:57,685
I turn into...

1296
00:56:58,786 --> 00:57:00,922
Bates Motel. [hums Psycho theme]

1297
00:57:01,055 --> 00:57:02,723
[laughing] Um, you know,
it's f--

1298
00:57:02,857 --> 00:57:07,795
it is-- it is, um, it is
a very seminal part of my life,

1299
00:57:07,929 --> 00:57:11,065
the early '60s, um,
and then it stayed

1300
00:57:11,198 --> 00:57:13,935
as a constant reminder,
that is <i>Doctor Who.</i>

1301
00:57:14,068 --> 00:57:16,170
I think that it applies
to a lot of people.

1302
00:57:16,304 --> 00:57:21,208
A lot of people hold onto,
um, their memories

1303
00:57:21,342 --> 00:57:25,212
of TV shows at certain points
in their lives.

1304
00:57:26,514 --> 00:57:27,782
[Daphne]
All right, just forget it.

1305
00:57:27,915 --> 00:57:29,383
We're gonna take a picture.
All right.

1306
00:57:29,517 --> 00:57:32,353
[Matthew] I see we have
a very young fan down there.

1307
00:57:32,485 --> 00:57:33,788
-How new are you?
-Two years.

1308
00:57:33,921 --> 00:57:36,757
My mom was re-watching
the whole series...

1309
00:57:37,591 --> 00:57:40,227
and so I was just like, "Oh,
what is this she's watching?"

1310
00:57:40,361 --> 00:57:44,265
And then that's when
my Whovian-ship started.

1311
00:57:44,398 --> 00:57:45,933
[audience laughing]

1312
00:57:46,734 --> 00:57:47,835
My favorite Doctor

1313
00:57:47,969 --> 00:57:49,704
-is Matt Smith.
-[Matthew] Ah.

1314
00:57:49,837 --> 00:57:52,273
And when I first discovered him,
I started to see

1315
00:57:52,406 --> 00:57:56,744
a lot of myself in him,
and as was brought up earlier,

1316
00:57:56,877 --> 00:57:59,947
I also was-- was bullied
quite a bit as a kid.

1317
00:58:00,081 --> 00:58:02,516
And I always felt ashamed
for being the odd man out,

1318
00:58:02,650 --> 00:58:05,286
and ever since Matt Smith,
he has helped me

1319
00:58:05,419 --> 00:58:08,389
to embrace the silliness
and just go out and have fun

1320
00:58:08,522 --> 00:58:10,191
and-- and do whatever.

1321
00:58:11,692 --> 00:58:13,627
[Matthew]
<i>So is fandom a form of escape?</i>

1322
00:58:13,761 --> 00:58:15,629
I don't feel an escape,
or a leap of faith.

1323
00:58:15,763 --> 00:58:18,966
I feel a close
emotional connection.

1324
00:58:20,334 --> 00:58:22,403
In some ways, I aspire as a fan,

1325
00:58:22,536 --> 00:58:24,171
I aspire to be like what I see.

1326
00:58:24,305 --> 00:58:27,241
But I also see myself reflected
in it,

1327
00:58:27,375 --> 00:58:29,210
um, so it's--
it's a learning experience

1328
00:58:29,343 --> 00:58:31,512
and it's also
an aspirational experience.

1329
00:58:31,645 --> 00:58:34,148
[audience applauding]

1330
00:58:48,462 --> 00:58:51,532
[audience cheering]

1331
00:58:53,968 --> 00:58:55,836
Snogged Madame de Pompadour.

1332
00:58:59,240 --> 00:59:00,641
[Shawna] Praise him.

1333
00:59:01,842 --> 00:59:03,544
Praise him!

1334
00:59:03,677 --> 00:59:07,048
[inhuman growling]

1335
00:59:07,181 --> 00:59:11,652
I know I have the body
of a weak and feeble woman,

1336
00:59:11,786 --> 00:59:15,322
but I have the heart
and the stomach of a king!

1337
00:59:15,456 --> 00:59:17,958
And of a king of England, too!

1338
00:59:18,092 --> 00:59:21,295
And to think that Dalek,
or Zygon,

1339
00:59:21,429 --> 00:59:24,865
or any creature of the universe
should dare to invade

1340
00:59:24,999 --> 00:59:30,204
the borders of my realm,

Good Doctor!

The Doctor never a more noble
of a subject.

01:00:27,862 --> 01:00:29,864
It was easy, at first,
to kind of...

1353
01:00:30,331 --> 01:00:31,632
not laugh at it.

1354
01:00:31,765 --> 01:00:32,967
I mean, it's easy to lampoon,

1355
01:00:33,100 --> 01:00:34,268
and some of it
is worth laughin' at.

-[Matthew] Yeah, yeah.
-Come on. But...

and these meetings

1360
01:00:41,342 --> 01:00:43,310

I mean that sincerely.

really-- that's why--

a musical version

1376

-[audience member] Yes.
-Maybe you could write it.

Cause it lends itself.

but--

-Why?
-You know what?

1383
01:01:28,657 --> 01:01:29,790
[Matthew] Which-- which I wrote.

So my husband passed away,

completely unexpectedly,
in 2009.

01:04:33,608 --> 01:04:35,643
He had a heart condition,
and he just--

1453
01:04:35,777 --> 01:04:37,911
one minute he was here,
and the next minute he was gone.

1454
01:04:38,546 --> 01:04:42,617
And it was... pretty devastating
for my son and myself.

1455

Those quiet, silent times
between sunset and sunrise,

1456

And out of my sorrow.

1461
01:05:03,470 --> 01:05:05,205
And gave me
something to laugh at.

And look forward to.

01:05:07,542 --> 01:05:09,677
Without that,
I don't know where I would be.

01:05:13,480 --> 01:05:14,481
People come here

1465
01:05:14,616 --> 01:05:16,551
and they get involved
in time travel

1466
01:05:16,684 --> 01:05:19,521

what's going on outside,

1467

there's a lot of things

1468

want to even talk about.

kind of loaded, and...

-Um, complex questions.
-[Matthew] Okay.

1479

-You're gonna be fantastic.
-[Matthew] Um, I will.

01:06:43,938 --> 01:06:45,205
-Me?
-[Matthew] Yeah.

1506
01:06:45,339 --> 01:06:48,275
I'd like to say,
you two need to get

1507
01:06:48,408 --> 01:06:49,744
a sense of humor, though.

1508
01:06:50,444 --> 01:06:51,513
Oh, look!

1509
01:06:57,184 --> 01:06:59,821
[attendees cheering, applauding]

1510
01:06:59,954 --> 01:07:04,091
[muffled announcement]

1511
01:07:10,364 --> 01:07:14,134
[harp music playing]

1512
01:07:18,973 --> 01:07:20,274
[man] We're here.

1513
01:07:20,407 --> 01:07:21,876
[Vanessa] Scene 30 off the tape,
one, mark it.

1514
01:07:22,010 --> 01:07:23,912
[Matthew] In my mind, why not?
Maybe I shouldn't be.

1515
01:07:24,044 --> 01:07:26,814
But, here. I want to show you
something before we start.

1516
01:07:26,948 --> 01:07:29,017
[Vanessa] Then tell me
why you're freaking out.

1517
01:07:29,984 --> 01:07:32,185
We were just filming--
we were just filming,

1518
01:07:32,319 --> 01:07:34,889
uh, Paul, but look.

1519
01:07:35,023 --> 01:07:37,190
I... [sighs] ...wait a sec.

1520
01:07:39,827 --> 01:07:41,061
I mean--

1521
01:07:41,495 --> 01:07:44,799
[indistinct chatter
& laughter on video]

1522
01:07:49,904 --> 01:07:51,305
This is him getting his cake.

1523
01:07:51,438 --> 01:07:53,541
[indistinct chatter on video]

1524
01:07:57,545 --> 01:07:59,781
[cheering and applause on video]

1525
01:08:04,819 --> 01:08:05,787
My hands are shaking.

1526
01:08:05,920 --> 01:08:08,488
[indistinct chatter on video]

1527
01:08:11,559 --> 01:08:14,596
And it was like-- the--
it was like the Pope.

1528
01:08:15,295 --> 01:08:19,701
It was-- seriously.
He was, um, oh gosh.

1529
01:08:19,834 --> 01:08:22,502
Everybody had
their cell phones up.

1530
01:08:23,437 --> 01:08:25,272
I was relatively close.

1531
01:08:32,046 --> 01:08:33,014
So sweet.

1532
01:08:33,146 --> 01:08:35,415
[video playing from phone]

1533
01:08:37,451 --> 01:08:39,053
[Vanessa] That's really cool.

1534
01:08:39,186 --> 01:08:41,522
I think at the end of the day,
I'm a bigger fan than I knew!

1535
01:08:41,656 --> 01:08:44,424
[indistinct chatter on video]

1536
01:09:13,087 --> 01:09:14,856
[man on screen]
<i>I'll be back just as soon</i>

1537
01:09:14,989 --> 01:09:18,425
<i>as you've finished</i>
<i>bringing up my character.</i>

1538
01:09:18,559 --> 01:09:20,193
[Vanessa] But you were there
when you were a kid.

1539
01:09:20,327 --> 01:09:22,496
Yeah, I mean, I was on the set.

1540
01:09:22,630 --> 01:09:25,298
I was by there,
it was like the best day ever.

1541
01:09:29,202 --> 01:09:31,539
[gunshots firing on film]

1542
01:09:32,874 --> 01:09:34,742
And it was not long after

1543
01:09:34,876 --> 01:09:37,111
my mother's death
and all that jazz, yeah.

1544
01:09:37,612 --> 01:09:39,647
Uh, and he was on the verge of--

1545
01:09:39,781 --> 01:09:42,482
of a breakdown anyway
when that happened.

1546
01:09:42,617 --> 01:09:44,085
[gunshots firing on film]

1547
01:09:44,217 --> 01:09:46,854
It was a shitty childhood,
and <i>Doctor Who</i> was

1548
01:09:47,155 --> 01:09:50,091
part of that shitty childhood,
at the end of the day.

1549
01:09:50,792 --> 01:09:53,561
Uh, I mean--
I could be sentimental

1550
01:09:53,695 --> 01:09:57,397
and say it was a respite,
it was a place to run to.

1551
01:09:57,532 --> 01:09:59,634
Uh, sadly films were...

1552
01:10:00,333 --> 01:10:01,903
uh, and still are.

1553
01:10:02,036 --> 01:10:03,838
[man on film]
<i>Here come the lights.</i>

1554
01:10:06,841 --> 01:10:10,978
-[man on film] <i>Now!</i>
-[gunshots on film]

1555
01:10:12,747 --> 01:10:14,182
[man on film] <i>Get 'em.</i>

1556
01:10:15,282 --> 01:10:17,785
[Vanessa] I'd say that
you are a fan now, for sure.

1557
01:10:18,152 --> 01:10:19,654
Yeah. Well, maybe...

1558
01:10:20,021 --> 01:10:22,023
I'm as screwed up
as the rest of them.

1559
01:10:22,156 --> 01:10:23,290
I mean, cause, let's face it,

1560
01:10:23,423 --> 01:10:25,560
a pretty screwed-up
bunch of people.

1561
01:10:26,728 --> 01:10:28,462
I mean, not screwed-up,
they're very real.

1562
01:10:28,596 --> 01:10:30,164
You know what I mean,
I can't say they're screwed-up,

1563
01:10:30,297 --> 01:10:31,733
but, uh--
but there's-- there's--

1564
01:10:31,866 --> 01:10:33,868
uh, you know, every--
each one of them looks like

1565
01:10:34,001 --> 01:10:36,137
they're dealing
with either being bullied,

1566
01:10:36,269 --> 01:10:40,340
or-- or, you know,
some crisis that they went to,

1567
01:10:40,474 --> 01:10:42,275
and they moved to Manhattan,

1568
01:10:42,409 --> 01:10:44,912
but they found a friend,
you know.

1569
01:10:45,046 --> 01:10:49,382
Everybody's crisis, uh,
it ha-- seems to be

1570
01:10:49,517 --> 01:10:54,622
how they resolve their crisis,
that they attach to The Doctor,

1571
01:10:54,756 --> 01:10:56,724
and I'm beginning to realize
it's the same.

1572
01:10:56,858 --> 01:10:58,492
[Vanessa] There's still joy
to be had there.

1573
01:10:58,626 --> 01:11:00,094
[Matthew] Well, there is
with making this film.

1574
01:11:00,228 --> 01:11:01,294
This is joyous.

1575
01:11:01,763 --> 01:11:03,497
Uh, and look at those people.

1576
01:11:03,631 --> 01:11:05,066
They-- how happy they were.

1577
01:11:05,199 --> 01:11:07,400
-[Vanessa] A community.
-No, it is, definitely is.

1578
01:11:07,535 --> 01:11:09,704
But will I come back
to another convention?

1579
01:11:10,337 --> 01:11:11,739
Uh, who knows.

1580
01:11:11,873 --> 01:11:15,176
You know, will I sort of
be circling my past forever?

1581
01:11:15,308 --> 01:11:17,044
I don't think I can do that.

1582
01:11:17,845 --> 01:11:19,881
It's cheaper than therapy,
I suppose.

1583
01:11:24,018 --> 01:11:27,588
My father was in a show
that was set in America,

1584
01:11:27,722 --> 01:11:30,158
and I ended up writing a show

1585
01:11:30,290 --> 01:11:31,926
the <i>Doctor Who</i> set in America.

1586
01:11:32,059 --> 01:11:34,996
Um, uh, you know,
and so there's a lot of sort of

1587
01:11:35,129 --> 01:11:40,134
synchronicity there that is
strangely moving, in a way.

1588
01:11:40,268 --> 01:11:41,602
-[fan] What...
-Yes.

1589
01:11:41,736 --> 01:11:43,104
...would you consider
to be the best period

1590
01:11:43,237 --> 01:11:45,873
for when you when you worked
in film and stuff?

1591
01:11:46,007 --> 01:11:47,875
You know,
the most enjoyable for you?

1592
01:11:48,009 --> 01:11:49,610
-For me, the best period?
-[fan] Yes.

1593
01:11:49,744 --> 01:11:51,179
Actually, right now.

1594
01:11:52,079 --> 01:11:55,016
To be honest,
making stuff like this,

1595
01:11:55,149 --> 01:11:56,349
making small films

1596
01:11:56,483 --> 01:11:58,586
and Hollywood's
an ageist industry,

1597
01:11:58,719 --> 01:12:01,055
so as you get a little older,
you have to find

1598
01:12:01,189 --> 01:12:02,657
other ways of making films.

1599
01:12:02,790 --> 01:12:07,094
And I've stopped waiting
for permission to make films.

1600
01:12:09,096 --> 01:12:11,098
It's a touching thing
that you guys have done,

1601
01:12:11,232 --> 01:12:12,365
putting together these clips.

1602
01:12:12,499 --> 01:12:13,701
It's really nice.

1603
01:12:14,235 --> 01:12:16,436
[panel member]
Ah, it's-- it's part of LI Who

1604
01:12:16,571 --> 01:12:18,039
-that's doing this.
-Yeah.

1605
01:12:18,172 --> 01:12:19,507
[panel staff] They're putting
all of this together.

1606
01:12:19,640 --> 01:12:21,075
-But, uh--
-No, I mean, really nice.

1607
01:12:21,209 --> 01:12:22,743
[audience applauding]

1608
01:12:22,877 --> 01:12:25,445
Thank you. Thank you very much.

1609
01:12:25,746 --> 01:12:28,916
This was fantastic! Oh, my God.

1610
01:12:31,252 --> 01:12:33,486
[tram rumbling]

1611
01:12:35,488 --> 01:12:36,757
Hey there!

1612
01:12:37,992 --> 01:12:39,060
Hello?

1613
01:12:40,528 --> 01:12:41,963
You guys--

1614
01:12:42,096 --> 01:12:45,933
Oh, okay. Um, I'll--
I'll see if the buzzer works.

1615
01:12:46,067 --> 01:12:48,536
-Nice to see you.
-Good to see you too.

1616
01:12:48,669 --> 01:12:50,071
-Ooh, sorry!
-[Matthew] Oops, sorry.

1617
01:12:50,204 --> 01:12:51,672
-[Greg] Good to see you.
-[Matthew] Good to see you.

1618
01:12:51,806 --> 01:12:54,275
Hello.
So are you moving tomorrow?

1619
01:12:54,407 --> 01:12:56,711
The moving people come tomorrow.

1620
01:12:56,844 --> 01:12:58,713
This is what,
when I graduated middle school?

1621
01:12:58,846 --> 01:13:00,413
-[Matthew] Yeah.
-It's a lot of stuff!

1622
01:13:00,548 --> 01:13:02,917
Three thous--
3000 pounds as well?

1623
01:13:03,050 --> 01:13:06,053
Who knows, it may not be
that much stuff.

1624
01:13:06,187 --> 01:13:07,487
Hey, how's it going, gang?

1625
01:13:07,622 --> 01:13:09,056
Greg's here.
[Greg] What's up, Josh?

1626
01:13:09,190 --> 01:13:10,791
-[Greg] Hey. Good to see you.
-[Josh] How are you?

1627
01:13:10,925 --> 01:13:12,492
[woman] Hey, Laura. How are you?

1628
01:13:12,627 --> 01:13:13,828
-[Laura] How are you?
-[woman] Good to see you.

1629
01:13:15,563 --> 01:13:17,098
[Josh] We see each other
on the holidays,

1630
01:13:17,231 --> 01:13:18,866
and every once in a while,
and when you come up, and so--

1631
01:13:19,000 --> 01:13:20,735
[Matthew] Yeah. And you'll be
able to come down to LA.

1632
01:13:20,868 --> 01:13:22,303
[Josh] Yeah, and now
I got someone to stay with

1633
01:13:22,435 --> 01:13:24,872
in Los Feliz, so actually,
this is pretty awesome.

1634
01:13:28,242 --> 01:13:29,977
[Matthew] Sorry
about filming this, guys.

1635
01:13:30,111 --> 01:13:32,680
[Josh] Dude! It's not--
it's not like that.

1636
01:13:32,813 --> 01:13:34,481
[Greg] Don't worry about it.
It's all good.

1637
01:13:36,117 --> 01:13:38,386
-[Josh] We knew what to expect.
-Ah, okay.

1638
01:13:38,519 --> 01:13:39,620
And dude, it's you.
You grew up--

1639
01:13:39,754 --> 01:13:41,289
we grew up in a movie.

1640
01:13:41,421 --> 01:13:42,790
Like, remember
when we were kids,

1641
01:13:42,924 --> 01:13:44,926
and we used to make movies
all the time?

1642
01:13:45,059 --> 01:13:47,460
-[girl] <i>It was you!</i>
-[boy] <i>It wasn't!</i>

1643
01:13:47,595 --> 01:13:50,164
-[girl] <i>He made me do it!</i>
<i>-Action!</i>

1644
01:13:50,298 --> 01:13:52,533
<i>No, it wasn't!</i>
<i>It wasn't me at all!</i>

1645
01:13:52,667 --> 01:13:53,968
<i>Here!</i>

1646
01:13:55,169 --> 01:13:56,637
<i>Stay away from me!</i>

1647
01:13:56,771 --> 01:13:58,606
<i>Stay away from me,</i>
<i>or the little one gets it!</i>

1648
01:13:59,173 --> 01:14:02,944
[Josh] <i>You moved the body!</i>
<i>He did, he did!</i>

1649
01:14:03,476 --> 01:14:05,846
<i>You're right!</i>
<i>You're right!</i> [voice cracking]

1650
01:14:08,015 --> 01:14:09,216
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

1651
01:14:10,284 --> 01:14:11,585
<i>I didn't mean to make you do it.</i>

1652
01:14:11,719 --> 01:14:13,654
<i>Just had a dreadful childhood.</i>

1653
01:14:17,425 --> 01:14:20,127
[Greg] I mean, you decided to do
something different, right?

1654
01:14:20,261 --> 01:14:22,763
To focus on your career
in a different way.

1655
01:14:22,897 --> 01:14:24,298
Does that say
anything about who you are,

1656
01:14:24,432 --> 01:14:25,733
or have you changed?

1657
01:14:25,866 --> 01:14:28,002
Yeah, maybe
I've been the Doctor.

1658
01:14:28,135 --> 01:14:31,706
-[woman] Hmm.
-Maybe I'm regenerating.

1659
01:14:32,673 --> 01:14:34,675
Which is sweet,
do you know what I'm saying?

1660
01:14:34,809 --> 01:14:36,744
-It's-- it's nice.
-[woman] Sweet 16.

1661
01:14:36,877 --> 01:14:38,412
You know, going off
into the sweet 60.

1662
01:14:38,546 --> 01:14:40,915
Not sweet 16, yes,
that's very true.

1663
01:14:41,048 --> 01:14:43,483
["The Fire"
by Laura Gibson playing]

1664
01:14:51,726 --> 01:14:54,028
[Matthew]
There is a new Doctor born

1665
01:14:54,161 --> 01:14:57,231
at the end of each series,
and I think that happens

1666
01:14:57,365 --> 01:15:00,001
to us all when we go through
certain stages in life.

1667
01:15:00,568 --> 01:15:05,072
We regenerate, and then
