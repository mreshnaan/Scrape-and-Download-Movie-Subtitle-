1
00:05:03,125 --> 00:05:04,525
Nice work!

2
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:06,353
That takes the cake!

3
00:05:08,096 --> 00:05:11,430
Hey, come help me.
Hurry up, we'll carry it together.

4
00:05:53,532 --> 00:05:55,576
What are you daydreaming about?!

5
00:05:58,103 --> 00:05:59,309
Oh, I see.

6
00:05:59,777 --> 00:06:01,200
Lewd things, again.

7
00:06:01,783 --> 00:06:05,083
That's not it,
you uncultivated woman!

8
00:06:05,506 --> 00:06:07,099
Can't you see what this is?

9
00:06:07,441 --> 00:06:09,069
No? Can't you see?

10
00:06:09,341 --> 00:06:11,019
It's a Foujita!

11
00:06:11,549 --> 00:06:14,055
Foujita, the painter!

12
00:06:14,752 --> 00:06:17,063
He sells quite well,
that Japanese fellow.

13
00:06:17,191 --> 00:06:20,067
This painting is well known, too.
Kiki is his model.

14
00:06:20,151 --> 00:06:22,367
- Who?
- Kiki, I'm telling you!

15
00:06:23,754 --> 00:06:25,490
Come, I'll show you something.

16
00:06:31,653 --> 00:06:32,780
Stop that!

17
00:06:32,854 --> 00:06:34,254
Don't move!

18
00:06:34,665 --> 00:06:36,327
I'll give you Kiki's eyes.

19
00:06:36,467 --> 00:06:38,800
They call her
the Queen of Montparnasse.

20
00:06:43,341 --> 00:06:46,834
Back when she had no money,
she'd use matches to do her make-up.

21
00:06:47,530 --> 00:06:49,240
Look at me now.

22
00:06:51,610 --> 00:06:53,270
How beautiful!

23
00:06:53,823 --> 00:06:56,745
I don't want to look like a whore!

24
00:08:00,341 --> 00:08:03,175
Master, Kiki has been delivered.

25
00:08:05,180 --> 00:08:06,739
Some wind today, huh?

26
00:08:06,844 --> 00:08:08,779
Master, what's wrong with you?

27
00:08:08,879 --> 00:08:10,733
Wait, wait, wait!

28
00:08:10,848 --> 00:08:12,564
Here's your receipt.

29
00:08:13,016 --> 00:08:16,618
Master, what are you doing?
What's the matter?

30
00:08:38,066 --> 00:08:40,360
<i>Oishii saké-san.</i>

31
00:08:45,794 --> 00:08:48,764
Your Japanese pronunciation
is very good.

32
00:08:49,113 --> 00:08:51,514
But that is not a Japanese name.

33
00:08:52,301 --> 00:08:55,032
It means "the good saké."

34
00:08:55,237 --> 00:08:57,399
No! Is that so?

35
00:08:58,507 --> 00:08:59,668
That's weird.

36
00:09:00,893 --> 00:09:02,452
You know, about my painting,

37
00:09:02,845 --> 00:09:04,814
the first buyer was Japanese.

38
00:09:05,648 --> 00:09:07,139
And that was his name.

39
00:09:07,993 --> 00:09:09,812
I remember it perfectly.

40
00:09:13,464 --> 00:09:14,591
Oshi.

41
00:09:15,124 --> 00:09:16,319
Sakai.

42
00:09:17,393 --> 00:09:19,362
That name exists.

43
00:09:21,808 --> 00:09:23,572
<i>Oishii saké.</i>

44
00:09:24,126 --> 00:09:25,933
Yes, that's it.

45
00:09:33,961 --> 00:09:35,542
But, Fernande,

46
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:41,035
you don't paint anymore?
Did you stop?

47
00:09:42,351 --> 00:09:43,788
It's not that...

48
00:09:44,622 --> 00:09:45,932
I don't paint anymore.

49
00:09:47,624 --> 00:09:48,672
Why?

50
00:09:50,059 --> 00:09:51,789
No, it's nothing.

51
00:09:55,177 --> 00:09:56,844
You can paint here if you want.

52
00:09:57,712 --> 00:09:59,439
I reckon it's not
the most comfortable.

53
00:10:04,429 --> 00:10:06,426
I will sell your paintings,
you know.

54
00:10:07,764 --> 00:10:09,136
You must apply yourself.

55
00:10:31,662 --> 00:10:33,858
You've forbidden me
to enter your studio.

56
00:10:34,048 --> 00:10:36,089
You see?
I keep my promises.

57
00:10:42,019 --> 00:10:43,988
It's bad faith on your part.

58
00:10:44,308 --> 00:10:47,676
You say I'm free,
that I can do what I desire,

59
00:10:48,245 --> 00:10:49,839
but you come out on top.

60
00:10:50,290 --> 00:10:52,391
In the end, I come out a slut.

61
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:55,889
Is that what you wanted?

62
00:10:56,993 --> 00:10:58,007
Very well.

63
00:10:59,928 --> 00:11:01,314
You're wrong.

64
00:11:02,130 --> 00:11:04,865
I don't force you to do anything,
you don't force me either.

65
00:11:05,782 --> 00:11:07,273
We each make our choices.

66
00:11:07,486 --> 00:11:11,479
The stairs of life
can be taken a step at a time.

67
00:11:35,446 --> 00:11:38,294
Selling your paintings
made you really arrogant.

68
00:11:40,568 --> 00:11:42,424
Did you forget
who made you successful?

69
00:11:42,685 --> 00:11:44,604
Did you forget everything
I did for you?

70
00:11:58,579 --> 00:12:01,912
And remember who showed you
how a French girl kisses!

71
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:29,621
Fou-fou!

72
00:12:30,867 --> 00:12:32,086
Where are you going?

73
00:12:33,443 --> 00:12:35,263
Do you know where van Dongen is?

74
00:12:36,316 --> 00:12:37,841
At <i>La Rotonde.</i>

75
00:12:40,854 --> 00:12:42,416
But, it's on the other side.

76
00:12:45,836 --> 00:12:47,162
Yes, yes.

77
00:12:47,387 --> 00:12:48,681
I know.

78
00:13:05,315 --> 00:13:07,459
Hot wine!

79
00:13:09,195 --> 00:13:11,187
Get your hot wine!

80
00:13:18,198 --> 00:13:19,830
Hot wine!

81
00:13:46,123 --> 00:13:47,850
Good evening, daddy Libion.

82
00:13:49,048 --> 00:13:50,853
Today I posed for Man.

83
00:13:52,281 --> 00:13:53,715
He's good looking, Man.

84
00:13:53,908 --> 00:13:55,825
Daddy, daddy.

85
00:13:57,035 --> 00:13:59,170
Everyone who's pennyless
calls you daddy,

86
00:13:59,278 --> 00:14:02,451
so won't you buy me a round,
daddy?

87
00:14:02,738 --> 00:14:05,194
Can the gentleman paint?

88
00:14:05,488 --> 00:14:07,364
Can the gentleman pose?

89
00:14:11,566 --> 00:14:12,816
For the Queen!

90
00:14:22,425 --> 00:14:23,425
Kiki!

91
00:14:24,971 --> 00:14:27,600
Come and teach these beginners
what it takes...

92
00:14:28,136 --> 00:14:30,832
to be a good model.

93
00:14:31,409 --> 00:14:33,657
There is nothing to learn.

94
00:14:35,202 --> 00:14:36,852
At first sight,

95
00:14:37,719 --> 00:14:39,359
there is nothing to learn.

96
00:14:39,700 --> 00:14:42,347
This is why
there is everything to learn.

97
00:14:42,929 --> 00:14:46,284
Here, Youki,
tell them the story of Utrillo.

98
00:14:47,612 --> 00:14:48,612
Me?

99
00:15:14,789 --> 00:15:16,262
Get undressed.

100
00:15:55,977 --> 00:15:57,138
One day,

101
00:16:00,835 --> 00:16:03,815
Utrillo descended from Montmartre

102
00:16:04,057 --> 00:16:05,655
to sketch Kiki.

103
00:16:07,704 --> 00:16:08,919
Of course,

104
00:16:09,474 --> 00:16:13,433
Uncle Utrillo descended from Montmartre,
with his bottle of wine.

105
00:16:20,083 --> 00:16:21,312
"I..."

106
00:16:24,602 --> 00:16:28,407
"I never show what I draw."

107
00:16:35,690 --> 00:16:38,728
But the moment he turned his back,

108
00:16:39,734 --> 00:16:42,164
Kiki looked at what he was drawing.

109
00:16:49,093 --> 00:16:51,124
It was a landscape.

110
00:16:55,046 --> 00:16:56,371
Nice one!

111
00:17:03,406 --> 00:17:04,905
Bravo! Bravo!

112
00:17:10,751 --> 00:17:13,277
For a sketch, that was a sketch!

113
00:17:15,459 --> 00:17:16,743
She was naked.

114
00:17:17,859 --> 00:17:20,617
And she was an appetizer
to go with his wine.

115
00:17:25,894 --> 00:17:26,894
Bravo!

116
00:17:26,940 --> 00:17:28,549
Bravo!
Bravo!

117
00:17:30,702 --> 00:17:32,364
For a good pose,

118
00:17:34,516 --> 00:17:36,062
you should stand like this.

119
00:17:41,338 --> 00:17:42,594
Be beautiful.

120
00:17:46,234 --> 00:17:47,461
And just not care.

121
00:17:48,546 --> 00:17:49,977
There's nothing to learn.

122
00:17:50,510 --> 00:17:51,539
However,

123
00:17:53,247 --> 00:17:57,810
if you want to know how the
Montparnasse art was invented,

124
00:17:59,203 --> 00:18:02,977
that, I can teach you.
And it concerns us all.

125
00:18:03,586 --> 00:18:05,453
Fou-fou, come help me.

126
00:18:06,078 --> 00:18:09,040
Oh, a new cocktail!

127
00:18:10,477 --> 00:18:11,797
For starters,

128
00:18:13,424 --> 00:18:15,422
a generous dose,

129
00:18:16,252 --> 00:18:18,250
a generous dose of Zadkine.

130
00:18:32,594 --> 00:18:35,922
Anyone here can guess where
this gentleman came from?

131
00:18:36,277 --> 00:18:37,328
Russia.

132
00:18:38,739 --> 00:18:40,211
Russia!

133
00:18:42,894 --> 00:18:44,453
Good answer!

134
00:18:45,437 --> 00:18:48,188
And next, next I'll add,

135
00:18:49,191 --> 00:18:51,195
three drops of van Dongen.

136
00:18:51,358 --> 00:18:53,844
For that sweet juniper taste
from the Netherlands.

137
00:18:57,148 --> 00:18:59,524
Then what, Fou-fou?

138
00:19:00,085 --> 00:19:02,406
You haven't put any beer yet.

139
00:19:05,323 --> 00:19:06,328
Yes!

140
00:19:06,519 --> 00:19:10,000
And a polish beer, Kisling!

141
00:19:11,233 --> 00:19:13,055
<i>Na zdrowie!</i>

142
00:19:13,231 --> 00:19:14,766
Ah, excuse me, Kiki,

143
00:19:14,984 --> 00:19:19,414
I have French citizenship, given to me
by the bullet that injured me!

144
00:19:19,668 --> 00:19:22,313
I am critically French, Madam!

145
00:19:24,555 --> 00:19:25,945
Bravo!

146
00:19:30,788 --> 00:19:31,788
Me,

147
00:19:32,284 --> 00:19:34,879
I was rejected from the legion.

148
00:19:35,703 --> 00:19:37,054
With Zadkine,

149
00:19:37,671 --> 00:19:40,866
we ended up making bandages

150
00:19:41,380 --> 00:19:43,539
for the Red Cross.

151
00:19:51,383 --> 00:19:54,063
So, Fou-fou, they don't have
any saké at <i>La Rotonde</i>?

152
00:19:55,890 --> 00:19:56,890
Yes, yes!

153
00:19:57,195 --> 00:19:59,016
Of course they do!

154
00:20:09,664 --> 00:20:10,679
Kiki!

155
00:20:10,898 --> 00:20:12,844
Did you put some Soutine?

156
00:20:15,066 --> 00:20:18,527
So, a double dose of vodka...

157
00:20:18,997 --> 00:20:21,662
from Belarus for Mr. Soutine.

158
00:20:21,887 --> 00:20:27,537
- Soutine!
- Soutine!

159
00:20:29,417 --> 00:20:30,448
Wait! Wait!

160
00:20:30,551 --> 00:20:31,827
Let us not forget,

161
00:20:31,917 --> 00:20:34,797
the only French painter here,
in the end, is Utrillo.

162
00:20:35,030 --> 00:20:36,591
Quick, wine!

163
00:20:56,384 --> 00:20:58,076
Bravo, Kiki!

164
00:20:58,340 --> 00:21:01,436
Drink the Montparnasse art.

165
00:22:21,837 --> 00:22:23,024
The full moon?

166
00:22:24,696 --> 00:22:25,704
The wolf.

167
00:22:29,486 --> 00:22:30,797
Not very original.

168
00:22:31,922 --> 00:22:32,961
And you?

169
00:22:34,280 --> 00:22:35,311
Water.

170
00:22:38,806 --> 00:22:39,828
Why?

171
00:22:42,850 --> 00:22:45,979
It's as if the moon
started to drip.

172
00:22:49,588 --> 00:22:51,555
That's a feeling I know well.

173
00:22:58,313 --> 00:23:00,164
<i>Under the Mirabeau bridge...</i>

174
00:23:01,097 --> 00:23:02,759
<i>flows the Seine</i>

175
00:23:04,821 --> 00:23:06,267
<i>And our loves</i>

176
00:23:07,829 --> 00:23:09,743
<i>Must I remember them</i>

177
00:23:13,367 --> 00:23:16,907
<i>Joy always followed pain</i>

178
00:23:19,751 --> 00:23:21,007
<i>The night falls...</i>

179
00:23:22,211 --> 00:23:23,712
<i>and the hours ring</i>

180
00:23:25,482 --> 00:23:27,041
<i>The days go away</i>

181
00:23:28,216 --> 00:23:29,680
<i>I remain</i>

182
00:23:41,798 --> 00:23:45,399
This is a poem for the exiled,
don't you think?

183
00:23:50,189 --> 00:23:51,649
Did you meet him?

184
00:23:52,326 --> 00:23:53,353
Apollinaire.

185
00:23:53,563 --> 00:23:54,563
Yes.

186
00:23:55,979 --> 00:23:58,860
At the Bateau-Lavoir,
with Picasso.

187
00:24:00,340 --> 00:24:04,297
In fact, it is where
Apollinaire met Marie.

188
00:24:05,566 --> 00:24:07,524
He fell in love instantly.

189
00:24:17,742 --> 00:24:21,696
How can you pierce the carpet
with the needle...

190
00:24:21,953 --> 00:24:23,118
in that position?

191
00:24:24,732 --> 00:24:26,347
I'm not piercing.

192
00:24:27,244 --> 00:24:29,264
The needles are bent...

193
00:24:30,882 --> 00:24:34,715
so I use them like a hook.

194
00:24:37,261 --> 00:24:39,125
Did you bend them yourself?

195
00:24:39,334 --> 00:24:40,392
But, of course.

196
00:24:43,226 --> 00:24:44,694
You're so strange.

197
00:24:56,047 --> 00:24:57,078
Tell me.

198
00:24:58,596 --> 00:25:00,060
I was wondering.

199
00:25:01,411 --> 00:25:03,813
Can I call you Fou-fou as well?

200
00:25:04,414 --> 00:25:05,848
Of course!

201
00:25:07,085 --> 00:25:09,816
But that means scatterbrained.

202
00:25:10,278 --> 00:25:12,024
It's not a very nice word.

203
00:25:12,446 --> 00:25:15,931
I know "scatterbrained"
means "a bit twisted"...

204
00:25:16,293 --> 00:25:17,849
like the needles.

205
00:25:18,530 --> 00:25:20,430
It's me.
Why not?

206
00:25:21,445 --> 00:25:23,352
Everyone calls me Fou-fou.

207
00:25:23,567 --> 00:25:25,900
That way, they remember me.

208
00:25:26,739 --> 00:25:28,944
Is it important
that people remember you?

209
00:25:29,242 --> 00:25:31,357
Very important, sure!

210
00:25:32,163 --> 00:25:34,907
I am a foreigner here.

211
00:25:36,675 --> 00:25:38,483
Even if my drawings are good,

212
00:25:38,982 --> 00:25:41,713
do you think they'll notice me

213
00:25:42,619 --> 00:25:44,542
if they don't know my name?

214
00:25:49,378 --> 00:25:50,879
How many years already?

215
00:25:52,691 --> 00:25:55,593
Ten.
I was 27.

216
00:26:05,976 --> 00:26:07,694
Five years for me.

217
00:26:14,729 --> 00:26:17,206
After my aunt died in Belgium.

218
00:26:19,820 --> 00:26:21,730
No, I'm not sad.

219
00:26:24,577 --> 00:26:26,252
I never wanted...

220
00:26:27,015 --> 00:26:29,342
a life like everybody else.

221
00:26:37,261 --> 00:26:39,334
A life like everybody else?

222
00:26:43,573 --> 00:26:45,167
What do you think, Fou-fou?

223
00:26:46,828 --> 00:26:48,180
You call that a life?

224
00:26:49,074 --> 00:26:51,114
An existence like ours?

225
00:26:52,171 --> 00:26:53,213
What?

226
00:26:53,839 --> 00:26:55,412
Live in a hotel?

227
00:26:58,292 --> 00:26:59,308
No.

228
00:27:01,784 --> 00:27:03,015
It's not that.

229
00:27:09,854 --> 00:27:10,957
I'm finished.

230
00:27:14,107 --> 00:27:16,721
Today, I baked bread.

231
00:27:17,362 --> 00:27:21,503
Can you find
what I cooked yesterday?

232
00:27:23,516 --> 00:27:25,124
Come on, take a guess.

233
00:31:10,658 --> 00:31:12,444
Master, can we strike a pose?

234
00:31:14,146 --> 00:31:15,405
No, no!

235
00:31:15,715 --> 00:31:17,707
<i>Sono mama, sono mama.</i>

236
00:31:20,378 --> 00:31:24,223
<i>"Sono mama</i>" means
"don't move" in Japanese.

237
00:31:25,014 --> 00:31:28,382
Therefore, <i>sono mama.</i>
Do you understand?

238
00:31:49,414 --> 00:31:52,227
Your standing posture is too bulky.

239
00:31:52,558 --> 00:31:53,890
Too bulky!

240
00:31:54,829 --> 00:31:58,357
Pretend that you just landed,

241
00:31:58,642 --> 00:32:00,316
that you just touched down.

242
00:32:10,768 --> 00:32:12,963
Free your senses.

243
00:32:13,681 --> 00:32:15,582
Spread your arms.

244
00:32:15,984 --> 00:32:17,748
Yes, good!

245
00:32:18,786 --> 00:32:21,088
That's it. Gently.

246
00:32:22,983 --> 00:32:26,131
Marie, is your ear bothering you?

247
00:32:26,600 --> 00:32:27,607
No.

248
00:33:15,510 --> 00:33:16,510
One!

249
00:33:17,412 --> 00:33:18,537
Two!

250
00:33:19,475 --> 00:33:20,966
Three! Go!

251
00:33:48,158 --> 00:33:49,180
Good morning.

252
00:33:50,855 --> 00:33:52,118
Don't go so fast.

253
00:33:52,981 --> 00:33:54,381
Slowly, slowly.

254
00:34:13,228 --> 00:34:14,463
I'm terribly sorry,

255
00:34:14,952 --> 00:34:17,581
a studio was finally available,

256
00:34:17,817 --> 00:34:21,002
but I'm afraid
others beat you to it.

257
00:34:21,587 --> 00:34:24,729
No, it's me who's sorry.

258
00:34:25,354 --> 00:34:27,284
So many of us showing up
without notice.

259
00:34:27,536 --> 00:34:29,424
You'll see, it's small...

260
00:34:29,651 --> 00:34:32,385
inside too.

261
00:34:33,939 --> 00:34:35,838
Please, take a closer look.

262
00:34:36,010 --> 00:34:38,393
Everyone is trying their best.

263
00:34:38,696 --> 00:34:39,696
Yes!

264
00:34:43,470 --> 00:34:45,823
Over 200 painters...

265
00:34:46,088 --> 00:34:48,471
are in the hive.

266
00:34:50,193 --> 00:34:53,391
In total, there might be tens
of thousands in Paris.

267
00:34:57,208 --> 00:34:59,336
Do you think you can win?

268
00:35:02,124 --> 00:35:03,963
This place's nickname,

269
00:35:04,613 --> 00:35:07,456
is the Villa Medici of Poverty.

270
00:35:11,560 --> 00:35:15,924
While this is not as respected
as the Medici residence is,

271
00:35:17,342 --> 00:35:19,334
I still cannot feel luckier.

272
00:35:21,935 --> 00:35:24,026
Paris is incredible!

273
00:35:25,578 --> 00:35:29,440
They accept any foreigner
regardless of their nationality.

274
00:35:29,959 --> 00:35:32,111
By the way,
Soutine came back yesterday.

275
00:35:32,464 --> 00:35:36,635
He had to throw rocks
at Chagall's studio.

276
00:35:37,684 --> 00:35:39,877
He broke a few windows too,
that fellow.

277
00:35:41,416 --> 00:35:44,617
He overdoes it a little,
even if he doesn't like him.

278
00:35:44,799 --> 00:35:48,992
The fact is, Soutine doesn't live here,
he's just passing by.

279
00:35:49,781 --> 00:35:50,797
Where's he staying?

280
00:35:53,050 --> 00:35:54,835
At everyone's.

281
00:35:55,641 --> 00:35:58,305
Modigliani did the same.

282
00:36:03,248 --> 00:36:04,546
Hive.

283
00:36:04,821 --> 00:36:05,982
Cube.

284
00:36:06,953 --> 00:36:08,216
Fauve.

285
00:36:08,836 --> 00:36:10,011
Shul.

286
00:36:10,916 --> 00:36:13,545
Various kinds of bees
have built hives.

287
00:36:14,305 --> 00:36:18,452
However, you are not
supposed to follow them.

288
00:36:48,438 --> 00:36:51,306
Bravo, it's coming together nicely.
Very good.

289
00:36:52,608 --> 00:36:53,615
Good.

290
00:36:57,547 --> 00:37:01,703
I was in Paris several years ago.

291
00:37:02,671 --> 00:37:03,695
Is that so?

292
00:37:05,700 --> 00:37:07,524
There is a poem I like.

293
00:37:10,393 --> 00:37:11,884
Can I read it?

294
00:37:12,662 --> 00:37:15,195
It's quite long, but I'd like
to read the beginning.

295
00:37:16,737 --> 00:37:17,797
Go ahead.

296
00:37:32,351 --> 00:37:34,938
"Cathedral in the Thrashing Rain,"

297
00:37:35,775 --> 00:37:37,344
by Kotaro Takamura.

298
00:37:41,724 --> 00:37:45,718
<i>O another deluge of
wind and rain</i>

299
00:37:49,842 --> 00:37:51,970
<i>Collar turned up,</i>

300
00:37:53,295 --> 00:37:56,129
<i>getting drenched
in this splashing rain,</i>

301
00:37:59,572 --> 00:38:02,474
<i>and looking up at you:
it's me...</i>

302
00:38:05,738 --> 00:38:09,266
<i>me who never fails to come here
once a day</i>

303
00:38:12,394 --> 00:38:14,454
<i>It's that Japanese</i>

304
00:38:19,801 --> 00:38:21,016
<i>This morning,</i>

305
00:38:21,852 --> 00:38:25,880
<i>about daybreak the storm suddenly
went violent, terrible,</i>

306
00:38:26,959 --> 00:38:28,039
<i>and now,</i>

307
00:38:29,242 --> 00:38:32,576
<i>is blowing through Paris
from one end to the other</i>

308
00:38:35,376 --> 00:38:39,143
<i>I have yet to know
the directions of this land</i>

309
00:38:41,782 --> 00:38:45,781
<i>I don't even know which way
this storm is facing,</i>

310
00:38:45,875 --> 00:38:48,289
<i>raging over the lie-de-France</i>

311
00:38:51,225 --> 00:38:53,126
<i>Only because even today</i>

312
00:38:54,097 --> 00:38:56,211
<i>I wanted to stand there</i>

313
00:38:57,505 --> 00:39:00,737
<i>and look up at you,
Cathedral of Notre-Dame de Paris,</i>

314
00:39:01,767 --> 00:39:04,672
<i>I came, getting drenched,</i>

315
00:39:07,708 --> 00:39:10,234
<i>only because I wanted
to touch you,</i>

316
00:39:12,120 --> 00:39:14,438
<i>only because I wanted
to kiss your skin,</i>

317
00:39:14,624 --> 00:39:17,320
<i>the stone, unknown to anyone</i>

318
00:39:20,500 --> 00:39:24,301
<i>O another deluge
of wind and rain</i>

319
00:39:29,516 --> 00:39:32,490
<i>Though it's already time
for morning coffee,</i>

320
00:39:33,416 --> 00:39:36,485
<i>a little while ago
I looked from the Pont-Neuf,</i>

321
00:39:36,748 --> 00:39:38,844
<i>the boats on the Seine</i>

322
00:39:39,199 --> 00:39:43,328
<i>were still tied up
to the banks, like puppies</i>

323
00:40:12,627 --> 00:40:14,979
What do you want from me,
ogling me like that?

324
00:40:17,677 --> 00:40:20,588
How can I draw without looking?

325
00:40:30,463 --> 00:40:31,502
Take it.

326
00:40:31,762 --> 00:40:32,916
It's yours.

327
00:40:42,826 --> 00:40:43,885
Thank you.

328
00:40:56,955 --> 00:41:00,379
When you pull out a sketchbook
and draw a rough sketch,

329
00:41:00,521 --> 00:41:02,870
it is the same as drawing
a portrait.

330
00:41:06,249 --> 00:41:09,354
How many times have you
visited the Louvre?

331
00:41:10,135 --> 00:41:11,694
I recognize it.

332
00:41:12,690 --> 00:41:14,221
I think I know him.

333
00:41:14,466 --> 00:41:15,798
He's a famous artist.

334
00:41:16,361 --> 00:41:19,330
I have gone there for three years.

335
00:41:21,335 --> 00:41:25,198
When I felt I couldn't even
draw a flower properly,

336
00:41:25,384 --> 00:41:27,651
I hung around the Louvre,

337
00:41:27,836 --> 00:41:32,331
found something most similar to the image
I had in my head and copied it repeatedly.

338
00:41:33,749 --> 00:41:37,557
Every human
has to try hard in this life.

339
00:41:46,035 --> 00:41:48,143
Aren't you Foujita,
by any chance?

340
00:41:49,019 --> 00:41:50,619
Ah, yes.

341
00:41:50,807 --> 00:41:51,900
Oh, dear!

342
00:41:52,304 --> 00:41:56,205
I saw a wax figure of you in a display,
your spitting image.

343
00:41:57,996 --> 00:42:01,260
Tell me, Mr. Foujita,
can you draw me as well?

344
00:42:02,992 --> 00:42:04,643
It's already done.

345
00:42:11,452 --> 00:42:14,845
Say, how did you guess
my underwear?

346
00:42:20,271 --> 00:42:23,737
Do we have to do this much?

347
00:42:25,061 --> 00:42:27,030
There are two Foujitas.

348
00:42:27,265 --> 00:42:31,760
Thanks to this, the real Foujita
becomes known to the public.

349
00:42:36,923 --> 00:42:38,391
What's up?

350
00:42:41,644 --> 00:42:43,728
There is a painting from
Mr. Foujita's collection

351
00:42:43,823 --> 00:42:46,210
of landscape paintings
from his early career.

352
00:42:50,858 --> 00:42:53,987
It shows a distant view
of the outskirts of Paris...

353
00:42:55,202 --> 00:42:57,190
in a dark tint.

354
00:43:06,422 --> 00:43:10,932
Can we view this painting as a departure
from your great white backgrounds?

355
00:43:17,658 --> 00:43:18,658
My white...

356
00:43:19,829 --> 00:43:24,424
isn't meant to separate
shadows from light.

357
00:43:25,985 --> 00:43:27,143
My white...

358
00:43:27,661 --> 00:43:29,527
is a color in itself.

359
00:43:33,666 --> 00:43:37,276
The beautiful fair skin
of European women,

360
00:43:38,359 --> 00:43:41,791
must be caressed by the gaze.

361
00:43:47,007 --> 00:43:48,807
Caressed by the gaze?

362
00:43:55,683 --> 00:43:57,831
I'm speaking about the painting,
of course.

363
00:43:59,879 --> 00:44:03,581
Ah, yes.
The vision is the sense

364
00:44:03,644 --> 00:44:06,530
that measures the distance
to the subject,

365
00:44:06,605 --> 00:44:09,370
whereas the touch...

366
00:44:09,994 --> 00:44:12,104
records the memory of the hand.

367
00:44:14,835 --> 00:44:17,339
A painting should convey...

368
00:44:17,645 --> 00:44:21,557
not only the distance
perceived by vision

369
00:44:22,501 --> 00:44:24,605
but also the perception of touch.

370
00:44:25,128 --> 00:44:27,800
That which we feel close to.

371
00:44:29,684 --> 00:44:32,894
That's how I understand it,
anyway.

372
00:44:34,469 --> 00:44:36,620
You're probably right.

373
00:44:38,050 --> 00:44:39,269
But for me,

374
00:44:39,863 --> 00:44:42,854
only my hand moves.

375
00:44:44,327 --> 00:44:47,722
And the question is to know,

376
00:44:47,921 --> 00:44:49,839
if this line here...

377
00:44:50,280 --> 00:44:51,331
is alive.

378
00:44:57,109 --> 00:44:58,362
Are you Youki?

379
00:44:59,784 --> 00:45:00,784
Yes.

380
00:45:01,167 --> 00:45:02,519
Mr. Picasso.

381
00:45:06,184 --> 00:45:07,894
You're prettier than this painting.

382
00:46:23,870 --> 00:46:27,752
If I buy them,
will you miss them?

383
00:46:31,541 --> 00:46:33,268
Obviously.

384
00:46:36,194 --> 00:46:37,815
But I'm here for that.

385
00:46:38,313 --> 00:46:40,002
For people to buy.

386
00:46:45,417 --> 00:46:47,495
I attach myself to objects,

387
00:46:48,057 --> 00:46:49,698
to their form.

388
00:46:51,549 --> 00:46:54,105
But only when they're free
from the hands...

389
00:46:54,379 --> 00:46:56,128
that used them.

390
00:46:57,720 --> 00:46:59,222
Strange, isn't it?

391
00:46:59,674 --> 00:47:01,438
Not at all.

392
00:47:06,455 --> 00:47:07,479
<i>Arigatõ.</i>

393
00:47:16,842 --> 00:47:19,209
It's pretty.
Don't you think so?

394
00:47:20,713 --> 00:47:22,198
She's going to win!

395
00:47:23,865 --> 00:47:25,834
Look!
Did you see?

396
00:47:27,886 --> 00:47:29,252
A drink, gentlemen?

397
00:47:29,347 --> 00:47:31,152
Well, thank you.
How nice of you!

398
00:47:32,300 --> 00:47:34,761
How am I supposed to sell them now?

399
00:47:34,826 --> 00:47:36,441
You're so cheeky!

400
00:47:36,646 --> 00:47:39,582
But I like them.
I never asked to sell them.

401
00:47:40,243 --> 00:47:42,136
Yes, I see that.

402
00:47:47,054 --> 00:47:49,114
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

403
00:48:18,439 --> 00:48:19,869
The roof can be opened.

404
00:48:36,716 --> 00:48:38,346
It's astonishing!

405
00:49:39,591 --> 00:49:40,684
Fou-fou.

406
00:49:41,658 --> 00:49:43,300
What are you doing tonight?

407
00:49:47,578 --> 00:49:48,987
I have work.

408
00:49:49,152 --> 00:49:51,205
A thousand things to finish.

409
00:49:58,673 --> 00:50:00,175
I wonder,

410
00:50:00,641 --> 00:50:02,550
can I go out alone?

411
00:50:03,479 --> 00:50:06,760
Of course!
Go wherever you want. Go.

412
00:50:07,440 --> 00:50:09,007
Do you have enough money?

413
00:50:09,140 --> 00:50:10,140
Yes.

414
00:50:10,870 --> 00:50:12,112
Thank you.

415
00:50:28,889 --> 00:50:31,073
Kiki sings at <i>Le Jockey</i> tonight.

416
00:50:32,081 --> 00:50:35,610
Ah, dancing?

417
00:50:36,972 --> 00:50:39,448
That's a professional obligation.

418
00:50:40,512 --> 00:50:42,855
Fun comes first.

419
00:51:02,472 --> 00:51:06,262
<i>The women were wearing laces</i>

420
00:51:06,574 --> 00:51:11,069
<i>And especially adorable
frilly skirts</i>

421
00:51:11,378 --> 00:51:15,110
<i>And when we walked behind them</i>

422
00:51:15,214 --> 00:51:19,886
<i>We had to guess
what was underneath!</i>

423
00:51:20,017 --> 00:51:24,536
<i>They only showed
the tips of their boots</i>

424
00:51:24,698 --> 00:51:28,910
<i>But as soon as it began to rain</i>

425
00:51:29,037 --> 00:51:32,439
<i>They rolled them up,
the naughty ones</i>

426
00:51:32,839 --> 00:51:34,441
<i>"Oh no, rain!"</i>

427
00:51:34,641 --> 00:51:37,975
<i>In order to be seen!</i>

428
00:51:38,393 --> 00:51:42,651
<i>Ah! How beautiful was my village</i>

429
00:51:42,884 --> 00:51:47,322
<i>My Paris, our Paris</i>

430
00:51:47,483 --> 00:51:51,298
<i>We only spoke one language</i>

431
00:51:51,392 --> 00:51:56,228
<i>That's enough to be understood</i>

432
00:51:56,455 --> 00:52:00,798
<i>We danced the polka,
the waltz and the mazurka</i>

433
00:52:00,931 --> 00:52:05,164
<i>It may have been a little silly</i>

434
00:52:05,308 --> 00:52:09,712
<i>But the boys and girls dancing,
they were so innocent</i>

435
00:52:09,816 --> 00:52:14,198
<i>Maybe that was true happiness</i>

436
00:52:14,487 --> 00:52:18,925
<i>Ah! How beautiful was my village</i>

437
00:52:19,025 --> 00:52:21,324
<i>My Paris</i>

438
00:52:22,180 --> 00:52:26,456
<i>Our Paris</i>

439
00:53:54,748 --> 00:53:57,912
Introducing the lady!

440
00:55:00,107 --> 00:55:02,008
- Are we going?
- Let's drink.

441
00:55:04,080 --> 00:55:05,091
Let's go!

442
00:57:01,089 --> 00:57:02,887
Be careful, Kiki!
Be careful!

443
00:57:21,025 --> 00:57:22,048
Careful!

444
00:57:26,767 --> 00:57:28,326
Like that, like that.

445
00:58:36,213 --> 00:58:38,962
The more I provoke scandals...

446
00:58:40,049 --> 00:58:41,798
and act scatterbrained,

447
00:58:43,463 --> 00:58:46,194
the closer I get to myself.

448
00:58:47,890 --> 00:58:49,931
My paintings are
that much more beautiful.

449
00:58:51,259 --> 00:58:53,236
Fun only lasts the night.

450
00:58:55,013 --> 00:58:56,478
It's pointless.

451
00:58:57,785 --> 00:58:59,455
And that's why I love it.

452
00:59:02,083 --> 00:59:03,251
I love it...

453
00:59:03,679 --> 00:59:06,150
because its meaning fades
very quickly.

454
00:59:11,633 --> 00:59:13,783
I will make a tatoo...

455
00:59:14,823 --> 00:59:16,658
on your white skin.

456
00:59:55,074 --> 00:59:56,438
What's the matter?

457
01:00:02,168 --> 01:00:03,822
Why not a painting?

458
01:00:16,892 --> 01:00:18,164
Melancholic?

459
01:00:26,929 --> 01:00:28,158
Of course,

460
01:00:28,404 --> 01:00:30,232
I'll continue to paint.

461
01:00:31,726 --> 01:00:32,991
However,

462
01:00:33,928 --> 01:00:35,827
thanks to the beauty
of your skin,

463
01:00:37,189 --> 01:00:38,459
my paintings...

464
01:00:39,192 --> 01:00:40,842
will sell even better.

465
01:00:43,209 --> 01:00:44,499
They'll sell...

466
01:00:45,779 --> 01:00:47,233
better than you imagine.

467
01:00:54,299 --> 01:00:55,385
Okay.

468
01:01:04,443 --> 01:01:06,099
What do you want to tattoo on me?

469
01:01:08,522 --> 01:01:09,785
On you,

470
01:01:10,233 --> 01:01:11,368
a mermaid.

471
01:01:14,030 --> 01:01:15,362
And on me,

472
01:01:15,930 --> 01:01:17,281
at first,

473
01:01:19,050 --> 01:01:20,302
a watch, here,

474
01:01:21,404 --> 01:01:24,069
that will always point to noon,

475
01:01:25,582 --> 01:01:27,993
to ensure my good health.

476
01:01:29,204 --> 01:01:32,420
I must tattoo a lion as well.

477
01:01:34,217 --> 01:01:37,038
One that will protect you forever.

478
01:03:39,129 --> 01:03:43,191
Wow, I didn't know you
were that famous.

479
01:03:43,467 --> 01:03:45,095
I am sorry!

480
01:03:45,953 --> 01:03:50,550
I was the one who decided to
stay here on a whim, that's all.

481
01:03:52,549 --> 01:03:55,516
Right now,
the newspaper reporters...

482
01:03:55,913 --> 01:03:58,712
must be struggling to find me
searching inns one by one,

483
01:03:59,014 --> 01:04:02,279
from the best to the worst one,
in that order.

484
01:05:58,884 --> 01:06:00,073
Mister.

485
01:06:01,929 --> 01:06:04,708
Is that a sword battle?

486
01:06:07,002 --> 01:06:09,062
Your voice is too loud.

487
01:06:12,207 --> 01:06:18,238
You told me that a sword battle
would take place in Attu Island.

488
01:06:24,605 --> 01:06:28,838
It's a sword battle because swords
are involved, right?

489
01:06:36,159 --> 01:06:43,992
I don't like drawing something still,
after all.

490
01:06:46,164 --> 01:06:50,746
I draw people in close proximity,

491
01:06:52,440 --> 01:06:55,239
to such extent
that I can even touch them.

492
01:06:58,440 --> 01:07:00,893
In war, the situation is similar.

493
01:07:04,721 --> 01:07:07,898
The only problem
is that I have to use...

494
01:07:08,568 --> 01:07:12,096
special drawing technique
because of the shaking.

495
01:07:14,837 --> 01:07:16,310
This time,

496
01:07:17,635 --> 01:07:21,249
I merely bet my life in order
to test my capabilities, that's all.

497
01:07:36,045 --> 01:07:40,277
Anyway, I ended up creating
a satisfactory piece of work.

498
01:07:43,868 --> 01:07:48,402
For the first time,
I learned firsthand...

499
01:07:49,851 --> 01:07:54,008
that drawings can move
people's minds.

500
01:07:57,528 --> 01:07:58,655
Today...

501
01:08:00,155 --> 01:08:02,454
was an unforgettable day.

502
01:09:20,344 --> 01:09:22,210
Are you still lost?

503
01:09:27,251 --> 01:09:28,685
But...

504
01:09:31,856 --> 01:09:34,451
If you cannot finish it
with one piece,

505
01:09:35,386 --> 01:09:37,082
just buy two.

506
01:09:40,140 --> 01:09:41,836
Are you satisfied?

507
01:09:45,368 --> 01:09:49,265
Women look prettier when
they spend money on accessories.

508
01:09:52,693 --> 01:09:54,301
You know, Master,

509
01:09:54,772 --> 01:09:56,172
this here...

510
01:09:57,659 --> 01:09:59,594
has stripes, though.

511
01:10:00,471 --> 01:10:03,771
You call me "Master"
only in this kind of situations.

512
01:10:06,696 --> 01:10:07,937
But...

513
01:10:09,934 --> 01:10:12,233
I think that one looks good too.

514
01:10:16,758 --> 01:10:21,719
I definitely saw that kind of color
on a Mexican traditional cloth.

515
01:11:42,137 --> 01:11:43,160
Oh, dear.

516
01:11:50,450 --> 01:11:52,952
I have an extra.

517
01:11:55,506 --> 01:11:57,099
You're welcome.

518
01:12:00,140 --> 01:12:01,699
Your fourth wife,

519
01:12:02,969 --> 01:12:04,896
Miss Madeleine, is that right?

520
01:12:05,196 --> 01:12:06,357
Hey, hey!

521
01:12:09,592 --> 01:12:12,770
I know it because
I am your fifth wife.

522
01:12:17,068 --> 01:12:21,528
Everyone can tell by your drawings.

523
01:12:27,732 --> 01:12:28,855
But,

524
01:12:30,365 --> 01:12:35,712
why is there no drawing
of your first Japanese wife?

525
01:12:39,709 --> 01:12:42,865
Before I went to Paris,

526
01:12:44,630 --> 01:12:47,952
I was just a student.

527
01:12:53,745 --> 01:12:54,775
Say,

528
01:12:56,075 --> 01:12:57,703
if Ms. Madeleine...

529
01:12:58,459 --> 01:13:02,231
were a fabric,
which fabric would she be?

530
01:13:08,570 --> 01:13:11,250
Velvet, maybe?

531
01:13:19,815 --> 01:13:22,257
How about Ms. Youki?

532
01:13:25,204 --> 01:13:27,867
She was fair-complexioned,
wasn't she?

533
01:13:31,935 --> 01:13:34,610
Silk, maybe?

534
01:13:35,579 --> 01:13:37,309
Please, stop.

535
01:13:39,709 --> 01:13:40,790
Say,

536
01:13:42,472 --> 01:13:43,997
how about me?

537
01:13:52,316 --> 01:13:55,860
We don't have enough
material right now.

538
01:13:57,128 --> 01:13:59,563
What do you mean by that?

539
01:14:08,398 --> 01:14:12,130
I have one with stronger tips,

540
01:14:13,253 --> 01:14:18,889
but it's hard to find soft ones
that will fit your style.

541
01:14:51,818 --> 01:14:54,879
Ever since Mr. Fujishima
passed away,

542
01:14:55,439 --> 01:15:02,710
I've heard that Mr. Foujita became the
president of the Army Art Association.

543
01:15:03,768 --> 01:15:05,851
It must have been hard.

544
01:15:10,621 --> 01:15:14,080
Please, provide your contribution
for a <i>senninbari.</i>

545
01:15:16,804 --> 01:15:19,300
- Please, contribute.
- Please, contribute.

546
01:15:34,439 --> 01:15:36,908
Every oil painter...

547
01:15:37,520 --> 01:15:39,605
goes to Paris to learn more.

548
01:15:41,476 --> 01:15:45,379
Paris is under German control
right now.

549
01:15:47,538 --> 01:15:51,584
Nobody can learn arts
in Paris anymore.

550
01:15:56,769 --> 01:15:58,897
There is no doubt about it.

551
01:16:00,002 --> 01:16:01,748
This is the best opportunity...

552
01:16:02,033 --> 01:16:06,596
to stay away from those imported art styles
influenced by Impressionism.

553
01:16:11,459 --> 01:16:13,985
The Great Depression...

554
01:16:14,930 --> 01:16:17,711
made Paris a sad city in no time.

555
01:16:22,162 --> 01:16:24,222
Nowadays,
the trend in the art scene...

556
01:16:24,792 --> 01:16:28,126
moves from Europe to the U.S.
Don't you think?

557
01:16:31,047 --> 01:16:33,189
Even if a country has no history,

558
01:16:33,483 --> 01:16:35,782
matured capitalism...

559
01:16:36,916 --> 01:16:38,891
can make flowers bloom anywhere.

560
01:16:41,797 --> 01:16:43,231
I want you two masters...

561
01:16:43,686 --> 01:16:46,417
to come up with an idea
that will better fit

562
01:16:48,091 --> 01:16:49,404
Our Great East Asian Vision.

563
01:16:49,472 --> 01:16:51,965
We have to end this
White Domination over Asians.

564
01:16:54,900 --> 01:16:56,391
Master Miyamoto.

565
01:16:58,068 --> 01:17:00,264
We have to, at least,

566
01:17:00,970 --> 01:17:04,230
win the war on paper like this.

567
01:17:06,777 --> 01:17:07,870
I see.

568
01:17:09,360 --> 01:17:10,953
I'm trying.

569
01:17:33,295 --> 01:17:37,164
Do you know the God-of-War
Squad Yamasaki?

570
01:17:37,894 --> 01:17:42,208
It surprises me that they even built
Yamasaki Shrine for that.

571
01:17:44,191 --> 01:17:45,853
It's not a big deal.

572
01:17:46,698 --> 01:17:50,783
I am very happy that the Army...

573
01:17:51,269 --> 01:17:53,568
made up the narrative.

574
01:17:55,628 --> 01:17:58,504
Drawings are all about falsehood,

575
01:17:58,698 --> 01:18:01,481
so narratives actually makes
them better.

576
01:18:05,739 --> 01:18:08,072
I don't think falsehood...

577
01:18:09,142 --> 01:18:11,475
is a bad thing in itself.

578
01:18:14,103 --> 01:18:15,571
I understand.

579
01:18:17,354 --> 01:18:18,822
Good drawings...

580
01:18:19,659 --> 01:18:23,052
will last longer than
the narratives themselves.

581
01:18:27,707 --> 01:18:31,047
What do you think about taking
a walk before going home?

582
01:18:32,425 --> 01:18:33,825
That sounds good.

583
01:18:39,672 --> 01:18:41,664
We lost the Midway Battle,

584
01:18:42,755 --> 01:18:47,097
that was the total opposite of the
announcement by the Headquarters.

585
01:18:49,542 --> 01:18:54,493
The U.S. already took control of the
air superiority over the Pacific Ocean.

586
01:18:56,299 --> 01:18:58,365
Even Tokyo is in danger.

587
01:19:05,458 --> 01:19:07,222
The walls have ears.

588
01:19:07,601 --> 01:19:09,092
I should be careful.

589
01:20:51,321 --> 01:20:54,415
Is it okay for us to enter?

590
01:20:56,192 --> 01:20:57,683
Thank you very much.

591
01:20:58,547 --> 01:21:00,641
Please, go inside.

592
01:22:43,535 --> 01:22:45,436
I am glad that I came.

593
01:22:47,506 --> 01:22:49,975
It's not even an important event.

594
01:22:50,576 --> 01:22:52,214
Why are you here?

595
01:22:52,423 --> 01:22:55,877
Why did you suddenly scream,
"Kamakura"?

596
01:23:00,876 --> 01:23:02,435
It's fine.

597
01:23:03,624 --> 01:23:05,991
I can leave for Chiba now,
if you want.

598
01:23:07,125 --> 01:23:09,822
Would you like to visit your grave?

599
01:23:11,697 --> 01:23:13,029
Why would I do...

600
01:23:14,066 --> 01:23:15,466
such a thing?

601
01:23:25,052 --> 01:23:26,350
I have seen...

602
01:23:28,113 --> 01:23:29,775
for almost twenty years...

603
01:23:30,475 --> 01:23:33,741
Jesus Christ nailed on the cross.

604
01:24:14,170 --> 01:24:18,591
<i>Last night, our soldiers ferociously
attacked the enemy's mobile unit...</i>

605
01:24:18,888 --> 01:24:20,966
<i>on the eastern coastline</i>

606
01:24:21,600 --> 01:24:25,154
<i>and destroyed half of them.</i>

607
01:24:25,600 --> 01:24:28,570
<i>The battle gave us...</i>

608
01:24:29,834 --> 01:24:32,895
<i>several tactical benefits,</i>

609
01:24:33,522 --> 01:24:36,178
<i>such as the following.</i>

610
01:24:36,869 --> 01:24:38,735
<i>Firstly...</i>

611
01:24:48,956 --> 01:24:51,194
- Goodbye, master.
- Goodbye.

612
01:24:52,966 --> 01:24:54,127
Mr. Seiroku.

613
01:24:55,804 --> 01:24:58,908
Thank you for your help the other day.
You saved me.

614
01:24:59,129 --> 01:25:02,446
Is Mr. Skillful Painter okay now?

615
01:25:06,135 --> 01:25:10,727
Being in the countryside helps.
But I am not sure what the future brings.

616
01:25:13,606 --> 01:25:16,838
Please, let me know
if you need any help.

617
01:25:17,602 --> 01:25:18,982
Thank you very much.

618
01:25:22,000 --> 01:25:24,492
Seiroku! The tea is ready!

619
01:26:00,215 --> 01:26:03,140
Mr. Yatsu, that's enough.

620
01:26:03,358 --> 01:26:05,735
Beans should be...

621
01:26:06,454 --> 01:26:08,889
managed carefully all the time.

622
01:26:13,237 --> 01:26:15,353
- Ah, Bo! Welcome back.
- Welcome back.

623
01:26:15,570 --> 01:26:16,690
I am back.

624
01:26:20,235 --> 01:26:21,726
Welcome back.

625
01:26:27,042 --> 01:26:29,671
Is your name Bo?

626
01:26:33,214 --> 01:26:34,288
Not really.

627
01:26:34,933 --> 01:26:38,567
It's my fault. I've called him
like that for a long time.

628
01:27:08,932 --> 01:27:12,509
Are you really going to walk in that?

629
01:27:15,921 --> 01:27:18,652
I was honored to receive it...

630
01:27:19,510 --> 01:27:22,537
from the country
as a major general.

631
01:27:23,397 --> 01:27:25,593
I have to wear it sometimes.

632
01:27:26,084 --> 01:27:29,020
Otherwise, it's the same
as disrespecting the country.

633
01:27:29,763 --> 01:27:32,509
Drawings are tasteless.

634
01:27:38,323 --> 01:27:39,882
Drawings gradually...

635
01:27:41,113 --> 01:27:45,339
get more serious and different from
the taste of the general public

636
01:27:46,016 --> 01:27:48,679
once you start digging deeper.

637
01:27:50,495 --> 01:27:52,934
Whether they are tasteless or not,

638
01:27:53,265 --> 01:27:56,394
everyone has to get over
this kind of phase.

639
01:27:57,797 --> 01:28:00,425
You didn't show me
the military boots yet.

640
01:28:04,668 --> 01:28:05,964
What?

641
01:28:06,928 --> 01:28:09,864
It doesn't have to be
an official issue?

642
01:28:11,275 --> 01:28:12,709
A pair of <i>getas</i> will do?

643
01:28:18,882 --> 01:28:22,080
Those <i>getas</i> are brand-new.

644
01:28:23,815 --> 01:28:26,808
When you wear new shoes
after dark,

645
01:28:27,488 --> 01:28:29,423
foxes will ridicule you.

646
01:28:31,440 --> 01:28:34,968
I am surprised that
you believe in that kind of myth.

647
01:28:36,409 --> 01:28:38,207
Let's go get ridiculed.

648
01:28:47,919 --> 01:28:51,763
Once you do this,
they will become used <i>getas.</i>

649
01:30:52,424 --> 01:30:56,331
Who would have ever thought
that farmers would ever receive rice

650
01:30:56,496 --> 01:30:58,624
from Tokyo people?

651
01:30:59,564 --> 01:31:01,148
That's right.

652
01:31:02,701 --> 01:31:04,260
It's strange.

653
01:31:05,345 --> 01:31:07,598
I am a strange one.

654
01:31:08,548 --> 01:31:12,952
Also, you need to use crushed rice
for rice flour.

655
01:31:13,669 --> 01:31:17,936
Why would you crush decent rice
into pieces?

656
01:31:18,592 --> 01:31:20,315
You are committing a sin.

657
01:31:21,861 --> 01:31:23,352
I'm sorry.

658
01:31:23,949 --> 01:31:27,784
I had to share
with my neighbors anyway.

659
01:31:29,436 --> 01:31:31,337
That's how it is supposed to go.

660
01:31:33,092 --> 01:31:35,949
We are desperate
for food right now.

661
01:31:36,519 --> 01:31:40,388
I guess human beings
will get happier than the Moon God.

662
01:31:41,721 --> 01:31:44,195
Let's have a break.

663
01:31:44,628 --> 01:31:45,827
Okay?

664
01:31:55,948 --> 01:32:01,353
I have never celebrated
the 13th Night Ritual before.

665
01:32:03,656 --> 01:32:05,648
Only the 15th Night Ritual, then?

666
01:32:06,592 --> 01:32:11,553
In the past, the 13th Night Ritual used
to be called <i>Mochi Tsukimi</i> by people.

667
01:32:12,561 --> 01:32:17,196
When you finish the 15th Night Ritual,
you see a half moon.

668
01:32:18,828 --> 01:32:22,765
The moon on the 13th night
is more beautiful...

669
01:32:23,567 --> 01:32:27,153
because it hasn't reached
the 15th night yet.

670
01:32:28,765 --> 01:32:30,631
The air is crisp.

671
01:33:11,791 --> 01:33:14,761
What a beautiful moon.

672
01:33:24,040 --> 01:33:27,977
Are you okay with the house
without decorations?

673
01:33:37,095 --> 01:33:38,144
Yes.

674
01:33:39,129 --> 01:33:42,429
Drawings don't look nice when
the <i>engawa</i> is not shown properly.

675
01:33:54,542 --> 01:33:56,534
Master! Master!

676
01:33:56,845 --> 01:34:00,140
I still think this is weird.
You are not supposed to do it.

677
01:34:02,649 --> 01:34:07,309
I need the stamina to keep drawing.
I am doing it right without any problem.

678
01:34:08,732 --> 01:34:11,531
If I don't put proper efforts,
I will die one day.

679
01:34:13,726 --> 01:34:14,854
In Tokyo,

680
01:34:14,997 --> 01:34:19,128
I used to work 14 hours a day
in my atelier.

681
01:34:30,705 --> 01:34:31,639
Hey!

682
01:34:31,725 --> 01:34:33,591
Aren't you Suzuki?

683
01:34:40,574 --> 01:34:41,972
Oh, master!

684
01:34:42,765 --> 01:34:45,030
I didn't recognize you!

685
01:34:47,789 --> 01:34:51,317
The home front has more
things to do than drawing.

686
01:34:53,054 --> 01:34:54,613
Thank you for your service.

687
01:34:55,091 --> 01:34:58,994
I will tell the village chief.
Please, go see him immediately.

688
01:34:59,893 --> 01:35:01,259
Thank you very much.

689
01:35:03,457 --> 01:35:06,689
We lost all ammo due
to the airstrikes.

690
01:35:08,162 --> 01:35:09,755
I can see that.

691
01:35:10,765 --> 01:35:12,961
I am just glad
that you didn't get hurt.

692
01:35:14,720 --> 01:35:16,348
Thank you very much.

693
01:35:20,708 --> 01:35:21,732
Gramps!

694
01:35:22,476 --> 01:35:25,241
I need to use some tools!

695
01:35:25,721 --> 01:35:27,849
You don't need them, do you?

696
01:35:28,215 --> 01:35:29,342
And also,

697
01:35:30,017 --> 01:35:33,977
is it okay for me to repair...

698
01:35:34,630 --> 01:35:38,830
the roof of the unused warehouse?

699
01:36:33,300 --> 01:36:35,266
Hey! Keep crushing!

700
01:36:51,519 --> 01:36:53,681
You finally took them all out!

701
01:37:01,919 --> 01:37:03,888
Which temple is it?

702
01:37:05,022 --> 01:37:07,958
The Jiganji Temple.
It's a decent one.

703
01:37:18,705 --> 01:37:19,729
Master!

704
01:37:40,103 --> 01:37:41,360
Today,

705
01:37:41,703 --> 01:37:45,868
two of our villagers
received conscription cards.

706
01:37:48,147 --> 01:37:50,889
I hope Kanji
won't receive it this time.

707
01:37:54,909 --> 01:37:59,337
I think Mr. Kanjiro officially left
the military in Manchuria.

708
01:38:01,679 --> 01:38:04,649
Conscription can take place
more than once.

709
01:38:06,672 --> 01:38:10,238
Tsuneichi,
who received the card today,

710
01:38:11,500 --> 01:38:13,435
is almost fifty.

711
01:38:18,914 --> 01:38:20,610
Kanji's older brother...

712
01:38:21,301 --> 01:38:23,738
died four years ago.

713
01:38:25,923 --> 01:38:27,687
As a brother,

714
01:38:29,460 --> 01:38:35,593
Kanji made
his older brother's wife as his.

715
01:38:38,868 --> 01:38:40,995
They did not have any children.

716
01:38:42,801 --> 01:38:45,134
I thought it was better
for the family...

717
01:38:45,730 --> 01:38:48,256
that they didn't have children.

718
01:38:51,120 --> 01:38:52,782
But in the end,

719
01:38:53,406 --> 01:38:55,341
the wife ran away from home.

720
01:38:58,226 --> 01:39:02,220
Some people even spread
malicious rumors about that.

721
01:39:06,616 --> 01:39:08,744
She was a beautiful woman.

722
01:39:13,123 --> 01:39:16,169
Three of them had been
very close with each other.

723
01:39:18,730 --> 01:39:19,925
That must...

724
01:39:21,317 --> 01:39:24,571
have made Kanji suffer deeply.

725
01:40:45,009 --> 01:40:46,773
In the night,

726
01:40:47,269 --> 01:40:49,649
someone called me out.

727
01:40:51,624 --> 01:40:53,923
He even shouted my name.

728
01:40:54,335 --> 01:40:56,912
So, I got out.
There was no one.

729
01:40:59,507 --> 01:41:02,067
That kind of thing
continued for days.

730
01:41:02,759 --> 01:41:05,511
People told me that foxes did that.

731
01:41:10,872 --> 01:41:15,742
If that is so,
foxes don't know the concept of time.

732
01:41:16,177 --> 01:41:17,736
If they cannot answer...

733
01:41:19,491 --> 01:41:22,154
when I ask for the time,

734
01:41:22,537 --> 01:41:24,470
it means that it was
a fox who did it.

735
01:41:25,910 --> 01:41:27,469
I see.

736
01:41:29,979 --> 01:41:35,836
So, I asked them,
"What time is it?"

737
01:41:37,457 --> 01:41:39,187
How interesting.

738
01:41:40,420 --> 01:41:42,082
And the answer was?

739
01:41:43,840 --> 01:41:46,503
They jumped once,

740
01:41:48,405 --> 01:41:51,366
"Time is time."

741
01:41:52,876 --> 01:41:54,310
They told me.

742
01:42:12,469 --> 01:42:16,873
I also like the story
of a ghost train.

743
01:42:19,368 --> 01:42:23,635
In the Meiji era, a railroad was built
on the outskirts of the village.

744
01:42:26,717 --> 01:42:30,781
One night,
a train crossed the rice field.

745
01:42:31,638 --> 01:42:34,540
Another train came
from the opposite direction.

746
01:42:36,593 --> 01:42:40,155
The train operator got scared
and stopped the train.

747
01:42:40,532 --> 01:42:43,024
The other train stopped as well...

748
01:42:43,487 --> 01:42:44,887
and disappeared.

749
01:42:47,204 --> 01:42:50,072
That kind of thing kept happening.

750
01:42:51,452 --> 01:42:53,045
One day,

751
01:42:53,473 --> 01:42:55,169
he turned off the light...

752
01:42:55,447 --> 01:42:58,884
and kept advancing,
honking its horn.

753
01:43:01,479 --> 01:43:07,248
The train disappeared
right before it was about to crash.

754
01:43:12,362 --> 01:43:13,694
On the next day,

755
01:43:14,230 --> 01:43:16,049
due to the train crash,

756
01:43:16,243 --> 01:43:21,031
several foxes were found dead.

757
01:43:34,842 --> 01:43:36,578
These fox tales,

758
01:43:37,311 --> 01:43:39,507
don't make much sense.

759
01:43:40,787 --> 01:43:42,915
But I can easily guess...

760
01:43:43,323 --> 01:43:48,694
what kind of emotions the villagers hide
in their minds when they tell them.

761
01:43:49,994 --> 01:43:52,964
Even I don't know exactly...

762
01:43:56,503 --> 01:43:58,062
who started that story.

763
01:43:58,705 --> 01:44:01,174
Was it the train operator?

764
01:44:01,715 --> 01:44:03,980
Or perhaps a villager?

765
01:44:04,744 --> 01:44:06,713
We will never know.

766
01:44:09,182 --> 01:44:12,976
As the story moves
from one person to another,

767
01:44:13,268 --> 01:44:14,600
it changes.

768
01:44:16,910 --> 01:44:21,101
The emotion of each person
who delivers the story,

769
01:44:21,370 --> 01:44:23,464
changes it forever.

770
01:44:29,117 --> 01:44:31,364
And at some point,

771
01:44:31,552 --> 01:44:34,147
the subject becomes ambiguous,

772
01:44:34,626 --> 01:44:37,095
and the story
becomes everybody's story.

773
01:44:43,950 --> 01:44:48,752
Foxes, just like humans,
live around the mountains.

774
01:44:49,966 --> 01:44:53,562
They are the Gods
of Rice Farming too.

775
01:44:56,615 --> 01:44:59,460
Every rice farmer hopes
that today...

776
01:45:00,133 --> 01:45:02,159
will be a peaceful day

777
01:45:03,236 --> 01:45:05,797
just like yesterday.

778
01:45:10,969 --> 01:45:12,631
One wonders if they...

779
01:45:12,994 --> 01:45:19,195
really wanted modern-day civilization and
enlightenment forced down by the government.

780
01:45:22,800 --> 01:45:24,792
Come back safely.

781
01:45:34,996 --> 01:45:36,760
Don't die!

782
01:45:45,022 --> 01:45:46,046
Yes!

783
01:46:18,897 --> 01:46:21,075
We are living a crucial moment.

784
01:46:21,275 --> 01:46:24,404
Even if you go to the battlefield,

785
01:46:25,187 --> 01:46:28,167
nobody can guarantee your safety.

786
01:46:30,685 --> 01:46:33,519
The reason why
I brought you here today...

787
01:46:33,915 --> 01:46:36,441
is that I want to hold
the art exhibition...

788
01:46:36,917 --> 01:46:41,465
we've been looking forward to
despite the big battle approaching.

789
01:46:42,989 --> 01:46:48,360
First, look at the material in front
of you and think of an image.

790
01:47:49,469 --> 01:47:50,562
Master.

791
01:47:51,908 --> 01:47:53,376
Can you come?

792
01:49:43,842 --> 01:49:45,640
It's an intense shower.

793
01:49:48,105 --> 01:49:49,869
It is indeed.

794
01:49:51,375 --> 01:49:53,276
It's already been three days.

795
01:49:55,053 --> 01:49:56,919
Unlike in the cities,

796
01:49:57,692 --> 01:50:01,129
there is no place to go
when it rains in the countryside.

797
01:50:02,686 --> 01:50:04,552
Just like a small child,

798
01:50:04,807 --> 01:50:09,245
I really want to go outside as soon
as possible. That's what I thought.

799
01:50:14,725 --> 01:50:16,626
Since I came to the village,

800
01:50:17,110 --> 01:50:21,480
my hearing has improved a lot,
catching every single sound.

801
01:50:23,674 --> 01:50:28,374
I can even hear various kinds
of sounds from the roof,

802
01:50:30,316 --> 01:50:31,944
soft ones,

803
01:50:32,732 --> 01:50:34,124
loud ones.

804
01:50:36,403 --> 01:50:41,068
It is fun to guess which part
of the roof gets hit...

805
01:50:41,630 --> 01:50:44,897
when I hear a certain sound.

806
01:51:06,218 --> 01:51:07,652
They are impressive.

807
01:51:10,435 --> 01:51:12,084
Painters.

808
01:51:16,806 --> 01:51:18,297
What happened?

809
01:51:25,201 --> 01:51:30,270
I am just putting a flower like this.
That's all.

810
01:51:41,754 --> 01:51:43,848
I think this war painting...

811
01:51:45,485 --> 01:51:48,108
might be the last one.

812
01:52:16,355 --> 01:52:22,492
I saw a billow of smoke
in the mountain.

813
01:52:24,940 --> 01:52:29,002
Are there some people living
on the opposite side of the river?

814
01:52:33,742 --> 01:52:38,039
A charcoal maker entered
the mountain a long time ago...

815
01:52:38,830 --> 01:52:41,659
and has not come back ever since.

816
01:52:44,246 --> 01:52:46,078
With his family?

817
01:52:47,588 --> 01:52:50,305
No, alone.

818
01:52:54,632 --> 01:52:57,805
Can I cross the river?

819
01:53:02,137 --> 01:53:05,471
When you walk several miles
toward the west,

820
01:53:06,010 --> 01:53:08,360
the river gradually becomes
narrower.

821
01:53:08,870 --> 01:53:11,572
And you will find a big cut
at some point.

822
01:53:12,640 --> 01:53:16,294
You can reach the opposite side
right away using that cut.

823
01:54:57,099 --> 01:55:00,162
What is inside the basket?

824
01:55:01,123 --> 01:55:02,716
Salted fish.

825
01:55:05,704 --> 01:55:07,488
Are you selling them?

826
01:55:07,705 --> 01:55:10,943
Yes, since my father's generation.

827
01:55:12,195 --> 01:55:16,698
I am just doing
what my father used to do.

828
01:55:22,397 --> 01:55:24,696
<i>Since my father's generation.</i>

829
01:55:25,177 --> 01:55:29,919
<i>I am just doing
what my father used to do.</i>
