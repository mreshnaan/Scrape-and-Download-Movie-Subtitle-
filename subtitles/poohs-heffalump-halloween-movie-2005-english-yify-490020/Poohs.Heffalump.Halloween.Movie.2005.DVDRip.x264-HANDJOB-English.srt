1
00:00:27,485 --> 00:00:30,571
This could be the room
of any small boy,

2
00:00:30,655 --> 00:00:35,534
but it just happens to belong to
a boy named Christopher Robin.

3
00:00:35,660 --> 00:00:40,080
Now, Christopher Robin had
many toy animals to play with,

4
00:00:40,165 --> 00:00:43,959
but his very best
friend was a bear,

5
00:00:44,044 --> 00:00:47,046
named Winnie the Pooh.

6
00:00:47,130 --> 00:00:51,592
Together, Pooh and his friends
shared many grand adventures.

7
00:00:51,676 --> 00:00:54,053
But one of their most unusual

8
00:00:54,137 --> 00:00:57,848
began on an early
autumn morning.

9
00:00:59,309 --> 00:01:02,311
lt was that time of year again.

10
00:01:02,395 --> 00:01:06,440
That magical time
when leaves fall,

11
00:01:06,524 --> 00:01:08,484
and pumpkins grin,

12
00:01:08,568 --> 00:01:12,237
and Spookables roam free.

13
00:01:12,322 --> 00:01:16,158
Halloween had come to
the Hundred Acre Wood.

14
00:01:21,456 --> 00:01:23,707
-Boo!
-Oh, my!

15
00:01:23,792 --> 00:01:26,168
A very, very small Spookable.

16
00:01:26,294 --> 00:01:27,878
Whatever shall I do?

17
00:01:27,962 --> 00:01:30,214
Don't be afraid, Mama.

18
00:01:30,340 --> 00:01:32,132
It's only me!

19
00:01:32,217 --> 00:01:33,842
-See?
-Oh, Roo.

20
00:01:33,927 --> 00:01:36,178
Thank goodness. I'm saved.

21
00:01:36,262 --> 00:01:37,679
Sorry I scared you so bad.

22
00:01:37,764 --> 00:01:39,973
I was just getting
ready for Halloween.

23
00:01:40,642 --> 00:01:43,018
Aren't you starting a
little early, dear?

24
00:01:43,103 --> 00:01:47,147
I can't help it. I'm excited. It's
Lumpy's first time trick-or-treating.

25
00:01:47,232 --> 00:01:49,149
Well, that is exciting.

26
00:01:49,234 --> 00:01:51,235
We're going to
Piglet's to practice.

27
00:01:51,319 --> 00:01:53,487
-Bye-bye, Mama!
-Bye, dear.

28
00:01:53,571 --> 00:01:55,447
Have a good time.

29
00:02:33,486 --> 00:02:35,779
-Treat-or-Trick!
-Lumpy!

30
00:02:35,864 --> 00:02:38,323
How was that, then? Did I
do it right this time?

31
00:02:38,408 --> 00:02:41,243
-Did I?
-Almost. But not quite.

32
00:02:41,327 --> 00:02:42,786
It's "trick-or-treat"!

33
00:02:44,581 --> 00:02:47,457
Trick-or-treat!

34
00:02:47,542 --> 00:02:49,209
Got it.

35
00:02:50,003 --> 00:02:51,503
-Roo?
-Yeah?

36
00:02:52,422 --> 00:02:55,465
-I don't get it.
-It's simple.

37
00:02:55,550 --> 00:02:58,802
We knock on any door, and
say "trick-or-treat".

38
00:02:59,721 --> 00:03:03,098
And they give us candy
and cider and cookies.

39
00:03:03,183 --> 00:03:05,350
What? Just like that?

40
00:03:05,435 --> 00:03:08,228
Don't worry, Lumpy, you'll
get the hang of it.

41
00:03:08,313 --> 00:03:09,354
I'll help you.

42
00:03:09,439 --> 00:03:12,858
This is gonna be the best
Halloween ever because it's...

43
00:03:12,942 --> 00:03:15,694
...our first
Halloween together.

44
00:03:15,778 --> 00:03:18,655
Come on, let's go practice
at Piglet's house.

45
00:03:35,423 --> 00:03:38,592
This is gonna be the most fun
you've ever had in your life.

46
00:03:38,676 --> 00:03:40,844
Trick-or-treat.

47
00:03:42,430 --> 00:03:44,389
Boo!

48
00:03:49,312 --> 00:03:50,562
Would you look at that.

49
00:03:50,647 --> 00:03:53,690
We frightened them so much
, they forgot to scream.

50
00:03:54,525 --> 00:03:56,485
Oh, bother.

51
00:03:56,569 --> 00:03:58,904
I don't think we
frightened them, Piglet.

52
00:03:58,988 --> 00:04:01,531
Oh, dear. Didn't we
scare you at all, Roo?

53
00:04:01,616 --> 00:04:03,951
Maybe a little bit.
Right, Lumpy?

54
00:04:04,035 --> 00:04:06,078
Oh, sure.

55
00:04:06,162 --> 00:04:08,372
Scary.

56
00:04:08,456 --> 00:04:10,666
Why are you wearing
those funny faces?

57
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:14,962
What? Why, these are
Halloween masks, Lumpy-boy.

58
00:04:15,046 --> 00:04:17,464
I guess the kid's not
from around here.

59
00:04:17,548 --> 00:04:20,717
-This is his first Halloween.
-No kidding?

60
00:04:20,802 --> 00:04:24,680
Don't Heffalumps have Heffaween.
.. I mean, Halloween?

61
00:04:24,764 --> 00:04:29,226
Well, we have
Trumplet-Trumpet Day.

62
00:04:30,019 --> 00:04:31,895
Flapadoodle Eve.

63
00:04:33,022 --> 00:04:35,065
-But that's it.
-Well, then,

64
00:04:35,149 --> 00:04:38,694
we must make this a very
special night, indeed.

65
00:04:38,778 --> 00:04:40,445
Well, what're we waiting for?

66
00:04:40,530 --> 00:04:42,698
Somebody get this
Heffalump some candy.

67
00:04:42,782 --> 00:04:45,200
No! No candy for anyone.

68
00:04:45,285 --> 00:04:48,787
Not until the proper time
to go trick-or-treating.

69
00:04:48,871 --> 00:04:52,082
Now, if you'll follow me
inside, I have all the fun

70
00:04:52,166 --> 00:04:54,668
meticulously planned out.

71
00:04:55,628 --> 00:04:57,879
Now, gather round, everyone.

72
00:04:57,964 --> 00:05:02,050
As you see, I've collected all the candy
to be found in the Hundred Acre Wood,

73
00:05:02,135 --> 00:05:05,178
and divided it into equal
, easy-to-carry sacks.

74
00:05:05,263 --> 00:05:08,307
Tonight, each of you
will take your sack home

75
00:05:08,391 --> 00:05:10,559
and dispense it for
trick-or-treating.

76
00:05:10,643 --> 00:05:13,770
Pooh Bear, you'll be
trick-or-treating with Piglet.

77
00:05:13,855 --> 00:05:16,023
Roo, you'll be with Lumpy.

78
00:05:16,107 --> 00:05:17,691
And I'll be with Tigger.

79
00:05:19,569 --> 00:05:22,696
-What about me?
-You, Eeyore?

80
00:05:22,780 --> 00:05:26,158
Forgot about me, didn't you?

81
00:05:26,242 --> 00:05:27,784
lt figures.

82
00:05:27,869 --> 00:05:29,661
The point is to get organized.

83
00:05:29,746 --> 00:05:33,248
If we follow the plan, we can
make this the best Halloween ever.

84
00:05:33,333 --> 00:05:34,416
Oh, boy!

85
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:37,753
Trick-or-treating begins promptly
at the stroke of sunset.

86
00:05:37,837 --> 00:05:40,922
But I don't think my tummy
can wait that long, Rabbit.

87
00:05:41,007 --> 00:05:43,008
lt wants a treat now.

88
00:05:43,092 --> 00:05:46,178
Well, your tummy will
just have to wait, Pooh.

89
00:05:46,262 --> 00:05:49,264
We need to save all the
candy for tonight.

90
00:05:50,933 --> 00:05:54,519
See, Lumpy? This is gonna be a
great night of trick-or-treating.

91
00:05:54,604 --> 00:05:58,690
I think I'm gonna like this Heffaween.
.. Hallow...

92
00:05:58,775 --> 00:06:02,527
The word is "Halloween".

93
00:06:02,612 --> 00:06:05,322
And it's time we
showed our new friend

94
00:06:05,406 --> 00:06:09,659
what my favourite night
of the year is all about.

95
00:06:12,622 --> 00:06:15,707
Now, a Halloween-y night is good

96
00:06:15,792 --> 00:06:19,252
When we're trick or
treatin' through the woods

97
00:06:19,379 --> 00:06:22,839
I'll be sneakin' up and peekin'
While my tippety toes are creakin'

98
00:06:22,924 --> 00:06:25,926
Boogity Boo-in' like a
Super Tigger should

99
00:06:26,010 --> 00:06:29,054
Well, a sweet treat
is just my cup of tea

100
00:06:29,180 --> 00:06:32,140
And a tricky-trick is
just the treat for me

101
00:06:32,225 --> 00:06:35,852
Oh, everybody pay attention
'Cause I really hate to mention

102
00:06:35,937 --> 00:06:38,647
That the ghoulie ghosts
are howling up a tree

103
00:06:38,731 --> 00:06:42,275
We are daring to be scaring

104
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:45,362
Who's behind that
mask you're wearing

105
00:06:45,446 --> 00:06:47,114
We can "Boo!" a spooky greetin'

106
00:06:47,198 --> 00:06:49,282
Then we'll share the
sweets we're eating

107
00:06:49,367 --> 00:06:52,411
When we're home from
trick-or-treating With our friends

108
00:06:52,537 --> 00:06:55,580
Oh, the Spookables crawl
out from where they hide

109
00:06:55,665 --> 00:06:58,875
Do you think they might
be hiding here inside?

110
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:02,421
-Well, together we're more clever
-We go places they would never!

111
00:07:02,505 --> 00:07:05,382
And a boo-hoo-hoo will
send 'em for a ride

112
00:07:05,466 --> 00:07:08,885
We are daring to be scaring

113
00:07:08,970 --> 00:07:11,721
Who's behind that
mask you're wearing?

114
00:07:11,806 --> 00:07:13,473
We can "Boo!" a spooky greeting

115
00:07:13,558 --> 00:07:15,559
Then we'll share the
sweets we're eating

116
00:07:15,643 --> 00:07:18,687
When we're home from
trick-or-treating With our friends

117
00:07:18,771 --> 00:07:21,731
We are daring to be scaring

118
00:07:21,858 --> 00:07:25,026
Who's behind that
mask you're wearing?

119
00:07:25,111 --> 00:07:28,905
We can "Boo!" a spooky greeting Then
we'll share the sweets we're eating

120
00:07:28,990 --> 00:07:32,826
When we're home from
trick-or-treating

121
00:07:32,910 --> 00:07:36,037
With our friends

122
00:07:42,753 --> 00:07:45,130
Bravo, Tigger.

123
00:07:45,214 --> 00:07:48,091
You've succeeded in
terrifying poor Lumpy.

124
00:07:49,302 --> 00:07:51,553
Lumpy, please come out.

125
00:07:51,637 --> 00:07:53,680
Halloween isn't that scary.

126
00:07:53,764 --> 00:07:57,058
-Right, Tigger?
-You said it, Roo, old pal.

127
00:07:57,143 --> 00:08:00,395
Not scary is just what it is.

128
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:03,857
As long as we don't run into
the Gobloon, of course.

129
00:08:03,941 --> 00:08:06,651
No! Not the Gobloon!

130
00:08:06,736 --> 00:08:09,196
-What's a Gobloon?
-Well, I'm glad you asked.

131
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:11,573
I didn't wanna leave
you in the dark.

132
00:08:11,699 --> 00:08:14,910
The Gobloon is the
scardiest fraidifier

133
00:08:14,994 --> 00:08:17,871
that ever scarified
on Halloween night.

134
00:08:17,955 --> 00:08:23,418
And he lives in the eeriest
part of the Hundred Acre Woods.

135
00:08:24,504 --> 00:08:27,797
His lair lies beyond
the Creepy Cave...

136
00:08:27,882 --> 00:08:30,842
-Dear.
-...down the Slimy Slide,

137
00:08:30,927 --> 00:08:36,306
and in the Tree of Terror!

138
00:08:37,642 --> 00:08:39,643
There, there, Lumpy.

139
00:08:39,727 --> 00:08:41,353
Don't listen to that lunatic.

140
00:08:43,814 --> 00:08:45,982
There's no such thing
as a Gobloon.

141
00:08:46,067 --> 00:08:48,485
You are so wrong, Long-Ears!

142
00:08:48,569 --> 00:08:49,945
-Tigger...
-Rabbit...

143
00:08:50,029 --> 00:08:51,696
-Lunatic.
-Long ears.

144
00:08:55,076 --> 00:08:57,244
Wrong you are, Long-Ears.

145
00:08:57,328 --> 00:08:59,996
Every Halloween,
he roams the woods

146
00:09:00,081 --> 00:09:03,625
for poor victims to turn
into jaggedy lanterns.

147
00:09:04,919 --> 00:09:07,212
Jaggedy lanterns!

148
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:09,089
Lumpy!

149
00:09:09,215 --> 00:09:11,883
I'm sure the Gobloon
isn't all bad.

150
00:09:11,968 --> 00:09:13,134
Right, Tigger?

151
00:09:13,219 --> 00:09:15,303
As a point of factin', Roo-boy,

152
00:09:15,388 --> 00:09:17,847
there is one good thing
about the Gobloon.

153
00:09:17,932 --> 00:09:21,268
If you catch him, you
get to make a wish.

154
00:09:21,352 --> 00:09:24,271
Did you hear that, Lumpy?
What kind of wish?

155
00:09:24,355 --> 00:09:26,022
Well, only the wish-iest wish

156
00:09:26,107 --> 00:09:28,567
that you could ever
wish about wishing for.

157
00:09:28,651 --> 00:09:31,027
Meaning, anything at all.

158
00:09:31,112 --> 00:09:33,321
-Wow!
-Oh, fiddlesticks and nonsense.

159
00:09:33,406 --> 00:09:37,242
There's no such thing as a Gobloon
and that's all there is to it!

160
00:09:40,371 --> 00:09:42,956
Lumpy? Please come out.

161
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:45,333
-Please?
-No, thanks.

162
00:09:45,459 --> 00:09:49,004
Don't want to get turned
into a jaggedy lantern.

163
00:09:49,088 --> 00:09:51,256
Lumpy won't come out.

164
00:09:51,340 --> 00:09:52,757
What do we do?

165
00:09:54,385 --> 00:09:58,471
This is going to require thought,
planning, concentration.

166
00:09:58,556 --> 00:10:02,392
Quick, everyone. "Operation
: Extract the Heffalump."

167
00:10:02,476 --> 00:10:06,021
Everyone grab hold. Heave ho!

168
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:13,570
We have to get organized.
All together now.

169
00:10:13,654 --> 00:10:15,488
Put some muscle into it.

170
00:10:16,949 --> 00:10:18,617
But I don't wanna come out!

171
00:10:18,659 --> 00:10:20,410
Come on, pull!

172
00:10:21,787 --> 00:10:23,872
Watch my tail, Piglet.

173
00:10:25,541 --> 00:10:27,709
Easy on the stripes back there.

174
00:10:27,793 --> 00:10:31,296
Somehow I don't believe
they thought this through.

175
00:10:31,380 --> 00:10:34,507
Come on, little Lumpster,
don't be scarified.

176
00:10:34,592 --> 00:10:36,676
The front of me's
not coming out.

177
00:10:36,761 --> 00:10:38,637
And the back of me's
not coming out.

178
00:10:38,721 --> 00:10:41,640
And neither is my middle.

179
00:10:46,854 --> 00:10:48,313
Who turned out the lights?

180
00:10:53,402 --> 00:10:55,820
-It's a Spookable! Help!
-Spookables! Run!

181
00:10:55,905 --> 00:10:57,989
-Help!
-Oh, my!

182
00:11:04,413 --> 00:11:07,540
Ah, well, that's more like it.

183
00:11:08,167 --> 00:11:11,461
I guess I taught him
a lesson or two.

184
00:11:12,129 --> 00:11:13,963
Please come out, Lumpy.

185
00:11:14,048 --> 00:11:16,841
I thought we were gonna
spend Halloween together?

186
00:11:16,926 --> 00:11:19,594
You can come under
here if you want.

187
00:11:23,891 --> 00:11:26,101
You guys go ahead.

188
00:11:27,103 --> 00:11:29,562
I'll stay here with Lumpy.

189
00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:38,279
It's OK, Lumpy.

190
00:11:38,364 --> 00:11:42,492
I was just really looking forward
to trick-or-treating together.

191
00:11:44,328 --> 00:11:46,830
Lumpy! You're not
hiding anymore.

192
00:11:46,914 --> 00:11:49,958
-Aren't you afraid?
-Oh, I still am.

193
00:11:50,042 --> 00:11:51,835
But as long as we're together,

194
00:11:51,919 --> 00:11:53,878
I can be brave.

195
00:11:53,963 --> 00:11:56,506
-Hooray for Lumpy!
-Good for you!

196
00:11:56,590 --> 00:11:58,341
That's what I'm talking about!

197
00:11:58,426 --> 00:12:01,219
Well, this calls
for a celebration.

198
00:12:01,303 --> 00:12:03,346
Piglet, fetch some candy.

199
00:12:03,431 --> 00:12:05,098
Yes, sir. Rabbit, sir.

200
00:12:09,019 --> 00:12:10,687
Yes, I know.

201
00:12:10,771 --> 00:12:12,397
You're all surprised.

202
00:12:12,481 --> 00:12:15,650
"No candy until
tonight," I said.

203
00:12:15,735 --> 00:12:18,903
But special occasions
call for sweets.

204
00:12:18,988 --> 00:12:21,823
So, Piglet, one piece
of candy each.

205
00:12:23,367 --> 00:12:26,494
-Rabbit?
-Yes, Piglet. The candy, if you please.

206
00:12:26,579 --> 00:12:28,663
Oh, dear. That's just it.

207
00:12:28,748 --> 00:12:30,790
Well, what is it, Piglet?
Spit it out!

208
00:12:30,875 --> 00:12:35,211
Well, there's no candy
left, Rabbit, sir.

209
00:12:35,296 --> 00:12:37,464
What do you mean,
"no candy left"?

210
00:12:37,548 --> 00:12:39,883
There's sacks and sacks
of it over there.

211
00:12:40,843 --> 00:12:43,970
Pooh Bear? You ate
all our candy?

212
00:12:44,054 --> 00:12:46,639
Mighty impressive for
one bear, though.

213
00:12:46,724 --> 00:12:48,391
I don't know how it happened.

214
00:12:48,476 --> 00:12:50,769
I only wanted one, but...

215
00:12:50,895 --> 00:12:53,521
...my tummy kept
asking for more.

216
00:12:54,899 --> 00:12:57,984
There's gotta be some
left here somewhere.

217
00:12:58,068 --> 00:13:00,403
We can't have Halloween
without candy.

218
00:13:00,488 --> 00:13:03,364
Well, I'll betcha Rabbit has
a few sweets tucked away.

219
00:13:03,449 --> 00:13:05,492
Don't ya, Long-Ears?

220
00:13:05,618 --> 00:13:07,952
I'm afraid not, Tigger.

221
00:13:14,877 --> 00:13:17,796
You see, I've collected
every bit of candy

222
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:19,756
from the Hundred Acre Wood.

223
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:22,133
I'm afraid...

224
00:13:22,259 --> 00:13:26,137
...there will be no trick-or-treating
this year. Oh, dear.

225
00:13:26,180 --> 00:13:28,890
Oh, bother.

226
00:13:28,974 --> 00:13:31,392
My tummy says it's sorry.

227
00:13:34,188 --> 00:13:37,106
I wish there was some way
we can get more candy.

228
00:13:37,191 --> 00:13:40,109
"Wish"? Maybe there is a way.

229
00:13:40,194 --> 00:13:42,320
Remember Tigger's story?

230
00:13:42,404 --> 00:13:44,030
If we catch the Gobloon,

231
00:13:44,114 --> 00:13:46,533
we could wish for enough
candy for everyone.

232
00:13:46,659 --> 00:13:48,952
Yeah! We can save Halloween.

233
00:13:49,036 --> 00:13:53,498
But if the Gobloon caught us,
we'd be jaggedy lanterns.

234
00:13:55,543 --> 00:13:57,585
Don't worry. I'll
be right there.

235
00:13:57,670 --> 00:13:59,212
I won't let him hurt you.

236
00:14:03,008 --> 00:14:04,384
OK, Lumpy,

237
00:14:04,468 --> 00:14:07,345
let's just go find some
costumes for tonight.

238
00:14:07,429 --> 00:14:10,598
Yes, Roo, let us do so.

239
00:14:10,683 --> 00:14:12,767
That's the spirit.

240
00:14:12,852 --> 00:14:15,353
We can still have
fun without candy.

241
00:14:15,980 --> 00:14:19,524
And don't forget, be back
promptly at the stroke of sunset.

242
00:14:19,608 --> 00:14:20,817
We will!

243
00:14:30,703 --> 00:14:33,329
Now, what did Tigger say again?
Oh, yeah.

244
00:14:33,414 --> 00:14:35,540
First we gotta find
the Creepy Cave,

245
00:14:35,624 --> 00:14:39,294
then the Slimy Slide and then.
..

246
00:14:39,420 --> 00:14:43,214
-The Tree of Terror.
-Oh, right. The Tree of Terror.

247
00:14:43,340 --> 00:14:44,674
Thanks, Lumpy. Come on!

248
00:14:44,758 --> 00:14:48,011
We're gonna make this the
best Halloween ever.

249
00:14:48,095 --> 00:14:51,389
Take that! And that! And that!

250
00:14:51,473 --> 00:14:53,766
I proclaim Lumpy and Roo

251
00:14:53,851 --> 00:14:56,603
to be the floundering
members of the...

252
00:14:58,731 --> 00:15:00,857
Bravest of the brave?

253
00:15:00,941 --> 00:15:04,736
The Bravest of the Brave
Gobloon Catchers' Club.

254
00:15:04,820 --> 00:15:07,989
Brave together! Brave forever!

255
00:15:08,073 --> 00:15:10,575
Conquerors of the Gobloon!

256
00:15:11,201 --> 00:15:12,243
Now shake.

257
00:15:15,873 --> 00:15:18,124
No, no! Shake hands.

258
00:15:18,208 --> 00:15:20,627
That means we stick
together, no matter what.

259
00:15:20,711 --> 00:15:23,171
What are we waiting for?
Let's go!

260
00:15:27,217 --> 00:15:31,471
We're friends forever
We'll be brave together

261
00:15:31,555 --> 00:15:35,850
We can weather
whatever comes along

262
00:15:36,477 --> 00:15:38,144
One can do it Two is better

263
00:15:38,228 --> 00:15:40,188
You and me together forever

264
00:15:40,272 --> 00:15:42,398
Braver than brave
Stronger than strong

265
00:15:42,483 --> 00:15:44,192
Brave together Singing our song

266
00:15:44,276 --> 00:15:46,861
-We're friends forever
-One can do it, two is better

267
00:15:46,946 --> 00:15:49,113
-We'll be brave together
-You and me together forever

268
00:15:49,198 --> 00:15:51,324
Braver than brave
Stronger than strong

269
00:15:51,408 --> 00:15:53,409
Brave together Singing our song

270
00:15:53,494 --> 00:15:55,370
Rumple de doodle Rumple dee dee

271
00:15:55,496 --> 00:15:57,789
We'll rumble and tumble
like bumbly bees

272
00:15:57,873 --> 00:15:59,958
Two together Together we're one

273
00:16:00,042 --> 00:16:02,335
Rumple de doodle
De doodle de dum

274
00:16:02,419 --> 00:16:04,253
-You're my buddy
-You're mine too

275
00:16:04,380 --> 00:16:06,673
-If I get scared
-I'm right behind you

276
00:16:06,757 --> 00:16:11,177
lt would be super if we could be
the bravest friends in history

277
00:16:13,180 --> 00:16:17,725
We're friends forever
We'll be brave together

278
00:16:17,810 --> 00:16:26,192
We can weather
whatever comes along

279
00:16:26,276 --> 00:16:30,822
We can weather whatever

280
00:16:30,906 --> 00:16:32,031
Comes

281
00:16:32,116 --> 00:16:33,616
Along

282
00:16:44,128 --> 00:16:47,422
No prizes for guessing
where the Gobloon lives?

283
00:16:47,506 --> 00:16:51,342
Oh, don't worry.
Gobloon catchers, ho!

284
00:16:53,554 --> 00:16:55,054
Lumpy?

285
00:16:58,142 --> 00:16:59,142
Come on!

286
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:02,103
All right.

287
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:06,441
Know what I'm gonna wish for
when we catch that Gobloon?

288
00:17:06,525 --> 00:17:09,861
Assuming the Gobloon
doesn't catch us first?

289
00:17:09,945 --> 00:17:12,113
I'm gonna wish for
a million cookies,

290
00:17:12,197 --> 00:17:14,032
and then a million candies,

291
00:17:14,116 --> 00:17:16,492
then three more wishes.

292
00:17:16,618 --> 00:17:18,828
-How 'bout you?
-Gosh.

293
00:17:18,912 --> 00:17:20,997
I've already got my best friend

294
00:17:21,081 --> 00:17:23,916
and a lunch box full
of rumpledoodles.

295
00:17:24,001 --> 00:17:26,002
What else do I need?

296
00:17:35,721 --> 00:17:37,221
What was that?

297
00:17:37,306 --> 00:17:39,515
lt sounded like it
came from over there.

298
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:40,933
Look!

299
00:17:43,103 --> 00:17:44,896
That's gotta be the Creepy Cave,

300
00:17:44,980 --> 00:17:46,439
just like Tigger said.

301
00:17:46,523 --> 00:17:48,649
The Slimy Slide
can't be far off.

302
00:17:48,734 --> 00:17:50,193
Come on, Lumpy.

303
00:17:57,159 --> 00:17:58,451
Whoa!

304
00:18:00,996 --> 00:18:02,830
Let's go!

305
00:18:06,460 --> 00:18:09,545
It's OK, Lumpy. It's only an echo.
Listen.

306
00:18:09,630 --> 00:18:11,005
Gobloon!

307
00:18:13,675 --> 00:18:17,386
Roo, please don't
do that again.

308
00:18:17,471 --> 00:18:18,846
I'm sorry.

309
00:18:37,491 --> 00:18:40,952
Roo! Something's following us.

310
00:18:42,663 --> 00:18:45,623
-I don't see anything.
-I heard it.

311
00:18:45,707 --> 00:18:47,416
I don't hear anything, either.

312
00:18:47,501 --> 00:18:49,544
My ears are bigger than yours.

313
00:18:49,628 --> 00:18:52,088
Lumpy, it's all in
your imagination.

314
00:19:02,224 --> 00:19:05,017
It's right behind me, Roo.
lt kicked me in the bottom.

315
00:19:05,102 --> 00:19:06,727
Lumpy! Stop!

316
00:19:08,063 --> 00:19:10,481
It's only your lunch box. See?

317
00:19:10,566 --> 00:19:13,651
I don't care. This is too scary.

318
00:19:13,735 --> 00:19:15,153
I don't want to go on.

319
00:19:15,237 --> 00:19:16,654
But we can't stop now.

320
00:19:16,780 --> 00:19:17,822
I'm sorry, Roo.

321
00:19:17,906 --> 00:19:21,826
I'm not taking another
step and that is final!

322
00:19:21,910 --> 00:19:24,579
We're almost through the cave.
All we have to...

323
00:19:24,663 --> 00:19:27,832
... find is the Slimy Slide!

324
00:19:34,506 --> 00:19:37,592
Lumpy? Are you OK?

325
00:19:37,676 --> 00:19:39,844
I think so.

326
00:19:46,351 --> 00:19:48,853
OK, we got through the
cave and down the slide.

327
00:19:48,979 --> 00:19:52,064
But where's that Tree of Terror?

328
00:19:54,067 --> 00:19:56,736
Wonder which way we should go?

329
00:20:04,912 --> 00:20:06,704
Smell anything?

330
00:20:08,540 --> 00:20:09,790
Nope.

331
00:20:09,875 --> 00:20:11,709
See anything?

332
00:20:15,547 --> 00:20:18,507
-Nope.
-Maybe he's not home.

333
00:20:18,592 --> 00:20:21,677
Well, only one way to find out.

334
00:20:22,346 --> 00:20:23,930
What are you going to do?

335
00:20:24,014 --> 00:20:26,974
Don't worry. I have a plan.

336
00:21:02,219 --> 00:21:03,552
Lumpy!

337
00:21:03,637 --> 00:21:06,472
You know what? He must
be out Goblooning.

338
00:21:06,556 --> 00:21:08,224
He could be back any minute.

339
00:21:08,308 --> 00:21:11,769
He could turn us into
jaggedy lanterns.

340
00:21:11,895 --> 00:21:14,605
I don't think I
can do this, Roo.

341
00:21:14,690 --> 00:21:16,607
I want to go home.

342
00:21:16,692 --> 00:21:20,152
If we leave, we won't catch the
Gobloon and we won't get our wishes

343
00:21:20,237 --> 00:21:23,281
and we won't have candy and
I won't get to show you

344
00:21:23,365 --> 00:21:24,824
how great Halloween is.

345
00:21:24,908 --> 00:21:26,784
I'm sorry.

346
00:21:26,868 --> 00:21:29,120
I'm just so scared.

347
00:21:30,622 --> 00:21:32,790
Gosh, I wish Piglet was here.

348
00:21:32,874 --> 00:21:34,375
-Piglet?
-Yeah.

349
00:21:34,459 --> 00:21:38,129
He was so afraid of Halloween once,
it almost was a Hallow-wasn't.

350
00:21:38,213 --> 00:21:41,257
-But then he got un-scared.
-Really?

351
00:21:42,259 --> 00:21:46,137
Say, maybe if I told
you the story, Lumpy,

352
00:21:46,221 --> 00:21:48,097
you might be un-scared too.

353
00:21:48,181 --> 00:21:49,932
All right.

354
00:21:50,058 --> 00:21:53,269
lt happened before Mom and I
moved to the Hundred Acre Wood.

355
00:21:53,353 --> 00:21:54,854
lt was Halloween,

356
00:21:54,938 --> 00:21:58,232
and everyone was really excited
to go trick-or-treating.

357
00:21:58,317 --> 00:22:00,735
They all had funny costumes

358
00:22:00,819 --> 00:22:03,654
and Pooh Bear's was the
bestest of them all.

359
00:22:03,739 --> 00:22:05,281
Look, there he is now.

360
00:22:05,365 --> 00:22:07,158
Hi, Pooh Bear. What
are you up to?

361
00:22:07,242 --> 00:22:09,535
Practicing.

362
00:22:09,619 --> 00:22:11,120
For Halloween.

363
00:22:11,204 --> 00:22:13,706
Which happens to happen soon.

364
00:22:13,790 --> 00:22:16,125
So I must be prepared.

365
00:22:18,170 --> 00:22:21,088
Though I'm not
fond of tricking,

366
00:22:21,173 --> 00:22:23,215
I do enjoy treating,

367
00:22:23,300 --> 00:22:25,468
because treating means...

368
00:22:26,345 --> 00:22:27,595
...eating.

369
00:22:28,347 --> 00:22:32,099
Bother. I've smackled every
smackeral of hon...

370
00:22:33,101 --> 00:22:36,020
Happy Halloweenin'
to ya, Pooh-boy!

371
00:22:37,939 --> 00:22:40,483
Not late, am I? Didn't
miss any anythin', did I?

372
00:22:40,567 --> 00:22:42,985
Halloween's what
Tiggers like the best.

373
00:22:45,947 --> 00:22:48,032
Trick or treat!

374
00:22:48,116 --> 00:22:50,910
Hello, Pooh. Hello, Tigger.

375
00:22:55,415 --> 00:22:57,375
Nice costume.

376
00:22:57,459 --> 00:22:59,251
You make a good yak.

377
00:22:59,378 --> 00:23:03,798
I'm not supposed to be some
yakkety-yakketin'-yak!

378
00:23:05,801 --> 00:23:08,260
Now I gotta get a new outfit!

379
00:23:08,345 --> 00:23:12,139
'Cause I'm gonna win
that Best Costume Prize.

380
00:23:12,224 --> 00:23:14,183
You wait and see!

381
00:23:16,311 --> 00:23:19,897
But, Gopher, I don't think
there is such a prize.

382
00:23:19,981 --> 00:23:22,149
Fine with me!

383
00:23:23,693 --> 00:23:26,404
Cuts down on the competition.

384
00:23:27,155 --> 00:23:29,073
Night'll be fallin'
any minute now,

385
00:23:29,157 --> 00:23:31,992
and I still haven't pulled
any warm-up tricks!

386
00:23:32,744 --> 00:23:35,371
But, Tigger, we can't go yet.

387
00:23:36,832 --> 00:23:38,416
What do you mean?

388
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:40,668
Halloween night
won't last all day,

389
00:23:40,752 --> 00:23:42,461
and we gotta be ready for it!

390
00:23:42,546 --> 00:23:45,881
But our very dear friend
Piglet is not here.

391
00:23:45,966 --> 00:23:49,385
And I would have thought he
should have been by now.

392
00:23:49,469 --> 00:23:52,263
I hope he is all right.

393
00:23:53,682 --> 00:23:57,059
Yes, Piglet, you're gonna
be quite all right.

394
00:23:57,144 --> 00:24:00,020
Because this year is
going to be the year.

395
00:24:00,105 --> 00:24:03,065
This Halloween, you're
going to enjoy yourself.

396
00:24:03,150 --> 00:24:05,443
Nothing is going
to frighten you.

397
00:24:08,780 --> 00:24:10,948
There! If I'm not scared

398
00:24:11,032 --> 00:24:14,702
of something as frightful as this,
I'll be unafraid of anything!

399
00:24:16,496 --> 00:24:18,372
I hope.

400
00:24:18,457 --> 00:24:21,292
Ghoulish goblin Ghastly ghost

401
00:24:21,376 --> 00:24:24,211
Everything scares me the most

402
00:24:24,296 --> 00:24:26,255
All I really want to do

403
00:24:26,339 --> 00:24:29,467
ls be with Pooh,
Eeyore and Tigger

404
00:24:29,551 --> 00:24:32,052
Kind of creepy, sort of scary

405
00:24:32,179 --> 00:24:34,763
Yes, but maybe not so very

406
00:24:34,848 --> 00:24:37,141
Well, in order to be brave

407
00:24:37,225 --> 00:24:41,645
I tell myself that
I am not afraid

408
00:24:41,730 --> 00:24:43,272
No, not too much

409
00:24:43,356 --> 00:24:46,734
And if I am not afraid

410
00:24:46,860 --> 00:24:48,986
Not more than a touch

411
00:24:49,070 --> 00:24:52,740
I can be around my friends

412
00:24:52,824 --> 00:24:56,202
And being with them
is much better

413
00:24:56,286 --> 00:24:58,996
We might be more brave together

414
00:24:59,080 --> 00:25:01,957
Then I can say that
I am not af...

415
00:25:02,042 --> 00:25:04,460
What if some spook
comes up to me

416
00:25:04,544 --> 00:25:07,004
When it's dark and really gloomy

417
00:25:07,088 --> 00:25:10,049
How very grand to stand up tall

418
00:25:10,133 --> 00:25:13,552
But could I even stand at all?

419
00:25:13,637 --> 00:25:16,514
I don't have one scary feature

420
00:25:16,598 --> 00:25:19,433
A timid, small and
frightened creature

421
00:25:19,518 --> 00:25:21,894
Dear, oh dear, I'm
just not brave

422
00:25:21,978 --> 00:25:23,354
I want to tell them

423
00:25:23,438 --> 00:25:26,524
I am not afraid

424
00:25:26,608 --> 00:25:28,442
No, not too much

425
00:25:28,527 --> 00:25:31,820
And if I am not afraid

426
00:25:31,905 --> 00:25:34,031
Not more than a touch

427
00:25:34,115 --> 00:25:37,868
I can be around my friends

428
00:25:37,953 --> 00:25:40,996
And being with them
is much better

429
00:25:41,081 --> 00:25:43,707
We might be more brave together

430
00:25:43,792 --> 00:25:46,585
It's Halloween I'll face my fear

431
00:25:46,670 --> 00:25:50,589
'Cause it's the spookiest
night of the year

432
00:25:50,674 --> 00:25:55,135
What a very grand
thing to be so brave

433
00:25:55,220 --> 00:26:00,391
To show myself that
I am not afraid

434
00:26:09,067 --> 00:26:12,611
Trick or treat. Or not.

435
00:26:12,696 --> 00:26:16,073
Why, Piglet, where
is your costume?

436
00:26:16,157 --> 00:26:18,242
Oh. I...

437
00:26:20,412 --> 00:26:23,872
Actually I haven't entirely
decided, exactly,

438
00:26:23,957 --> 00:26:26,000
just what I want
to be, precisely.

439
00:26:27,460 --> 00:26:29,503
Gasp! Look at the time.

440
00:26:29,588 --> 00:26:31,297
Half-past a quarter of sunset.

441
00:26:31,381 --> 00:26:34,883
And I still haven't done any
warmin'-uppin'! Come on!

442
00:26:38,054 --> 00:26:41,682
I gotta try some
trick-or-trickin' on old Rabbit.

443
00:26:41,766 --> 00:26:44,101
There is a trick to
pullin' tricks, you know.

444
00:26:47,439 --> 00:26:49,106
Storm brewin'.

445
00:26:50,317 --> 00:26:51,859
Oh, dear.

446
00:26:52,652 --> 00:26:53,777
Piglet.

447
00:26:53,862 --> 00:26:57,573
If you were I and I were you,

448
00:26:57,657 --> 00:27:01,160
would you think my costume will
get me plenty of treats tonight?

449
00:27:01,244 --> 00:27:04,330
Namely, honey.

450
00:27:04,831 --> 00:27:08,834
I should give it a
trying-out to be sure.

451
00:27:08,918 --> 00:27:11,754
Oh, Pooh, I really don't know.

452
00:27:11,838 --> 00:27:15,466
Say, where y'all buzzing
off to, buddy boys?

453
00:27:20,513 --> 00:27:23,807
I shall know I'm all
the bee that I can be,

454
00:27:23,892 --> 00:27:25,726
if the bees see me

455
00:27:25,810 --> 00:27:28,729
and see a bee instead of me.

456
00:27:28,813 --> 00:27:30,064
See?

457
00:27:33,860 --> 00:27:35,736
Oh, Pooh Bear!

458
00:27:37,030 --> 00:27:39,073
Perhaps it would
be best, Piglet,

459
00:27:39,157 --> 00:27:41,450
if you didn't call me by name.

460
00:27:41,576 --> 00:27:44,411
lt might make the bees curious.

461
00:27:44,496 --> 00:27:47,331
I'm sorry, Pooh Who Isn't.

462
00:27:58,009 --> 00:28:00,678
A trick? Or treat?

463
00:28:02,597 --> 00:28:04,139
Oh, bother.

464
00:28:06,559 --> 00:28:10,771
Each precious pumpkin a
picture of perfection!

465
00:28:12,565 --> 00:28:14,983
No, no, no!

466
00:28:15,068 --> 00:28:18,278
Not this way. That
way, to your left.

467
00:28:18,363 --> 00:28:20,197
No, your other left!

468
00:28:22,617 --> 00:28:24,410
Oh, my!

469
00:28:24,536 --> 00:28:27,371
My poor pumpkins.

470
00:28:28,164 --> 00:28:29,873
Are you all right, Pauline?

471
00:28:29,958 --> 00:28:32,543
Oh, speak to me, Pietro.

472
00:28:32,627 --> 00:28:36,296
Oh, don't you know me, Petunia?

473
00:28:36,381 --> 00:28:38,966
Trick or treat!

474
00:28:39,050 --> 00:28:41,301
Not now, Gopher.

475
00:28:41,386 --> 00:28:43,595
And why are you dressed
like a muskrat?

476
00:28:43,680 --> 00:28:45,222
Muskrat?

477
00:28:46,391 --> 00:28:49,935
That guy wouldn't know a rabbit
from a hole in the ground!

478
00:28:57,902 --> 00:29:00,154
Look at all the
pretty pumplekins!

479
00:29:00,238 --> 00:29:03,073
Jackie-lanterns just
waitin' to happen!

480
00:29:19,382 --> 00:29:27,473
Oh, dear!

481
00:29:27,557 --> 00:29:29,558
Tigger, stop that!

482
00:29:29,642 --> 00:29:32,478
I have no time for this
Halloween nonsense.

483
00:29:32,562 --> 00:29:36,064
I have work to do. I have
pumpkins to protect!

484
00:29:36,149 --> 00:29:38,400
How's this one?

485
00:29:38,485 --> 00:29:41,236
Of all my favourite holidays,

486
00:29:41,321 --> 00:29:43,614
Halloween isn't.

487
00:29:54,250 --> 00:29:56,210
A stormin'-good storm.

488
00:29:56,336 --> 00:29:59,213
This is gonna be the
bestest Halloween ever!

489
00:29:59,339 --> 00:30:01,715
With loads of lightnin'!

490
00:30:03,009 --> 00:30:05,344
And thunderous thunderin'!

491
00:30:06,679 --> 00:30:09,973
And windiferous winds
breaking everywhere!

492
00:30:13,937 --> 00:30:16,063
Oh, dear.

493
00:30:16,648 --> 00:30:21,235
Why, we're gonna be creepin'
and crawlin' with Spookables!

494
00:30:21,736 --> 00:30:23,737
Oh, dear.

495
00:30:25,156 --> 00:30:28,408
You don't suppose there
will be any Spookables

496
00:30:28,493 --> 00:30:31,453
of the honey-hungry sort?

497
00:30:31,538 --> 00:30:35,040
-Do you?
-At least half a dump of Spookables.

498
00:30:35,124 --> 00:30:39,002
And bug-eyed Woozles and
saw-toothed Jagulars!

499
00:30:40,296 --> 00:30:42,506
Oh, dear! Deary dear dear!

500
00:30:42,590 --> 00:30:43,799
Piglet.

501
00:30:53,560 --> 00:30:55,602
And then Piglet
ran for his life.

502
00:30:55,770 --> 00:30:58,689
Hey, Lumpy, is the story
making you feel any better?

503
00:31:00,775 --> 00:31:04,278
-I'll take that as a "no".
-What happened next, Roo?

504
00:31:04,362 --> 00:31:06,947
Did the Spookables get Piglet?

505
00:31:07,615 --> 00:31:09,575
Well, let's see.

506
00:31:13,872 --> 00:31:16,748
Piglet was all alone,
lost in the woods,

507
00:31:16,833 --> 00:31:20,294
on the ookiest-spookiest
night of the year,

508
00:31:21,004 --> 00:31:23,130
which really wasn't
the best place to be.

509
00:31:33,975 --> 00:31:36,977
There. Now you're
safe and sound.

510
00:31:39,272 --> 00:31:41,273
Who is it?

511
00:31:41,357 --> 00:31:44,860
It's me, them, and
, of course, us.

512
00:31:44,944 --> 00:31:46,778
Oh. But wait.

513
00:31:46,863 --> 00:31:50,782
Perhaps if you'd say something
only you would say,

514
00:31:50,867 --> 00:31:52,284
I'd know you're you.

515
00:31:52,368 --> 00:31:56,246
A very good idea, Piglet.
But what should I say?

516
00:31:56,331 --> 00:32:00,500
Well, possibly..
. "I am Pooh"?

517
00:32:00,585 --> 00:32:03,462
You are? Well, then who am I?

518
00:32:05,340 --> 00:32:06,924
It's Pooh.

519
00:32:10,136 --> 00:32:12,262
Are you quite all right, Piglet?

520
00:32:14,390 --> 00:32:15,432
Yes.

521
00:32:15,516 --> 00:32:19,061
You will be joining us for
Halloween, won't you?

522
00:32:19,145 --> 00:32:21,521
Well, to be perfectly honest.
..

523
00:32:21,606 --> 00:32:23,273
What I mean to say is...

524
00:32:23,358 --> 00:32:25,317
To put it another way...

525
00:32:25,401 --> 00:32:27,319
The truth of the matter is...

526
00:32:27,403 --> 00:32:29,196
As a small and timid animal,

527
00:32:29,280 --> 00:32:32,115
I'm afraid I'm
really too afraid.

528
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:33,700
Oh, but Piglet,

529
00:32:33,785 --> 00:32:37,162
Halloween without you
would be like...

530
00:32:37,246 --> 00:32:40,457
Like last year, and the
year before last year.

531
00:32:40,541 --> 00:32:42,960
And the year before that year.

532
00:32:43,044 --> 00:32:45,879
And all the years leadin'
up to and includin'

533
00:32:45,964 --> 00:32:47,881
every last Halloween ever.

534
00:32:47,966 --> 00:32:51,009
I'm very, very sorry indeed.

535
00:32:51,094 --> 00:32:53,845
Oh, that's quite
all right, Piglet.

536
00:32:53,930 --> 00:32:56,890
We shall simply not
have Halloween.

537
00:32:57,016 --> 00:32:59,101
Oh, you mustn't do
that, Pooh Bear,

538
00:32:59,185 --> 00:33:01,853
-only because of me.
-Oh, no.

539
00:33:01,938 --> 00:33:04,815
This Halloween shall
be a Hallo-wasn't

540
00:33:04,899 --> 00:33:07,859
and you shall have no
reason to be frightened.

541
00:33:07,944 --> 00:33:09,945
Thank you, Pooh Bear.

542
00:33:12,573 --> 00:33:15,283
Would you like us to
stay with you, Piglet?

543
00:33:15,368 --> 00:33:19,162
No, I'll be quite all right now.

544
00:33:21,124 --> 00:33:23,500
I had hoped it wouldn't
happen this year.

545
00:33:23,584 --> 00:33:27,254
Everyone was looking
forward to Halloween so.

546
00:33:27,380 --> 00:33:30,841
I've let down Pooh and Tigger

547
00:33:30,925 --> 00:33:32,801
and Gopher and Eeyore

548
00:33:32,885 --> 00:33:36,430
and most of all... me.

549
00:33:40,476 --> 00:33:43,770
I do so hope this blusterous
and rather stormish night

550
00:33:43,855 --> 00:33:46,815
will not be too frightening
for poor Piglet.

551
00:33:46,899 --> 00:33:49,901
I suspect something
should be done.

552
00:33:49,986 --> 00:33:51,737
But what?

553
00:33:51,779 --> 00:33:53,613
I don't know either.

554
00:33:53,698 --> 00:33:55,615
Think, think.

555
00:33:55,700 --> 00:34:00,078
Why, just because Piglet can't
have Halloween with us,

556
00:34:00,163 --> 00:34:03,540
there's no reason we can't
have Hallo-wasn't with him!

557
00:34:03,624 --> 00:34:06,626
I like the way you think.

558
00:34:07,170 --> 00:34:11,631
No way, no how, am I gonna miss
out on another Halloween!

559
00:34:11,716 --> 00:34:15,385
I'll have my own
Hallo-wasn't all by myself.

560
00:34:16,679 --> 00:34:20,682
If only Piglet was more
like me and less like him.

561
00:34:22,143 --> 00:34:26,021
I love surprises and wearin' disguises
A horribly hideous costume'll do

562
00:34:26,105 --> 00:34:29,983
Better be wary, be spooky and scary
I'll bounce from the shadows and "Boo"

563
00:34:30,068 --> 00:34:32,110
I wanna scare myself
and everyone else

564
00:34:32,195 --> 00:34:34,488
Those thrilly and chilly
old willys will rise

565
00:34:34,614 --> 00:34:38,325
Cover your eyes, little buddy beware
I'm twitchin' and itchin' to scare

566
00:34:38,409 --> 00:34:39,701
Myself

567
00:34:39,786 --> 00:34:42,162
Unspeakable Spookables
Awful unlookables

568
00:34:42,246 --> 00:34:44,372
Galloping ghosties
and goblins galore

569
00:34:44,457 --> 00:34:46,208
What if they find you
Oh, look out behind you

570
00:34:46,292 --> 00:34:49,503
A terrible Tigger-type roar
That would be me, hoo-hoo

571
00:34:49,587 --> 00:34:51,713
I wanna scare myself
and everyone else

572
00:34:51,798 --> 00:34:54,091
Those thrilly and chilly
old willys will rise

573
00:34:54,217 --> 00:34:57,969
Cover your eyes, little buddy beware
I'm twitchin' and itchin' to scare

574
00:34:58,096 --> 00:34:59,429
Myself

575
00:35:01,641 --> 00:35:03,975
Now Tiggers I figger
make scares even bigger

576
00:35:04,060 --> 00:35:06,061
They dress up and scream "Who am I?
Can you guess?"

577
00:35:06,145 --> 00:35:08,021
And tricks always happen
when ghosts are a-flappin'

578
00:35:08,106 --> 00:35:12,192
And tricks are what Tiggers like best!
I wanna scare myself and everyone else

579
00:35:12,276 --> 00:35:14,277
Those thrilly and chilly
old willys will rise

580
00:35:14,362 --> 00:35:18,156
Cover your eyes, little buddy beware
I'm twitchin' and itchin' to scare

581
00:35:18,241 --> 00:35:19,741
Myself

582
00:35:21,077 --> 00:35:22,828
And who better?

583
00:35:23,371 --> 00:35:25,497
Oh, by the way. Boo!

584
00:35:29,001 --> 00:35:31,294
Spookables!

585
00:35:34,465 --> 00:35:37,217
Trick-or-treat, again.

586
00:35:37,301 --> 00:35:40,178
We're on our way to Piglet's
to have a Hallo-wasn't,

587
00:35:40,263 --> 00:35:42,973
-if you'd like to join...
-What're ya waitin' for?

588
00:35:43,057 --> 00:35:44,558
Come on!

589
00:35:48,771 --> 00:35:51,022
What was that?

590
00:35:54,193 --> 00:35:55,652
Someone's coming!

591
00:35:56,195 --> 00:36:00,157
It's a three-headed, bug-eyed
, saw-toothed Spookable!

592
00:36:01,617 --> 00:36:03,493
I must find Pooh!

593
00:36:05,079 --> 00:36:08,582
Perhaps we'd better
take off our costumes,

594
00:36:08,666 --> 00:36:10,667
so as not to frighten him.

595
00:36:10,751 --> 00:36:14,588
Piglet? Piglet?

596
00:36:17,300 --> 00:36:19,968
Don't you know what this means?

597
00:36:20,052 --> 00:36:23,180
He's been pignapped
by Spookables!

598
00:36:24,056 --> 00:36:27,225
Hup, two, three, four.

599
00:36:38,404 --> 00:36:40,614
Pooh wasn't at Eeyore's either,

600
00:36:40,740 --> 00:36:42,490
and neither was Eeyore,

601
00:36:42,575 --> 00:36:46,036
and no one was at Tigger's.

602
00:36:46,120 --> 00:36:49,289
Hello, Rabbit?

603
00:36:52,877 --> 00:36:56,338
Oh, no one at all is
where they should be.

604
00:36:59,383 --> 00:37:02,177
Oh, dear.

605
00:37:18,736 --> 00:37:21,029
Was that you, Eeyore?

606
00:37:21,113 --> 00:37:23,740
Wish I could say it was.

607
00:37:23,824 --> 00:37:25,575
But it wasn't.

608
00:37:27,578 --> 00:37:29,579
If I didn't know any better,

609
00:37:29,664 --> 00:37:32,499
I'd think you fellas
was all scaredy.

610
00:37:33,751 --> 00:37:35,877
We are.

611
00:37:42,260 --> 00:37:44,052
Well, I'm not!

612
00:37:44,887 --> 00:37:47,472
Now quit climbin' all
over me, buddy bear!

613
00:37:47,556 --> 00:37:49,349
We got piglets to find!

614
00:37:51,477 --> 00:37:53,687
I think I have had a thought.

615
00:37:53,771 --> 00:37:56,523
If we put our costumes on,

616
00:37:56,607 --> 00:37:58,733
when we find the Spookables,

617
00:37:58,859 --> 00:38:02,612
they shall think we're them and
we shall think they are us,

618
00:38:02,697 --> 00:38:05,240
so we can save Piglet

619
00:38:05,324 --> 00:38:08,201
and no one will be the wiser!

620
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:18,920
I know I got it this time!

621
00:38:29,974 --> 00:38:34,728
Oh, an infestation of ghosts
and goblins and ghouls!

622
00:38:36,439 --> 00:38:37,856
Piglet!

623
00:38:39,483 --> 00:38:42,402
Excuse me, but could someone,

624
00:38:42,486 --> 00:38:44,988
anyone really, help me?

625
00:38:48,326 --> 00:38:50,410
Oh, dear! Pooh Bear!

626
00:38:50,494 --> 00:38:52,829
Oh, they have Pooh Bear!

627
00:38:52,913 --> 00:38:56,499
Two very fierce and
savage Spookables!

628
00:39:06,510 --> 00:39:09,095
I must save my friend Pooh!

629
00:39:09,180 --> 00:39:11,056
Boo! Boo, I say.

630
00:39:11,140 --> 00:39:12,223
Boo!

631
00:39:16,520 --> 00:39:19,272
Spookable!

632
00:39:27,490 --> 00:39:29,366
What? Who's that?

633
00:39:29,450 --> 00:39:31,409
Oh no, not this way!

634
00:39:40,836 --> 00:39:42,670
Oh, dear!

635
00:39:51,639 --> 00:39:55,934
Why, Piglet, you scared
the Spookable away!

636
00:39:56,018 --> 00:39:57,310
I did?

637
00:39:57,395 --> 00:40:01,398
You did and what you
did saved us all.

638
00:40:01,482 --> 00:40:03,441
I did!

639
00:40:03,526 --> 00:40:07,445
Three cheers for the bravest
little timid guy ever!

640
00:40:07,530 --> 00:40:11,908
Hip-hip! Hooray! Hip-hip!
Hooray!

641
00:40:17,832 --> 00:40:19,290
Dagnabit!

642
00:40:19,375 --> 00:40:23,253
Why, Gopher, what a
wonderful costume.

643
00:40:23,379 --> 00:40:26,131
lt is? lt is!

644
00:40:26,215 --> 00:40:30,260
By dingy, it's the best!
That's what it is.

645
00:40:30,344 --> 00:40:33,430
Of all the Halloweens
I can remember,

646
00:40:33,514 --> 00:40:34,931
and I can't,

647
00:40:35,015 --> 00:40:37,225
this Hallo-wasn't has been

648
00:40:37,309 --> 00:40:39,978
the most unforgettable of all.

649
00:40:40,062 --> 00:40:44,274
And I got a super, grade-A,
lollapaloozin' good scare!

650
00:40:44,358 --> 00:40:46,276
Not that I was frightened by it.

651
00:40:46,360 --> 00:40:50,363
And this year Piglet has made
it all the way through,

652
00:40:50,448 --> 00:40:54,325
so our Hallo-wasn't
truly was a Hallo-was.

653
00:40:54,410 --> 00:40:57,203
Hey, wait a half a segundo.

654
00:40:57,288 --> 00:41:00,331
You never did figure out what
you're gonna be, Piglet!

655
00:41:00,458 --> 00:41:02,333
Actually, Tigger, I did.

656
00:41:02,460 --> 00:41:05,712
I've decided I'd like to
go as Pooh's very best,

657
00:41:05,796 --> 00:41:08,423
and very bravest friend.

658
00:41:08,507 --> 00:41:11,092
That, Piglet,

659
00:41:11,177 --> 00:41:14,596
is the thing I should
most like you to be.

660
00:41:15,639 --> 00:41:19,517
So, with just a little bit of
help from his very good friend...

661
00:41:19,602 --> 00:41:21,478
-Pooh Bear?
-That's right.

662
00:41:21,562 --> 00:41:23,396
Piglet became un-scared.

663
00:41:23,481 --> 00:41:25,482
And he stayed un-scared
for a while.

664
00:41:25,566 --> 00:41:29,194
'Cause he had his friends
to keep him company.

665
00:41:29,278 --> 00:41:32,280
Lumpy, did my story
un-scare you?

666
00:41:32,364 --> 00:41:33,823
I think so.

667
00:41:33,908 --> 00:41:37,076
If someone as small as
Piglet can be brave,

668
00:41:37,161 --> 00:41:40,997
-I can be twice as brave.
-At least.

669
00:41:41,081 --> 00:41:45,084
You would never leave me
alone, would you, Roo?

670
00:41:45,169 --> 00:41:47,795
Never, Lumpy. I promise.

671
00:41:47,880 --> 00:41:51,174
-Brave together.
-Brave forever.

672
00:41:51,300 --> 00:41:53,885
Conquerors of the Gobloon!

673
00:41:53,969 --> 00:41:55,887
Come on, Lumpy.

674
00:42:38,722 --> 00:42:40,139
Come on!

675
00:42:44,645 --> 00:42:47,146
All we have to do now is
wait 'til he comes home.

676
00:42:47,231 --> 00:42:50,441
Then I pull the rope, the trap
door slams down and wham!

677
00:42:50,526 --> 00:42:52,819
-We get our wishes?
-Yep!

678
00:42:52,903 --> 00:42:54,862
Now...

679
00:42:54,947 --> 00:42:58,992
Don't make a sound.

680
00:43:04,164 --> 00:43:05,498
Whoa!

681
00:43:07,126 --> 00:43:08,751
What was that?

682
00:43:08,836 --> 00:43:11,796
Maybe it's the Gobloon.

683
00:43:11,880 --> 00:43:13,840
You stay here. I'll
go check it out.

684
00:43:13,924 --> 00:43:15,717
If it's him, I'll
chase him here.

685
00:43:15,801 --> 00:43:18,928
And when I give the signal
, you spring the trap.

686
00:43:19,013 --> 00:43:20,597
What signal?

687
00:43:22,141 --> 00:43:24,601
I'll hoot like Owl. Only
instead of "hoo hoo",

688
00:43:24,685 --> 00:43:26,394
I'll hoot "Roo hoo".

689
00:43:27,396 --> 00:43:30,356
On second thought, why
don't you come with me?

690
00:43:30,441 --> 00:43:33,610
Good idea. That way I'll know
when you give the signal.

691
00:43:48,751 --> 00:43:50,543
Come on.

692
00:43:56,425 --> 00:43:59,010
It's coming from the bridge.

693
00:44:01,555 --> 00:44:03,431
Follow me.

694
00:44:08,437 --> 00:44:11,022
Lumpy, come on!

695
00:44:23,243 --> 00:44:25,453
Lumpy, quiet!

696
00:44:40,469 --> 00:44:42,220
Run, Lumpy! Run!

697
00:44:48,477 --> 00:44:50,645
The Gobloon's gonna get us.

698
00:45:06,745 --> 00:45:08,329
Help!

699
00:45:12,501 --> 00:45:14,085
Roo!

700
00:45:21,301 --> 00:45:23,136
Roo?

701
00:45:27,725 --> 00:45:30,351
Roo, where are you?

702
00:45:32,813 --> 00:45:36,858
You said you'd never
leave me alone.

703
00:46:00,883 --> 00:46:03,259
Lumpy?

704
00:46:03,343 --> 00:46:05,928
Where are you?

705
00:46:14,730 --> 00:46:18,149
Help! The Gobloon's got me!
The Gobloon's got me!

706
00:46:20,694 --> 00:46:22,695
Hold on, Roo. I'll save you!

707
00:46:22,780 --> 00:46:24,739
Help!

708
00:46:39,046 --> 00:46:40,546
Roo hoo!

709
00:46:40,631 --> 00:46:42,840
Where are you, Roo?

710
00:46:43,342 --> 00:46:44,842
Please answer me.

711
00:46:44,927 --> 00:46:46,886
Roo?

712
00:46:49,807 --> 00:46:51,974
Help! The Gobloon's got Roo!

713
00:46:54,770 --> 00:46:58,523
Brave together, brave forever.

714
00:47:00,484 --> 00:47:02,193
I'll save you, Roo.

715
00:47:02,277 --> 00:47:05,696
If Piglet can be
un-scared, so can I.

716
00:47:07,950 --> 00:47:11,744
Brave together, brave forever.

717
00:47:14,706 --> 00:47:17,500
Conquerors of the Gobloon.

718
00:47:25,884 --> 00:47:27,677
Oh, no, you don't.

719
00:47:56,832 --> 00:47:59,417
-Boo.
-Oh, hello, Eeyore.

720
00:47:59,501 --> 00:48:02,336
How'd you know it was me?

721
00:48:02,921 --> 00:48:05,214
-Hello, Piglet.
-Hello, Pooh.

722
00:48:05,340 --> 00:48:07,675
Look at me, Piglet.

723
00:48:07,759 --> 00:48:09,302
I'm a little honey pot.

724
00:48:09,386 --> 00:48:11,971
Oh, very nice, Pooh Bear.

725
00:48:12,055 --> 00:48:14,015
Oh, hi, Tigger.

726
00:48:15,475 --> 00:48:18,102
Tigger is my
mild-mannered alter-ego.

727
00:48:18,186 --> 00:48:21,355
I am Super-Tigger.

728
00:48:21,440 --> 00:48:26,193
I can leap over a house or something
really big, in a single bounce.

729
00:48:26,278 --> 00:48:29,655
And then... And I...

730
00:48:29,740 --> 00:48:31,157
I'm not kidding anyone.

731
00:48:31,241 --> 00:48:34,368
lt just doesn't feel like
Halloween without any candy.

732
00:48:34,453 --> 00:48:38,998
lt feels more like Hallow-almost
or Hallow-Not-Quite-Right.

733
00:48:39,082 --> 00:48:41,709
-Or something.
-I know what you mean, Tigger.

734
00:48:41,793 --> 00:48:44,170
Even my tummy can't be fooled.

735
00:48:45,631 --> 00:48:47,506
Cheer up, everyone.

736
00:48:47,591 --> 00:48:49,800
Halloween is saved.

737
00:48:50,427 --> 00:48:52,428
I knew you could
do it, Long-Ears.

738
00:48:52,512 --> 00:48:54,555
So, what did ya bring?
Popcorn balls?

739
00:48:54,640 --> 00:48:56,724
Candied apples? Cookies?

740
00:48:56,808 --> 00:48:58,601
-Even better.
-Honey?

741
00:48:58,685 --> 00:49:01,979
-Even better.
-As long as it's candy.

742
00:49:02,064 --> 00:49:03,105
Sure is.

743
00:49:04,441 --> 00:49:07,193
Nature's candy. Vegetables.

744
00:49:08,528 --> 00:49:10,696
Carrots. Radishes. Rutabagas.

745
00:49:10,781 --> 00:49:12,823
Oh, they're tasty, juicy,

746
00:49:12,908 --> 00:49:15,618
and most important,
good for you.

747
00:49:16,662 --> 00:49:21,290
Well, I suppose we could go
trick-or-treating with these.

748
00:49:22,459 --> 00:49:24,502
Well, I'll take
the trick, please.

749
00:49:26,254 --> 00:49:29,048
Oh, nonsense. This is
going to be the best

750
00:49:29,132 --> 00:49:32,176
and healthiest Halloween ever!

751
00:49:32,260 --> 00:49:34,011
Finally, as it should be.

752
00:49:34,096 --> 00:49:36,764
Hey, I just thought
of something.

753
00:49:36,848 --> 00:49:39,600
If we're all here to go
tricking and treating,

754
00:49:39,685 --> 00:49:43,062
then none of us are home
to be treated or tricked.

755
00:49:43,146 --> 00:49:45,272
You're right, Tigger.

756
00:49:45,357 --> 00:49:47,149
That is a bother.

757
00:49:47,234 --> 00:49:49,318
But what should we do?

758
00:49:50,195 --> 00:49:51,737
Think, think, think.

759
00:49:51,822 --> 00:49:55,074
I have an idea!
Let's take turns.

760
00:49:55,158 --> 00:49:57,451
We can practice
here at my house.

761
00:49:57,536 --> 00:49:59,704
I don't know, Piglet.

762
00:49:59,788 --> 00:50:02,164
What if you don't
answer the door?

763
00:50:02,249 --> 00:50:04,583
Oh, I will! I
promise, I will!

764
00:50:04,668 --> 00:50:06,544
Well, it's risky.

765
00:50:06,628 --> 00:50:08,295
Oh, my head hurts.

766
00:50:08,380 --> 00:50:10,464
But it's just crazy
enough to work.

767
00:50:10,549 --> 00:50:13,384
-Let's give it a try.
-Goody-goody!

768
00:50:23,520 --> 00:50:25,646
Who's there?

769
00:50:25,731 --> 00:50:28,649
It's us! Who else could it be?

770
00:50:29,818 --> 00:50:32,945
-"Us" who?
-"Us"!

771
00:50:33,030 --> 00:50:35,281
Rabbit, Tigger and Pooh Bear!

772
00:50:35,365 --> 00:50:36,907
Forgot me again.

773
00:50:36,992 --> 00:50:38,659
Prove it.

774
00:50:38,744 --> 00:50:40,703
Open this door at once!

775
00:50:46,168 --> 00:50:49,920
-Rabbit! lt is you!
-Trick-or-treat!

776
00:50:52,299 --> 00:50:53,549
Hooray!

777
00:50:54,968 --> 00:50:57,845
I can't wait to try my place.

778
00:50:57,929 --> 00:51:00,264
Wonder if I'm gonna be there.

779
00:51:08,690 --> 00:51:12,902
Lumpy?

780
00:51:12,986 --> 00:51:14,987
Where are you?

781
00:51:23,246 --> 00:51:24,789
Lumpy?

782
00:51:29,044 --> 00:51:31,295
Oh, no! The Gobloon got you!

783
00:51:31,379 --> 00:51:34,298
And he's turned you into
a jaggedy lantern.

784
00:51:34,382 --> 00:51:37,384
Say something, Lumpy.

785
00:51:38,220 --> 00:51:40,763
Oh no, Lumpy.

786
00:51:41,306 --> 00:51:42,973
Don't worry, I'll find help.

787
00:51:43,058 --> 00:51:45,559
It'll be OK.

788
00:51:45,644 --> 00:51:48,020
I won't leave you again.

789
00:51:55,028 --> 00:51:58,072
Let's give Rabbit the
old trickety-treatment.

790
00:52:00,075 --> 00:52:02,034
Knockety knock knockety.

791
00:52:02,119 --> 00:52:03,786
Guess who!

792
00:52:06,164 --> 00:52:09,291
"Guess who," he says.
Gee, I don't know.

793
00:52:09,417 --> 00:52:11,210
Pooh Bear? Tigger?

794
00:52:11,294 --> 00:52:14,046
Oh, he's good.

795
00:52:14,131 --> 00:52:16,090
Very good.

796
00:52:16,925 --> 00:52:19,635
Anyway, let's see, where
are those treats?

797
00:52:19,719 --> 00:52:20,719
Oh, here we go.

798
00:52:20,804 --> 00:52:23,764
A nice juicy rutabaga
for Pooh Bear.

799
00:52:23,849 --> 00:52:27,143
Prunes for Piglet,
celery for Eeyore,

800
00:52:27,227 --> 00:52:31,355
and for you, Tigger.
.. spinach.

801
00:52:34,484 --> 00:52:37,194
Roo-boy and Lumpy are
missing all the fun,

802
00:52:37,279 --> 00:52:40,239
and the spinach.

803
00:52:40,323 --> 00:52:43,659
I told 'em to be here at sunset.
I'm sure they'll be by any minute.

804
00:52:43,743 --> 00:52:45,119
-Help!
-Roo-boy.

805
00:52:45,203 --> 00:52:46,954
Help!

806
00:52:47,539 --> 00:52:50,374
We tried to catch the Gobloon
, and we found his tree

807
00:52:50,458 --> 00:52:52,042
but I got scared and ran away.

808
00:52:52,127 --> 00:52:54,879
Then the Gobloon turned him
into a jaggedy lantern.

809
00:52:56,673 --> 00:52:59,592
Could you start again
from that first Gobloon?

810
00:53:01,469 --> 00:53:03,929
-Gobloon!
-Oh, dear.

811
00:53:04,014 --> 00:53:06,432
The story's true. There
really is a Gobloon.

812
00:53:06,516 --> 00:53:08,267
Quick, everyone, panic!

813
00:53:08,351 --> 00:53:10,936
-Poor Lumpy.
-Oh, this will never do.

814
00:53:12,647 --> 00:53:14,481
Wait a second. I got it.

815
00:53:14,566 --> 00:53:16,901
We gotta catch the Gobloon.

816
00:53:16,985 --> 00:53:19,528
-What?
-Well, if you catch the Gobloon,

817
00:53:19,613 --> 00:53:21,989
-you get to make a wish.
-That's it, Tigger.

818
00:53:22,073 --> 00:53:23,574
We can wish Lumpy back.

819
00:53:23,700 --> 00:53:25,910
Tigger's right. Wait a minute.

820
00:53:25,994 --> 00:53:28,787
Tigger's right? That
can't be right.

821
00:53:28,788 --> 00:53:29,038


822
00:53:29,289 --> 00:53:32,833
Hurry! There's not
a moment to lose!

823
00:53:34,294 --> 00:53:36,128
-Hurry!
-Come on.

824
00:53:36,213 --> 00:53:37,755
We're gonna save him.

825
00:53:37,839 --> 00:53:39,924
-We're coming, Lumpy.
-Don't worry!

826
00:53:40,008 --> 00:53:42,426
We'll have you back
to normal in no time.

827
00:53:42,510 --> 00:53:45,679
I'm sorry I left you all alone.

828
00:53:45,764 --> 00:53:48,349
Lumpy, we're coming for you!

829
00:53:48,433 --> 00:53:50,601
We're coming, Lumpy!

830
00:53:58,193 --> 00:54:00,986
Remind me again, Pooh Bear.

831
00:54:01,071 --> 00:54:04,657
How did I ever become un-scared?

832
00:54:08,787 --> 00:54:10,079
Listen, everyone.

833
00:54:10,872 --> 00:54:13,916
The tree is making noises.

834
00:54:17,545 --> 00:54:20,506
Maybe it has a bellyache.

835
00:54:20,590 --> 00:54:23,008
That's the Gobloon!
The trap worked.

836
00:54:23,093 --> 00:54:25,010
We caught him!

837
00:54:25,095 --> 00:54:27,554
-Hooray!
-Hooray for us!

838
00:54:27,639 --> 00:54:30,391
-I knew we could do it.
-Hooray! Yay!

839
00:54:32,269 --> 00:54:34,270
Now what?

840
00:54:34,354 --> 00:54:38,482
-Knock and shout "trick-or-treat".
-I could offer him some honey.

841
00:54:38,566 --> 00:54:40,359
I don't think
Gobloons eat honey.

842
00:54:40,443 --> 00:54:42,736
Well, he could sure
have all of my spinach.

843
00:54:46,950 --> 00:54:50,494
Um, Mr Gobloon?

844
00:54:53,832 --> 00:54:56,542
I don't want candy.

845
00:54:56,626 --> 00:54:59,128
All I care about is Lumpy.

846
00:55:00,380 --> 00:55:03,340
I wish my friend back.

847
00:55:07,470 --> 00:55:10,306
You hear me, you
mean old Gobloon?

848
00:55:10,390 --> 00:55:12,433
I want my friend back!

849
00:55:12,517 --> 00:55:15,352
Roo? Roo! I'm in here!

850
00:55:51,389 --> 00:55:53,057
Lumpy?

851
00:55:53,141 --> 00:55:54,767
-You're OK!
-lt worked.

852
00:55:54,851 --> 00:55:58,937
-Things couldn't get better.
-Roo wished Lumpy back!

853
00:56:00,732 --> 00:56:02,483
-lt worked!
-Oh, yes!

854
00:56:02,567 --> 00:56:05,611
Now, that's what I
call a happy ending.

855
00:56:06,488 --> 00:56:08,530
I'm sorry I ran away, Lumpy.

856
00:56:08,656 --> 00:56:10,908
I was just so scared.

857
00:56:10,992 --> 00:56:12,493
Would you...

858
00:56:12,577 --> 00:56:15,454
Could you... forgive me?

859
00:56:15,580 --> 00:56:19,083
Gosh, Roo, you
came back for me.

860
00:56:19,167 --> 00:56:21,001
That was brave.

861
00:56:21,086 --> 00:56:25,547
I guess thinking about being
with you made me brave.

862
00:56:25,632 --> 00:56:28,926
-Brave together?
-Brave forever.

863
00:56:29,010 --> 00:56:31,720
Conquerors of the Gobloon!

864
00:56:31,805 --> 00:56:33,305
-Hooray!
-Hooray for us!

865
00:56:33,390 --> 00:56:35,766
Who needs candy to have
a great Halloween?

866
00:56:35,850 --> 00:56:37,559
When we've got each other.

867
00:56:38,436 --> 00:56:40,437
You know, it seems to me

868
00:56:40,522 --> 00:56:43,107
there's only one
thing left to say.

869
00:56:43,191 --> 00:56:44,650
I know, I know.

870
00:56:44,734 --> 00:56:46,235
Trick-or-Treat.

871
00:56:47,737 --> 00:56:50,406
-Gasp!
-Happy Halloween, everyone!

872
00:56:50,490 --> 00:56:51,824
Trick-or-Treat.

873
00:56:54,119 --> 00:56:55,994
Mama!

874
00:56:56,079 --> 00:56:57,162
Come in.

875
00:56:57,247 --> 00:57:00,624
I baked cookies and
rumpledoodles for everybody.

876
00:57:00,708 --> 00:57:03,377
And I made a special
jack-o'-lantern

877
00:57:03,420 --> 00:57:05,587
for each and every one of you.

878
00:57:07,298 --> 00:57:09,425
Hello, gorgeous.

879
00:57:10,677 --> 00:57:13,053
Doesn't look like me at all.

880
00:57:13,138 --> 00:57:15,305
Why the long face?

881
00:57:15,390 --> 00:57:19,268
Oh, look, Piglet. It's me
and my very best friend.

882
00:57:19,352 --> 00:57:20,853
Oh, mine too!

883
00:57:20,979 --> 00:57:22,980
Look, Lumpy. There's
even one for me.

884
00:57:23,064 --> 00:57:24,898
-Wow!
-But where's yours?

885
00:57:24,983 --> 00:57:26,608
I'm so sorry, Lumpy.

886
00:57:26,693 --> 00:57:28,485
I did make one for you,

887
00:57:28,570 --> 00:57:31,280
but it must have fallen
off my wheelbarrow.

888
00:57:34,868 --> 00:57:36,452
See? I told you.

889
00:57:36,578 --> 00:57:39,288
Halloween is the most fun ever.

890
00:57:39,372 --> 00:57:42,332
You were right. I
love Hallowoon.

891
00:57:42,417 --> 00:57:45,252
Hallow-woo... Hallow...

892
00:57:45,336 --> 00:57:46,462
Oh, whatever.

893
00:57:46,546 --> 00:57:49,214
As long as we're together.

894
00:57:49,549 --> 00:57:52,718
We are daring to be scaring

895
00:57:52,802 --> 00:57:55,554
Who's behind that
mask you're wearing?

896
00:57:55,638 --> 00:57:59,433
We can "Boo!" a spooky greetin' Then
we'll share the sweets we're eating

897
00:57:59,517 --> 00:58:03,896
When we're home from
trick or treating
