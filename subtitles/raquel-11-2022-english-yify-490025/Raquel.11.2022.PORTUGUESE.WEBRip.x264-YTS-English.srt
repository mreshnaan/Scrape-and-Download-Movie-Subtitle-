1
00:02:59,303 --> 00:03:01,263
I'll take the suitcases
to the bedroom.

2
00:03:01,305 --> 00:03:03,390
I thought you could stay
in the room that was mine

3
00:03:03,432 --> 00:03:05,017
and I'll stay
in your grandfather's.

4
00:03:05,058 --> 00:03:06,185
All right?

5
00:03:45,475 --> 00:03:48,352
THE SEVENTH SEAL

6
00:04:12,252 --> 00:04:14,003
- Thank you so much.
- You're welcome.

7
00:04:20,133 --> 00:04:23,553
Excuse me,
you are from the church, right?

8
00:04:24,388 --> 00:04:26,265
Are you new around here?

9
00:04:26,307 --> 00:04:27,517
I just arrived.

10
00:04:27,558 --> 00:04:29,018
- What's your name?
- Raquel.

11
00:04:29,268 --> 00:04:30,353
And you?

12
00:04:30,395 --> 00:04:31,895
- I'm Ana Helena.
- And I'm Laura.

13
00:04:32,313 --> 00:04:33,857
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

14
00:04:33,898 --> 00:04:37,152
Do you know if there is any other
activity besides the ones on the wall?

15
00:04:37,943 --> 00:04:38,945
Yes.

16
00:04:39,195 --> 00:04:42,157
We do many activities
to spread God's word.

17
00:04:42,407 --> 00:04:44,908
We have a service,
that is actual led by my mom.

18
00:04:44,950 --> 00:04:47,328
We have a group cell
at my house.

19
00:04:47,662 --> 00:04:49,205
Have you been touched by God?

20
00:04:49,913 --> 00:04:51,665
Yes, a little... I am new to this.

21
00:04:52,667 --> 00:04:53,752
So it's worth it.

22
00:04:53,793 --> 00:04:56,420
I think so too.
Then you meet everybody.

23
00:04:58,172 --> 00:04:59,257
Ok.

24
00:04:59,298 --> 00:05:00,675
I'll get your number, ok?

25
00:05:00,717 --> 00:05:02,968
I felt something interesting
about you.

26
00:06:00,485 --> 00:06:02,737
ANA HELENA ADDED YOU
TO THE GROUP "YOUTH MINISTRY”

27
00:06:02,778 --> 00:06:04,738
GIRLS, THIS IS RAQUEL.

28
00:06:04,780 --> 00:06:06,615
WELCOME!

29
00:06:07,283 --> 00:06:09,827
RAQUEL, WE WANT TO TAKE YOU
SOMEWHERE TOMORROW. CAN YOU COME?

30
00:06:09,868 --> 00:06:11,745
BRING YOUR SWIMSUIT!

31
00:06:36,937 --> 00:06:38,022
Wow.

32
00:09:53,383 --> 00:09:54,635
Help!

33
00:12:21,740 --> 00:12:24,618
Darling, are you all right?

34
00:12:29,248 --> 00:12:30,665
You are too hot.

35
00:12:31,875 --> 00:12:33,627
Are you feeling well?

36
00:12:34,795 --> 00:12:37,130
Do you want me to prepare
something for you, maybe a tea?

37
00:12:37,923 --> 00:12:39,007
No.

38
00:12:42,678 --> 00:12:46,140
- Can I turn off the light?
- Don't, leave it on.

39
00:12:48,767 --> 00:12:49,810
Rest now.

40
00:12:53,438 --> 00:12:54,523
Good night.

41
00:13:10,915 --> 00:13:13,500
God is thirsty for healing.

42
00:13:13,542 --> 00:13:16,670
And we go, like:
opening our path, opening our path.

43
00:13:16,712 --> 00:13:20,007
Because our path is illuminated.
Our path is the word of God.

44
00:13:20,048 --> 00:13:23,260
- We have a direction. Am I right?
- Amen!

45
00:13:23,302 --> 00:13:28,182
In Matthew 26:41,
"Watch and pray.

46
00:13:28,223 --> 00:13:30,475
So that you will not fall
into temptation."

47
00:13:31,435 --> 00:13:33,603
Do you know what that means,
brothers?

48
00:13:34,313 --> 00:13:38,317
That even though we're being watchful,
Evil will want to prevail.

49
00:13:38,692 --> 00:13:41,820
The power of Satan.
The force of darkness.

50
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:43,947
The power of the serpent.

51
00:13:43,988 --> 00:13:46,242
But we have the power of light.

52
00:13:46,992 --> 00:13:50,203
Which is much stronger
than any other force.

53
00:13:50,245 --> 00:13:54,040
And we will use that.
We will use this against Evil.

54
00:13:54,082 --> 00:13:56,752
That's right, my daughter!
That's right!

55
00:13:57,085 --> 00:13:59,338
- And I want an amen!
- Amen!

56
00:13:59,380 --> 00:14:02,090
- And I want Glory!
- Glory!

57
00:14:08,722 --> 00:14:11,142
Don't cut it into rings.
Cut into small squares.

58
00:14:11,725 --> 00:14:12,852
- It's better.
- Ok.

59
00:14:15,980 --> 00:14:18,982
We have to take advantage of this
situation to the fullest, my daughter.

60
00:14:19,858 --> 00:14:21,985
We can't suffer
any loss from this. At all.

61
00:14:23,237 --> 00:14:24,780
I invited some friends.

62
00:14:25,363 --> 00:14:26,407
You did?

63
00:14:27,532 --> 00:14:29,493
How nice! Which friends?

64
00:14:30,618 --> 00:14:32,120
Some people from the church.

65
00:14:34,498 --> 00:14:36,167
Oh, from the church...

66
00:14:38,293 --> 00:14:41,338
Dad, people from the church
also do groceries, right?

67
00:14:41,380 --> 00:14:43,548
I know. That's right.
It's all right.

68
00:14:46,010 --> 00:14:47,135
But...

69
00:14:49,137 --> 00:14:51,432
Don't talk too much
to these people, okay?

70
00:14:53,267 --> 00:14:54,768
Why? They are cool.

71
00:14:55,685 --> 00:14:56,770
Okay, they're cool.

72
00:14:56,812 --> 00:14:59,022
But college friends
can also be nice.

73
00:14:59,648 --> 00:15:01,400
By the way,
how's this matter going?

74
00:15:01,650 --> 00:15:04,152
I don't know yet, dad,
but I'm looking into it.

75
00:15:06,030 --> 00:15:09,700
It's good to think about this.
Think about your future.

76
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:13,078
Cut this one too?
Very tiny, okay?

77
00:15:20,710 --> 00:15:22,087
- Did it light up?
- Yes.

78
00:15:27,802 --> 00:15:30,387
- Hello, Elisa!
- How are you doing, Dulcidio?

79
00:15:30,428 --> 00:15:32,263
Let me do it. Go down a bit.

80
00:15:32,305 --> 00:15:33,348
Wait, look!

81
00:15:33,723 --> 00:15:35,183
I think it's cute.

82
00:15:35,808 --> 00:15:36,935
Do it on Raquel.

83
00:15:36,977 --> 00:15:37,978
Come here.

84
00:15:43,567 --> 00:15:45,693
We love using it as makeup,
you know?

85
00:15:46,570 --> 00:15:48,613
Did you see how well
they are getting along?

86
00:15:49,823 --> 00:15:51,617
- Yes, that's true.
- Yes.

87
00:15:52,702 --> 00:15:56,830
Hermes, you can count on us
for anything you need.

88
00:15:57,080 --> 00:15:59,290
Because this period
of transition is not easy.

89
00:15:59,333 --> 00:16:00,417
Thank you, Elisa.

90
00:16:00,458 --> 00:16:04,380
I think about Raquel...
After everything that happened to Vera.

91
00:16:09,843 --> 00:16:14,348
We are made of love

92
00:16:15,348 --> 00:16:16,600
I think he is cute.

93
00:16:17,475 --> 00:16:19,227
I think he is cute, and hot...

94
00:16:19,268 --> 00:16:21,355
What is this, Laura?
God is watching.

95
00:16:21,980 --> 00:16:24,107
As for Raquel...
She is watching nothing, see?

96
00:16:25,608 --> 00:16:27,360
- What?
- Gustavo.

97
00:16:29,863 --> 00:16:31,907
His family owns
Monte's Newspaper.

98
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:33,908
Yes, Monte's Newspaper.

99
00:16:34,242 --> 00:16:36,745
- That only prints bad news.
- Liar.

100
00:16:38,163 --> 00:16:39,498
There's nothing to it.

101
00:16:39,540 --> 00:16:41,380
It only runs here
and another couple of cities.

102
00:16:41,417 --> 00:16:43,377
Oh yeah? God is watching.

103
00:16:58,142 --> 00:16:59,308
Vera!

104
00:17:03,522 --> 00:17:06,150
- André, now I can't talk.
- Wait. Let me talk.

105
00:17:06,192 --> 00:17:09,528
I'm trying to talk to you
and you don't answer me.

106
00:17:10,278 --> 00:17:12,131
I don't answer because
I don't want to talk to you.

107
00:17:12,155 --> 00:17:13,365
But I'm your boyfriend!

108
00:17:13,407 --> 00:17:15,783
You're not my boyfriend, André.
We broke up!

109
00:17:17,160 --> 00:17:18,412
Open that door!

110
00:17:38,682 --> 00:17:39,850
Genesis.

111
00:17:40,933 --> 00:17:42,060
Corinthians.

112
00:17:43,437 --> 00:17:45,063
Proverbs. Hosea.

113
00:17:45,438 --> 00:17:47,148
Deuteronomy. Judges.

114
00:17:47,190 --> 00:17:48,317
Raquel.

115
00:18:13,467 --> 00:18:18,097
Savior
The special name for our Lord

116
00:18:18,138 --> 00:18:22,308
Savior ow ow ow
The special name for your Love

117
00:18:22,350 --> 00:18:27,188
Savior
The special name for our Lord

118
00:18:27,230 --> 00:18:32,110
Savior
The special name for your Love

119
00:18:32,527 --> 00:18:36,990
Now I know why God sent me
and why he sent you too

120
00:18:37,740 --> 00:18:39,075
to this place,

121
00:18:39,117 --> 00:18:40,327
to this suffering.

122
00:18:40,368 --> 00:18:42,787
This is all part of God's plan.

123
00:18:43,163 --> 00:18:45,748
We are not lost men, Assos.

124
00:18:46,167 --> 00:18:49,127
Our lives are not insignificant.

125
00:18:49,168 --> 00:18:53,673
We have a mission to accomplish,
which cannot be done anywhere else.

126
00:18:53,923 --> 00:18:55,883
Oh, my brothers!

127
00:18:55,925 --> 00:18:59,137
How glad I am to live with you.

128
00:19:00,013 --> 00:19:02,265
Because that's God's plan.

129
00:19:02,307 --> 00:19:04,392
I'll write it all down.

130
00:19:26,415 --> 00:19:29,918
Hey, we're going to have a party
at the Church. Want to come?

131
00:19:32,545 --> 00:19:33,588
Raquel?

132
00:19:34,422 --> 00:19:36,048
- Raquel?
- What?

133
00:19:39,218 --> 00:19:41,555
- Oh, sorry.
- Okay, I'll clean it.

134
00:20:01,492 --> 00:20:06,830
WHO WROTE THE WORD OF GOD?

135
00:20:10,958 --> 00:20:12,920
To the woman, he said,

136
00:20:12,962 --> 00:20:16,840
I will greatly multiply
your grief and your conception,

137
00:20:20,260 --> 00:20:22,845
and with grief
you will bear children;

138
00:20:23,347 --> 00:20:28,227
and your desire shall be for your husband,
and he shall rule over you.

139
00:20:32,605 --> 00:20:34,398
And the head of Christ is God...

140
00:20:34,733 --> 00:20:37,818
But the woman
is the glory of man.

141
00:20:37,860 --> 00:20:42,657
Now, as the Church
submits to Christ,

142
00:20:43,367 --> 00:20:47,662
so also wives should submit
to their husbands in everything.

143
00:20:49,288 --> 00:20:52,875
Ephesians 5:24.

144
00:20:59,548 --> 00:21:01,385
I'm not doing well these days,
you know?

145
00:21:02,260 --> 00:21:04,930
But it's okay.
I think she was right.

146
00:21:05,805 --> 00:21:07,975
I mean, she must be right.
I guess...

147
00:21:08,017 --> 00:21:09,392
- Hi.
- What happened?

148
00:21:09,433 --> 00:21:11,937
You know that model contest
that I said I was going to do?

149
00:21:12,520 --> 00:21:14,397
- I passed.
- Wow, how cool.

150
00:21:14,898 --> 00:21:17,608
But then the pastor said
that I better not go.

151
00:21:17,650 --> 00:21:19,778
Yeah, Pietra.
Because this is not for you.

152
00:21:20,278 --> 00:21:23,323
- That is not a serious profession.
- But what's the problem?

153
00:21:23,698 --> 00:21:26,158
- You will stray from the path.
- But why?

154
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:28,537
Laura has some news.

155
00:21:28,953 --> 00:21:30,747
- If you don't tell, I will!
- What?

156
00:21:30,788 --> 00:21:33,250
- Come on Laura, tell us!
- Don't need to gossip about it!

157
00:21:33,292 --> 00:21:35,043
- What is it?
- Tell us!

158
00:21:35,918 --> 00:21:37,170
We got engaged.

159
00:21:37,545 --> 00:21:38,672
- Really?
- Yes.

160
00:21:38,713 --> 00:21:39,882
Damn, congratulations!

161
00:21:39,923 --> 00:21:41,298
- Thanks.
- Thank you.

162
00:21:41,342 --> 00:21:43,260
The pastor gave the blessing
and everything.

163
00:21:43,302 --> 00:21:45,428
Now the challenge
is to wait for the wedding.

164
00:21:46,430 --> 00:21:47,472
Congratulations.

165
00:21:49,182 --> 00:21:50,183
That's so cool.

166
00:21:50,725 --> 00:21:51,727
Thank you.

167
00:21:53,228 --> 00:21:54,228
Tamar.

168
00:21:57,107 --> 00:21:59,192
How many people
have you brought to the church?

169
00:22:01,110 --> 00:22:03,947
I always try to bring
people in, Anice.

170
00:22:03,988 --> 00:22:06,115
How come you never succeed?

171
00:22:06,700 --> 00:22:10,078
- That's offensive.
- Jesus brought twelve, remember?

172
00:22:10,370 --> 00:22:11,705
But I am not Jesus!

173
00:22:12,455 --> 00:22:17,460
But we, as a church, must
seek that, to be like Jesus.

174
00:22:17,835 --> 00:22:18,837
Yeah, right.

175
00:22:19,503 --> 00:22:20,630
Laura, you go...

176
00:22:22,215 --> 00:22:23,258
Oh, God...

177
00:22:24,592 --> 00:22:26,135
What's your biggest fear?

178
00:22:28,597 --> 00:22:30,223
My biggest fear?

179
00:22:30,848 --> 00:22:33,643
- C'mon, Laura!
- Calm down, I'm thinking!

180
00:22:35,853 --> 00:22:37,230
Of a car running over me.

181
00:22:38,857 --> 00:22:41,275
- Is that your biggest fear?
- It is, why?

182
00:22:42,777 --> 00:22:45,197
Okay,
I just hope this isn't a lie.

183
00:22:45,238 --> 00:22:47,073
Because the universe conspires!

184
00:22:47,115 --> 00:22:48,325
Oh, really?

185
00:22:48,367 --> 00:22:50,618
I thought it was something
more interesting.

186
00:22:51,368 --> 00:22:55,707
The end of times, Lucifer,
spiders, something like that.

187
00:22:55,748 --> 00:22:58,042
- Well, it's my fear..
- Uhhh...

188
00:23:01,547 --> 00:23:03,423
Why did you come to Monte Megido?

189
00:23:06,510 --> 00:23:08,178
Because my father was born here.

190
00:23:10,805 --> 00:23:12,223
No, what she meant was...

191
00:23:12,265 --> 00:23:15,643
What happened
for you to come here?

192
00:23:16,018 --> 00:23:18,230
She already answered,
her father was born here.

193
00:23:18,272 --> 00:23:20,523
Okay, why did you come back?

194
00:23:23,025 --> 00:23:25,945
- We wanted to start over.
- Start over what?

195
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:29,365
You never wanted
to start anything over?

196
00:23:29,407 --> 00:23:31,200
It's your turn to answer, Raquel.

197
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:33,995
I already answered,
we came to start over.

198
00:23:34,037 --> 00:23:36,498
Yeah, she already answered.
Now she asks the question.

199
00:23:36,540 --> 00:23:37,582
Fine.

200
00:23:40,168 --> 00:23:41,168
Ana Helena.

201
00:23:43,547 --> 00:23:46,550
Do you believe in everything
that is written in the Bible?

202
00:23:47,300 --> 00:23:49,677
Everything written
in the Bible is divine.

203
00:23:49,718 --> 00:23:50,720
Go, Suzana.

204
00:23:53,973 --> 00:23:54,892
Your turn, Tamar.

205
00:23:54,933 --> 00:23:58,812
But do you think
we should be submissive?

206
00:23:59,062 --> 00:24:00,105
We who?

207
00:24:00,688 --> 00:24:01,690
Women.

208
00:24:04,233 --> 00:24:07,695
For you to understand what the Bible
says about the woman being submissive,

209
00:24:08,197 --> 00:24:12,325
you first have to understand
what true submission is.

210
00:24:12,950 --> 00:24:15,745
And submission is a rule
for every Christian.

211
00:24:17,955 --> 00:24:21,960
But it was a book written many years ago
and was written only by men.

212
00:24:22,002 --> 00:24:24,587
There were many writers,
but the authorship is from God.

213
00:24:24,628 --> 00:24:25,713
Yes.

214
00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:27,715
Ok, but...

215
00:24:27,757 --> 00:24:32,470
What's in the Bible
is much more than just written words.

216
00:24:33,597 --> 00:24:35,723
God speaks in parables.

217
00:24:36,348 --> 00:24:38,477
Behind each word is a message.

218
00:24:38,518 --> 00:24:43,232
And that message is only deciphered
if you've contact with the Holy Spirit.

219
00:24:43,482 --> 00:24:49,070
Do you believe that women
brought death and sin to Earth

220
00:24:49,112 --> 00:24:50,738
because it's written like that?

221
00:24:52,032 --> 00:24:54,450
Raquel, you already asked
a lot of questions.

222
00:24:54,492 --> 00:24:55,743
It's against the rules.

223
00:24:56,160 --> 00:24:57,870
What rules? Who wrote the rules?

224
00:24:58,538 --> 00:24:59,622
Me.

225
00:24:59,663 --> 00:25:01,123
- Ana Helena!
- Wow!

226
00:25:02,250 --> 00:25:04,627
I think the Bible
should be revised.

227
00:25:08,507 --> 00:25:09,632
Revised?

228
00:25:11,508 --> 00:25:14,012
Yes, if it has been rewritten
so many times,

229
00:25:14,053 --> 00:25:16,055
why would it be
any different now?

230
00:25:24,522 --> 00:25:26,650
I advise you to pray.

231
00:26:08,817 --> 00:26:10,610
ARE YOU OKAY?

232
00:26:11,568 --> 00:26:12,945
YES...

233
00:26:16,573 --> 00:26:21,495
I AGREE WITH YOU.
AND IT'S NOT JUST ME...

234
00:26:29,503 --> 00:26:34,883
WHAT IF WE START A NEW GROUP?

235
00:26:38,472 --> 00:26:40,515
WHAT ABOUT THE CELL?

236
00:26:41,725 --> 00:26:44,352
IT WILL BE DIFFERENT.

237
00:26:47,605 --> 00:26:50,025
BUT DID YOU DECIDE THAT NOW?

238
00:26:50,858 --> 00:26:52,860
I THINK THAT...

239
00:27:04,038 --> 00:27:08,377
I'VE BEEN RECEIVING SIGNS.

240
00:29:04,867 --> 00:29:05,910
Hi, Elisa.

241
00:29:06,493 --> 00:29:07,787
Hi, Raquel. How are you?

242
00:29:08,037 --> 00:29:09,122
May I help you?

243
00:29:09,663 --> 00:29:11,457
Coffee. Do you have it?

244
00:29:11,498 --> 00:29:14,002
- There.
- Oh. Thank you.

245
00:29:30,560 --> 00:29:31,643
All set.

246
00:29:47,660 --> 00:29:49,787
- Need bags?
- No, thank you.

247
00:29:50,913 --> 00:29:52,957
So... I was worried.

248
00:29:54,292 --> 00:29:55,418
There you go.

249
00:29:59,547 --> 00:30:01,423
- Thank you!
- No problem.

250
00:30:02,425 --> 00:30:03,425
Hi.

251
00:30:04,552 --> 00:30:06,553
And the grocery store
is doing well, right?

252
00:30:07,055 --> 00:30:08,055
Yeah.

253
00:30:08,932 --> 00:30:10,808
It's good to think
about that too.

254
00:30:12,102 --> 00:30:14,187
- Come back soon.
- Good afternoon.

255
00:30:45,468 --> 00:30:46,593
Do you wanna talk?

256
00:30:48,470 --> 00:30:49,513
Talk about what?

257
00:30:52,225 --> 00:30:53,267
I don't know.

258
00:30:55,102 --> 00:30:57,105
There's something bothering you?

259
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:18,627
Raquel, I'm worried.

260
00:31:20,753 --> 00:31:21,795
Why?

261
00:31:29,137 --> 00:31:30,305
You know, darling...

262
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:35,768
Unfortunately, I no longer
have the bookstore.

263
00:31:38,395 --> 00:31:44,027
And not only I don't have the bookstore,
many debts appeared in its place.

264
00:31:46,528 --> 00:31:48,657
So our life depends on this.

265
00:31:50,950 --> 00:31:54,662
It depends on this city,
these people.

266
00:31:55,830 --> 00:31:57,415
We have a home here.

267
00:31:57,457 --> 00:32:03,087
We have a store that can
rebalance us financially.

268
00:32:07,550 --> 00:32:09,052
That's what we have, Raquel.

269
00:32:11,428 --> 00:32:12,680
I have no other option.

270
00:32:15,308 --> 00:32:16,600
You need to help me.

271
00:32:19,562 --> 00:32:20,980
I will help you, dad.

272
00:32:24,442 --> 00:32:25,485
That's good!

273
00:32:26,943 --> 00:32:27,987
That's good!

274
00:32:33,117 --> 00:32:34,202
And...

275
00:32:36,495 --> 00:32:38,707
There is also something
you need to know.

276
00:32:40,625 --> 00:32:43,377
We're in a small country town.

277
00:32:44,587 --> 00:32:49,008
Here, when you tell someone
you've heard or seen something,

278
00:32:49,967 --> 00:32:54,138
that person will tell another,
that will tell another...

279
00:32:55,222 --> 00:32:57,350
And suddenly, everyone is
talking about you.

280
00:33:00,268 --> 00:33:02,855
And depending on the way
as the story goes,

281
00:33:02,897 --> 00:33:05,900
you lose control
of what they say.

282
00:33:09,028 --> 00:33:12,490
You don't want people to be talking
about us out there, do you?

283
00:33:16,618 --> 00:33:19,372
So you have to be careful with
what you say, my daughter.

284
00:33:22,875 --> 00:33:25,462
Vera, if you think
that I'll just leave here,

285
00:33:25,503 --> 00:33:26,962
you can forget about that, ok?

286
00:33:27,003 --> 00:33:30,132
André, please, go away!
There is no one here!

287
00:33:30,173 --> 00:33:32,843
Did you cheat on me
with that bastard?

288
00:33:32,885 --> 00:33:34,262
Are you completely crazy?

289
00:33:36,305 --> 00:33:38,850
Dad, pick up! Please, pick up!

290
00:33:38,892 --> 00:33:40,142
André is here.

291
00:33:40,560 --> 00:33:43,645
He's completely out of control.
He jumped the front gate!

292
00:33:43,897 --> 00:33:45,898
I'll burn this house down!

293
00:33:45,940 --> 00:33:47,543
He said he's going
to set the house on fire.

294
00:33:47,567 --> 00:33:49,253
If you're with someone else,
just tell me...

295
00:33:49,277 --> 00:33:50,903
I'm not seeing anyone! Enough!

296
00:33:51,153 --> 00:33:53,131
- I want to see him face to face.
- There's no one here!

297
00:33:53,155 --> 00:33:55,408
- There is...
- Stop!

298
00:34:19,223 --> 00:34:21,892
First we start identifying
the verses, right?

299
00:34:21,933 --> 00:34:23,578
CIRCLE OF RENOVATION
Which we will comment on.

300
00:34:23,602 --> 00:34:27,063
Then we cut them
and organize according to the Books.

301
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:30,527
We take blank sheets,
we glue these sections,

302
00:34:30,568 --> 00:34:33,278
and we comment below
with our observations.

303
00:34:33,320 --> 00:34:34,822
- Cool.
- Ok?

304
00:34:35,615 --> 00:34:38,575
Deuteronomy 22:20.

305
00:34:39,118 --> 00:34:41,412
"If, however, the charge is true

306
00:34:41,453 --> 00:34:44,373
and no proof of the young
woman's virginity can be found,

307
00:34:44,707 --> 00:34:48,335
she shall be brought to the door
of her father's house...

308
00:34:48,377 --> 00:34:52,340
and there the men of her town
shall stone her to death."

310
00:34:56,385 --> 00:34:59,555
"Look, here is my virgin daughter,
and his concubine.

311
00:34:59,597 --> 00:35:01,348
I will bring them out to you now,

312
00:35:01,598 --> 00:35:06,770
and you can use them
and do to them whatever you wish."

313
00:35:07,230 --> 00:35:09,607
Corinthians 14:34.

314
00:35:10,232 --> 00:35:13,652
"Women should remain silent
in the churches.

315
00:35:14,237 --> 00:35:16,238
They are not allowed to speak."

316
00:35:17,240 --> 00:35:19,242

317
00:35:19,992 --> 00:35:22,495

which pertaineth unto a man,

318
00:35:22,870 --> 00:35:24,913
neither shall a man put
on a woman's garment

319
00:35:25,873 --> 00:35:30,587
for all who do so are abomination
unto the Lord thy God."

320
00:35:30,628 --> 00:35:33,588
If a man marries a woman...

321
00:35:33,630 --> 00:35:35,800

322
00:35:36,133 --> 00:35:38,593
"When a woman has
her regular flow of blood,

323
00:35:38,635 --> 00:35:41,513
and her impurity
is upon her flesh,

324
00:35:41,805 --> 00:35:44,767
her monthly period
will last seven days,

325
00:35:45,142 --> 00:35:48,395
and anyone who touches her
will be unclean till evening."

326
00:35:48,687 --> 00:35:51,315
Timothy 2:12.

327
00:35:52,148 --> 00:35:58,030
"I do not permit a woman to teach
or to assume authority over a man.

328
00:35:58,405 --> 00:36:00,407
She must be quiet."

Genesis 2:18.

330
00:36:04,828 --> 00:36:09,708
"Then the Lord God made a woman from
the rib he had taken out of the man,

331
00:36:10,042 --> 00:36:11,668
and he brought her to the man.

332
00:36:12,043 --> 00:36:15,923
She shall be called 'woman, '
for she was taken out of man."

"All malice is small compared
to a woman's malice;

338
00:36:39,197 --> 00:36:42,450
let the lot of sinners
fall on her!"

339
00:37:11,228 --> 00:37:14,648
BRAZIL IS RANKED NUMBER 5
IN VIOLENT DEATHS OF WOMEN

340
00:37:15,357 --> 00:37:16,983
THE DAUGHTERS OF MARY MAGDALENE

341
00:37:18,235 --> 00:37:24,117
WHO WAS MARY MAGDALENE?

342
00:37:32,123 --> 00:37:34,252
WHY WAS JUNIA LEFT OUT?

343
00:37:44,303 --> 00:37:47,515
NEW MESSAGE FROM ANA HELENA

344
00:37:47,807 --> 00:37:50,100
RAQUEL, ARE YOU COMING
TO THE SERVICE TODAY?

345
00:37:50,142 --> 00:37:51,560
IT WILL BE IMPORTANT TO YOU.

346
00:37:53,520 --> 00:37:54,855
In Apocalypse

347
00:37:54,897 --> 00:37:57,400
22:18-19,

348
00:37:57,775 --> 00:37:59,902
"For I say to every man

349
00:37:59,943 --> 00:38:03,780
to whose ears have come the words
of this prophet's book.

350
00:38:03,822 --> 00:38:06,783
If any man makes
an addition to them,

351
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:09,203
God will put on him

352
00:38:09,578 --> 00:38:13,290
the punishments
which are in this book."

353
00:38:13,665 --> 00:38:18,378
And that's why, my friends,
for that and exactly for that,

354
00:38:18,420 --> 00:38:23,342
that when someone comes,
calling herself a prophet,

355
00:38:24,052 --> 00:38:29,473
it's very important that we analyze
these words according to the Bible.

356
00:38:29,807 --> 00:38:32,142
To see if it's true
or if it's false.

357
00:38:32,183 --> 00:38:34,145
Because it is our guide,
am I right?

358
00:38:34,187 --> 00:38:36,063
It is our guide. Amen!

359
00:38:36,605 --> 00:38:39,400
Now I want to ask you something.

360
00:38:39,442 --> 00:38:41,902
And I want to see who will know
how to answer me.

361
00:38:41,943 --> 00:38:44,280
What happens

362
00:38:44,322 --> 00:38:48,325
to those who insist
on false prophecies?

363
00:38:49,077 --> 00:38:50,703
- What happens?
- Sinners!

364
00:38:50,745 --> 00:38:54,207
Apocalypse 22:18-19.

365
00:38:54,498 --> 00:38:58,668
God will punish these people.

366
00:38:58,710 --> 00:39:00,337
There's no way out of it!

367
00:39:01,088 --> 00:39:02,840
There is no excuse!

368
00:39:03,382 --> 00:39:05,718
Because, in the Bible, it says:

369
00:39:06,343 --> 00:39:09,097
"Every tree that does not
bear good fruit

370
00:39:09,138 --> 00:39:12,348
is cut down
and thrown into the fire."

371
00:39:13,600 --> 00:39:16,103
- I want an Amen!
- Amen!

372
00:39:16,353 --> 00:39:17,605
Praise God!

373
00:39:24,362 --> 00:39:26,238
Hermes, I really need
to talk to you.

374
00:39:27,238 --> 00:39:28,990
Sorry, Elisa,
it's just that I'm a little...

375
00:39:29,032 --> 00:39:30,158
Is Raquel there?

376
00:39:30,993 --> 00:39:33,120
- No, she's not.
- I will not take too long.

377
00:39:33,620 --> 00:39:34,997
I promise. It will be fast.

378
00:39:55,433 --> 00:39:56,643
Look at this, Hermes.

379
00:40:03,317 --> 00:40:04,693
Do you know what this is?

380
00:40:04,943 --> 00:40:06,028
No.

381
00:40:06,653 --> 00:40:10,323
That's where your daughter is taking
a lot of teenagers.

382
00:40:10,657 --> 00:40:12,910
Taking the girls
to the middle of this bush.

383
00:40:12,952 --> 00:40:14,453
Without any security.

384
00:40:15,453 --> 00:40:16,997
Have you wondered
what could happen?

385
00:40:17,038 --> 00:40:19,500
Someone may appear there.
The things they can do to them.

386
00:40:19,542 --> 00:40:21,668
And they're praying
for God knows which devil.

387
00:40:22,962 --> 00:40:24,297
And who told you that?

388
00:40:24,713 --> 00:40:26,673
It doesn't matter who told me.

389
00:40:26,923 --> 00:40:29,302
It doesn't matter,
the whole church already knows.

390
00:40:29,343 --> 00:40:33,055
And then they keep questioning me
because they know that I know you.

391
00:40:35,432 --> 00:40:37,935
Ok, Elisa.
I'll see what this is about.

392
00:40:38,977 --> 00:40:41,980
Pietra is dating a boy
that nobody knows who it is.

393
00:40:42,482 --> 00:40:45,150
Tamar is missing classes
almost every day.

394
00:40:45,192 --> 00:40:47,570
And everyone is missing
church too, right, Elisa?

395
00:40:47,987 --> 00:40:50,322
Oh Hermes, please.

396
00:40:51,448 --> 00:40:54,327
Try to put yourself in these parents'
shoes, at least once in your life.

397
00:40:54,827 --> 00:40:56,453
We don't know what
they are doing there,

398
00:40:56,495 --> 00:40:58,872
if they are making rituals,
sacrifices...

399
00:40:59,748 --> 00:41:00,833
Look...

400
00:41:01,250 --> 00:41:03,210
You have to do something.

401
00:41:04,127 --> 00:41:07,422
This girl is going to get
in trouble.

402
00:41:07,463 --> 00:41:08,882
I'm warning you!

403
00:41:10,968 --> 00:41:12,385
Is this a threat?

404
00:41:45,502 --> 00:41:46,878
Hey, girls!

405
00:41:47,253 --> 00:41:48,380
Hi, Elisa.

406
00:41:48,755 --> 00:41:50,007
You came!

407
00:41:51,633 --> 00:41:52,760
Good!

408
00:41:57,388 --> 00:41:59,015
We are just passing by.

409
00:42:00,267 --> 00:42:01,560
Are you okay?

410
00:42:01,893 --> 00:42:03,895
- Yes.
- Yes...

411
00:42:07,398 --> 00:42:08,567
To sweeten your day.

412
00:42:20,662 --> 00:42:21,663
Here.

413
00:42:33,300 --> 00:42:34,427
Let's make a toast!

414
00:42:37,553 --> 00:42:38,597
Want some?

415
00:42:42,558 --> 00:42:43,602
You have to drink it!

416
00:42:43,935 --> 00:42:44,937
Fine.

417
00:42:50,442 --> 00:42:54,530
DJ Robinho, pump the beat
To get the crowd jumping

418
00:42:54,572 --> 00:42:57,783
Only who is a Christian
Only who is a Christian

419
00:42:57,825 --> 00:43:02,037
Jump from one side to the other
And clap your hands

420
00:43:02,078 --> 00:43:05,540
Only who is a Christian
Only who is a Christian

421
00:43:05,582 --> 00:43:09,210
Only who is a Christian
Only who is a Christian

422
00:43:12,463 --> 00:43:16,552
Because Jesus freed me
To live a new story

423
00:43:16,593 --> 00:43:20,305
I'm free to have fun
Prejudice isn't my thing

424
00:43:20,347 --> 00:43:23,975
Whichever beat
Because God created it all

425
00:44:20,282 --> 00:44:23,493
Only who is a Christian
Only who is a Christian

426
00:44:23,535 --> 00:44:27,538
Jump from one side to the other
And clap your hands

427
00:44:27,580 --> 00:44:31,252
Only who is a Christian
Only who is a Christian

428
00:44:31,293 --> 00:44:34,337
Only who is a Christian
Only who is a Christian

429
00:45:00,738 --> 00:45:04,452
But if you mess around with me, young girl
I won't look

430
00:45:04,493 --> 00:45:08,038
If you mess around with me, young girl
I won't look

431
00:45:08,080 --> 00:45:11,917
Because I'm anointed
I got the oil

432
00:45:11,958 --> 00:45:15,462
Because I'm anointed
I got the oil

433
00:45:15,503 --> 00:45:19,173
Don't mess with me Don't come

434
00:45:19,215 --> 00:45:22,427
There's no legality
I'm consecrated

435
00:45:22,468 --> 00:45:26,598
I'm over watching
I'm in that way

436
00:45:26,640 --> 00:45:30,310
I stopped the abuses
Cut the hype

437
00:45:30,352 --> 00:45:33,605
I'm telling you
Hear me out, girl

438
00:45:33,647 --> 00:45:38,110
Those who are easy
Have no value in this life

439
00:45:38,152 --> 00:45:41,070
Whoever say
The flesh is weak, listen

440
00:45:41,113 --> 00:45:44,992
If the problem is weakness
Sin is not vitamin

441
00:45:45,033 --> 00:45:48,745
But if you mess around with me, young girl
I won't look

442
00:45:48,787 --> 00:45:52,373
If you mess around with me, young girl
I won't look

443
00:45:52,415 --> 00:45:56,128
Because I'm anointed
I got the oil

444
00:45:56,170 --> 00:45:59,632
Because I'm anointed
I got the oil

445
00:46:02,633 --> 00:46:05,012
Sorry to ruin the mood, guys.

446
00:46:05,678 --> 00:46:08,307
But I have something
very important to say.

447
00:46:08,890 --> 00:46:12,143
One thing that can save
the souls of all of you.

448
00:46:13,145 --> 00:46:14,353
The Evil.

449
00:46:14,395 --> 00:46:16,523
Evil does not appear to be bleak.

450
00:46:17,690 --> 00:46:18,900
Macabre.

451
00:46:19,652 --> 00:46:21,903
It doesn't look like a monster.

452
00:46:23,405 --> 00:46:25,198
Evil has beauty.

453
00:46:26,825 --> 00:46:28,535
Evil is manipulative.

454
00:46:30,828 --> 00:46:33,290
That person who lets Evil in,

455
00:46:34,792 --> 00:46:36,252
that person needs help.

456
00:46:36,293 --> 00:46:38,920
Now, if she denies help,

457
00:46:43,175 --> 00:46:45,968
if she denies it, there is nothing
that we can do.

458
00:46:46,803 --> 00:46:48,305
It's very dangerous.

459
00:46:50,182 --> 00:46:52,308
We can't let them...

460
00:46:52,935 --> 00:46:54,812
Let them destroy us!

461
00:46:57,230 --> 00:46:59,065
Now, my question is:

462
00:46:59,440 --> 00:47:01,902
What do we do with all this evil?

463
00:47:01,943 --> 00:47:04,487
What do we do
with these evil angels?

464
00:47:07,323 --> 00:47:10,202
Laura!
Don't let her do this, Laura.

465
00:47:10,577 --> 00:47:11,578
Laura!

466
00:47:12,703 --> 00:47:13,955
Don't let her!

467
00:47:14,998 --> 00:47:17,083
She's doubting our faith!

468
00:47:17,333 --> 00:47:20,087
I never doubted anyone's faith.

469
00:47:20,587 --> 00:47:23,840
- Liar.
- Why am I lying? I never doubted.

470
00:47:23,882 --> 00:47:25,133
Stop this.

471
00:47:25,467 --> 00:47:26,677
Go away!

472
00:47:26,718 --> 00:47:28,970
I believe in God too!

473
00:47:29,012 --> 00:47:32,182
- Out!
- Out!

474
00:47:32,223 --> 00:47:34,100
I'm also from the Church!

475
00:47:34,142 --> 00:47:35,685
- Get out of here!
- Get out!

476
00:47:35,727 --> 00:47:36,978
Go away!

477
00:47:37,020 --> 00:47:39,313
Guys, I never wanted
to doubt anyone!

478
00:47:39,355 --> 00:47:42,442
I never wanted to doubt anyone's faith!
I'm also from the Church!

479
00:47:42,483 --> 00:47:43,693
- Get out of here!
- Get out!

480
00:47:43,735 --> 00:47:47,238
I believe in God!
I believe in Jesus, guys! Please!

481
00:47:54,037 --> 00:47:57,415
I'm writing it for the Good!
For the Good, guys!

482
00:47:58,375 --> 00:48:01,753
I also believe in Jesus!
I'm writing it for women!

483
00:48:02,003 --> 00:48:03,255
Go away!

484
00:48:18,437 --> 00:48:22,065
She is not one of us!

485
00:48:41,918 --> 00:48:44,212
Timothy 2:18.

486
00:48:53,680 --> 00:48:54,807
Help!

487
00:49:00,062 --> 00:49:04,942
TAMAR
OF COURSE SHE SEES THINGS, GUYS!

488
00:49:13,075 --> 00:49:14,117
Raquel?

489
00:49:15,952 --> 00:49:16,995
What happened?

490
00:49:19,580 --> 00:49:20,957
- Raquel, my daughter?
- Mom?

491
00:49:21,333 --> 00:49:23,752
No, no. It's me, your father.

492
00:49:24,377 --> 00:49:26,087
What are you feeling, Raquel?

493
00:49:27,505 --> 00:49:28,882
Raquel, talk to me.

494
00:49:31,843 --> 00:49:33,345
No, Raquel. No, no...

495
00:49:33,845 --> 00:49:35,972
It is not time for that now.

496
00:49:37,515 --> 00:49:39,852
We will write everything again.

497
00:49:59,245 --> 00:50:00,872
The exams are all normal.

498
00:50:02,290 --> 00:50:05,252
In addition to what you already told me,
Raquel, any other discomfort?

499
00:50:11,508 --> 00:50:12,883
What can this be?

500
00:50:13,760 --> 00:50:17,138
Look, she organizes her thoughts
in an absolutely logical way.

501
00:50:17,388 --> 00:50:20,683
I have no way of giving you an accurate
diagnosis with so little observation.

502
00:50:22,893 --> 00:50:25,938
I wanted to show you something.

503
00:50:27,398 --> 00:50:28,525
What is this?

504
00:50:29,067 --> 00:50:30,360
It's just a notebook!

505
00:50:30,402 --> 00:50:32,528
I know it's a notebook,
and what's inside?

506
00:50:48,587 --> 00:50:50,338
Do you have anything
to tell me about this?

507
00:50:54,843 --> 00:50:56,928
How come not, Raquel?
I think you do.

508
00:51:03,477 --> 00:51:08,565
She lost her mother in a very violent
way and the two were very close.

509
00:51:09,565 --> 00:51:13,403
At the time I thought it was good
for her to find strength in faith,

510
00:51:13,445 --> 00:51:15,030
in a religion that is...

511
00:51:15,072 --> 00:51:18,575
But then she started
doing some weird things...

512
00:51:21,578 --> 00:51:24,205
Look, it would be very important
that you do therapy.

513
00:51:26,708 --> 00:51:29,962
Doctor, I'm sorry.
Raquel did therapy for a while.

514
00:51:30,253 --> 00:51:31,253
And...

515
00:51:31,838 --> 00:51:34,925
Anyway, wouldn't there be
something parallel to therapy?

516
00:51:34,967 --> 00:51:37,218
Something more immediate?
Because...

517
00:51:38,470 --> 00:51:39,637
I don't know what to do.

518
00:52:12,628 --> 00:52:14,797
()

519
00:52:18,677 --> 00:52:20,262
WHO IS IT?

520
00:52:33,192 --> 00:52:35,193
YOU DON'T KNOW?

521
00:52:37,528 --> 00:52:38,780
NO.

522
00:52:44,660 --> 00:52:46,580
AREN'T YOU THE PROPHET?

523
00:52:53,795 --> 00:52:56,673
I NEVER SAID I WAS A PROPHET.

524
00:53:11,187 --> 00:53:12,688
I'LL GIVE YOU A HINT...

525
00:53:12,730 --> 00:53:14,942
WE ALREADY KNOW EACH OTHER.

526
00:53:15,192 --> 00:53:17,235
WHAT DO YOU WANT?

527
00:53:28,747 --> 00:53:30,373
TO TALK.

528
00:53:35,712 --> 00:53:39,465
I CAN'T TALK NOW.

529
00:53:41,508 --> 00:53:44,137
TELL ME, WHAT DO YOU WANT?

530
00:54:00,403 --> 00:54:02,405
THE POSSESSED GIRL
FROM MONTE MEGIDO

531
00:54:12,623 --> 00:54:14,875
Heretic! Liar!

532
00:54:15,293 --> 00:54:17,920
Liar! Witch!

533
00:54:18,253 --> 00:54:21,298
- We don't want you here!
- You are bringing the darkness!

534
00:54:38,525 --> 00:54:40,152
SHE CAME TO CURSE THE CITY.

535
00:54:40,193 --> 00:54:41,610
SHE HAD A VISION!

536
00:54:41,653 --> 00:54:43,363
LET'S PRAY FOR HER SOUL!

537
00:54:43,405 --> 00:54:45,032
SHE MUST BE SICK...

538
00:54:45,073 --> 00:54:47,033
SHE OPENED
THE DOORS FOR THE EVIL!

539
00:54:48,033 --> 00:54:53,457
HER NAME IS
RAQUEL HERNANDES REIS.

540
00:54:54,290 --> 00:54:55,292
Witch!

541
00:55:53,725 --> 00:55:59,313
- Where is he?
- Where is who?

542
00:55:59,355 --> 00:56:02,567
- Where is he?
- What are you talking about, André?

543
00:56:02,608 --> 00:56:04,693
- You're crazy!
- Confess it already!

544
00:56:04,735 --> 00:56:08,363
André, please. Go away!
Go away, there is no one here!

545
00:56:08,407 --> 00:56:11,408
No! Let me go.
Let me go, André! Let me go!

546
00:56:16,247 --> 00:56:19,500
Go away! Get out of here!
Get out!

547
00:56:20,252 --> 00:56:22,212
Help... Help me.

548
00:56:22,253 --> 00:56:23,880
Police emergency line.

549
00:56:23,922 --> 00:56:27,217
Officer, please!
Send help! I beg you, please!

550
00:56:27,258 --> 00:56:29,593
My mother's ex-boyfriend
is very nervous!

551
00:56:29,635 --> 00:56:31,262
Ok, he's nervous.

552
00:56:31,678 --> 00:56:33,097
And what is the occurrence?

553
00:56:33,138 --> 00:56:35,850
Please, officer.
He's assaulting her!

554
00:56:35,892 --> 00:56:36,977
Give me your address.

555
00:56:37,018 --> 00:56:38,978
- I'll go check your room!
- No, you don't, André!

556
00:56:39,020 --> 00:56:41,272
I can't talk anymore!
I can't talk anymore!

557
00:56:58,540 --> 00:56:59,540
Yes?

558
00:56:59,790 --> 00:57:01,083
- Hi, Hermes!
- Hi.

559
00:57:01,417 --> 00:57:02,543
Is Raquel around?

560
00:57:03,168 --> 00:57:04,295
No. Raquel's not here.

561
00:57:05,297 --> 00:57:09,675
- We know she's here.
- Nope. I'm saying she's not here.

562
00:57:12,428 --> 00:57:13,805
I already said she isn't here.

563
00:57:13,847 --> 00:57:15,432
Can we wait here for her then?

564
00:57:15,848 --> 00:57:19,310
Unfortunately, no.
Can you, please, excuse me?

565
00:57:20,728 --> 00:57:21,728
Ok?

566
00:57:22,188 --> 00:57:23,438
Have a good day.

567
00:57:33,700 --> 00:57:35,827
We are concerned about Raquel.

568
00:57:36,743 --> 00:57:40,748
I appreciate your concern,
but she has already started treatment.

569
00:57:41,707 --> 00:57:43,835
But what happened, Hermes...

570
00:57:44,710 --> 00:57:46,503
I know this is none
of our business.

571
00:57:47,380 --> 00:57:52,010
The truth is that some things, Hermes,
need another type of treatment.

572
00:57:52,385 --> 00:57:54,095
Because they are
not common things.

573
00:57:54,137 --> 00:57:56,680
They are things
of a spiritual nature.

574
00:57:56,722 --> 00:57:59,225
Sorry, Elisa.
I don't believe in this.

575
00:58:00,142 --> 00:58:02,312
We can think
in a more symbolic way.

576
00:58:02,353 --> 00:58:04,730
It's so simple what
I'm talking about, Hermes.

577
00:58:05,105 --> 00:58:07,608
Look, there are those
who work for Good.

578
00:58:07,650 --> 00:58:09,235
There are those
who work for Evil.

579
00:58:09,985 --> 00:58:13,363
Because they are being
dominated by that force.

580
00:58:14,657 --> 00:58:17,952
I really appreciate your concern.

581
00:58:17,993 --> 00:58:19,037
Just one thing.

582
00:58:20,037 --> 00:58:22,248
Do you know the Ritual of Healing
and Deliverance?

583
00:58:24,292 --> 00:58:26,293
Sorry, but I'm not interested.

584
00:58:26,752 --> 00:58:28,505
Come on, Hermes,
we're already here.

585
00:58:28,755 --> 00:58:32,258
I think you could pay
a little attention, it won't hurt.

586
00:58:37,430 --> 00:58:38,932
Okay, what is it about?

587
00:58:41,642 --> 00:58:45,145
When we realize that there is
something wrong with a person,

588
00:58:46,522 --> 00:58:49,400
a change in behavior,
a change in their eyes,

589
00:58:49,942 --> 00:58:51,152
in the soul,

590
00:58:53,905 --> 00:58:56,032
it could be that this
comes from another place.

591
00:58:56,407 --> 00:58:58,283
Of the other side.

592
00:58:58,577 --> 00:59:00,160
A dark side.

593
00:59:02,830 --> 00:59:04,415
It's very dangerous.

594
00:59:05,040 --> 00:59:07,043
You don't want that for Raquel,
do you?

595
00:59:08,085 --> 00:59:10,838
Sorry, but I don't understand
what you're talking about.

596
00:59:12,548 --> 00:59:14,508
Raquel needs to be exorcised.

597
00:59:14,550 --> 00:59:17,553
It's not exactly that,
that's not the word.

598
00:59:17,970 --> 00:59:20,770
Raquel went to the doctor because
this is the treatment that I believe,

599
00:59:20,807 --> 00:59:23,058
and this is the treatment she's
going to do for now.

600
00:59:24,435 --> 00:59:27,855
So I ask you to please
respect our decision,

601
00:59:28,188 --> 00:59:29,523
and don't look for us again.

602
00:59:29,565 --> 00:59:31,608
We can take this evil away
from Raquel!

603
00:59:32,943 --> 00:59:33,987
Please!

604
00:59:36,948 --> 00:59:39,533
Hermes, the enemy might be
using her.

605
00:59:39,575 --> 00:59:41,577
And you are responsible.

606
00:59:41,827 --> 00:59:44,080
- Excuse me.
- You will regret it.

607
00:59:44,330 --> 00:59:45,957
Get out of my house, please?

608
01:00:19,365 --> 01:00:20,492
What happened?

609
01:00:31,418 --> 01:00:32,670
I was at home.

610
01:00:35,005 --> 01:00:36,382
With Gustavo.

611
01:00:38,258 --> 01:00:40,302
We were watching a movie.

612
01:00:43,430 --> 01:00:45,767
And then we started
to kiss and...

613
01:00:47,643 --> 01:00:50,187
He put his hand under my skirt.

614
01:00:52,273 --> 01:00:53,648
I didn't want it.

615
01:00:56,777 --> 01:00:58,153
I started to scream.

616
01:01:00,030 --> 01:01:01,532
Telling him to stop.

617
01:01:03,200 --> 01:01:04,702
But he continued.

618
01:01:08,538 --> 01:01:10,542
My brother came home.

619
01:01:12,043 --> 01:01:14,212
Gustavo started shouting at me.

620
01:01:15,422 --> 01:01:17,215
Calling me a slut.

621
01:01:19,592 --> 01:01:22,803
Telling my brother that
he had caught me with another guy.

622
01:01:23,805 --> 01:01:25,557
My brother believed him.

623
01:01:28,600 --> 01:01:30,227
My father came home,

624
01:01:32,355 --> 01:01:33,815
and started to beat me.

625
01:01:37,818 --> 01:01:38,987
I ran away.

626
01:02:32,998 --> 01:02:34,250
Am I bothering you?

627
01:02:43,508 --> 01:02:44,510
Laura.

628
01:02:51,392 --> 01:02:53,018
I came here to apologize to you.

629
01:02:57,022 --> 01:02:59,150
I don't know what happened
to me that day.

630
01:03:02,195 --> 01:03:03,403
Let's go home.

631
01:03:03,822 --> 01:03:04,905
I'll take you.

632
01:03:09,452 --> 01:03:10,578
I regret that.

633
01:03:17,668 --> 01:03:18,920
Come with me?

634
01:03:20,672 --> 01:03:22,047
We can talk about it.

635
01:03:29,055 --> 01:03:30,932
No, Laura. Stop it.

636
01:03:33,350 --> 01:03:34,810
Come back with me, please?

637
01:03:35,352 --> 01:03:36,603
Let me go. I won't go.

638
01:03:42,568 --> 01:03:44,320
- Laura!
- She said she won't go.

639
01:03:46,072 --> 01:03:47,198
You're fucked.

640
01:03:48,867 --> 01:03:51,118
Witch. Motherfucker.

641
01:04:13,223 --> 01:04:15,433
Your call is being forwarded
to voicemail

642
01:04:15,475 --> 01:04:17,353
and is subject to a charge
after the signal.

643
01:04:19,480 --> 01:04:20,607
Take care.

644
01:04:21,357 --> 01:04:22,358
Bye.

645
01:05:51,572 --> 01:05:52,615
Good morning.

646
01:05:58,203 --> 01:05:59,330
Go to hell!

647
01:06:01,207 --> 01:06:02,684
- What is this?
- You are not welcome here.

648
01:06:02,708 --> 01:06:04,543
This is no place for profanity!

649
01:06:04,585 --> 01:06:05,585
Are you crazy?

650
01:06:05,837 --> 01:06:07,003
Go away from here!

651
01:06:07,253 --> 01:06:08,672
- Hell!
- Get off here!

652
01:06:08,713 --> 01:06:11,342
You are not welcome here!
Out of here! Go away!

653
01:06:11,883 --> 01:06:13,552
Out! Leave us alone!

654
01:06:13,593 --> 01:06:15,345
- Get out!
- Hell!

655
01:06:15,888 --> 01:06:17,432
Leave! You are not welcome here!

656
01:06:17,473 --> 01:06:19,017
You are taking our peace away!

657
01:06:33,363 --> 01:06:37,535
SATANIC CULT IN THE CITY
OF MONTE MEGIDO DEFIES THE BIBLE

658
01:06:43,165 --> 01:06:46,377
HERETIC BITCH!

659
01:07:35,467 --> 01:07:36,552
Raquel!

660
01:07:38,845 --> 01:07:40,055
Raquel, come here!

661
01:07:48,230 --> 01:07:49,898
You called
the police emergency line.

662
01:07:49,940 --> 01:07:52,568
At the moment
all our attendants are busy.

663
01:07:53,443 --> 01:07:54,487
Shit!

664
01:07:56,947 --> 01:07:58,198
Who did this?

665
01:08:17,383 --> 01:08:19,010
Who did this, Raquel?

666
01:08:23,473 --> 01:08:24,517
I don't know.

667
01:08:34,735 --> 01:08:36,487
And what is God's plan

668
01:08:37,028 --> 01:08:38,530
for a situation like that?

669
01:08:39,990 --> 01:08:40,992
What?

670
01:08:46,122 --> 01:08:47,122
Tell me, Raquel!

671
01:08:51,168 --> 01:08:52,252
To forgive.

672
01:08:54,547 --> 01:08:55,630
To forgive?

673
01:08:59,510 --> 01:09:00,887
Forgive!

674
01:09:03,930 --> 01:09:05,307
Forgive what, my daughter?

675
01:09:06,017 --> 01:09:07,058
Huh?

676
01:09:08,518 --> 01:09:11,897
Do you think that forgiving those
who destroy our home is to do good?

677
01:09:12,397 --> 01:09:13,398
That's it?

678
01:09:19,447 --> 01:09:21,532
They don't know
what they are doing.

679
01:09:21,573 --> 01:09:23,033
And you don't know either.

680
01:09:25,785 --> 01:09:28,455
You also don't know what you do.

681
01:09:32,960 --> 01:09:33,960
Look!

682
01:09:37,923 --> 01:09:41,218
Can you see the absurdity
of this situation, Raquel?

683
01:09:42,343 --> 01:09:43,428
Can you?

684
01:09:48,558 --> 01:09:49,977
I don't know what else to do.

685
01:09:54,607 --> 01:09:56,067
I don't know what else to do.

686
01:10:49,495 --> 01:10:51,372
Everything was like this
when we arrived.

687
01:10:51,663 --> 01:10:54,833
I don't know how they got in.
The door was open. It was a mess.

688
01:10:54,875 --> 01:10:58,503
Things thrown on the floor.
They left everything upside down.

689
01:10:59,922 --> 01:11:04,133
- Did they steal something?
- There was no time to see...

690
01:11:50,472 --> 01:11:51,473
Dad!

01:15:23,268 --> 01:15:24,268
Get up!

696
01:15:24,518 --> 01:15:25,687
Come on. Get up.

697
01:15:30,900 --> 01:15:31,943
Calm down.

698
01:15:50,670 --> 01:15:53,048
- Go on. Hurry!
- Go, go, go.

699
01:16:09,480 --> 01:16:10,565

01:16:12,192 --> 01:16:16,070
- Vera!
- Close it. Faster!

He's coming! He's coming! Faster!

01:16:19,115 --> 01:16:20,950
Vera!

703
01:16:21,452 --> 01:16:23,162
Open the garage!

704
01:16:23,203 --> 01:16:24,997
- Vera?
- Come on, mom!

705
01:16:26,080 --> 01:16:27,915
- What the fuck is this?
- Run, Raquel!

706
01:16:27,958 --> 01:16:30,002
What the fuck is this?

707
01:16:30,585 --> 01:16:33,297
- Shut up!
- Let me go, André! Let me go!

708
01:16:33,338 --> 01:16:36,048
- André! Let her go!
- You must think that I'm a fool!

709
01:16:36,090 --> 01:16:38,093
Don't hurt her, please!

710
01:16:38,760 --> 01:16:41,347
Give me that key!
The party is over.

711
01:16:42,472 --> 01:16:46,560
You want to go out? So let's go out!
Raquel, get in the trunk!

712
01:16:46,602 --> 01:16:50,147
- No! André, leave her out of this!
- Shut your mouth!

713
01:16:51,022 --> 01:16:54,567
- For God's sake! Leave her out of this!
- Silence!

714
01:16:54,608 --> 01:16:58,572
- Leave her! I'll go with you!
- Can you be quiet, dammit!

715
01:16:58,613 --> 01:17:01,950
Raquel, get in the goddamn trunk!
Or I'll beat you up!

716
01:17:01,992 --> 01:17:04,493
- Do it, darling!
- Ok, I'll do it!

717
01:17:04,535 --> 01:17:05,995
I'll do it! Calm down!

718
01:17:06,663 --> 01:17:10,083
For the love of God!
André, what are you doing?

719
01:17:10,125 --> 01:17:13,503
Don't you want to pray?
Then pray!

720
01:17:15,297 --> 01:17:16,297
Stop.

721
01:17:16,757 --> 01:17:20,635
- André, I'm sorry.
- You don't trust me.

722
01:17:20,677 --> 01:17:23,638
You are right, I'm sorry.
I'm so stupid!

723
01:17:23,930 --> 01:17:27,725
I'm so stupid! I don't know why
I left you, André. I love you!

724
01:17:27,767 --> 01:17:31,772
- You're talking bullshit now.
- I mean it. I love you!

725
01:17:32,147 --> 01:17:33,898
André, please believe me!

726
01:17:34,148 --> 01:17:35,150
André...

727
01:17:35,442 --> 01:17:36,693
André, you are right!

728
01:17:37,193 --> 01:17:42,365
- André, slow down for god's sake!
- You have exhausted my patience.

729
01:17:42,407 --> 01:17:45,618
- Look at me! I love you!
- Stop it! Take your hands off!

730
01:17:45,660 --> 01:17:48,247
- Let's try it again, please!
- Take your hands off!

731
01:17:48,288 --> 01:17:51,917
- Please, you're going too fast!
- Take your hands off the wheel!

732
01:17:53,168 --> 01:17:54,543
Watch out!

733
01:18:30,955 --> 01:18:33,708
- Good evening, brothers!
- Good evening!

734
01:18:34,250 --> 01:18:36,335
How are you all tonight?

735
01:18:36,628 --> 01:18:39,547
- Good! Thank God!
- Thank God!

736
01:18:39,588 --> 01:18:43,008
But I hope you leave here
better than when you arrived.

737
01:18:43,385 --> 01:18:47,222
Because today is
the night of healing and deliverance!

738
01:18:47,513 --> 01:18:50,058
It is my favorite night

739
01:18:50,100 --> 01:18:54,813
because tonight God works
His miracles.

740
01:18:54,855 --> 01:18:56,815
- Praise the Lord!
- Hallelujah!

741
01:18:56,857 --> 01:18:59,400
What is the cure you are
looking for today, brother?

742
01:19:00,152 --> 01:19:03,488
What cure do you need?

743
01:19:04,238 --> 01:19:09,743
What do you need to experience
before the Lord, brother?

744
01:19:10,787 --> 01:19:11,830
Look.

745
01:19:11,872 --> 01:19:13,832
Do not waste your illness.

746
01:19:13,873 --> 01:19:19,337
Do not waste, as the disease is
an opportunity for revelation, brothers!

747
01:19:19,378 --> 01:19:20,380
Amen!

748
01:19:20,422 --> 01:19:24,758
It is through disease, be it physical,
emotional, spiritual...

749
01:19:24,802 --> 01:19:28,888
It is through sickness
that God works in us!

750
01:19:29,263 --> 01:19:33,477
- Praise the Lord!
- And He will work on you!

751
01:19:33,518 --> 01:19:35,645
Work the healing on you!

752
01:19:35,895 --> 01:19:36,980
Praise the Lord!

753
01:19:37,022 --> 01:19:40,525
Tonight, God will do something
extraordinary in your lives.

754
01:19:46,280 --> 01:19:50,077
If someone needs to cure
the pain of guilt,

755
01:19:50,327 --> 01:19:51,912
because guilt hurts, brothers.

756
01:19:52,162 --> 01:19:55,623
Blame for wrong doings,
blame for blasphemy,

757
01:19:55,665 --> 01:19:57,917
blame for any crime,
it doesn't matter!

758
01:19:58,418 --> 01:20:00,920
It doesn't matter
because God knows you!

759
01:20:01,170 --> 01:20:05,800
He knows each one of you,
your life, your struggle.

760
01:20:07,927 --> 01:20:11,097
And it is through Him
that we will heal!

761
01:20:11,682 --> 01:20:13,642
We will heal from
everything that affects us.

762
01:20:13,683 --> 01:20:16,728
Today is the day that God
will work a miracle.

763
01:20:17,103 --> 01:20:18,563
Tonight!

764
01:20:19,813 --> 01:20:22,317
So I want to pray for you!

765
01:20:23,193 --> 01:20:25,695
He is touched
by your struggles, brothers.

766
01:20:26,572 --> 01:20:27,988
And He wants to help you.

767
01:20:34,078 --> 01:20:35,580
Let's all stand up.

768
01:20:38,875 --> 01:20:39,960
Lord!

769
01:20:41,210 --> 01:20:43,128
Merciful God,

770
01:20:44,005 --> 01:20:47,133
perform a miracle tonight.

771
01:20:48,008 --> 01:20:51,597
Give this young woman
a righteous path to follow.

772
01:20:52,222 --> 01:20:55,392
Keep the tortuous paths

773
01:20:55,725 --> 01:20:59,478
of blasphemy away from this girl.

774
01:21:00,480 --> 01:21:05,402
Take the enemies away from her!
The enemies! The evil angels!

775
01:21:05,652 --> 01:21:07,237
Take it from her, Lord!

776
01:21:07,278 --> 01:21:10,615
The Demon in her body!
Take it away, Lord!

777
01:21:10,907 --> 01:21:14,660
Get it out of her, give her mercy, Lord!
Heal her wounds!

778
01:21:15,120 --> 01:21:18,122
Bad thoughts about others!

779
01:21:19,917 --> 01:21:22,502
- Mom?
- Raquel.

780
01:21:23,378 --> 01:21:25,922
Raquel, my daughter!
Oh, thank you God!

781
01:21:27,382 --> 01:21:31,010
- Thank God! Are you ok, darling?
- Yes, I think I am.

782
01:21:31,052 --> 01:21:35,140
- Where are you, mom?
- I think I'm stuck. I can't get out.

783
01:21:37,642 --> 01:21:38,810
Bastard.

784
01:21:39,643 --> 01:21:41,647
Look at the shit you've done.

785
01:21:42,688 --> 01:21:45,942
Help me, please, André.
I'm stuck here. Help!

786
01:21:46,442 --> 01:21:49,278
- You need help?
- Please, get me out.

787
01:21:53,825 --> 01:21:55,285
What are you going
to do with that?

788
01:21:56,285 --> 01:21:59,413
For what? What are you going
to do with that, André?

789
01:21:59,455 --> 01:22:01,165
I want the truth...

790
01:22:01,207 --> 01:22:04,252
What you're going to do with
that stone? Drop that stone, André!

791
01:22:04,293 --> 01:22:07,172
- Drop that stone!
- Look what you've done!

792
01:22:08,340 --> 01:22:14,303
No, please! For God's sake!
I'll do anything you want!

793
01:22:14,345 --> 01:22:17,890
Women are a dangerous thing,
aren't they? Make anyone go crazy.

794
01:22:17,932 --> 01:22:19,475
Help!

795
01:22:20,602 --> 01:22:22,853
Help!

796

Mom!

797
01:22:41,247 --> 01:22:44,125
Mom, mom, mom!

798
01:23:51,525 --> 01:23:52,735
Help!

799
01:23:52,777 --> 01:23:56,530

Stop! Stop! No!

803
01:24:04,330 --> 01:24:06,623
- Please, stop!

ON BEHALF OF ALL THAT PASSED,
AND THOSE WHO ARE YET TO COME,

829
