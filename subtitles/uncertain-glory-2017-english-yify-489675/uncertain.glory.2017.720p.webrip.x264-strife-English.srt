1
00:01:09,667 --> 00:01:10,792
Where are the boys?

2
00:01:12,958 --> 00:01:14,083
Come here, you!

3
00:01:14,250 --> 00:01:16,833
You whore! Come with me!

4
00:01:28,208 --> 00:01:29,625
Don't touch my brother!

5
00:01:30,167 --> 00:01:33,250
- Let him go!
- Where's your mother?

6
00:01:33,833 --> 00:01:34,958
Let them go!

7
00:01:35,167 --> 00:01:36,917
They're just kids!
Let them go.

8
00:01:44,250 --> 00:01:46,750
Let's fucking castrate him now,

9
00:01:46,917 --> 00:01:49,125
it's no fun when they're dead.

10
00:01:49,292 --> 00:01:51,958
Damn it! Let's just finish this!

11
00:01:52,125 --> 00:01:55,083
You can kill every priest
and landlord in Spain,

12
00:01:55,250 --> 00:01:56,958
but you'll never win!

13
00:01:57,125 --> 00:01:58,208
You're scum!

14
00:02:07,458 --> 00:02:10,167
Now bring out his wife and kids.

15
00:02:10,333 --> 00:02:12,667
No!
You can't kill two innocent boys.

16
00:02:12,833 --> 00:02:13,500
No!

17
00:02:13,667 --> 00:02:15,625
I'm not even his wife.

18
00:02:16,750 --> 00:02:17,875
Josico.

19
00:02:18,042 --> 00:02:19,292
Josico, tell him.

20
00:02:19,875 --> 00:02:22,958
I'm Cagorcio's daughter.
We were never married.

21
00:02:23,167 --> 00:02:26,542
These poor boys
won't even inherit his name!

22
00:02:26,708 --> 00:02:28,042
Is that true?

23
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:30,917
Yes, she was his mistress.

24
00:02:31,292 --> 00:02:33,667
But he wouldn't marry a maid.

25
00:02:34,417 --> 00:02:36,292
So the boys were born bastards.

26
00:02:36,583 --> 00:02:38,667
Typical bloody toff.

27
00:02:39,667 --> 00:02:40,667
Don't touch me.

28
00:02:40,833 --> 00:02:43,500
- Don't fucking touch me!
- Please!

29
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:47,583
We'll let them go.

30
00:02:48,417 --> 00:02:50,333
Should we torch the castle?

31
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:52,833
No, no.
It'll make a nice HQ.

32
00:02:52,958 --> 00:02:56,792
I'm sure our maid here
will keep it tidy, right?

33
00:02:56,958 --> 00:02:58,042
Right?

34
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:04,958
Now throw this sack of shit
to the vultures!

35
00:03:13,667 --> 00:03:17,667
UNCERTAIN GLORY

36
00:03:42,375 --> 00:03:44,042
Long live the Republic!

37
00:05:29,667 --> 00:05:32,958
ARAGON FRONT
SPANISH CIVIL WAR, JUNE 1937

38
00:05:42,292 --> 00:05:43,750
I'm Lieutenant Sales.

39
00:05:44,083 --> 00:05:46,208
- Forgive me, lieutenant.
- At ease.

40
00:05:46,750 --> 00:05:48,750
I'm to report to Captain Picó.

41
00:05:49,458 --> 00:05:50,875
He's been expecting you.

42
00:05:51,250 --> 00:05:52,292
He's at the river.

43
00:05:52,875 --> 00:05:54,583
Suau, go with the Lieutenant.

44
00:05:58,708 --> 00:06:02,208
We have two great enemies:
lice and pornography.

45
00:06:02,625 --> 00:06:05,625
Plagues of war,
as Napoleon called them.

46
00:06:06,042 --> 00:06:08,125
Lice and pornography!

47
00:06:09,208 --> 00:06:11,708
We will only defeat our enemies

48
00:06:11,875 --> 00:06:16,792
if we scrub ourselves clean,
both physically and morally.

49
00:06:17,917 --> 00:06:19,583
OK, hand it out.

50
00:06:19,750 --> 00:06:22,250
- Yes, sir!
- Make good use of this soap.

51
00:06:22,875 --> 00:06:24,375
And make it last.

52
00:06:24,750 --> 00:06:25,875
Is that clear?

53
00:06:26,042 --> 00:06:26,875
Is that clear?

54
00:06:27,042 --> 00:06:28,500
Yes, sir!

55
00:06:28,667 --> 00:06:31,333
Now get undressed.
Fall out!

56
00:06:38,875 --> 00:06:41,375
You too, lieutenant.
Don't be shy.

57
00:06:43,750 --> 00:06:46,208
Don't be ashamed
of your shameful parts!

58
00:06:46,375 --> 00:06:47,542
We've all got one.

59
00:06:47,708 --> 00:06:51,250
I want the cleanest regiment
in the Republican army.

60
00:06:51,417 --> 00:06:53,125
Then, and only then,

61
00:06:53,292 --> 00:06:57,292
will we dirty our hands
with the blood of those fascists.

62
00:06:57,458 --> 00:07:01,125
Hygiene is the first step to glory!

63
00:07:03,458 --> 00:07:05,917
This whole battalion is disgusting.

64
00:07:06,417 --> 00:07:07,708
No hygiene or culture.

65
00:07:07,875 --> 00:07:10,333
As long as they will fight
for their ideals...

66
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:11,958
Nobody here has ideals.

67
00:07:12,792 --> 00:07:14,750
Or principles... Hey!

68
00:07:14,917 --> 00:07:16,542
We need them, if we want to win.

69
00:07:16,708 --> 00:07:19,167
This front has been dead for months.

70
00:07:19,333 --> 00:07:21,667
Franco is concentrating on Madrid,

71
00:07:21,833 --> 00:07:24,875
and we're here,
like cast-off old whores.

72
00:07:25,042 --> 00:07:26,417
We have to do something.

73
00:07:26,583 --> 00:07:28,375
You want to kill fascists.

74
00:07:28,542 --> 00:07:30,458
I don't want to kill anyone.

75
00:07:30,625 --> 00:07:33,167
But we need to defend
the rights of the Republic.

76
00:07:36,167 --> 00:07:39,167
I hear there's an officer here
called Soleràs.

77
00:07:39,333 --> 00:07:41,208
- Juli Soleràs?
- Juli, yes.

78
00:07:41,375 --> 00:07:42,542
What about him?

79
00:07:42,708 --> 00:07:44,667
We're mates.
We studied together.

80
00:07:44,833 --> 00:07:47,958
That surprises me.
A cultured man like yourself...

81
00:07:48,125 --> 00:07:50,958
What?
Juli is educated and clever...

82
00:07:51,167 --> 00:07:52,792
He has no morals or principles.

83
00:07:52,958 --> 00:07:54,625
Take the last battle we had.

84
00:07:54,792 --> 00:07:57,458
He took out 20 fascists
with a machine gun,

85
00:07:57,625 --> 00:07:59,750
then he just buggered off

86
00:07:59,917 --> 00:08:02,292
and left,
in the middle of the battle.

87
00:08:02,458 --> 00:08:03,625
Don't laugh.

88
00:08:03,792 --> 00:08:05,875
We should've shot him for it.

89
00:08:06,750 --> 00:08:08,958
This is it.
You'll be all right here.

90
00:08:11,458 --> 00:08:12,458
Olegaria!

91
00:08:13,833 --> 00:08:15,333
Yes, Captain.

92
00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:18,083
You'll eat well in this house.

93
00:08:18,583 --> 00:08:20,875
Look, some tasty haggis.

94
00:08:23,083 --> 00:08:24,750
I'll show you around.

95
00:08:25,542 --> 00:08:26,958
My nephew.

96
00:08:27,417 --> 00:08:28,417
Handsome.

97
00:08:29,250 --> 00:08:31,042
Joined up at 16.

98
00:08:31,208 --> 00:08:34,208
I don't know which regiment,
he's on the other side.

99
00:08:34,375 --> 00:08:35,958
This way, Master Lluís.

100
00:08:36,833 --> 00:08:39,167
You'll have the boy's room.

101
00:08:39,667 --> 00:08:41,958
The war caught him
on the other side.

102
00:08:42,125 --> 00:08:43,917
That's how it is here.

103
00:08:44,083 --> 00:08:46,042
You enlist or you get shot.

104
00:08:46,208 --> 00:08:48,583
At least it wasn't the anarchists.

105
00:08:48,750 --> 00:08:51,625
They killed all the friars
from the monastery.

106
00:08:52,667 --> 00:08:54,375
Master Lluís,

107
00:08:54,542 --> 00:08:55,917
don't take this badly,

108
00:08:56,083 --> 00:08:58,292
but I don't care
who wins the war.

109
00:08:58,458 --> 00:09:00,208
I just want it to end.

110
00:09:20,417 --> 00:09:24,083
DEAR TRINI

111
00:09:40,042 --> 00:09:42,750
In my village,
we have ploughs for this.

112
00:09:42,917 --> 00:09:44,792
But they don't give you soap.

113
00:09:45,958 --> 00:09:48,292
Why do they need a trench anyway?

114
00:09:48,458 --> 00:09:51,542
To bury us in when we're killed.
Saves time.

115
00:09:51,958 --> 00:09:53,125
Listen up!

116
00:09:54,125 --> 00:09:57,583
That trench is to protect us
from the enemy.

117
00:09:57,750 --> 00:10:00,292
From here,
we can spot any movement.

118
00:10:00,458 --> 00:10:03,167
It protects us
from bullets and bombs.

119
00:10:03,625 --> 00:10:06,333
Some of us might die in this trench,

120
00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:09,583
but we will beat them from here.
Got it?

121
00:10:09,750 --> 00:10:10,750
Yes, sir!

122
00:10:42,958 --> 00:10:45,417
We bring our dying animals here.

123
00:10:46,125 --> 00:10:49,292
While they can still walk.
Then we throw them down.

124
00:10:50,208 --> 00:10:52,375
The vultures do the rest.

125
00:10:53,167 --> 00:10:55,083
Some people end up here too.

126
00:10:55,708 --> 00:10:57,333
My husband is down there.

127
00:11:07,875 --> 00:11:10,167
- You're new here.
- Yes.

128
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:11,833
I'm training the soldiers.

129
00:11:11,958 --> 00:11:14,458
Really?
What does that involve?

130
00:11:15,083 --> 00:11:16,583
Teaching them to kill.

131
00:11:16,958 --> 00:11:18,833
I thought that came naturally.

132
00:11:20,667 --> 00:11:23,167
I almost killed my mother
when I was born.

133
00:11:23,917 --> 00:11:26,417
That little one there
almost killed me.

134
00:11:27,333 --> 00:11:28,625
I'm glad he didn't.

135
00:11:30,958 --> 00:11:32,458
How come you speak Catalan?

136
00:11:34,125 --> 00:11:36,167
My husband was from Barcelona.

137
00:11:36,333 --> 00:11:37,708
I lived there for years.

138
00:11:37,875 --> 00:11:40,333
- Are you from Barcelona?
- Yes.

139
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:42,542
And when you're not
giving killing lessons?

140
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:46,625
I studied law.
I wanted to be a lawyer.

141
00:11:47,417 --> 00:11:49,750
I see you're from a good family.

142
00:11:49,917 --> 00:11:52,000
This desert is bigger than it looks.

143
00:11:52,917 --> 00:11:55,958
In those boots,
you won't even reach the enemy.

144
00:12:42,542 --> 00:12:44,542
- What?
- Don't you ever knock?

145
00:12:44,708 --> 00:12:46,958
Too risky.
People wouldn't let me in.

146
00:12:49,958 --> 00:12:51,542
Let's not get carried away.

147
00:12:51,708 --> 00:12:54,083
You have a great view from here.

148
00:12:54,417 --> 00:12:56,375
How do you always get what I want?

149
00:12:56,750 --> 00:12:58,500
By being friendly and polite.

150
00:13:00,083 --> 00:13:01,333
You still have it?

151
00:13:01,750 --> 00:13:03,958
This?
I'll take it to my grave.

152
00:13:04,292 --> 00:13:07,125
- Anything interesting up there?
- More than here.

153
00:13:07,292 --> 00:13:08,958
I bet. This place is dead.

154
00:13:09,167 --> 00:13:11,667
The Fascists
could be in Barcelona by now,

155
00:13:11,833 --> 00:13:14,875
but they use the ARAGON front
to make the war drag on.

156
00:13:15,042 --> 00:13:18,083
The longer it takes,
the greater the triumph.

157
00:13:18,375 --> 00:13:19,792
And we get to die of boredom.

158
00:13:19,958 --> 00:13:22,083
But smelling of soap!

159
00:13:22,792 --> 00:13:25,917
Not you!
You stink like a pig.

160
00:13:26,083 --> 00:13:27,833
Follow my scent, then shoot me.

161
00:13:27,958 --> 00:13:29,375
Sounds good.

162
00:13:30,875 --> 00:13:34,167
Let's celebrate this reunion
with some fascist brandy.

163
00:13:34,333 --> 00:13:36,625
- Are you crazy?
- I know where to get some.

164
00:13:39,167 --> 00:13:41,750
You achieved glory
by killing a load of fascists,

165
00:13:41,917 --> 00:13:43,250
then just walked away.

166
00:13:43,417 --> 00:13:45,083
I left when it was over.

167
00:13:45,250 --> 00:13:47,792
Glory only lasts a second.

168
00:13:47,958 --> 00:13:50,500
I experienced it and then I split.

169
00:13:50,792 --> 00:13:53,167
I must admit,
it felt like an eternity.

170
00:13:55,625 --> 00:13:57,458
Now I'm counting chickpeas.

171
00:13:57,625 --> 00:14:01,208
Apparently, someone
who leaves their post like that

172
00:14:01,375 --> 00:14:02,708
can't be trusted.

173
00:14:04,750 --> 00:14:06,417
Am I a bad example to the men?

174
00:14:06,958 --> 00:14:07,958
Yes.

175
00:14:13,292 --> 00:14:13,958
Juli?

176
00:14:14,125 --> 00:14:16,542
Watch your back!
Always watch your back.

177
00:14:16,708 --> 00:14:18,792
You can't trust your mates.

178
00:14:20,292 --> 00:14:22,125
Dinner's ready!

179
00:14:25,958 --> 00:14:27,333
Look.

180
00:14:29,750 --> 00:14:31,250
Look, a piano.

181
00:15:10,042 --> 00:15:11,042
Juli!

182
00:15:12,250 --> 00:15:13,625
Juli, get down.

183
00:15:13,792 --> 00:15:14,792
Juli!

184
00:15:43,417 --> 00:15:44,667
It's somebody's house!

185
00:15:44,833 --> 00:15:48,625
You don't abandon a house
and expect to find it the same.

186
00:15:48,792 --> 00:15:50,583
- Juli, you're an officer.
- Yes.

187
00:15:50,750 --> 00:15:54,083
You shouldn't be stealing,
or counting chickpeas.

188
00:15:54,250 --> 00:15:57,750
My subordinate does that.
You know I'm no good at numbers.

189
00:15:59,125 --> 00:15:59,875
<i>Et Voilà.</i>

190
00:16:00,042 --> 00:16:02,042
So what are you good at?

191
00:16:02,958 --> 00:16:04,250
Escapism.

192
00:16:05,042 --> 00:16:07,958
I could do it for a living
when I grow up.

193
00:16:08,125 --> 00:16:09,708
But you're good at it too.

194
00:16:09,875 --> 00:16:11,708
What do you mean?

195
00:16:11,875 --> 00:16:15,208
Ask Trini.
You don't even open her letters.

196
00:16:15,667 --> 00:16:17,458
Spying on your best friend now?

197
00:16:17,625 --> 00:16:19,667
Don't you care about anything?

198
00:16:19,833 --> 00:16:22,708
The man of great principles
is wrong again.

199
00:16:23,250 --> 00:16:26,125
You know what I care about?
The stars.

200
00:16:26,583 --> 00:16:28,250
And one in particular.

201
00:16:29,208 --> 00:16:32,708
It's getting fainter every day,
and is about to go out.

202
00:16:32,875 --> 00:16:34,542
There are millions of stars.

203
00:16:34,792 --> 00:16:36,375
Be careful, Lluís.

204
00:16:36,833 --> 00:16:39,167
Trini is like
these abandoned houses.

205
00:16:39,667 --> 00:16:41,833
A stranger
could start poking around.

206
00:16:43,417 --> 00:16:45,250
Don't talk to me about Trini.

207
00:16:58,542 --> 00:17:00,875
Juli! Come!

208
00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:05,417
- What is it?
- There are some fascists over there.

209
00:17:09,083 --> 00:17:12,208
- See?
- Yes. So what? That's their side.

210
00:17:12,750 --> 00:17:13,750
What do you mean?

211
00:17:13,833 --> 00:17:17,417
Abandoned villages are the store
where both sides go shopping.

212
00:17:17,583 --> 00:17:19,833
If nobody crosses the line, it's fine.

213
00:17:20,167 --> 00:17:21,458
Put your gun away.

214
00:17:42,208 --> 00:17:44,667
- Reporting for duty, Captain.
- At ease.

215
00:17:44,833 --> 00:17:47,917
I'm making a contraption
to scare away the flies.

216
00:17:48,083 --> 00:17:50,458
This says
I'm to requisition a horse.

217
00:17:50,625 --> 00:17:54,208
This is a large area,
and we're short of cavalry.

218
00:17:54,375 --> 00:17:56,417
You'll need to get closer
to the other side.

219
00:17:56,583 --> 00:17:59,875
So where can I find one?
The locals only have donkeys.

220
00:18:00,042 --> 00:18:02,500
You can use the<i> Carlán's</i> mare.

221
00:18:02,667 --> 00:18:05,125
His widow has kindly offered
to let you ride her.

222
00:18:06,125 --> 00:18:06,875
Me?

223
00:18:07,042 --> 00:18:08,875
You made a good impression.

224
00:18:34,750 --> 00:18:35,792
Shut up!

225
00:18:35,958 --> 00:18:36,958
Is Mrs Olivella home?

226
00:19:06,208 --> 00:19:07,208
Leave us, Fermín.

227
00:19:08,625 --> 00:19:11,042
And put the axe away,
we're not at war here.

228
00:19:12,458 --> 00:19:13,458
Are we?

229
00:19:13,625 --> 00:19:14,708
No.

230
00:19:15,083 --> 00:19:16,583
I don't have servants.

231
00:19:16,750 --> 00:19:19,750
Just him, and a maid
who is out with the boys.

232
00:19:19,917 --> 00:19:21,333
Mrs Olivella.

233
00:19:27,208 --> 00:19:29,167
Forgive my boldness.

234
00:19:29,333 --> 00:19:31,792
The Captain sent me
about the horse.

235
00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:35,042
- The horse...
- My late husband's horse.

236
00:19:36,333 --> 00:19:37,917
She is yours to use.

237
00:19:38,083 --> 00:19:41,750
But you won't get far
with those boots. Follow me.

238
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:47,167
You be rough
and gentle at the same time.

239
00:19:48,625 --> 00:19:50,958
My husband did it every night.

240
00:19:52,625 --> 00:19:55,083
He loved Bellota
more than anything.

241
00:19:57,583 --> 00:19:59,458
Only he could ride her.

242
00:20:02,125 --> 00:20:03,917
I'm sorry to deprive you of her.

243
00:20:04,083 --> 00:20:07,208
We're at war.
We must help however we can.

244
00:20:07,833 --> 00:20:09,583
We can't hang on
to what we have.

245
00:20:11,042 --> 00:20:13,875
We could lose everything
in an instant.

246
00:20:14,750 --> 00:20:17,958
And since she's had
nobody to ride her,

247
00:20:19,250 --> 00:20:20,958
she's been very sad.

248
00:20:21,875 --> 00:20:25,125
She's getting old,
she thinks nobody loves her.

249
00:20:27,583 --> 00:20:28,625
Get on.

250
00:20:57,875 --> 00:20:58,875
Easy.

251
00:21:01,792 --> 00:21:02,875
Good, Bellota.

252
00:21:03,875 --> 00:21:06,375
I think she likes you.

253
00:21:07,250 --> 00:21:09,167
You must have work to do.

254
00:21:09,333 --> 00:21:11,208
Yes, inspecting the troops.

255
00:21:11,583 --> 00:21:13,833
Don't forget to teach them
staying alive.

256
00:21:13,958 --> 00:21:15,500
It's harder than killing,

257
00:21:16,208 --> 00:21:18,333
although sometimes,
the two go together.

258
00:22:04,292 --> 00:22:06,542
What a fine companion, Master Lluís.

259
00:22:06,708 --> 00:22:08,542
- Where can I put her?
- Under shelter.

260
00:22:08,708 --> 00:22:12,333
They say it's going to rain,
and this place floods easily.

261
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:15,083
Look at the horse.

262
00:22:15,250 --> 00:22:16,583
What are they whispering?

263
00:22:17,792 --> 00:22:19,625
Mind your own business!

264
00:22:20,375 --> 00:22:23,375
That's the<i> Carlana's</i> horse, isn't it?

265
00:22:23,542 --> 00:22:24,917
Yes. The Lady of the Manor.

266
00:22:28,375 --> 00:22:29,208
What's so funny?

267
00:22:29,375 --> 00:22:33,333
The<i> Carlana</i> is anything but a lady.

268
00:22:33,500 --> 00:22:34,583
What do you mean?

269
00:22:34,917 --> 00:22:36,542
If only you knew.

270
00:22:36,708 --> 00:22:38,833
Her own father, Cagorcio,

271
00:22:38,958 --> 00:22:41,417
called her "the dirty pig" because

272
00:22:41,583 --> 00:22:43,458
she would bathe
naked in a trough,

273
00:22:43,625 --> 00:22:45,250
and it shocked people here.

274
00:22:45,417 --> 00:22:47,083
She seemed a very nice lady.

275
00:22:47,250 --> 00:22:48,958
If you say so, but the<i> Carlana</i>

276
00:22:49,167 --> 00:22:52,875
is not a lady,
she's not even the<i> Carlán's</i> widow.

277
00:22:53,042 --> 00:22:55,292
He just gave her two bastard sons.

278
00:23:27,875 --> 00:23:28,875
Good morning.

279
00:23:29,042 --> 00:23:30,958
I'm with the Republicans here,

280
00:23:31,167 --> 00:23:33,458
but my wife is sick in Barcelona.

281
00:23:33,625 --> 00:23:35,375
If you were going that way...

282
00:23:38,875 --> 00:23:42,375
I can drop you at Plaza Palau,
where I'm going.

283
00:23:42,750 --> 00:23:44,625
Don't ask me to go any further.

284
00:23:46,625 --> 00:23:48,792
No, no.
In the back with the sheep.

285
00:23:49,958 --> 00:23:51,917
Fine.
I like them more than people.

286
00:24:03,333 --> 00:24:07,333
BARCELONA

287
00:24:16,792 --> 00:24:17,875
Hurry up.

288
00:24:22,417 --> 00:24:23,417
Here.

289
00:24:24,292 --> 00:24:25,542
At your service.

290
00:24:25,958 --> 00:24:27,125
Comrade!

291
00:25:27,417 --> 00:25:29,333
Eat your onion.

292
00:26:38,708 --> 00:26:39,708
Trini!

293
00:26:44,708 --> 00:26:46,375
Juli!

294
00:26:46,625 --> 00:26:47,792
Always playing!

295
00:26:48,750 --> 00:26:49,833
You smell great.

296
00:26:49,958 --> 00:26:51,083
You stink of sheep.

297
00:26:51,250 --> 00:26:54,625
No, it's dung.
The latest perfume from Paris.

298
00:26:55,958 --> 00:26:57,292
How is Lluís?

299
00:26:57,458 --> 00:26:59,958
Fine.
Getting on with the new regiment.

300
00:27:00,125 --> 00:27:03,083
- He hasn't written for months.
- That place is a mess.

301
00:27:03,250 --> 00:27:05,958
But don't worry,
the front itself is quiet.

302
00:27:06,167 --> 00:27:07,250
Not like here then.

303
00:27:07,417 --> 00:27:10,083
People don't realise
how hellish life is in Barcelona.

304
00:27:10,292 --> 00:27:11,500
Ramonet!

305
00:27:11,875 --> 00:27:14,292
- Uncle Juli!
- Hello!

306
00:27:15,250 --> 00:27:16,750
- What did you bring me?
- Ramonet!

307
00:27:16,917 --> 00:27:18,417
- You'll see.
- Always want more.

308
00:27:18,583 --> 00:27:19,917
He's like me.

309
00:27:20,375 --> 00:27:23,333
- Look!
- Uncle Juli brought you a doll.

310
00:27:23,500 --> 00:27:25,292
Dolls are for girls.

311
00:27:25,458 --> 00:27:29,542
Not a doll, a soldier,
like your daddy and me.

312
00:27:30,083 --> 00:27:33,583
We'll make him a rifle
and a uniform. Here.

313
00:27:35,625 --> 00:27:37,375
Put these greens on to boil.

314
00:27:37,542 --> 00:27:40,083
- And the potatoes?
- No, there aren't any.

315
00:27:40,250 --> 00:27:42,458
I have something for you too.

316
00:27:44,958 --> 00:27:46,167
Is that a Christmas tree?

317
00:27:46,333 --> 00:27:49,042
I keep them.
They're like treasure.

318
00:27:49,208 --> 00:27:50,667
If it wasn't for you...

319
00:27:51,500 --> 00:27:53,083
I'd like to do more.

320
00:27:53,250 --> 00:27:54,708
You do plenty.

321
00:27:57,917 --> 00:27:59,917
Did you know we got baptized?

322
00:28:00,458 --> 00:28:01,958
No, that is a miracle.

323
00:28:02,125 --> 00:28:04,625
Trini, the atheist anarchist
gets baptized.

324
00:28:04,792 --> 00:28:07,458
- I daren't tell Lluís.
- He'd kill you.

325
00:28:07,625 --> 00:28:09,167
I know,

326
00:28:09,792 --> 00:28:11,708
but it makes me feel less alone.

327
00:28:13,292 --> 00:28:14,458
Hold out your hand.

328
00:28:20,542 --> 00:28:22,167
It's beautiful.

329
00:28:26,667 --> 00:28:27,708
Where did you find it?

330
00:28:28,167 --> 00:28:32,167
In a church with no roof.
It's really dark.

331
00:28:32,333 --> 00:28:34,708
I go there to look at the stars.

332
00:28:35,542 --> 00:28:38,167
- Is it a meteorite?
- I don't know.

333
00:28:38,333 --> 00:28:40,167
You're the geologist.

334
00:28:42,125 --> 00:28:43,625
I'll study it.

335
00:28:44,250 --> 00:28:46,833
Wherever it came from,

336
00:28:46,958 --> 00:28:49,458
it's the best gift I've ever had.

337
00:29:16,417 --> 00:29:17,417
Hurry up!

338
00:29:18,042 --> 00:29:20,375
It's going to pour down any minute.

339
00:29:20,875 --> 00:29:23,625
Fasten it down,
or it'll get washed away.

340
00:29:32,792 --> 00:29:34,750
You rascal!

341
00:29:34,917 --> 00:29:36,500
You rascal!

342
00:29:36,667 --> 00:29:39,167
You've blinded me!

343
00:29:39,458 --> 00:29:42,667
You've blinded me!

344
00:29:43,083 --> 00:29:46,583
The little girl
saw her chance to escape.

345
00:29:46,750 --> 00:29:49,042
When she reached the door,

346
00:29:49,208 --> 00:29:51,667
she couldn't believe her eyes.

347
00:29:51,833 --> 00:29:55,958
The stepmother was holding
a huge stick to beat her with.

348
00:29:56,542 --> 00:30:00,458
Why doesn't my dad
go and bash the stepmother?

349
00:30:00,625 --> 00:30:02,625
He can't.
He's away at the war.

350
00:30:02,792 --> 00:30:04,542
Then I want to go too.

351
00:30:04,875 --> 00:30:08,375
Really?
But then who will look after me?

352
00:30:08,542 --> 00:30:10,375
I will, Mummy.

353
00:30:20,292 --> 00:30:21,292
How are you?

354
00:30:23,458 --> 00:30:25,208
Tired, Trini.

355
00:30:26,167 --> 00:30:27,583
I want to leave this world,

356
00:30:27,750 --> 00:30:30,583
or get married,
and read fairy tales.

357
00:30:30,750 --> 00:30:34,042
- Why don't you then?
- No woman could love me.

358
00:30:34,208 --> 00:30:36,667
You? You're made
to make some woman happy.

359
00:30:36,833 --> 00:30:38,083
Then marry me.

360
00:30:38,250 --> 00:30:39,958
- Don't be an animal.
- An animal? Me?

361
00:30:40,125 --> 00:30:42,292
Yes, you! Animal!

362
00:30:43,792 --> 00:30:45,708
I can talk to you like a brother.

363
00:30:47,125 --> 00:30:49,250
Lluís is completely ignoring me.

364
00:30:49,625 --> 00:30:53,417
I know you're trying
to get him to come back to me,

365
00:30:54,458 --> 00:30:56,750
but I don't think
it'll ever be the same.

366
00:31:14,833 --> 00:31:17,250
This country
has been poisoned forever.

367
00:31:18,583 --> 00:31:20,833
Don't let the mud cover your eyes.

368
00:31:21,667 --> 00:31:23,333
You have to see the stars.

369
00:31:24,458 --> 00:31:26,750
Our ideals were so good,

370
00:31:27,167 --> 00:31:29,250
so beautiful to live by,

371
00:31:30,083 --> 00:31:32,208
really believing in something.

372
00:31:32,375 --> 00:31:33,708
That's over, Trini.

373
00:31:34,917 --> 00:31:38,000
One year, the spring won't return.

374
00:31:39,083 --> 00:31:43,417
April, that month of uncertain glory,
is slipping through our fingers.

375
00:31:44,833 --> 00:31:47,458
Uncertain or not, it's the only glory.

376
00:31:48,833 --> 00:31:51,500
What comes after will be nausea.

377
00:32:29,417 --> 00:32:30,417
Lieutenant!

378
00:32:30,458 --> 00:32:33,458
Come inside!
Don't stand there in the rain.

379
00:32:34,375 --> 00:32:35,792
Oh, there she is.

380
00:32:36,208 --> 00:32:39,083
We'd have offered you shelter
in our mill,

381
00:32:39,250 --> 00:32:41,167
but you saw what happened to it.

382
00:32:41,625 --> 00:32:42,750
It's bad luck.

383
00:32:42,917 --> 00:32:44,667
It's a catastrophe.

384
00:32:45,208 --> 00:32:48,458
Our daughter-in-law
died in childbirth.

385
00:32:49,083 --> 00:32:51,292
The war took away our sons.

386
00:32:52,583 --> 00:32:54,083
And now, with no mill,

387
00:32:54,875 --> 00:32:57,417
we're all going to starve.

388
00:32:57,708 --> 00:33:02,208
If you keep crying like that,
you'll flood the shack as well.

389
00:33:02,375 --> 00:33:03,875
Oh, dear Lord!

390
00:33:04,208 --> 00:33:08,375
Don't worry,
I'll go and see the<i> Carlana</i>

391
00:33:08,542 --> 00:33:10,833
and ask her to rent us her mill.

392
00:33:10,958 --> 00:33:13,667
She'll slam the door in your face.

393
00:33:14,167 --> 00:33:16,292
She lent me the<i> Carlán's</i> mare,

394
00:33:16,458 --> 00:33:18,333
to help our cause.

395
00:33:18,500 --> 00:33:21,333
Because you're a gentleman.

396
00:33:22,208 --> 00:33:24,958
And you are her neighbours.

397
00:33:25,542 --> 00:33:28,250
Ever since
she moved into that castle,

398
00:33:29,292 --> 00:33:31,917
she hasn't spoken
to us in the village.

399
00:33:32,083 --> 00:33:34,083
My wife's right.

400
00:33:35,042 --> 00:33:39,500
I'm ashamed to ask you this,
but...

401
00:33:39,958 --> 00:33:44,167
being as she seems to like you,

402
00:33:44,542 --> 00:33:46,708
maybe you could ask her for us.

403
00:33:47,208 --> 00:33:49,792
Well, she only lent me the horse.

404
00:33:49,958 --> 00:33:52,667
She never let anyone else ride it.

405
00:33:57,167 --> 00:33:58,500
All right.

406
00:33:59,083 --> 00:34:00,458
I'll talk to her.

407
00:34:06,708 --> 00:34:07,750
Bellota!

408
00:34:12,125 --> 00:34:14,875
Where were you?

409
00:34:19,458 --> 00:34:20,792
What are you doing?

410
00:34:22,625 --> 00:34:24,292
Go on, sit down.

411
00:34:24,708 --> 00:34:26,708
Leave your boots in the corner.

412
00:34:32,167 --> 00:34:34,792
Let me help, I'm used to this.

413
00:34:35,750 --> 00:34:36,917
Pull.

414
00:34:37,917 --> 00:34:40,500
I'm glad to see Bellota came back.

415
00:34:40,792 --> 00:34:42,042
I was worried.

416
00:34:42,292 --> 00:34:44,958
Don't worry so much,
you'll get wrinkles.

417
00:34:45,500 --> 00:34:46,958
Now pull!

418
00:34:54,083 --> 00:34:55,583
You told me to pull.

419
00:34:58,667 --> 00:34:59,667
Put these on.

420
00:35:00,708 --> 00:35:02,292
They were my husband's.

421
00:35:02,708 --> 00:35:04,583
So, what can I do for you?

422
00:35:04,833 --> 00:35:07,250
You're not only here for the horse.

423
00:35:07,417 --> 00:35:11,167
I wouldn't want
to abuse your kindness, but...

424
00:35:11,333 --> 00:35:14,583
the miller and his wife
would like to rent...

425
00:35:14,750 --> 00:35:16,958
- My mill?
- Yes.

426
00:35:17,125 --> 00:35:18,125
How did you know?

427
00:35:18,500 --> 00:35:22,500
I saw the river flood theirs.
I see everything from up here.

428
00:35:23,167 --> 00:35:25,458
They've been left with nothing...

429
00:35:25,625 --> 00:35:27,833
They can come and discuss terms
when they like.

430
00:35:27,958 --> 00:35:28,792
Thank you.

431
00:35:28,958 --> 00:35:30,375
I'll tell them.

432
00:35:31,083 --> 00:35:32,292
Sit down, please.

433
00:35:32,458 --> 00:35:34,083
Don't be shy.

434
00:35:35,958 --> 00:35:38,333
You like helping people, don't you?

435
00:35:38,542 --> 00:35:40,083
Yes, when I can.

436
00:35:41,917 --> 00:35:43,917
Could you help me?

437
00:35:44,917 --> 00:35:45,917
You?

438
00:35:47,333 --> 00:35:49,083
You said you were a lawyer.

439
00:35:49,833 --> 00:35:51,917
I studied to become a lawyer.

440
00:35:52,708 --> 00:35:55,125
I need help with a legal matter.

441
00:35:55,458 --> 00:35:56,958
I'll help, if I can.

442
00:35:58,333 --> 00:35:59,333
Tell me more.

443
00:35:59,625 --> 00:36:01,833
I'm sure you've heard by now

444
00:36:01,958 --> 00:36:04,958
that I was the<i> Carlán's</i> maid,
and he never married me.

445
00:36:08,583 --> 00:36:09,792
Yes, you've heard.

446
00:36:12,750 --> 00:36:15,417
What people don't know
is that my husband,

447
00:36:15,583 --> 00:36:18,250
suspecting the anarchists
would kill him,

448
00:36:18,417 --> 00:36:21,542
married me
so our children would be his heirs.

449
00:36:22,333 --> 00:36:23,958
We did it at the monastery.

450
00:36:24,417 --> 00:36:26,667
But the anarchists
destroyed everything,

451
00:36:26,833 --> 00:36:29,292
leaving no witnesses
of the marriage alive.

452
00:36:29,458 --> 00:36:30,542
Now nobody believes me.

453
00:36:31,417 --> 00:36:33,458
But you must have
a marriage certificate.

454
00:36:33,958 --> 00:36:34,958
No.

455
00:36:37,833 --> 00:36:39,958
Come and sit here.

456
00:36:50,375 --> 00:36:51,375
Give me your foot.

457
00:36:54,958 --> 00:36:58,333
The problem is
that without that certificate,

458
00:37:00,292 --> 00:37:01,667
my husband's family

459
00:37:02,917 --> 00:37:04,958
will claim this estate
when the war ends.

460
00:37:06,750 --> 00:37:09,917
And my sons and I
will be homeless.

461
00:37:11,458 --> 00:37:13,583
But that certificate must exist.

462
00:37:13,958 --> 00:37:15,625
It's in the monastery.

463
00:37:16,375 --> 00:37:19,708
But I wouldn't know
where to look for it.

464
00:37:20,708 --> 00:37:23,708
And the place
makes my skin crawl.

465
00:37:26,583 --> 00:37:28,625
Why don't you look for it?

466
00:39:38,333 --> 00:39:39,458
MARRIAGES

467
00:40:03,625 --> 00:40:04,792
Fuck Juli!

468
00:40:05,625 --> 00:40:07,542
You always appear unexpectedly!

469
00:40:07,708 --> 00:40:09,958
- Ditto.
- What are you doing here?

470
00:40:10,125 --> 00:40:12,208
This is my favourite place.

471
00:40:12,792 --> 00:40:15,958
Silent corpses,
the stench of betrayal...

472
00:40:16,667 --> 00:40:18,625
It's grotesque and macabre.

473
00:40:18,792 --> 00:40:20,083
As if it were my home.

474
00:40:20,250 --> 00:40:23,917
Juli, I'm not in the mood
for an absurd speech.

475
00:40:24,083 --> 00:40:27,083
All that riding
seems to have upset you.

476
00:40:27,333 --> 00:40:28,167
What did you say?

477
00:40:28,333 --> 00:40:30,083
Isn't that the<i> Carlana's</i> mare?

478
00:40:30,250 --> 00:40:32,375
She loaned it to the regiment.

479
00:40:32,542 --> 00:40:34,333
Stop being modest.

480
00:40:34,500 --> 00:40:36,542
You got it.
I was left frustrated.

481
00:40:36,708 --> 00:40:37,875
What?

482
00:40:38,042 --> 00:40:40,333
She never let me ride her.

483
00:40:40,500 --> 00:40:43,458
- What are you insinuating?
- Nothing, except...

484
00:40:43,625 --> 00:40:46,500
I imagine you have
returned the favour.

485
00:40:48,417 --> 00:40:50,792
Don't get caught in her web, Lluís.

486
00:40:50,958 --> 00:40:52,625
Why should I listen to you?

487
00:40:53,417 --> 00:40:55,958
I'm your best friend, remember?

488
00:40:58,208 --> 00:41:01,583
Trust me, and look after
those who really need you.

489
00:41:08,542 --> 00:41:09,542
It's an air raid!

490
00:41:10,250 --> 00:41:11,958
Everybody out!

491
00:41:12,958 --> 00:41:15,958
- Give me a loaf.
- Outside, Trini. Hurry.

492
00:41:16,167 --> 00:41:18,375
You have a child to protect.

493
00:41:18,875 --> 00:41:20,417
Outside!

494
00:41:38,667 --> 00:41:40,417
Help me!

495
00:41:49,708 --> 00:41:52,208
Hurry, come inside!

496
00:42:18,833 --> 00:42:21,833
If it's impossible
to find that document,

497
00:42:23,042 --> 00:42:24,375
why not make a new one?

498
00:42:24,958 --> 00:42:25,958
What do you mean?

499
00:42:26,083 --> 00:42:27,542
You know the law.

500
00:42:27,708 --> 00:42:30,500
You could get a judge
to write something...

501
00:42:30,667 --> 00:42:33,500
Are you asking me
to forge a document?

502
00:42:33,667 --> 00:42:36,000
I'm asking you to help us.

503
00:42:38,208 --> 00:42:39,500
I'm sorry.

504
00:42:39,958 --> 00:42:42,792
I understand your situation,

505
00:42:42,958 --> 00:42:46,250
but what you're asking
is against the law.

506
00:42:46,417 --> 00:42:49,542
Don't tell me about the law.
It's never helped me.

507
00:42:49,958 --> 00:42:52,792
That's why I'm asking you
to help me get justice.

508
00:42:54,042 --> 00:42:55,042
Look,

509
00:42:56,292 --> 00:42:58,625
I was born poor,
I know how that is.

510
00:42:59,167 --> 00:43:01,750
I'm Cagorcio's daughter.
You must've heard.

511
00:43:02,125 --> 00:43:06,292
I watched as they daubed shit on
this castle and called me a whore.

512
00:43:06,958 --> 00:43:08,667
I can take all that,

513
00:43:09,708 --> 00:43:13,500
but I won't see my two boys
pay for this senseless war.

514
00:43:19,292 --> 00:43:21,958
If I could find a witness,

515
00:43:22,167 --> 00:43:23,583
I could make them testify.

516
00:43:23,750 --> 00:43:25,583
I told you, they're all dead.

517
00:43:51,833 --> 00:43:54,833
Don't come back,
unless you can help.

518
00:44:46,917 --> 00:44:47,958
Good morning.

519
00:44:48,667 --> 00:44:49,833
Look who it is!

520
00:44:49,958 --> 00:44:51,958
Welcome, Master Lluís.

521
00:44:52,542 --> 00:44:53,958
Come and see.

522
00:44:54,125 --> 00:44:57,417
Try one of the loaves,
they're still warm.

523
00:44:57,583 --> 00:45:00,208
You lot keep working.

524
00:45:01,417 --> 00:45:02,542
What did I tell you?

525
00:45:03,208 --> 00:45:06,708
I told you she'd make us pay
for the favour.

526
00:45:06,917 --> 00:45:10,542
Be quiet,
and let the lieutenant explain.

527
00:45:10,708 --> 00:45:14,208
You just need to swear
that you witnessed the wedding.

528
00:45:14,667 --> 00:45:18,250
I'm sure that if you do,
you'll be rewarded.

529
00:45:18,792 --> 00:45:22,500
Do you think
she might lower the rent?

530
00:45:22,792 --> 00:45:25,042
She might even give you the mill.

531
00:45:25,375 --> 00:45:27,208
- Really?
- Yes.

532
00:45:27,542 --> 00:45:30,750
What you're asking us to do...
Is it legal?

533
00:45:31,708 --> 00:45:34,958
Is it legal to kill someone?
And yet it happens every day.

534
00:45:35,292 --> 00:45:38,167
- Because we're at war.
- Exactly.

535
00:45:38,333 --> 00:45:41,375
If they hadn't murdered the friars...

536
00:45:41,542 --> 00:45:43,708
Hold on a minute.

537
00:45:43,875 --> 00:45:46,708
What you're asking us to do...

538
00:45:47,167 --> 00:45:49,792
Could we get into trouble for it?

539
00:45:49,958 --> 00:45:52,250
The<i> Carlana</i> and I won't tell a soul.

540
00:45:52,417 --> 00:45:55,083
Why are you doing all this?

541
00:45:55,583 --> 00:45:58,625
Those boys could end up
on the streets.

542
00:45:58,792 --> 00:46:01,292
- Where they belong.
- Shut up!

543
00:46:01,458 --> 00:46:03,542
Don't you see he's right?

544
00:46:03,708 --> 00:46:07,667
Children shouldn't have to pay
for their parents' sins.

545
00:46:07,833 --> 00:46:08,917
That's right.

546
00:46:10,625 --> 00:46:12,958
You're doing the right thing.

547
00:46:14,833 --> 00:46:16,458
What the hell.

548
00:46:18,625 --> 00:46:19,833
Sign here.

549
00:46:22,250 --> 00:46:23,250
Put a cross.

550
00:46:30,250 --> 00:46:32,250
You too, come on.

551
00:46:36,208 --> 00:46:38,417
We'll all go to hell.

552
00:46:48,458 --> 00:46:50,458
María, take the boys outside.

553
00:47:09,167 --> 00:47:10,792
Is this what I think it is?

554
00:47:14,250 --> 00:47:15,667
I'm eternally grateful.

555
00:47:16,458 --> 00:47:18,208
I don't want gratitude.

556
00:47:20,958 --> 00:47:21,958
What do you want?

557
00:47:23,042 --> 00:47:24,375
You know.

558
00:47:27,958 --> 00:47:30,833
I think the situation
has affected us all.

559
00:47:32,583 --> 00:47:34,417
You can't be serious.

560
00:47:34,583 --> 00:47:36,750
I've never been more serious.

561
00:47:36,917 --> 00:47:37,958
You don't know me.

562
00:47:38,125 --> 00:47:40,042
Nobody's ever really loved you.

563
00:47:40,208 --> 00:47:41,500
But I'm ready to.

564
00:47:41,958 --> 00:47:43,125
Don't you see?

565
00:47:43,292 --> 00:47:46,542
I'm getting old,
and you're just starting to live.

566
00:47:46,708 --> 00:47:47,708
I don't care.

567
00:47:47,750 --> 00:47:48,917
But I do.

568
00:47:49,667 --> 00:47:51,417
You won't let yourself be loved.

569
00:47:53,792 --> 00:47:55,292
Why not?

570
00:48:16,917 --> 00:48:20,583
Don't tell me you did all this
just to have me as a reward.

571
00:48:24,667 --> 00:48:26,292
You're a good man.

572
00:48:27,958 --> 00:48:29,125
I wish you well.

573
00:48:30,333 --> 00:48:33,667
Perhaps one day, I'll be able
to help you or your son,

574
00:48:33,833 --> 00:48:35,167
like you helped mine.

575
00:48:35,333 --> 00:48:36,583
How do you know I have a son?

576
00:48:36,750 --> 00:48:40,792
I know you have a son with a woman,
but you're not married.

577
00:48:41,167 --> 00:48:43,333
I know you're a man of your word,

578
00:48:43,500 --> 00:48:47,042
weak, innocent
and high-minded.

579
00:48:48,292 --> 00:48:51,125
Although apparently
not as moral as I thought.

580
00:48:51,833 --> 00:48:55,083
Now go back to the village
and forget this ever happened.

581
00:48:55,250 --> 00:48:58,375
And marry that woman.
For the sake of your son.

582
00:48:58,542 --> 00:49:02,208
I didn't marry, on principle.
But I recognised my son.

583
00:49:02,375 --> 00:49:03,125
Look at me!

584
00:49:03,292 --> 00:49:06,208
Not like that sod
who turned his back on you.

585
00:49:06,708 --> 00:49:10,375
And thanks to you,
that sod is now my husband.

586
00:49:11,750 --> 00:49:15,125
You should show me some respect.
Now I really am the<i> Carlana.</i>

587
00:49:16,625 --> 00:49:17,625
Get out.

588
00:49:50,458 --> 00:49:52,042
Welcome, everyone.

589
00:49:52,292 --> 00:49:55,375
We thought we wouldn't
be able to celebrate this year,

590
00:49:56,042 --> 00:50:00,042
but thanks to the generosity
of the Lady of the Manor,

591
00:50:00,208 --> 00:50:04,208
we can honour our patron saint
the Virgin of Olivel.

592
00:50:06,042 --> 00:50:10,375
The war has brought hunger,
fear and hate,

593
00:50:10,792 --> 00:50:13,083
but it will never
destroy our faith

594
00:50:13,250 --> 00:50:15,667
in the Holy Virgin of our village.

595
00:50:28,292 --> 00:50:30,542
Who'd have thought it, eh, Picó?

596
00:50:30,708 --> 00:50:34,542
I know, Doc, but now everyone
thinks they were married.

597
00:50:34,708 --> 00:50:38,333
This shift in collective memory
is suspicious.

598
00:50:38,500 --> 00:50:40,875
It might start an epidemic.

599
00:50:41,042 --> 00:50:42,958
They're not stupid.

600
00:50:43,167 --> 00:50:45,125
They know
when to drop their trousers.

601
00:50:45,292 --> 00:50:47,583
I hope no one screws them.

602
00:50:48,708 --> 00:50:52,042
Lluís said
right from the beginning

603
00:50:52,208 --> 00:50:56,125
that the<i> Carlana</i> was a real lady.

604
00:50:56,292 --> 00:50:57,750
What do you say now?

605
00:50:57,917 --> 00:50:59,042
Right, Lluís?

606
00:51:00,125 --> 00:51:03,458
Does our lieutenant
have inside information?

607
00:51:04,708 --> 00:51:06,708
Gentlemen, excuse me.

608
00:51:07,417 --> 00:51:10,708
Anyone would think
he had a broom up his arse.

609
00:51:26,375 --> 00:51:29,167
She's pleased with
the favour you did her.

610
00:51:29,333 --> 00:51:30,333
What favour?

611
00:51:30,417 --> 00:51:33,542
You got her a certificate
that makes her a noble!

612
00:51:33,708 --> 00:51:36,375
- What makes you think that?
- She asked me too.

613
00:51:37,083 --> 00:51:38,625
I was tempted, I must admit.

614
00:51:38,792 --> 00:51:40,542
She's very persuasive.

615
00:51:40,708 --> 00:51:43,875
But if I wanted to buy sex,
I'd go to a whore.

616
00:51:44,042 --> 00:51:48,083
I never imagined you, of all people,
caught in her web.

617
00:51:48,250 --> 00:51:50,833
I thought you had strict morals.

618
00:51:50,958 --> 00:51:53,458
- You can talk!
- Yes, I can.

619
00:51:53,625 --> 00:51:56,667
While you were riding
horses and landed ladies,

620
00:51:56,833 --> 00:51:59,833
I was taking food
to Trini and Ramonet.

621
00:51:59,958 --> 00:52:01,500
You never miss a chance.

622
00:52:01,667 --> 00:52:05,208
I didn't tell her.
I love her too much to hurt her.

623
00:52:05,375 --> 00:52:06,708
That's so romantic.

624
00:52:06,875 --> 00:52:10,417
- Write to her and invite her here.
- I don't take orders from you.

625
00:52:10,583 --> 00:52:12,333
Invite her, or I will.

626
00:52:14,625 --> 00:52:16,583
- What for?
- You know what for.

627
00:52:16,750 --> 00:52:18,958
Picó's inviting
the wives for Christmas.

628
00:52:19,125 --> 00:52:22,417
- We're not married.
- Then ask her to marry you, Lluís.

629
00:52:23,875 --> 00:52:27,000
OK. But when they get here,
you have to disappear.

630
00:52:46,583 --> 00:52:48,167
Open the front door.

631
00:52:48,792 --> 00:52:50,375
We have a visitor.

632
00:53:05,833 --> 00:53:07,083
Olivella?

633
00:53:10,875 --> 00:53:12,042
Come in, Father.

634
00:53:12,542 --> 00:53:13,958
It's good to see you.

635
00:53:15,208 --> 00:53:16,208
Not for me.

636
00:53:16,375 --> 00:53:19,333
The<i> Carlán</i> treated you
like a whore,

637
00:53:19,500 --> 00:53:22,833
but you've managed
to live like a lady.

638
00:53:22,958 --> 00:53:24,125
What do you want?

639
00:53:26,417 --> 00:53:28,750
Your good news
has reached the front.

640
00:53:31,958 --> 00:53:33,083
My girl,

641
00:53:34,250 --> 00:53:38,292
give me two thousand
and I'll never say a word.

642
00:53:39,583 --> 00:53:41,958
Sundown.
I'll bring it to the sheep hut.

643
00:53:42,708 --> 00:53:45,292
You're making this easy,<i> Carlana.</i>

644
00:53:45,458 --> 00:53:47,375
Would you prefer it complicated?

645
00:53:54,083 --> 00:53:55,083
Fucking hell!

646
00:53:55,458 --> 00:53:56,708
- I never...
- Now go.

647
00:54:06,083 --> 00:54:07,792
Don't let the villagers see you.

648
00:54:20,042 --> 00:54:21,792
Fermín, do we have petrol?

649
00:54:21,958 --> 00:54:24,167
Yes, one of those large cans.

650
00:54:24,333 --> 00:54:26,458
Take the cover off the car.

651
00:54:30,167 --> 00:54:31,167
Bandido.

652
00:54:31,500 --> 00:54:32,750
Bandido.

653
00:55:44,667 --> 00:55:47,958
Still bad-tempered.
Just like your dead mother.

654
00:55:48,125 --> 00:55:51,708
If you hadn't beaten her to death,
I might've known her.

655
00:55:51,875 --> 00:55:55,125
We're not here to argue.
Give me the money.

656
00:55:55,292 --> 00:55:56,542
You've got your castle now.

657
00:55:56,708 --> 00:55:59,542
Yes, but I'm still
Cagorcio's daughter.

658
00:56:00,375 --> 00:56:01,875
What are you saying?

659
00:56:02,042 --> 00:56:05,417
Even though I own all this,
I'm still the daughter of a pig.

660
00:56:06,167 --> 00:56:10,125
I won't let you shame me.
You're Cagorcio's girl!

661
00:56:10,292 --> 00:56:12,625
You never had any shame, Father.

662
00:56:12,792 --> 00:56:14,833
Or you wouldn't have
done those things.

663
00:56:14,958 --> 00:56:19,417
You fucked his lordship
and bore him two bastards.

664
00:56:19,750 --> 00:56:21,375
Remember this trough, Father?

665
00:56:22,208 --> 00:56:27,667
This is where my girl washed
her cunt like a dirty whore.

666
00:56:29,375 --> 00:56:30,375
Get off me!

667
00:57:04,750 --> 00:57:06,083
Do it.

668
00:58:24,792 --> 00:58:27,542
Look, there's Daddy!

669
00:58:42,333 --> 00:58:43,417
Lluís.

670
00:58:43,667 --> 00:58:44,708
Lluís.

671
00:58:49,875 --> 00:58:51,958
I thought
I'd never hold you again.

672
00:58:55,792 --> 00:58:58,125
I'm sorry I didn't write more.

673
00:58:58,333 --> 00:58:59,958
But you wrote that last letter.

674
00:59:00,167 --> 00:59:02,125
Look how much he's grown.

675
00:59:07,292 --> 00:59:08,375
Well?

676
00:59:08,875 --> 00:59:11,958
- Don't you like me anymore?
- Ramonet, give Daddy a kiss.

677
00:59:17,875 --> 00:59:19,375
You're so big!

678
00:59:20,583 --> 00:59:22,208
I've missed you so much.

679
00:59:35,167 --> 00:59:36,667
He's asleep.

680
00:59:37,917 --> 00:59:40,708
I'm surprised Juli hasn't come.

681
00:59:40,875 --> 00:59:42,875
Nothing Juli does surprises me now.

682
00:59:43,333 --> 00:59:44,750
We can see him tomorrow.

683
00:59:44,917 --> 00:59:46,792
Forget about Juli.

684
01:01:01,542 --> 01:01:02,875
Sorry.

685
01:01:10,500 --> 01:01:11,917
Don't worry.

686
01:01:14,458 --> 01:01:18,042
A year without a woman
is too long.

687
01:03:22,250 --> 01:03:24,958
- Tell her how beautiful she is.
- She's beautiful.

688
01:03:25,125 --> 01:03:27,875
So beautiful, right?

689
01:03:29,708 --> 01:03:32,792
That's it, get up there.

690
01:03:32,958 --> 01:03:34,042
Good.

691
01:03:34,208 --> 01:03:35,875
Give her a stroke.

692
01:03:37,042 --> 01:03:39,625
Now like a soldier.
Chest out.

693
01:03:39,792 --> 01:03:42,042
And give a salute, like this.

694
01:03:42,208 --> 01:03:44,125
Now you can gallop.

695
01:03:51,208 --> 01:03:53,375
Sit down, dear.
I'll fetch your husband.

696
01:03:53,542 --> 01:03:55,875
It's fine. I'll do it.

697
01:03:56,667 --> 01:03:57,792
Good morning!

698
01:03:58,333 --> 01:03:59,875
Mummy, look at me.

699
01:04:00,042 --> 01:04:01,542
Come and try this.

700
01:04:01,708 --> 01:04:02,958
Breakfast!

701
01:04:03,583 --> 01:04:05,542
- Go and see.
- Run, like a solider!

702
01:04:06,792 --> 01:04:08,542
A breakfast fit for a king.

703
01:04:20,542 --> 01:04:21,875
There you go!

704
01:04:23,750 --> 01:04:25,292
Why are you all dressed up?

705
01:04:25,792 --> 01:04:28,167
There's a funeral
for the<i> Carlana's</i> father.

706
01:04:29,125 --> 01:04:30,125
He's dead?

707
01:04:30,292 --> 01:04:31,625
Yes.

708
01:04:32,042 --> 01:04:34,083
A terrible accident.

709
01:04:34,375 --> 01:04:35,375
At the front?

710
01:04:35,417 --> 01:04:36,417
No!

711
01:04:36,458 --> 01:04:40,125
He was on leave and his hut
burnt down with him inside.

712
01:04:41,542 --> 01:04:43,458
Don't let your milk get cold.

713
01:05:19,417 --> 01:05:20,500
- Hello.
- Good morning.

714
01:05:38,625 --> 01:05:40,917
Mummy, look,
it's uncle Juli milk.

715
01:05:41,083 --> 01:05:42,667
Put that back.

716
01:05:43,792 --> 01:05:45,292
What are you doing here?

717
01:05:45,792 --> 01:05:48,125
- Looking for Juli.
- Me too.

718
01:05:48,292 --> 01:05:49,583
He's meant to be on duty.

719
01:05:49,750 --> 01:05:51,792
This soldier
had to stand in for him.

720
01:05:51,958 --> 01:05:54,125
He's not here.
Tell the captain.

721
01:05:54,292 --> 01:05:56,625
- He already knows.
- Tell him again!

722
01:05:57,208 --> 01:05:59,500
Does he often disappear like this?

723
01:05:59,667 --> 01:06:02,333
No. You know Juli,
he gets restless.

724
01:06:02,500 --> 01:06:04,333
But I told him we were coming.

725
01:06:04,500 --> 01:06:06,042
Seems he doesn't care.

726
01:06:06,208 --> 01:06:09,125
Lluís, did he steal
that food he brought us?

727
01:06:09,292 --> 01:06:12,625
Of course.
He has no respect for anything.

728
01:06:12,792 --> 01:06:16,250
If it wasn't for him...
Where do you think he is?

729
01:06:16,417 --> 01:06:17,542
I don't care.

730
01:06:18,250 --> 01:06:20,292
You don't care
if he's dead or alive?

731
01:06:20,458 --> 01:06:21,667
No, I don't.

732
01:06:22,042 --> 01:06:24,125
And neither should you.

733
01:06:47,958 --> 01:06:49,208
Who's that?

734
01:06:49,875 --> 01:06:50,958
The<i> Carlana.</i>

735
01:06:51,167 --> 01:06:52,958
The Lady of the Manor.

736
01:06:53,125 --> 01:06:54,625
Go inside the chapel.

737
01:07:08,375 --> 01:07:10,542
- My condolences.
- Thank you.

738
01:07:10,708 --> 01:07:13,458
It's nice to see you
with your family.

739
01:07:13,625 --> 01:07:15,458
My wife and my son.

740
01:07:15,833 --> 01:07:17,625
Hello. My name's Trini.

741
01:07:19,292 --> 01:07:20,792
I'm Olivella.

742
01:07:20,958 --> 01:07:23,042
And this is our son Ramonet.

743
01:07:24,958 --> 01:07:26,333
What a beautiful boy.

744
01:07:27,125 --> 01:07:28,792
You have lovely hair.

745
01:07:28,958 --> 01:07:30,542
Thank you, ma'am.

746
01:07:34,958 --> 01:07:37,083
I can't keep them waiting.

747
01:07:37,250 --> 01:07:40,417
Nice to meet you.
Let's get this over with.

748
01:07:42,792 --> 01:07:45,875
Such an elegant woman.
Don't you think, Lluís?

749
01:07:48,750 --> 01:07:51,250
And such sadness in her eyes.

750
01:09:00,667 --> 01:09:03,167
María, put my mourning clothes away

751
01:09:03,333 --> 01:09:05,875
- and starch my coloured suits.
- Yes, ma'am.

752
01:09:06,042 --> 01:09:08,125
And send in Fermín. Hurry.

753
01:09:19,583 --> 01:09:20,583
Olivella.

754
01:09:27,958 --> 01:09:30,292
Take this
to the mayor of Olivel.

755
01:09:30,458 --> 01:09:32,208
It's a safe-conduct
for Christmas Eve.

756
01:09:32,375 --> 01:09:35,167
How do I get to the other side?

757
01:09:35,750 --> 01:09:39,583
Tell the soldiers
you have a message for the mayor.

758
01:09:39,750 --> 01:09:42,375
They'll recognise my car.

759
01:09:59,667 --> 01:10:01,542
Do you mind if I pray with you?

760
01:10:01,708 --> 01:10:05,208
Of course not.
We can keep each other company.

761
01:10:43,208 --> 01:10:47,250
All the women here feel
those daggers in their hearts.

762
01:10:47,417 --> 01:10:49,500
Women here and women everywhere.

763
01:10:49,667 --> 01:10:51,042
It's no kind of life.

764
01:10:58,750 --> 01:11:00,042
Praying for your nephew?

765
01:11:01,375 --> 01:11:04,542
Every day, I pray
for the Virgin to protect him.

766
01:11:05,333 --> 01:11:07,875
Who are you praying for?

767
01:11:08,792 --> 01:11:10,708
For someone I love very much.

768
01:11:10,875 --> 01:11:12,458
Did he give you that stone?

769
01:11:12,625 --> 01:11:16,792
It's not a stone, it's a jewel.

770
01:11:19,042 --> 01:11:21,292
From Master Lluís?

771
01:11:25,167 --> 01:11:27,583
Let's have a little drink.

772
01:11:30,208 --> 01:11:31,750
We all pray to that virgin.

773
01:11:31,917 --> 01:11:34,875
Patron saint of marital
and family strife.

774
01:11:35,042 --> 01:11:36,042
Have a seat.

775
01:11:36,375 --> 01:11:38,667
The real one
is in the<i> Carlana's</i> castle,

776
01:11:38,833 --> 01:11:40,750
but she keeps it locked away.

777
01:11:41,333 --> 01:11:43,250
People don't seem to like her.

778
01:11:43,417 --> 01:11:45,250
She doesn't get on with anyone.

779
01:11:45,417 --> 01:11:47,625
She was very polite
with my husband.

780
01:11:47,792 --> 01:11:50,792
Because Master Lluís
looks after her horse.

781
01:11:52,917 --> 01:11:53,917
The horse is hers?

782
01:11:54,083 --> 01:11:56,542
Of course,
like everything around here.

783
01:11:56,708 --> 01:11:58,375
Why did she give it to my husband?

784
01:11:58,542 --> 01:12:02,292
I don't know.
You'll have to ask him.

785
01:12:15,375 --> 01:12:16,375
At ease!

786
01:12:18,625 --> 01:12:19,333
At ease.

787
01:12:19,500 --> 01:12:21,500
And lose this queer scarf!

788
01:12:21,667 --> 01:12:23,417
Honour your uniform.

789
01:12:23,583 --> 01:12:25,708
Our blood will build
a new fatherland.

790
01:12:26,042 --> 01:12:27,208
Yes, sir!

791
01:12:28,833 --> 01:12:30,958
- You see all that snow?
- Yes.

792
01:12:31,125 --> 01:12:33,125
Look.
Where are they going?

793
01:12:33,333 --> 01:12:34,167
I don't know.

794
01:12:34,333 --> 01:12:35,958
To Africa, because they're cold.

795
01:12:36,167 --> 01:12:37,417
Is it cold?

796
01:12:37,583 --> 01:12:39,792
So cold it burns.

797
01:12:40,208 --> 01:12:42,458
Shut that
before we catch pneumonia.

798
01:12:42,625 --> 01:12:45,042
Come on,
or Mum will tell us off.

799
01:12:45,458 --> 01:12:46,750
Good lad!

800
01:12:48,875 --> 01:12:50,208
Just like a soldier.

801
01:12:50,375 --> 01:12:51,583
I need a poo.

802
01:12:52,167 --> 01:12:54,917
Go on then.
You're a big boy now.

803
01:12:58,292 --> 01:13:00,583
You suddenly seem much older.

804
01:13:02,792 --> 01:13:05,542
I'm so happy
to have you both here.

805
01:13:07,458 --> 01:13:09,917
- Guess what he wants for Christmas.
- What?

806
01:13:10,083 --> 01:13:12,083
A horse, like yours.

807
01:13:12,250 --> 01:13:14,083
We'll buy him three.

808
01:13:14,250 --> 01:13:17,292
Yeah, right!
We can't even afford a toy one.

809
01:13:17,792 --> 01:13:19,167
I know how to get one.

810
01:13:23,833 --> 01:13:27,292
By the way, how did you get
such a nice horse?

811
01:13:28,792 --> 01:13:30,333
Picó gave it to me.

812
01:13:30,500 --> 01:13:33,167
The last one in the regiment.

813
01:13:33,333 --> 01:13:35,083
You were lucky to get it.

814
01:13:36,750 --> 01:13:38,083
Yes, very lucky.

815
01:13:38,250 --> 01:13:40,917
- Mummy, I've finished.
- I'll go.

816
01:15:06,125 --> 01:15:07,208
Merry Christmas.

817
01:15:07,833 --> 01:15:09,667
Come in!

818
01:16:00,958 --> 01:16:02,542
I propose a toast.

819
01:16:02,708 --> 01:16:04,750
Here's to our wives,

820
01:16:04,917 --> 01:16:09,083
who, thanks to the Captain,
are with us for this special night.

821
01:16:09,250 --> 01:16:11,083
Yes. To our wives!

822
01:16:11,958 --> 01:16:15,708
I don't know how we've survived
without them.

823
01:16:15,875 --> 01:16:18,958
But don't think
the women here have forgotten us.

824
01:16:19,333 --> 01:16:24,625
Cigars from the Lady of the Manor.
For the officers.

825
01:16:25,583 --> 01:16:27,958
And this is especially for you.

826
01:16:28,167 --> 01:16:30,417
I don't know what it is.

827
01:16:31,042 --> 01:16:33,042
A sack of spuds.

828
01:16:34,583 --> 01:16:36,583
What nice boots.

829
01:16:36,958 --> 01:16:40,458
First the horse,
and now the boots.

830
01:16:40,625 --> 01:16:44,583
She must think our lieutenant
has delicate feet.

831
01:16:44,958 --> 01:16:48,750
And I have a gift for you.

832
01:16:48,917 --> 01:16:51,042
Doctor! Is it a book?

833
01:16:51,208 --> 01:16:54,375
The guy is
cuckolded by the third page!

834
01:16:55,375 --> 01:16:56,875
"The Horns of Roland."

835
01:16:57,042 --> 01:17:01,125
No long descriptions of scenery,
just women who are always ready.

836
01:17:01,292 --> 01:17:02,958
Who did you get this from?

837
01:17:03,167 --> 01:17:06,333
- Who do you think? Soleràs.
- That bastard?

838
01:17:06,500 --> 01:17:09,708
He might be a bastard,
but he's still funny.

839
01:17:09,875 --> 01:17:11,458
Yes, he is.

840
01:17:11,625 --> 01:17:15,625
An officer deserting
in the middle of the night.

841
01:17:15,792 --> 01:17:17,833
Do you think your friend is funny?

842
01:17:18,542 --> 01:17:19,708
He's not my friend.

843
01:17:20,083 --> 01:17:22,625
I'm glad you've finally realised.

844
01:17:22,792 --> 01:17:24,375
He's a coward.

845
01:17:24,542 --> 01:17:27,042
He should be court-martialled.

846
01:17:27,208 --> 01:17:29,542
But I can't deny he was clever.

847
01:17:29,708 --> 01:17:34,208
I remember the day that
English politician came up here

848
01:17:34,375 --> 01:17:38,083
and started criticizing everything...

849
01:17:38,250 --> 01:17:41,208
- What's the matter?
- I've got a sore throat.

850
01:17:44,250 --> 01:17:45,917
Is something wrong?

851
01:17:46,458 --> 01:17:48,625
I think the boy has a chill.

852
01:17:50,500 --> 01:17:54,208
- You're not taking him home.
- No? Then you take him!

853
01:17:55,958 --> 01:17:57,583
Sorry, I don't feel well.

854
01:17:57,750 --> 01:17:59,042
What have you done now?

855
01:18:00,417 --> 01:18:01,833
Go easy on her.

856
01:18:03,208 --> 01:18:04,042
What's got into you?

857
01:18:04,208 --> 01:18:07,292
They're all talking about Juli.
He could be dead!

858
01:18:07,458 --> 01:18:08,958
That's enough!

859
01:18:09,750 --> 01:18:12,500
He's alive.
And doing as he pleases.

860
01:18:12,667 --> 01:18:14,292
- You've seen him?
- Yes.

861
01:18:14,708 --> 01:18:16,458
- Where?
- On the other side.

862
01:18:16,625 --> 01:18:17,625
Prisoner?

863
01:18:19,083 --> 01:18:20,083
No.

864
01:18:20,250 --> 01:18:23,792
In a Fascist uniform
and aiming at us, Trini.

865
01:18:23,958 --> 01:18:26,167
That irresponsible liar
is now a traitor.

866
01:18:26,333 --> 01:18:28,250
I don't believe you.

867
01:18:28,417 --> 01:18:30,333
It's the truth about your friend.

868
01:18:30,500 --> 01:18:33,542
Why should I believe you,
when you've lied to me?

869
01:18:33,708 --> 01:18:35,292
- You know all about lying.
- What?

870
01:18:35,458 --> 01:18:36,625
You've betrayed me.

871
01:18:36,792 --> 01:18:39,125
It's the<i> Carlana's</i> horse.
You're her lover.

872
01:18:39,292 --> 01:18:41,875
- What?
- The whole village knows!

873
01:18:42,042 --> 01:18:43,208
It's so humiliating.

874
01:18:43,375 --> 01:18:45,917
Don't touch me!
Never touch me again!

875
01:18:46,083 --> 01:18:46,750
Trini.

876
01:18:46,917 --> 01:18:50,250
I knew you couldn't love me
like I loved you,

877
01:18:50,417 --> 01:18:53,958
but I never thought
you'd become a fraud and a cynic.

878
01:18:54,125 --> 01:18:56,500
Nothing happened.
She rejected me.

879
01:18:56,667 --> 01:18:58,458
So you couldn't even enjoy it?

880
01:18:58,625 --> 01:19:00,417
That's not what I meant.

881
01:19:00,583 --> 01:19:02,542
Please, let me fix this.

882
01:19:03,500 --> 01:19:06,083
Let's get married
and forget all this.

883
01:19:06,750 --> 01:19:08,083
You're asking me now?

884
01:19:08,750 --> 01:19:10,750
Just to clear your conscience?

885
01:19:10,917 --> 01:19:14,500
No, I want to start over.
Like a real family, Trini.

886
01:19:14,667 --> 01:19:18,292
You're Ramonet's father,
and you always will be,

887
01:19:18,458 --> 01:19:20,958
but don't expect us to be a family.

888
01:19:21,333 --> 01:19:23,708
- Trini, I know...
- You don't know anything!

889
01:19:23,875 --> 01:19:25,292
You know what hurts most?

890
01:19:25,458 --> 01:19:27,667
How you've treated your friend.

891
01:19:27,833 --> 01:19:30,417
The only person who really loved me,

892
01:19:30,583 --> 01:19:35,500
the only one who wanted to know me
and who cared about what I needed.

893
01:19:36,042 --> 01:19:38,583
Go and have fun
with that bunch of drunks.

894
01:19:38,750 --> 01:19:40,833
Ramonet and I won't bother you.

895
01:19:40,958 --> 01:19:43,167
I'm taking him
back to Barcelona tomorrow.

896
01:20:00,708 --> 01:20:01,958
Dear Lord,

897
01:20:02,250 --> 01:20:05,917
thank you for allowing us
to celebrate another Christmas

898
01:20:06,917 --> 01:20:09,292
and for protecting us
from so much death.

899
01:20:10,083 --> 01:20:11,750
And thank you

900
01:20:11,917 --> 01:20:14,958
for allowing us friendships
and alliances

901
01:20:15,125 --> 01:20:17,667
in the middle of this cruel war.

902
01:20:17,833 --> 01:20:21,458
And we ask you to protect
these children, who are our future.

903
01:20:21,833 --> 01:20:22,833
Amen.

904
01:20:28,292 --> 01:20:30,125
I hope you like the dinner.

905
01:20:30,292 --> 01:20:33,250
Fascist crockery
and a Republican menu.

906
01:20:33,417 --> 01:20:35,167
Very appropriate, My Lady.

907
01:20:35,625 --> 01:20:39,625
I'm glad you could be with us
on such a special night.

908
01:20:40,417 --> 01:20:43,208
It's a sad time for me,
as a widow.

909
01:20:43,375 --> 01:20:46,250
And trapped inside enemy territory.

910
01:20:46,417 --> 01:20:50,083
We must stick together in hard times.
Right, Federico?

911
01:20:50,250 --> 01:20:51,250
But of course.

912
01:20:51,625 --> 01:20:54,625
Despite all we have suffered,
our strength

913
01:20:54,792 --> 01:20:57,833
- will bring us victory.
- God willing, Mr Mayor.

914
01:20:57,958 --> 01:21:00,125
He's on our side too.

915
01:21:00,292 --> 01:21:02,708
And that's good enough for me.

916
01:21:02,875 --> 01:21:06,667
I hope order is restored soon
so our villages can be reunited.

917
01:21:06,833 --> 01:21:10,458
We can't divide that which
was united by God and nature.

918
01:21:10,875 --> 01:21:12,958
I couldn't agree more.

919
01:21:13,333 --> 01:21:14,958
When this awful war is over,

920
01:21:15,167 --> 01:21:17,958
I'll do all I can
to share my wealth.

921
01:21:18,500 --> 01:21:20,583
My lands are on both sides,

922
01:21:20,750 --> 01:21:22,917
and although there's a river
in between,

923
01:21:23,083 --> 01:21:26,833
there is no need
to turn our backs on each other.

924
01:21:30,417 --> 01:21:33,500
Here's to a bright future, My Lady.

925
01:22:18,125 --> 01:22:19,333
Juli!

926
01:22:22,417 --> 01:22:24,042
I missed you so much.

927
01:22:24,208 --> 01:22:25,250
Get on.

928
01:22:49,333 --> 01:22:50,333
Get off.

929
01:23:02,792 --> 01:23:04,125
What's this?

930
01:23:04,583 --> 01:23:05,583
I don't understand.

931
01:23:06,042 --> 01:23:07,417
Don't judge me.

932
01:23:07,583 --> 01:23:10,667
Right now, I can't judge you.
But why?

933
01:23:11,958 --> 01:23:14,250
I thought I was already dead,

934
01:23:14,875 --> 01:23:17,458
but I wasn't brave enough to die.

935
01:23:18,417 --> 01:23:19,500
I feel I failed you.

936
01:23:19,667 --> 01:23:21,625
You've never failed me.

937
01:23:21,958 --> 01:23:25,792
- An advantage of being fickle.
- You never were with me.

938
01:23:26,458 --> 01:23:30,875
When I look at you,
I see myself reflected in your eyes.

939
01:23:31,167 --> 01:23:34,625
The Trini I want to be,
not the one other people want.

940
01:23:43,417 --> 01:23:44,500
What are you doing?

941
01:23:45,833 --> 01:23:46,958
Come.

942
01:23:47,333 --> 01:23:49,583
I want to show you the sky.

943
01:23:51,708 --> 01:23:54,208
The stars teach us a lot.

944
01:23:58,833 --> 01:24:00,167
It's beautiful.

945
01:24:01,417 --> 01:24:03,917
You see those two masses?

946
01:24:04,917 --> 01:24:07,167
Some stars shining

947
01:24:07,833 --> 01:24:10,708
and dark shadows around them.

948
01:24:10,875 --> 01:24:13,083
That's like thirst and water.

949
01:24:16,667 --> 01:24:18,167
Right next to each other,

950
01:24:18,792 --> 01:24:20,875
without ever becoming one.

951
01:24:24,167 --> 01:24:27,667
If they did it would make
the most glorious planet.

952
01:24:28,875 --> 01:24:31,333
Do you know
what it would be called?

953
01:24:32,417 --> 01:24:33,083
No.

954
01:24:33,250 --> 01:24:35,250
Planet Solerasus.

955
01:24:37,083 --> 01:24:39,542
Waiting thousands of years

956
01:24:39,708 --> 01:24:43,292
for its moment of glory,
and then dying.

957
01:24:43,458 --> 01:24:45,583
In geology, a century
is like the blink of an eye.

958
01:24:45,750 --> 01:24:48,250
But we have just one instant,

959
01:24:48,792 --> 01:24:50,542
a single flash

960
01:24:51,458 --> 01:24:53,083
of such uncertain glory.

961
01:24:55,875 --> 01:24:57,125
I came to get you.

962
01:24:59,875 --> 01:25:01,375
I can't.

963
01:25:03,125 --> 01:25:04,958
I've nothing left.

964
01:25:05,417 --> 01:25:07,958
You'd hate me
for what I can't give you,

965
01:25:08,167 --> 01:25:10,583
like I hate Lluís now.

966
01:25:10,750 --> 01:25:12,958
- Don't talk about Lluís.
- I can't.

967
01:25:13,417 --> 01:25:14,833
He humiliated me.

968
01:25:15,125 --> 01:25:19,375
He stopped respecting me,
but I can't stop loving him.

969
01:25:20,833 --> 01:25:23,167
Lluís might be weak,

970
01:25:23,417 --> 01:25:26,750
but he'll always take care
of you and Ramonet.

971
01:25:27,958 --> 01:25:29,958
So what do I do now?

972
01:25:31,167 --> 01:25:34,167
Remember this moment.
It's perfect.

973
01:25:35,708 --> 01:25:36,833
The moon,

974
01:25:37,958 --> 01:25:39,417
the stars,

975
01:25:41,250 --> 01:25:42,625
and your smile.

976
01:25:52,708 --> 01:25:54,292
Your smile.

977
01:26:01,208 --> 01:26:02,792
I'll never take it off.

978
01:26:10,292 --> 01:26:11,292
Juli.

979
01:26:12,917 --> 01:26:14,625
I had it analyzed.

980
01:26:15,458 --> 01:26:16,458
And?

981
01:26:17,958 --> 01:26:19,375
It's like you.

982
01:26:19,875 --> 01:26:21,542
From another planet.

983
01:26:27,792 --> 01:26:28,625
Where were you?

984
01:26:28,792 --> 01:26:30,875
I don't have to
explain myself to you.

985
01:26:31,042 --> 01:26:33,500
Trini, not now.
Our son is sick.

986
01:26:35,417 --> 01:26:36,667
What's wrong with him?

987
01:26:37,583 --> 01:26:38,750
I don't know.

988
01:26:41,625 --> 01:26:43,792
He's boiling. Call the doctor.

989
01:26:43,958 --> 01:26:46,542
- He'll be drunk.
- Give him coffee!

990
01:26:59,375 --> 01:27:02,208
Thank you for a wonderful dinner.

991
01:27:02,958 --> 01:27:05,500
- Thank you for coming.
- Goodnight.

992
01:27:17,250 --> 01:27:20,167
- Thank you.
- Thanks for coming. Goodnight.

993
01:27:31,750 --> 01:27:33,750
Fermín, close the gates.

994
01:28:02,958 --> 01:28:06,958
I figure you don't mind guests,
whichever side they come from.

995
01:28:07,125 --> 01:28:08,875
I've always had foresight.

996
01:28:09,375 --> 01:28:11,750
We can't leave
our destiny to chance.

997
01:28:11,917 --> 01:28:13,708
I totally agree.

998
01:28:15,750 --> 01:28:16,833
More rum?

999
01:28:16,958 --> 01:28:18,458
Yes, thank you.

1000
01:28:19,042 --> 01:28:21,542
I didn't expect this warm welcome.

1001
01:28:22,875 --> 01:28:24,708
You caught me in a good mood.

1002
01:28:27,333 --> 01:28:29,625
That uniform suits you better.

1003
01:28:31,417 --> 01:28:34,417
It seems these colours
also suit you.

1004
01:28:35,958 --> 01:28:38,417
The sun always rises
in the same place.

1005
01:28:38,583 --> 01:28:41,208
And we must turn towards it

1006
01:28:41,375 --> 01:28:43,292
if we want to stay alive.

1007
01:28:43,667 --> 01:28:45,417
Just like sunflowers.

1008
01:28:49,583 --> 01:28:51,417
We've always got on.

1009
01:28:52,333 --> 01:28:55,958
That's what I thought.
Until I realised you were using me.

1010
01:28:56,125 --> 01:28:59,083
- Juli, we all use people.
- No, not all of us.

1011
01:29:00,458 --> 01:29:03,417
Anyway,
you didn't do what I asked,

1012
01:29:03,583 --> 01:29:05,958
- so we're even.
- You're wrong.

1013
01:29:06,167 --> 01:29:07,583
You owe me.

1014
01:29:07,875 --> 01:29:08,958
What do I owe you?

1015
01:29:10,500 --> 01:29:11,958
Some compensation.

1016
01:29:13,083 --> 01:29:14,083
For what?

1017
01:29:16,042 --> 01:29:19,458
For having destroyed the honour
of the most decent man I know,

1018
01:29:20,333 --> 01:29:24,000
and for condemning a woman
to the worst humiliation of all.

1019
01:29:25,583 --> 01:29:26,667
What are you talking about?

1020
01:29:26,833 --> 01:29:29,167
A false marriage certificate.

1021
01:29:29,333 --> 01:29:30,333
Is it money you want?

1022
01:29:31,958 --> 01:29:34,458
No, I don't want your money.

1023
01:29:35,208 --> 01:29:36,958
Then why are you here?

1024
01:29:39,750 --> 01:29:40,917
I want you to undress.

1025
01:29:43,208 --> 01:29:45,625
- You must be joking.
- Not at all.

1026
01:29:47,958 --> 01:29:51,667
I want to see
what a spider woman looks like.

1027
01:29:52,542 --> 01:29:55,625
You think I'm going to
undress for you?

1028
01:29:56,333 --> 01:29:58,167
We're on the same side now.

1029
01:29:58,958 --> 01:30:00,250
I could talk.

1030
01:30:00,750 --> 01:30:01,958
You know I'm good at it.

1031
01:30:02,125 --> 01:30:03,708
Or you could be shot.

1032
01:30:04,250 --> 01:30:05,958
Yes, maybe.

1033
01:30:06,625 --> 01:30:10,292
Nobody would believe
a deserter and a drunk.

1034
01:30:10,625 --> 01:30:14,708
I could spread the rumour
and sow the doubt.

1035
01:30:15,083 --> 01:30:18,333
We both know that
to destroy a woman's reputation,

1036
01:30:18,500 --> 01:30:22,250
it doesn't matter
if it's gossip or gospel truth.

1037
01:30:22,958 --> 01:30:26,625
- I'll destroy you first.
- Please try.

1038
01:30:28,167 --> 01:30:30,000
I'm prepared to take the risk.

1039
01:30:31,958 --> 01:30:33,125
I've nothing to lose.

1040
01:30:34,792 --> 01:30:37,750
But you can't really say the same.

1041
01:30:39,750 --> 01:30:43,292
So you want to humiliate me

1042
01:30:43,667 --> 01:30:46,500
to make up for
another woman's humiliation

1043
01:30:46,750 --> 01:30:49,125
and to restore
your friend's honour?

1044
01:30:49,625 --> 01:30:53,500
- You think this will make it better?
- Not for them.

1045
01:30:53,708 --> 01:30:54,792
But for me.

1046
01:30:56,708 --> 01:30:57,958
What do you want?

1047
01:30:58,167 --> 01:30:59,417
I told you.

1048
01:30:59,583 --> 01:31:01,667
I want to see
what I imagine is there.

1049
01:31:02,667 --> 01:31:04,750
The saggy tits

1050
01:31:04,917 --> 01:31:08,833
of a woman who seems young,
but whose flesh is old.

1051
01:31:09,250 --> 01:31:12,792
Cagorcio's daughter,
"the dirty pig".

1052
01:31:15,083 --> 01:31:17,375
That's what I want to see.

1053
01:31:20,458 --> 01:31:21,958
I'd rather die.

1054
01:31:33,375 --> 01:31:34,708
You won't do it.

1055
01:31:34,875 --> 01:31:36,333
Try me.

1056
01:32:11,917 --> 01:32:12,917
And the rest.

1057
01:32:34,958 --> 01:32:37,458
How old was I
when my father did this?

1058
01:32:41,250 --> 01:32:42,417
Four.

1059
01:32:44,625 --> 01:32:45,875
And this?

1060
01:32:46,708 --> 01:32:47,708
Seventeen.

1061
01:32:47,875 --> 01:32:50,292
I stopped counting
all the ones in between.

1062
01:32:50,667 --> 01:32:55,333
You're not the first to treat me
like I wasn't a person.

1063
01:33:00,833 --> 01:33:04,083
Now you know
what a spider woman looks like.

1064
01:33:04,625 --> 01:33:06,875
Does it make you feel better?

1065
01:33:17,125 --> 01:33:20,125
Open wide.
Stick your tongue out.

1066
01:33:20,750 --> 01:33:21,958
Say "aah"...

1067
01:33:23,583 --> 01:33:25,250
The boy will be fine.

1068
01:33:25,417 --> 01:33:27,917
It's an infection of the tonsils.

1069
01:33:28,083 --> 01:33:28,792
It can't be.

1070
01:33:28,958 --> 01:33:30,667
It causes a high fever.

1071
01:33:30,833 --> 01:33:32,625
He had them out last year.

1072
01:33:32,792 --> 01:33:36,292
- Are you sure?
- Of course I am. I'm his mother.

1073
01:33:43,167 --> 01:33:45,292
Then it's not good news.

1074
01:33:45,458 --> 01:33:46,458
What do you mean?

1075
01:33:46,542 --> 01:33:49,167
It must be diphtheria.

1076
01:33:49,333 --> 01:33:50,958
But children die from that.

1077
01:33:51,167 --> 01:33:55,833
Not normally. With an antiserum,
he'd recover in a few days.

1078
01:33:55,958 --> 01:33:58,708
But we don't have any
in our pharmacy.

1079
01:33:58,875 --> 01:34:00,083
Are you sure?

1080
01:34:00,250 --> 01:34:04,042
I might be drunk,
but I know what's in our pharmacy.

1081
01:34:04,208 --> 01:34:05,625
So what can we do?

1082
01:34:08,083 --> 01:34:11,375
The Saint Paul hospital
in Barcelona might have some.

1083
01:34:11,542 --> 01:34:13,625
I'll ask the Captain to let me go.

1084
01:34:17,417 --> 01:34:18,625
Listen.

1085
01:34:18,792 --> 01:34:22,042
Go now.
The boy only has a few days.

1086
01:34:22,208 --> 01:34:25,708
Ask for Dr. Vega.
Tell him I sent you.

1087
01:34:25,875 --> 01:34:26,917
Thank you.

1088
01:34:49,750 --> 01:34:51,917
I'm looking for Dr. Vega.

1089
01:34:52,083 --> 01:34:54,583
Paediatrics is the third floor.

1090
01:35:43,250 --> 01:35:44,417
Doctor Vega?

1091
01:35:44,583 --> 01:35:46,250
Yes, that's me.

1092
01:35:46,750 --> 01:35:48,792
Doctor Puig sent me,
from the front.

1093
01:35:48,958 --> 01:35:52,958
My son has diphtheria
and we have no antiserum.

1094
01:35:53,125 --> 01:35:54,958
Could you give me some?

1095
01:35:55,125 --> 01:35:56,917
I wish I could,

1096
01:35:57,083 --> 01:35:59,542
but we ran out a week ago.

1097
01:36:00,250 --> 01:36:03,708
Every day, I lose
half a dozen like this.

1098
01:36:03,875 --> 01:36:06,667
What about the other hospitals?

1099
01:36:06,833 --> 01:36:08,667
Unfortunately not.

1100
01:36:08,833 --> 01:36:12,042
The Fascists
aren't letting anything through.

1101
01:36:12,208 --> 01:36:13,708
I'm sorry.

1102
01:36:21,958 --> 01:36:23,833
Open your mouth.

1103
01:36:23,958 --> 01:36:24,958
That's it.

1104
01:36:25,125 --> 01:36:26,417
Swallow.

1105
01:36:28,708 --> 01:36:30,292
He can't even drink.

1106
01:36:30,583 --> 01:36:32,667
The fever isn't going down.

1107
01:36:32,958 --> 01:36:34,375
He's dying.

1108
01:36:34,917 --> 01:36:36,833
My boy is dying.

1109
01:36:44,750 --> 01:36:47,583
Trini, we've had a telegram
from Lluís.

1110
01:36:47,750 --> 01:36:49,917
There's no antiserum
in the Republican zone.

1111
01:36:50,083 --> 01:36:51,708
The Fascists have it all.

1112
01:36:51,875 --> 01:36:55,083
He says not to worry,
he'll find it somehow.

1113
01:36:56,708 --> 01:36:58,542
He won't find any.

1114
01:37:00,792 --> 01:37:02,542
He won't find any.

1115
01:37:02,917 --> 01:37:06,167
Please, God, don't take my boy.

1116
01:37:07,958 --> 01:37:10,833
Don't take him from me.

1117
01:37:14,208 --> 01:37:16,875
Please, God.

1118
01:37:20,750 --> 01:37:23,917
Listen, Trini.
Why don't you ask the<i> Carlana?</i>

1119
01:37:26,083 --> 01:37:27,417
The<i> Carlana?</i>

1120
01:37:27,583 --> 01:37:28,250
Why?

1121
01:37:28,417 --> 01:37:31,542
Because she gets on well
with both sides.

1122
01:37:32,792 --> 01:37:34,292
And what could she do?

1123
01:37:34,458 --> 01:37:37,500
She knows all the landlords
on the other side.

1124
01:37:38,667 --> 01:37:41,542
Will you go?
I can't see that woman.

1125
01:37:42,958 --> 01:37:44,583
Of course you can.

1126
01:37:45,583 --> 01:37:46,958
And you will.

1127
01:38:15,458 --> 01:38:17,333
I'd like to see her ladyship.

1128
01:38:17,500 --> 01:38:19,417
Let her in, María.

1129
01:38:23,958 --> 01:38:25,500
Is something wrong?

1130
01:38:26,042 --> 01:38:29,292
I need to ask a favour.
It's for my son.

1131
01:38:29,625 --> 01:38:31,292
What's wrong with him?

1132
01:38:31,458 --> 01:38:32,625
He has diphtheria.

1133
01:38:32,792 --> 01:38:35,583
Without an antiserum,
he'll die in a few days.

1134
01:38:35,750 --> 01:38:37,167
I'm so sorry.

1135
01:38:40,500 --> 01:38:44,250
I know you don't want to talk
to me, but I want to help.

1136
01:38:46,458 --> 01:38:47,542
What can I do?

1137
01:38:48,208 --> 01:38:50,375
There's no antiserum
on this side,

1138
01:38:50,542 --> 01:38:52,500
but you know people
on the other side.

1139
01:38:53,708 --> 01:38:55,375
Does your husband
know you're here?

1140
01:38:55,542 --> 01:38:57,792
No, I came on my own.

1141
01:38:59,250 --> 01:39:00,625
Tell him to come and see me.

1142
01:39:07,375 --> 01:39:09,458
Wait here.
Switch off the lights.

1143
01:39:18,750 --> 01:39:19,417
Halt!

1144
01:39:19,583 --> 01:39:21,333
Please, don't shoot.

1145
01:39:21,500 --> 01:39:24,833
Call Soleràs, he's with you lot.

1146
01:39:25,625 --> 01:39:27,833
- Say his friend Lluís is here.
- Why should I?

1147
01:39:36,042 --> 01:39:37,042
Wait here.

1148
01:39:51,792 --> 01:39:52,792
What do you want?

1149
01:39:55,042 --> 01:39:57,292
- It's Ramonet.
- What about Ramonet?

1150
01:39:58,042 --> 01:39:59,083
He has diphtheria.

1151
01:39:59,250 --> 01:40:00,250
What?

1152
01:40:00,333 --> 01:40:02,167
He doesn't have long.

1153
01:40:02,625 --> 01:40:04,833
We don't have any antiserum.

1154
01:40:05,250 --> 01:40:07,875
- I thought maybe you...
- Me?

1155
01:40:08,375 --> 01:40:11,042
What can I do?
We have nothing either.

1156
01:40:15,917 --> 01:40:18,750
But I'll check
with the other regiments.

1157
01:40:19,500 --> 01:40:21,958
Don't worry, Lluís. I'll find it.

1158
01:40:23,083 --> 01:40:24,542
I hope so.

1159
01:40:26,917 --> 01:40:30,375
Meet me tomorrow night
at the old convent.

1160
01:40:31,750 --> 01:40:32,958
Thank you.

1161
01:40:35,083 --> 01:40:36,167
And Trini?

1162
01:40:38,125 --> 01:40:39,125
How is she?

1163
01:40:39,833 --> 01:40:41,667
You can imagine.

1164
01:40:45,708 --> 01:40:47,042
Thanks.

1165
01:40:55,167 --> 01:40:56,167
Trini.

1166
01:40:56,875 --> 01:40:59,042
- How is he?
- Lluís,

1167
01:40:59,208 --> 01:41:00,542
thank God you're back.

1168
01:41:02,458 --> 01:41:03,583
How did it go?

1169
01:41:04,250 --> 01:41:05,750
I'll find out tonight.

1170
01:41:05,917 --> 01:41:07,083
Is it certain?

1171
01:41:07,250 --> 01:41:08,625
No, Trini.

1172
01:41:08,792 --> 01:41:10,750
Then go to see the<i> Carlana.</i>

1173
01:41:11,375 --> 01:41:13,875
The<i> Carlana?</i> Why?

1174
01:41:14,042 --> 01:41:16,208
She'll get it, if you ask her.

1175
01:41:16,750 --> 01:41:17,750
Did you go to her?

1176
01:41:17,833 --> 01:41:20,583
Go, Lluís.
Don't waste more time.

1177
01:41:34,250 --> 01:41:36,667
María, take the boys to their room.

1178
01:41:38,375 --> 01:41:40,125
Have them wash their faces.

1179
01:41:40,750 --> 01:41:41,833
You stay, Fermín.

1180
01:41:44,250 --> 01:41:45,958
My wife told me to come.

1181
01:41:47,250 --> 01:41:48,333
Hello, Lluís.

1182
01:41:51,625 --> 01:41:53,208
Come close to the fire.

1183
01:41:55,542 --> 01:41:56,542
Have a seat.

1184
01:42:05,083 --> 01:42:09,042
I once told you I would
be prepared to help your son.

1185
01:42:09,583 --> 01:42:11,958
I stand by what I said.

1186
01:42:13,583 --> 01:42:16,958
I'll get you the antiserum,
on one condition.

1187
01:42:18,458 --> 01:42:19,458
What's that?

1188
01:42:21,208 --> 01:42:22,583
That you kill Soleràs.

1189
01:42:23,625 --> 01:42:24,750
What?

1190
01:42:26,292 --> 01:42:27,292
You heard me.

1191
01:42:28,250 --> 01:42:29,250
Why?

1192
01:42:30,542 --> 01:42:31,958
Because he's dangerous.

1193
01:42:32,958 --> 01:42:34,750
Don't ask me to do that.

1194
01:42:34,958 --> 01:42:37,083
Soleràs is like a brother to me.

1195
01:42:37,250 --> 01:42:39,792
Soleràs is just a soldier
for the other side.

1196
01:42:40,333 --> 01:42:42,667
- We're at war.
- Give me the bloody antiserum!

1197
01:42:42,833 --> 01:42:44,833
My son is dying!

1198
01:42:47,667 --> 01:42:50,500
That's the deal.

1199
01:42:51,708 --> 01:42:55,375
If you want to save your son,
you know what to do.

1200
01:43:01,250 --> 01:43:02,667
I've never killed anyone.

1201
01:43:03,583 --> 01:43:04,917
It's never too late.

1202
01:43:09,042 --> 01:43:10,458
Don't I get an answer?

1203
01:43:32,208 --> 01:43:34,125
I'm sorry, Lluís.

1204
01:43:34,542 --> 01:43:36,042
I couldn't get anything.

1205
01:43:44,667 --> 01:43:45,750
What will you do?

1206
01:43:47,833 --> 01:43:51,250
- I've taken steps to get some.
- What steps?

1207
01:43:57,292 --> 01:43:58,792
The<i> Carlana</i> will give it to me.

1208
01:43:59,375 --> 01:44:00,875
The<i> Carlana?</i>

1209
01:44:01,625 --> 01:44:03,542
In exchange for what?

1210
01:44:04,083 --> 01:44:06,667
She doesn't give anything
away for free.

1211
01:44:09,625 --> 01:44:10,875
Lluís.

1212
01:44:31,458 --> 01:44:34,958
The important thing
is that Ramonet will live.

1213
01:44:35,583 --> 01:44:37,833
- He has to live.
- And he will.

1214
01:44:38,167 --> 01:44:40,292
His life is worth more
than either of ours.

1215
01:44:40,458 --> 01:44:41,625
Much more.

1216
01:44:42,875 --> 01:44:47,042
Juli, I want you to know
that despite our differences,

1217
01:44:47,208 --> 01:44:49,542
I've always thought of you
as family.

1218
01:44:50,417 --> 01:44:53,250
All families have a black sheep.

1219
01:44:56,917 --> 01:44:58,417
No, it's OK.

1220
01:45:03,042 --> 01:45:04,292
Relax.

1221
01:45:12,333 --> 01:45:14,125
Stain it with my blood.

1222
01:45:16,500 --> 01:45:18,125
Go, Juli.

1223
01:45:19,125 --> 01:45:20,125
Go.

1224
01:45:21,417 --> 01:45:23,667
Don't feel guilty, Lluís.

1225
01:45:24,125 --> 01:45:26,083
You're doing me a favour.

1226
01:45:27,083 --> 01:45:30,417
It's what I've always wanted:
To die.

1227
01:45:31,125 --> 01:45:32,917
And this way, at least,

1228
01:45:33,083 --> 01:45:35,500
my death will achieve something.

1229
01:45:35,750 --> 01:45:39,833
Just promise you'll look after them,
and never leave them.

1230
01:45:40,458 --> 01:45:41,458
I promise.

1231
01:45:43,875 --> 01:45:46,958
I don't want to be buried
with the winners.

1232
01:45:48,625 --> 01:45:52,458
A war can only end well if it's lost.

1233
01:46:01,042 --> 01:46:02,125
Go on.

1234
01:46:02,792 --> 01:46:03,792
I'm ready.

1235
01:46:49,833 --> 01:46:52,333
Let's kill each other
like good brothers.

1236
01:47:49,167 --> 01:47:50,167
Where's the antiserum?

1237
01:47:50,250 --> 01:47:52,583
I just gave it to your wife.

1238
01:47:53,167 --> 01:47:54,750
I knew you'd do it.

1239
01:48:34,375 --> 01:48:36,333
He seems to be getting better.

1240
01:48:45,833 --> 01:48:47,917
When the<i> Carlana</i> came here,

1241
01:48:48,208 --> 01:48:50,958
it felt like
the world made no sense.

1242
01:48:52,083 --> 01:48:55,458
It's absurd that the same woman
who hurt us so much

1243
01:48:55,625 --> 01:48:58,125
could have saved our son's life.

1244
01:49:00,083 --> 01:49:02,583
The main thing is Ramonet is alive.

1245
01:49:03,958 --> 01:49:05,167
He is.

1246
01:49:06,667 --> 01:49:08,417
What about us, Lluís?

1247
01:49:32,875 --> 01:49:34,042
They're shooting.

1248
01:49:34,792 --> 01:49:36,625
Quickly, AGUSTÍN.

1249
01:49:37,250 --> 01:49:39,083
It's all right.

1250
01:49:51,583 --> 01:49:52,875
Get into bed.

1251
01:49:56,542 --> 01:49:58,292
Go on, AGUSTÍN.

1252
01:50:15,500 --> 01:50:17,250
Everything's all right.

1253
01:50:17,417 --> 01:50:18,833
Go to sleep.

1254
01:50:19,958 --> 01:50:21,167
Go to sleep.

1255
01:50:28,792 --> 01:50:33,500
<i>They say that when the moon</i>

1256
01:50:35,250 --> 01:50:39,958
<i>shines in the sky,</i>

1257
01:50:41,500 --> 01:50:46,833
<i>the sun has gone away,</i>

1258
01:50:48,250 --> 01:50:53,417
<i>because it's very sleepy.</i>

1259
01:50:54,917 --> 01:50:59,500
<i>Slowly, slowly,</i>

1260
01:51:01,250 --> 01:51:06,208
<i>close your eyes,</i>

1261
01:51:06,708 --> 01:51:10,958
<i>because you, my little girl,
are the sun</i>

1262
01:51:12,958 --> 01:51:17,917
<i>that I love the most.</i>

1263
01:51:18,875 --> 01:51:24,833
<i>And the moon peeps through</i>

1264
01:51:26,333 --> 01:51:32,708
<i>into the bedroom</i>

1265
01:51:33,958 --> 01:51:41,167
<i>and tells you to go to sleep</i>

1266
01:51:41,792 --> 01:51:47,750
<i>and not to be afraid.</i>

1267
01:51:47,917 --> 01:51:50,958
<i>And in your sleep you play,</i>

1268
01:51:51,167 --> 01:51:55,542
<i>you play with the stars</i>

1269
01:51:55,708 --> 01:52:03,500
<i>and fill the sky with joy.</i>

1270
01:52:03,667 --> 01:52:07,125
<i>Sleep, my child.</i>

1271
01:52:07,292 --> 01:52:11,208
<i>Sleep, my child.</i>

1272
01:52:11,375 --> 01:52:15,125
<i>Your mother tenderly</i>

1273
01:52:15,292 --> 01:52:18,750
<i>rocks and caress you.</i>

1274
01:52:18,917 --> 01:52:22,875
<i>Your mother tenderly</i>

1275
01:52:23,042 --> 01:52:26,583
<i>rocks you</i>

1276
01:52:34,125 --> 01:52:40,125
<i>in the bedroom.</i>

1277
01:52:49,542 --> 01:52:55,750
<i>Don't be afraid.</i>
