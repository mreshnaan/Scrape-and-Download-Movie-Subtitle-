1
00:00:13,013 --> 00:00:14,753
Jackpot. Bust it up, dog.

2
00:00:14,797 --> 00:00:16,712
No, no, no. Not right now, yo.

3
00:00:17,191 --> 00:00:18,757
I think it's the cops.

4
00:00:18,801 --> 00:00:20,387
Come on, stop being scared
and bust the window out, man.

5
00:00:20,411 --> 00:00:21,282
I'm not being scared, man.

6
00:00:21,325 --> 00:00:22,761
This is what we came here for!

7
00:00:22,805 --> 00:00:23,675
Bust them out!
- I'm just saying it's going be to...

8
00:00:23,719 --> 00:00:24,676
Shh. Somebody's coming.

9
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:26,417
We'll handle this later.

10
00:00:31,031 --> 00:00:33,424
Hey, Elizabeth, it's me.

11
00:00:34,338 --> 00:00:35,557
Ahh!

12
00:00:36,601 --> 00:00:39,213
That's going to leave
a mark in the morning.

13
00:00:44,740 --> 00:00:47,003
You go, check his
wallet, check his wallet.

14
00:00:47,351 --> 00:00:48,546
Where's the money at, big boy?

15
00:00:48,570 --> 00:00:50,746
Here we go. Here we go.

16
00:00:51,181 --> 00:00:53,401
Yo, yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah.

17
00:00:53,444 --> 00:00:55,011
What else you got for me?

18
00:00:55,055 --> 00:00:55,968
What else you got for, huh?
There's a couple hundred, boy.

19
00:00:56,012 --> 00:00:56,578
Oh yeah.

20
00:00:56,621 --> 00:00:57,274
Yeah.

21
00:00:57,318 --> 00:00:58,449
I'm seeing flash.

22
00:00:58,493 --> 00:01:00,451
I'm seeing some flash.

23
00:01:00,495 --> 00:01:02,375
Shit!
- You know what I can get for this, huh?

24
00:01:02,410 --> 00:01:03,498
Thanks, big dog.

25
00:01:10,461 --> 00:01:12,507
Do you know what happened?

26
00:01:12,550 --> 00:01:14,552
I'm not sure.

27
00:01:14,813 --> 00:01:16,554
Oh, my head.

28
00:01:16,598 --> 00:01:19,079
Can't imagine
that feels too good.

29
00:01:19,644 --> 00:01:21,298
Mister...

30
00:01:22,343 --> 00:01:25,433
- White.
- Jackson White.

31
00:01:28,088 --> 00:01:31,091
Mister White,
you seem like a decent guy.

32
00:01:31,352 --> 00:01:34,833
Can you tell me why you're
face down in an alley?

33
00:01:38,533 --> 00:01:39,795
Just...

34
00:01:39,838 --> 00:01:43,190
This isn't how I thought
my life would turn out.

35
00:01:44,582 --> 00:01:47,585
But do you ever feel like you're
not the man you want to be?

36
00:01:47,629 --> 00:01:50,588
You know, I wanted to do
something that mattered.

37
00:01:50,632 --> 00:01:51,763
I want more.

38
00:01:51,807 --> 00:01:53,635
Can we focus on tonight?

39
00:01:53,678 --> 00:01:55,593
October 27th.

40
00:01:55,637 --> 00:01:57,117
It's my birthday.

41
00:01:57,682 --> 00:01:59,858
My 30th birthday.

42
00:01:59,902 --> 00:02:01,469
You were drinking?

43
00:02:01,773 --> 00:02:03,819
Yeah, there was a party.

44
00:02:09,390 --> 00:02:10,434
My client...

45
00:02:10,478 --> 00:02:11,653
What, what do you do?

46
00:02:11,696 --> 00:02:13,263
I'm a music manager.

47
00:02:13,307 --> 00:02:14,699
Hmm.

48
00:02:26,146 --> 00:02:30,106
He sang a song about my fiance.

49
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:32,195
How can we contact her?

50
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:34,371
Why do you keep doing this?

51
00:02:34,415 --> 00:02:35,720
What do you mean?

52
00:02:36,634 --> 00:02:40,986
My ex fiance.

53
00:02:41,422 --> 00:02:42,292
Liz!

54
00:02:42,336 --> 00:02:44,555
I screwed it up.

55
00:02:56,524 --> 00:02:57,612
Did you have any arguments?

56
00:02:57,655 --> 00:03:00,484
Anything out of the
ordinary happen?

57
00:03:01,181 --> 00:03:02,878
Not really.

58
00:03:03,531 --> 00:03:06,098
Why did you sit
down with Gammons?

59
00:03:07,056 --> 00:03:08,405
L.A.'s a small town, James.

60
00:03:08,449 --> 00:03:11,060
Dude, I don't want to
talk about this tonight.

61
00:03:18,894 --> 00:03:21,026
I left early.

62
00:03:21,418 --> 00:03:23,246
What happened at the party?

63
00:03:23,290 --> 00:03:25,205
Is there something
you're not telling me?

64
00:03:25,248 --> 00:03:26,597
Just talk to me about it.

65
00:03:26,641 --> 00:03:28,314
I feel like he's got
a lot of big clients.

66
00:03:28,338 --> 00:03:29,513
He can do something.

67
00:03:29,557 --> 00:03:31,167
His company has a
lot of big clients.

68
00:03:31,211 --> 00:03:33,300
He's a promotion away
from answering phones

69
00:03:33,343 --> 00:03:35,693
and making fucking coffee.

70
00:03:35,737 --> 00:03:39,175
My biggest client James,

71
00:03:39,654 --> 00:03:41,743
I think he's going to
sign with another manager.

72
00:03:44,180 --> 00:03:44,963
Just remember I was your client

73
00:03:45,007 --> 00:03:46,574
before I was your friend.

74
00:03:47,314 --> 00:03:50,621
Jackie boy,
it's your gray haired daddy.

75
00:03:50,665 --> 00:03:55,147
I wanted to call you earlier
but, well, happy birthday.

76
00:03:55,191 --> 00:03:56,627
I miss you, buddy.

77
00:03:56,671 --> 00:03:58,281
It's
Elizabeth. Leave a message.

78
00:03:58,325 --> 00:04:01,545
Hey, Elizabeth.
It's me, Jackson.

79
00:04:03,330 --> 00:04:05,288
I haven't spoken
to you in a while.

80
00:04:05,332 --> 00:04:10,337
Um, call me if, if you a, if...

81
00:04:24,829 --> 00:04:26,440
That's the
last thing I remember.

82
00:04:26,483 --> 00:04:29,007
- Go home.
- We'll be in touch.

83
00:05:04,739 --> 00:05:06,001
Jackson White's office.

84
00:05:06,044 --> 00:05:07,394
It's me.

85
00:05:07,437 --> 00:05:08,588
Dennis wants
to see you first thing.

86
00:05:08,612 --> 00:05:09,831
Where are you?

87
00:05:09,874 --> 00:05:11,461
I'm going to work
out of the house today.

88
00:05:11,485 --> 00:05:13,487
Jesus. You've
got three meetings and a lunch.

89
00:05:13,530 --> 00:05:14,749
Reschedule them.

90
00:05:14,792 --> 00:05:15,793
What do I tell Dennis?

91
00:05:15,837 --> 00:05:17,229
Uh, car trouble.

92
00:05:17,273 --> 00:05:18,685
Look, we need to find something
for James immediately.

93
00:05:18,709 --> 00:05:19,797
I mean, right now.

94
00:05:19,841 --> 00:05:20,798
Find out who's looking
for opening acts

95
00:05:20,842 --> 00:05:22,583
and put it in an email asap.

96
00:05:22,626 --> 00:05:24,062
People we know or everybody.

97
00:05:24,106 --> 00:05:25,890
Everybody,
Stefanie. Everybody.

98
00:05:25,934 --> 00:05:28,066
He's moving more units
in the Pacific Northwest.

99
00:05:28,110 --> 00:05:29,285
He's getting more airplay.

100
00:05:29,329 --> 00:05:31,548
I mean, this guy is
the next John Mayer.

101
00:05:31,592 --> 00:05:33,376
It's the same act.

102
00:05:33,420 --> 00:05:34,725
Another girl with a guitar!

103
00:05:34,769 --> 00:05:36,248
Crisis control.
It's what I do, man.

104
00:05:36,292 --> 00:05:37,511
It's what I do.

105
00:05:37,554 --> 00:05:38,792
It's what separates
the men from the boys.

106
00:05:38,816 --> 00:05:39,837
I pushed them into Thursday.

107
00:05:39,861 --> 00:05:41,471
Friday you have a
9:30 staff meeting.

108
00:05:41,515 --> 00:05:42,907
Lunch with the
head of the T Recs,

109
00:05:42,951 --> 00:05:44,624
you need to stop by the War
Presidents' video shoot.

110
00:05:44,648 --> 00:05:46,128
When do I sleep?

111
00:05:48,652 --> 00:05:50,437
Oh shit, I'd got to get this.

112
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:51,525
It's a Carolina number.

113
00:05:51,568 --> 00:05:53,135
Uh, I'll talk to you tomorrow.

114
00:05:53,178 --> 00:05:54,354
Good work today.

115
00:05:54,397 --> 00:05:55,790
Say hi to your dad for me.

116
00:05:55,833 --> 00:05:56,833
Yeah, will do.

117
00:05:58,358 --> 00:05:59,924
What do you want?

118
00:06:00,664 --> 00:06:01,622
Who?

119
00:06:01,665 --> 00:06:03,145
Oh, Foster!

120
00:06:03,450 --> 00:06:06,278
Hey, man, I haven't
spoken to you in a while.

121
00:06:09,325 --> 00:06:11,109
Wait. Wait. Wait.

122
00:06:16,332 --> 00:06:17,899
Cancer.

123
00:07:02,422 --> 00:07:03,423
Sir?

124
00:07:03,466 --> 00:07:04,902
Sir, excuse me.

125
00:07:04,946 --> 00:07:07,688
I don't want to wake
you up, but we're here.

126
00:07:27,316 --> 00:07:29,187
Oh, come on.

127
00:07:31,625 --> 00:07:33,148
This is great.

128
00:07:39,633 --> 00:07:40,808
Hello?

129
00:07:41,678 --> 00:07:43,724
You forgot a bag.

130
00:07:44,551 --> 00:07:46,291
Anyone back there?

131
00:07:49,991 --> 00:07:51,340
Sir, I'm sorry.

132
00:07:51,383 --> 00:07:53,013
We don't have you listed
in our passenger manifest

133
00:07:53,037 --> 00:07:54,996
for Flight 319.

134
00:07:55,039 --> 00:07:56,432
One second.

135
00:07:56,867 --> 00:07:57,694
How is that possible?

136
00:07:57,738 --> 00:07:58,434
How do you think I got here?

137
00:07:58,478 --> 00:07:59,479
Do you think I walked?

138
00:07:59,522 --> 00:08:00,305
No.

139
00:08:00,349 --> 00:08:02,307
Astral projection maybe?

140
00:08:02,743 --> 00:08:03,831
Your name is White.

141
00:08:03,874 --> 00:08:05,615
Yes. Jackson White.

142
00:08:05,659 --> 00:08:07,922
My assistant made the
reservation last evening.

143
00:08:07,965 --> 00:08:11,012
And it's W-H-I-T?

144
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:14,102
I'll call you back.

145
00:08:17,845 --> 00:08:20,978
My ticket. My driver's license.

146
00:08:21,370 --> 00:08:23,415
My baggage ticket.

147
00:08:23,459 --> 00:08:24,852
Okay.

148
00:08:30,205 --> 00:08:31,380
That's odd, sir.

149
00:08:31,423 --> 00:08:33,687
We, we just don't have
you in our system.

150
00:08:36,907 --> 00:08:37,908
You know what?

151
00:08:37,952 --> 00:08:40,302
I don't like how
you guys operate.

152
00:08:41,564 --> 00:08:43,740
Have a good day, sir.

153
00:08:44,785 --> 00:08:46,134
They've lost my luggage.

154
00:08:46,177 --> 00:08:48,615
They've got Barney Fife
behind the desk. Find it.

155
00:08:48,658 --> 00:08:50,506
You wouldn't believe the
rental car they gave me.

156
00:08:50,530 --> 00:08:51,855
Yeah, I'll
call the airline first thing

157
00:08:51,879 --> 00:08:52,967
and I'll get back to you.

158
00:08:53,010 --> 00:08:54,534
First thing? Call them now.

159
00:08:54,577 --> 00:08:56,710
Okay. I'll call
them right now. I'm sorry.

160
00:09:13,553 --> 00:09:14,704
Listen, listen, you don't
need to tell me we're behind.

161
00:09:14,728 --> 00:09:16,077
I know.

162
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:17,968
Yeah, well I need copies
of concert gate receipts,

163
00:09:17,992 --> 00:09:19,776
their published songs
and other paperwork

164
00:09:19,820 --> 00:09:21,386
pertinent to the group's income.

165
00:09:21,430 --> 00:09:24,172
I also need you to find out
who produced their merchandise

166
00:09:24,215 --> 00:09:25,782
and if the cost for...

167
00:09:26,348 --> 00:09:27,871
No, no, who produced
their merchandise.

168
00:09:27,915 --> 00:09:29,457
And if the cost of
production was subtracted

169
00:09:29,481 --> 00:09:30,918
before profits were divvied up.

170
00:09:30,961 --> 00:09:33,224
Yeah, get back to me asap.

171
00:09:33,834 --> 00:09:36,053
Yeah, no, no cell
phones. I got it. I know.

172
00:09:36,097 --> 00:09:37,272
Uh, it's Chris White's room.

173
00:09:37,315 --> 00:09:39,187
You know where that is?

174
00:09:40,667 --> 00:09:42,190
319.

175
00:09:44,801 --> 00:09:46,150
Thanks.

176
00:10:17,747 --> 00:10:19,836
Hi.

177
00:10:21,621 --> 00:10:23,623
Welcome home.

178
00:10:43,947 --> 00:10:45,708
I'm not sure you're
supposed to be doing this.

179
00:10:45,732 --> 00:10:48,648
Well, I'm not supposed
to do a lot of things.

180
00:11:11,758 --> 00:11:13,542
I missed you, buddy.

181
00:11:14,325 --> 00:11:16,023
Missed you too.

182
00:11:16,371 --> 00:11:18,939
You didn't have to come.

183
00:11:20,767 --> 00:11:22,353
How long are they
going to keep you here?

184
00:11:22,377 --> 00:11:24,031
I go home tomorrow.

185
00:11:24,509 --> 00:11:25,423
Sure about that?

186
00:11:25,467 --> 00:11:26,773
Mm.

187
00:11:27,599 --> 00:11:28,992
What do you want?

188
00:11:29,340 --> 00:11:30,994
I was going to
crack the window.

189
00:11:31,038 --> 00:11:32,692
I got it.

190
00:11:46,227 --> 00:11:47,750
Oh, that's right,
you don't smoke.

191
00:11:47,794 --> 00:11:49,578
You shouldn't either.

192
00:11:49,883 --> 00:11:52,276
One thing has nothing
to do with the other.

193
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:54,931
Dad, come on.
We're in a hospital.

194
00:11:55,671 --> 00:11:57,020
Everyone else give me shit.

195
00:11:57,064 --> 00:11:58,805
I don't need it
from my kid, too.

196
00:11:58,848 --> 00:12:00,197
Apparently you do.

197
00:12:00,241 --> 00:12:02,852
Everybody else doesn't
want you to die.

198
00:12:02,896 --> 00:12:05,028
They say you've stopped eating.

199
00:12:05,376 --> 00:12:06,682
I'm not hungry, kiddo.

200
00:12:06,726 --> 00:12:09,119
And you're just gonna
light up whenever you...

201
00:12:26,876 --> 00:12:29,270
You hear about Dunbar?

202
00:12:33,187 --> 00:12:34,275
Tony Dunbar?

203
00:12:34,318 --> 00:12:36,930
Mm-hmm. Miami moved
up to draft him.

204
00:12:37,582 --> 00:12:41,238
Riley thinks he's the hardest
worker he's ever seen.

205
00:12:41,282 --> 00:12:41,891
Really.

206
00:12:41,935 --> 00:12:42,762
Mm-hmm.

207
00:12:42,805 --> 00:12:45,982
He got 32 in San Diego game.

208
00:12:46,374 --> 00:12:48,680
Baron Davis guarding him.

209
00:12:50,987 --> 00:12:52,206
What does he know?

210
00:12:52,249 --> 00:12:54,251
What? He's a good coach.

211
00:12:54,295 --> 00:12:55,992
He needs a haircut.

212
00:12:56,993 --> 00:12:58,255
He doesn't have any more hair

213
00:12:59,082 --> 00:13:00,301
to get cut.

214
00:13:10,137 --> 00:13:12,269
Jackson White.

215
00:13:19,581 --> 00:13:20,930
Hey.

216
00:13:21,670 --> 00:13:23,759
I'm really glad you called.

217
00:13:23,803 --> 00:13:24,978
Of course.

218
00:13:25,021 --> 00:13:27,197
It's no problem.

219
00:13:27,241 --> 00:13:28,982
This is real.

220
00:13:39,688 --> 00:13:41,864
Sorry, it's just
that I haven't spoken

221
00:13:41,908 --> 00:13:43,823
to anybody since I got here.

222
00:13:44,084 --> 00:13:46,564
It's okay. I'm glad you came.

223
00:13:46,608 --> 00:13:47,652
Yeah.

224
00:13:47,957 --> 00:13:49,611
So, you're his doctor?

225
00:13:49,916 --> 00:13:50,873
One of them.

226
00:13:50,917 --> 00:13:52,832
Surgical resident.

227
00:13:54,659 --> 00:13:56,574
How bad is it?

228
00:15:36,500 --> 00:15:39,112
You should be careful up there.

229
00:15:42,767 --> 00:15:45,248
I thought you
weren't going to come.

230
00:15:45,466 --> 00:15:47,337
Who are you?

231
00:16:09,969 --> 00:16:10,665
Let me give you a hand.

232
00:16:10,708 --> 00:16:12,972
Nah, it's all right.

233
00:16:18,673 --> 00:16:20,327
Bit of a mess.

234
00:16:20,631 --> 00:16:22,416
I haven't had people
over for a while.

235
00:16:22,459 --> 00:16:24,287
Don't be ridiculous.

236
00:16:55,318 --> 00:16:57,016
Have a snack.

237
00:16:57,059 --> 00:17:00,497
Someday soon this
will all be yours.

238
00:17:14,642 --> 00:17:17,166
Is the picture
always like that?

239
00:17:17,906 --> 00:17:19,647
What do you mean?

240
00:17:20,213 --> 00:17:22,041
Are you running the
cables through RCA's

241
00:17:22,084 --> 00:17:24,086
or an S Video cord?

242
00:17:24,434 --> 00:17:25,957
Huh?

243
00:17:27,263 --> 00:17:30,049
How old is this TV?

244
00:17:33,139 --> 00:17:34,227
Oh, Dad.

245
00:17:34,270 --> 00:17:35,595
No wonder it looks
like a snowstorm.

246
00:17:35,619 --> 00:17:37,665
You're using a coaxial cable.

247
00:17:38,100 --> 00:17:39,362
Looks fine to me.

248
00:17:39,406 --> 00:17:40,600
That's ¢cause you
don't know any better.

249
00:17:40,624 --> 00:17:42,365
You know what you need?

250
00:17:43,366 --> 00:17:44,237
What's that?

251
00:17:44,280 --> 00:17:45,803
High def.

252
00:17:47,109 --> 00:17:48,197
Yeah, baby.

253
00:17:48,241 --> 00:17:49,894
This remote is for
the television.

254
00:17:49,938 --> 00:17:52,549
You only need to turn the
power on, then forget it.

255
00:17:52,593 --> 00:17:54,247
This one is for the cable.

256
00:17:54,290 --> 00:17:56,597
It controls the DVD
and surround sound.

257
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:59,948
This is the main remote
you'll have to know.

258
00:18:00,644 --> 00:18:02,211
Okay.

259
00:18:02,255 --> 00:18:03,865
Okay.

260
00:18:05,214 --> 00:18:05,780
What are you...

261
00:18:05,823 --> 00:18:07,912
Dad, Dad, no.

262
00:18:09,218 --> 00:18:11,307
You didn't have to
do this, you know.

263
00:18:11,351 --> 00:18:14,005
It's the absolute
least I could do.

264
00:18:14,049 --> 00:18:16,051
All right, what
does this one do?

265
00:18:17,226 --> 00:18:18,445
You know, back in my day,

266
00:18:18,488 --> 00:18:19,509
you just hit a button...
You have no idea.

267
00:18:19,533 --> 00:18:21,535
You hit a button
and it comes on.

268
00:18:21,578 --> 00:18:23,102
Now why is this not working?

269
00:18:23,145 --> 00:18:24,929
It's not working.

270
00:18:27,062 --> 00:18:27,671
Batteries.

271
00:18:27,715 --> 00:18:28,237
That was your job.

272
00:18:28,281 --> 00:18:29,064
No...

273
00:18:29,108 --> 00:18:30,413
I told you, aisle four.

274
00:18:30,718 --> 00:18:31,912
It was the only
thing you had to do.

275
00:18:31,936 --> 00:18:33,349
Just walk up to the
set, hit a button.

276
00:18:33,373 --> 00:18:34,591
That's it.

277
00:18:40,728 --> 00:18:43,470
Isn't it time for my medication?

278
00:18:44,035 --> 00:18:46,429
You going to ask
every fifteen minutes?

279
00:18:47,213 --> 00:18:49,171
Only during the commercials.

280
00:18:49,215 --> 00:18:49,867
Nice.

281
00:18:49,911 --> 00:18:53,480
This guy.

282
00:19:06,362 --> 00:19:08,712
This wasn't the first time.

283
00:19:09,235 --> 00:19:11,193
The hospital, I mean.

284
00:19:12,368 --> 00:19:14,544
Foster told me.

285
00:19:16,285 --> 00:19:18,157
Why didn't you say anything?

286
00:19:18,722 --> 00:19:19,917
It would have sounded serious.

287
00:19:19,941 --> 00:19:22,073
I didn't want you to worry.

288
00:19:22,552 --> 00:19:25,164
You didn't want me to worry.

289
00:19:26,817 --> 00:19:29,211
Cancer is kind of a big deal.

290
00:19:29,559 --> 00:19:31,126
I'm fine.

291
00:19:31,344 --> 00:19:33,259
I just uh...

292
00:19:33,868 --> 00:19:35,217
You what?

293
00:19:35,609 --> 00:19:37,306
I don't want to fight.

294
00:19:37,350 --> 00:19:38,089
Fuck you!

295
00:19:38,133 --> 00:19:39,265
I want to fight.

296
00:19:39,308 --> 00:19:39,830
Jackson!

297
00:19:39,874 --> 00:19:41,267
No, no, no.

298
00:19:41,310 --> 00:19:43,747
Last night we're in the
hospital and I let it slide.

299
00:19:43,791 --> 00:19:45,227
But you lied to me.

300
00:19:45,271 --> 00:19:46,489
I could never lie to you.

301
00:19:46,533 --> 00:19:49,231
Every time we
talked it was a lie!

302
00:19:49,536 --> 00:19:52,147
Every time you didn't tell me!

303
00:19:56,195 --> 00:19:58,632
I thought we were
closer than this.

304
00:20:00,677 --> 00:20:02,157
We are!

305
00:20:09,817 --> 00:20:11,514
Ashville Democrat.

306
00:20:11,558 --> 00:20:13,603
Are you looking for
marketing opportunities?

307
00:20:13,647 --> 00:20:14,909
What are you doing?

308
00:20:14,952 --> 00:20:16,345
Homework.

309
00:20:17,868 --> 00:20:19,870
Can you do it
somewhere else please?

310
00:20:19,914 --> 00:20:21,132
Why?

311
00:20:21,394 --> 00:20:23,134
Because this is
my dad's office.

312
00:20:23,178 --> 00:20:25,049
This is his desk.
That's his chair.

313
00:20:25,093 --> 00:20:28,357
And that's his pencil
you're chewing on.

314
00:20:29,228 --> 00:20:30,751
The office is empty.

315
00:20:30,794 --> 00:20:34,189
Besides, the guy who
used to work here got...

316
00:20:36,844 --> 00:20:38,237
I'm sorry.

317
00:20:44,199 --> 00:20:46,636
You're turning my dad's
office into a study hall?

318
00:20:46,680 --> 00:20:48,986
Sorry, that's my son.

319
00:20:49,335 --> 00:20:53,077
We're all just so broken
up about your dad.

320
00:20:53,339 --> 00:20:56,211
Maybe he'd come for
a visit sometime.

321
00:20:57,256 --> 00:20:58,605
Maybe. I'll ask him.

322
00:20:58,648 --> 00:21:00,694
Well, I've got the Cobra
and life insurance forms

323
00:21:00,737 --> 00:21:03,131
if you'd like to look them over.

324
00:21:04,350 --> 00:21:05,481
Okay.

325
00:21:27,460 --> 00:21:29,331
Mister Sheldrake...

326
00:21:30,245 --> 00:21:33,292
Yeah, I know sir. I haven't
had a chance to get to him.

327
00:21:33,901 --> 00:21:36,947
Uh, no, no, I had
to reschedule that.

328
00:21:40,603 --> 00:21:43,302
Sir, I'm doing the best I can.

329
00:21:46,261 --> 00:21:49,177
Well, I hope I have a
job to come back to.

330
00:21:51,092 --> 00:21:52,243
Are you really
going to threaten me

331
00:21:52,267 --> 00:21:54,965
while I'm packing
up my dad's office?

332
00:21:59,666 --> 00:22:00,841
Fuck!

333
00:22:03,583 --> 00:22:06,281
Clearly this
isn't a good time.

334
00:22:07,413 --> 00:22:08,936
Sorry.

335
00:22:09,937 --> 00:22:11,504
Don't be sorry.

336
00:22:11,547 --> 00:22:13,201
I'm Kat.

337
00:22:14,637 --> 00:22:16,204
Jackson.

338
00:22:16,509 --> 00:22:17,597
From New York?

339
00:22:17,640 --> 00:22:19,686
L.A. but close enough.

340
00:22:21,818 --> 00:22:24,212
Is there something
I can help you with?

341
00:22:25,213 --> 00:22:26,475
Oh, I...

342
00:22:28,956 --> 00:22:32,481
I interned here this spring
and I heard about your...

343
00:22:33,264 --> 00:22:35,354
I heard and,

344
00:22:36,137 --> 00:22:38,357
I want you to give this to him.

345
00:22:41,751 --> 00:22:43,187
Thanks.

346
00:22:43,231 --> 00:22:45,364
I'll make sure he gets it.

347
00:22:50,586 --> 00:22:52,022
You want to get lunch?

348
00:22:52,066 --> 00:22:53,328
Uh, no. Thank you.

349
00:22:53,372 --> 00:22:54,764
You already eat?

350
00:22:54,808 --> 00:22:55,808
No.

351
00:22:56,070 --> 00:22:57,288
Well, you got to eat.

352
00:22:57,332 --> 00:22:58,507
That's true.

353
00:22:58,551 --> 00:22:59,552
But not with me?

354
00:22:59,595 --> 00:23:01,162
No, not with a
complete stranger.

355
00:23:01,205 --> 00:23:04,121
And not when my world
is falling apart.

356
00:23:04,383 --> 00:23:06,341
Your dad said you were a snob.

357
00:23:06,385 --> 00:23:08,038
Excuse me?

358
00:23:08,343 --> 00:23:09,910
Not in a bad way.

359
00:23:09,953 --> 00:23:12,347
Just the prodigal son
who leaves his hometown

360
00:23:12,391 --> 00:23:14,175
and doesn't look back.

361
00:23:22,313 --> 00:23:25,404
Hey! Need a hand with that?

362
00:23:25,665 --> 00:23:28,276
Familiar with
the term stalker?

363
00:23:28,798 --> 00:23:32,193
Yeah, men tend to
get attached to me.

364
00:23:32,498 --> 00:23:35,326
Well, why aren't you
bothering one of them?

365
00:23:36,458 --> 00:23:38,417
He talks about you.

366
00:23:39,156 --> 00:23:40,419
A lot.

367
00:23:43,596 --> 00:23:45,424
We'll be quick.

368
00:23:47,164 --> 00:23:48,905
I think I put that...

369
00:23:49,602 --> 00:23:50,603
Okay.

370
00:23:50,646 --> 00:23:52,343
It's amazing.
I like your song.

371
00:23:52,387 --> 00:23:55,216
You look and I, and
maybe I'll, I'll steer.

372
00:23:55,259 --> 00:23:56,739
- Very funny.
- Please.

373
00:23:56,783 --> 00:23:57,479
You got it?

374
00:23:57,523 --> 00:23:58,349
Yeah? Yeah?

375
00:23:58,393 --> 00:24:00,439
I got it. Thanks.

376
00:24:09,099 --> 00:24:09,926
Whoa!

377
00:24:09,970 --> 00:24:11,711
Enough with the emailing.

378
00:24:12,494 --> 00:24:13,887
I'm just gonna...

379
00:24:14,191 --> 00:24:15,758
It's Thursday.

380
00:24:15,802 --> 00:24:18,457
The music industry doesn't shut
down because you want sushi.

381
00:24:18,892 --> 00:24:19,893
Well, that's a crime.

382
00:24:19,936 --> 00:24:21,416
Now put it away.

383
00:24:21,460 --> 00:24:24,506
Just one more and I'll put
the Blackberry away. Okay?

384
00:24:24,550 --> 00:24:26,377
What? What are you doing?

385
00:24:26,421 --> 00:24:28,292
What? Wait!

386
00:24:29,468 --> 00:24:31,861
Kat! This is a street!

387
00:24:32,514 --> 00:24:33,689
I'm, I'm sorry.

388
00:24:33,733 --> 00:24:35,474
What are you doing?

389
00:24:38,433 --> 00:24:40,261
Where's the owner?

390
00:24:40,522 --> 00:24:41,305
I don't know.

391
00:24:41,349 --> 00:24:43,177
There's no tags.

392
00:24:45,048 --> 00:24:47,050
Then who do we call?

393
00:24:47,355 --> 00:24:49,139
He hurt his paw.

394
00:24:49,183 --> 00:24:51,272
We're taking him to the vet.

395
00:24:56,451 --> 00:24:57,451
All right.

396
00:25:04,241 --> 00:25:05,504
Asheville.

397
00:25:05,547 --> 00:25:07,331
Where good taste goes to die.

398
00:25:07,375 --> 00:25:08,289
I do not think that would fly

399
00:25:08,332 --> 00:25:10,204
with the Chamber of Commerce.

400
00:25:10,247 --> 00:25:12,356
You've always thought you
were better than anyone else.

401
00:25:12,380 --> 00:25:14,600
I don't think I'm
better than anybody.

402
00:25:15,035 --> 00:25:16,906
Well, maybe just a
little bit better.

403
00:25:18,038 --> 00:25:20,823
I can't believe they
can just lose a bag.

404
00:25:21,128 --> 00:25:24,435
What if I had something
irreplaceable in there?

405
00:25:25,393 --> 00:25:27,743
What would be irreplaceable?

406
00:25:29,005 --> 00:25:29,658
I don't know.

407
00:25:29,702 --> 00:25:30,877
Uh...

408
00:25:31,921 --> 00:25:33,793
I'm sorry. I
don't have a 32-33.

409
00:25:33,836 --> 00:25:34,944
I didn't even ask for black.

410
00:25:34,968 --> 00:25:36,317
What about the French cuffs?

411
00:25:36,360 --> 00:25:38,101
Let me check in the back.

412
00:25:38,145 --> 00:25:40,408
Should have gotten them
the first time.

413
00:25:40,930 --> 00:25:44,673
Did the airline lose your
manners with the luggage?

414
00:25:45,195 --> 00:25:46,893
I'm almost done.

415
00:25:46,936 --> 00:25:48,131
I can't believe that
nobody in this town

416
00:25:48,155 --> 00:25:50,070
sells True Religion.

417
00:25:50,592 --> 00:25:52,551
You sure I can't
get you anything?

418
00:25:52,594 --> 00:25:54,857
A new watch? A
haircut? Anything?

419
00:25:54,901 --> 00:25:56,511
Consider it an early
Christmas gift.

420
00:25:56,555 --> 00:25:58,731
Or a late one from last
year for that matter.

421
00:25:58,774 --> 00:25:59,862
Well, I'm Jewish, Dad.

422
00:25:59,906 --> 00:26:01,951
I can't keep up with the dates.

423
00:26:01,995 --> 00:26:04,127
It's December
25th. Every year.

424
00:26:04,171 --> 00:26:05,738
Isn't that confusing?

425
00:26:05,781 --> 00:26:09,132
With Yom Kippur and Passover
jumping all over the calendar?

426
00:26:09,916 --> 00:26:11,700
Does this look all
right from the back?

427
00:26:11,744 --> 00:26:13,397
You look a little
fat, but yeah.

428
00:26:13,441 --> 00:26:15,182
I don't really wear suits.

429
00:26:15,225 --> 00:26:16,226
Well, you should.

430
00:26:16,270 --> 00:26:17,619
You look good.

431
00:26:17,663 --> 00:26:18,968
Huh?

432
00:26:20,753 --> 00:26:21,449
So what do you think?

433
00:26:21,492 --> 00:26:23,277
The navy or the gray?

434
00:26:23,538 --> 00:26:25,671
Yeah. I like this one.

435
00:26:28,238 --> 00:26:30,318
Shouldn't we get something
a little more practical?

436
00:26:30,458 --> 00:26:33,809
We both know I'm only
going to wear this suit once.

437
00:26:36,899 --> 00:26:38,422
Yeah.

438
00:26:40,424 --> 00:26:42,296
It's going to
be the white suit.

439
00:26:47,388 --> 00:26:50,434
You said I could get
anything if I agreed to this.

440
00:26:50,478 --> 00:26:51,697
Anything at all.

441
00:26:51,740 --> 00:26:54,047
Then I want this
shirt as well.

442
00:26:54,395 --> 00:26:57,006
Oh, Dad, that's revolting.

443
00:27:02,098 --> 00:27:05,058
Does he got any
idea on this contract?

444
00:27:07,843 --> 00:27:09,932
This cracks me up.

445
00:27:12,326 --> 00:27:16,547
My snotnose little kid
is buying me a suit.

446
00:27:22,641 --> 00:27:23,990
What's that?

447
00:27:33,608 --> 00:27:34,914
What?

448
00:27:35,436 --> 00:27:36,611
What?

449
00:27:36,655 --> 00:27:37,481
You upset?

450
00:27:37,525 --> 00:27:39,483
No, no.

451
00:27:46,577 --> 00:27:48,405
It's okay, it's okay.

452
00:27:51,974 --> 00:27:53,454
Dad, I love you.

453
00:27:53,497 --> 00:27:54,934
Yeah.

454
00:27:56,152 --> 00:27:58,241
I love you so much.

455
00:27:59,721 --> 00:28:01,723
I promise, I swear to you
it's going to be okay.

456
00:28:01,767 --> 00:28:04,334
No. There's
nothing they can do.

457
00:28:06,685 --> 00:28:08,338
I'm dying.

458
00:28:08,687 --> 00:28:11,341
There's nothing they
can do about it.

459
00:28:16,564 --> 00:28:17,521
I'm so scared.

460
00:28:17,565 --> 00:28:19,219
Come here. Come here.

461
00:28:27,967 --> 00:28:29,316
So let me get this right.

462
00:28:29,359 --> 00:28:32,058
Your life's ambition is to
not become your parents?

463
00:28:32,101 --> 00:28:33,537
Totally.

464
00:28:33,842 --> 00:28:34,974
They think that human life

465
00:28:35,017 --> 00:28:37,890
is defined by its
consumer potential.

466
00:28:38,499 --> 00:28:40,631
Right. And what do you think?

467
00:28:43,156 --> 00:28:44,461
I don't know.

468
00:28:44,505 --> 00:28:47,464
But I want what I do
to mean something.

469
00:28:47,508 --> 00:28:49,945
I'm not sure that one
life can mean anything.

470
00:28:49,989 --> 00:28:52,556
One life can change the world.

471
00:28:53,732 --> 00:28:55,187
Wait until you're
in the real world.

472
00:28:55,211 --> 00:28:56,604
You'll see.

473
00:28:56,647 --> 00:28:58,388
What does that even mean?

474
00:28:58,432 --> 00:29:00,390
This isn't real?

475
00:29:01,261 --> 00:29:03,021
The real world is where
you're no longer driving

476
00:29:03,045 --> 00:29:06,440
Daddy's BMW and you have
ramen six days in a row

477
00:29:06,483 --> 00:29:09,443
because entry level job
roughly translates to

478
00:29:09,486 --> 00:29:11,445
"We can pay you as
little as we like."

479
00:29:11,488 --> 00:29:12,663
Your priorities shift.

480
00:29:12,707 --> 00:29:14,317
Not mine.

481
00:29:15,536 --> 00:29:17,712
Don't patronize me.

482
00:29:21,803 --> 00:29:23,457
I got this friend, right?

483
00:29:23,500 --> 00:29:26,373
He thinks his novel is
going to change the world.

484
00:29:26,808 --> 00:29:28,505
He's now 28 years old

485
00:29:28,549 --> 00:29:30,725
and he still works at
our childhood camp.

486
00:29:30,769 --> 00:29:32,422
What's your point?

487
00:29:32,683 --> 00:29:35,425
My point is, he spends
so much time dreaming

488
00:29:35,469 --> 00:29:37,776
that he's pissed his life away.

489
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:39,299
And we used to be so close.

490
00:29:39,342 --> 00:29:41,649
Now I don't even know
what to say to him.

491
00:29:41,692 --> 00:29:43,520
To a guy who still
lives for a fantasy

492
00:29:43,564 --> 00:29:45,871
that's never going to happen.

493
00:30:16,510 --> 00:30:17,816
Dad?

494
00:30:22,298 --> 00:30:23,734
Dad?

495
00:30:28,914 --> 00:30:31,046
Is it seven already?

496
00:30:31,742 --> 00:30:32,221
Yeah.

497
00:30:32,265 --> 00:30:33,657
Oh.

498
00:30:34,528 --> 00:30:35,311
Here, dad.

499
00:30:35,355 --> 00:30:36,878
Thanks, darling.

500
00:30:38,401 --> 00:30:40,012
Give me five minutes.

501
00:30:51,632 --> 00:30:53,242
Wow!

502
00:30:53,808 --> 00:30:57,638
This is just amazing.

503
00:30:59,509 --> 00:31:01,076
It's amazing.

504
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:03,339
You still like it
medium rare, right?

505
00:31:04,906 --> 00:31:07,430
I don't know what to say.

506
00:31:08,823 --> 00:31:11,260
I really appreciate this.

507
00:31:12,566 --> 00:31:13,741
But?

508
00:31:16,004 --> 00:31:18,441
I don't have an appetite.

509
00:31:19,703 --> 00:31:20,966
I'm sorry, Jack,

510
00:31:21,009 --> 00:31:22,682
if I'd known you'd gone
to all this trouble...

511
00:31:22,706 --> 00:31:23,533
It's okay.

512
00:31:23,577 --> 00:31:25,579
No, I mean it.

513
00:31:26,014 --> 00:31:27,668
This is great.

514
00:31:28,799 --> 00:31:31,628
They said they would like
to see you at the office.

515
00:31:33,543 --> 00:31:35,763
I don't want them
to see me like this.

516
00:31:36,677 --> 00:31:37,547
Dad, you're sick.

517
00:31:37,591 --> 00:31:39,332
It's nothing to be ashamed of.

518
00:31:39,680 --> 00:31:40,681
Mm.

519
00:31:42,901 --> 00:31:45,599
And one of the interns
wrote you a letter.

520
00:31:45,642 --> 00:31:46,730
Who?

521
00:31:47,209 --> 00:31:48,950
Her name is Kat.

522
00:31:49,298 --> 00:31:51,692
Katherine Morrison.

523
00:31:51,997 --> 00:31:53,781
I like her.

524
00:31:57,785 --> 00:31:58,699
Enjoy being home?

525
00:31:58,742 --> 00:32:00,135
Sure. You want another one?

526
00:32:00,179 --> 00:32:00,701
Yeah.

527
00:32:00,744 --> 00:32:02,311
I got it.

528
00:32:09,231 --> 00:32:11,930
What's on schedule
for tomorrow?

529
00:32:12,408 --> 00:32:14,628
I was going to
run by the camp.

530
00:32:14,671 --> 00:32:17,370
Ben's working there
full time now.

531
00:32:21,765 --> 00:32:23,419
That's about it.

532
00:32:32,515 --> 00:32:34,300
He wrote a book.

533
00:32:34,604 --> 00:32:35,736
Ben?

534
00:32:35,779 --> 00:32:37,390
Yeah.

535
00:32:39,827 --> 00:32:41,568
Is it any good?

536
00:32:42,047 --> 00:32:43,787
It's very good.

537
00:32:43,831 --> 00:32:45,441
It's very good.

538
00:32:47,052 --> 00:32:48,879
It's about me.

539
00:32:49,750 --> 00:32:51,621
How much of it?

540
00:32:53,623 --> 00:32:55,408
All of it.

541
00:32:58,237 --> 00:33:02,719
I didn't even realize until
about a hundred pages into it.

542
00:33:03,111 --> 00:33:06,854
It's about a politician
who loses his soul.

543
00:33:06,897 --> 00:33:07,986
He sells out his friends,

544
00:33:08,029 --> 00:33:10,989
constituency and
religion for power.

545
00:33:13,687 --> 00:33:15,906
Haven't spoken to him since?

546
00:33:17,212 --> 00:33:18,126
I was supposed to head down

547
00:33:18,170 --> 00:33:19,867
to the music festival in August.

548
00:33:19,910 --> 00:33:22,043
But that didn't happen.

549
00:33:22,826 --> 00:33:25,133
It's good you're
seeing him again.

550
00:33:29,355 --> 00:33:31,792
You can't leave things unsaid.

551
00:33:34,142 --> 00:33:36,014
What do I say?

552
00:34:21,581 --> 00:34:23,322
As a rule,

553
00:34:24,497 --> 00:34:29,502
the Jewish faith does not
address the afterlife.

554
00:34:30,024 --> 00:34:33,810
We are asked to
focus on the present.

555
00:34:33,854 --> 00:34:35,943
There's a reason the
Mourner's Kaddish

556
00:34:35,986 --> 00:34:37,379
doesn't mention death.

557
00:34:37,423 --> 00:34:40,730
It's a celebration of
the time we spent...

558
00:34:40,774 --> 00:34:41,775
Is she sleeping?

559
00:34:41,818 --> 00:34:43,124
Is she sleeping
or is she just...

560
00:34:43,168 --> 00:34:44,299
Is she thinking?

561
00:34:44,343 --> 00:34:46,519
She's very pensive.
Or is that sleep?

562
00:34:46,562 --> 00:34:47,520
Sleeping Beauty!

563
00:34:47,563 --> 00:34:49,783
Jordan! Wake up. Thank you.

564
00:34:49,826 --> 00:34:53,047
How could you, how could
you sleep through this?

565
00:34:53,091 --> 00:34:55,223
Okay, forget it.

566
00:34:55,267 --> 00:34:57,138
Girls, can we see
your art projects?

567
00:34:57,182 --> 00:34:58,574
I uh...

568
00:34:58,835 --> 00:35:01,838
I am a loser. Thank
you. Well done.

569
00:35:02,187 --> 00:35:03,188
Let's see...

570
00:35:03,231 --> 00:35:05,103
He must be stoned.

571
00:35:06,104 --> 00:35:07,627
Rachel?

572
00:35:08,410 --> 00:35:09,672
Earth to Rachel?

573
00:35:09,716 --> 00:35:10,673
Are you?

574
00:35:10,717 --> 00:35:13,111
Who's the guy in the back?

575
00:35:18,246 --> 00:35:20,988
Jackson White everybody.

576
00:35:21,031 --> 00:35:22,772
Yeah, uh...

577
00:35:23,208 --> 00:35:24,992
I'll come find you.

578
00:35:42,749 --> 00:35:45,621
You're, you're Ben's friend.

579
00:35:46,187 --> 00:35:47,536
Yeah.

580
00:35:49,495 --> 00:35:51,366
Are you going to bust us?

581
00:35:51,714 --> 00:35:53,499
I don't work here.

582
00:35:55,283 --> 00:35:57,633
No, I'm not going to bust you.

583
00:35:57,938 --> 00:35:59,983
You guys want to shoot a round?

584
00:36:00,680 --> 00:36:01,550
You want some of that?

585
00:36:01,594 --> 00:36:03,161
Oh!

586
00:36:03,552 --> 00:36:05,032
How do you know Ben?

587
00:36:05,075 --> 00:36:07,121
We went to camp together.

588
00:36:07,556 --> 00:36:08,731
What's your name?

589
00:36:08,775 --> 00:36:10,472
I'm Jackson White.

590
00:36:10,516 --> 00:36:11,343
Wait.

591
00:36:11,386 --> 00:36:13,693
Holy shit. You're a legend.

592
00:36:13,736 --> 00:36:14,911
No way.

593
00:36:14,955 --> 00:36:16,652
You're the Rocket?

594
00:36:16,696 --> 00:36:18,132
Well I suppose I was.

595
00:36:18,176 --> 00:36:19,568
I'm him.

596
00:36:20,090 --> 00:36:22,658
Dude, I heard
you dropped 40 points

597
00:36:22,702 --> 00:36:24,617
on Camp Barney one year.

598
00:36:24,660 --> 00:36:25,922
43.

599
00:36:27,402 --> 00:36:28,708
Hello. He's open.

600
00:36:28,751 --> 00:36:29,926
Uh-oh.

601
00:36:31,754 --> 00:36:34,192
He's open. He's open.

602
00:36:40,023 --> 00:36:41,199
You still got it.

603
00:36:41,242 --> 00:36:42,374
Still got it.

604
00:36:44,245 --> 00:36:46,813
So what brings you
to Hendersonville?

605
00:36:47,509 --> 00:36:49,119
Just visiting my dad.

606
00:36:49,163 --> 00:36:50,773
Everything all right?

607
00:36:51,470 --> 00:36:52,949
Yeah.

608
00:36:56,997 --> 00:36:58,912
How's Elizabeth?

609
00:36:59,391 --> 00:37:02,785
Or as we say behind her
back, the Japinator?

610
00:37:03,308 --> 00:37:06,659
Uh, you know, she's
as difficult as ever.

611
00:37:12,317 --> 00:37:13,927
Are you all right?

612
00:37:14,884 --> 00:37:18,845
Yeah. Yeah, I'm great.

613
00:37:22,588 --> 00:37:24,198
It's good to hear.

614
00:37:26,679 --> 00:37:28,681
Because you look like shit.

615
00:37:42,434 --> 00:37:43,609
Nine months out of the year

616
00:37:43,652 --> 00:37:46,307
I got this whole
place to myself.

617
00:37:47,439 --> 00:37:48,962
It's great.

618
00:37:49,005 --> 00:37:50,920
I read. I write.

619
00:37:51,399 --> 00:37:53,096
Sleep till noon.

620
00:37:55,142 --> 00:37:56,752
I'm up at six.

621
00:37:56,796 --> 00:37:57,449
On a good day.

622
00:37:57,492 --> 00:38:00,190
Ouch. Sorry.

623
00:38:00,539 --> 00:38:05,544
I'm hooking up with girls,
I'm way too old for.

624
00:38:06,022 --> 00:38:07,894
Does it ever get old?

625
00:38:07,937 --> 00:38:09,287
Not yet.

626
00:38:12,246 --> 00:38:15,771
Uh, no. I, I...

627
00:38:21,473 --> 00:38:24,780
Adulthood you know,
it's it's overrated.

628
00:38:25,085 --> 00:38:30,090
It's all uh, tuition and
erectile dysfunction.

629
00:38:39,055 --> 00:38:40,883
Adulthood's uh...

630
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:44,191
It's working out
for you, though?

631
00:38:44,496 --> 00:38:45,734
Well, you know I was thinking

632
00:38:45,758 --> 00:38:47,455
of becoming a camp counselor.

633
00:38:52,068 --> 00:38:54,636
You still thinking
about grad school?

634
00:38:56,246 --> 00:38:58,118
I'm thinking about it.

635
00:38:58,988 --> 00:39:01,208
Doing anything about it?

636
00:39:02,818 --> 00:39:04,864
I'm thinking about it.

637
00:39:13,873 --> 00:39:14,917
It's great.

638
00:39:14,961 --> 00:39:16,745
All right?

639
00:39:18,617 --> 00:39:21,184
I read your book and
I think it's great.

640
00:39:21,707 --> 00:39:23,926
I don't know how I
became Sammy Glick.

641
00:39:23,970 --> 00:39:26,320
Look, Jackson, man.

642
00:39:27,016 --> 00:39:29,105
I never meant to hurt you.

643
00:39:30,455 --> 00:39:33,066
Sometimes the
truth just hurts.

644
00:39:44,077 --> 00:39:46,035
Hey,
Ben, we need you at services.

645
00:39:46,079 --> 00:39:47,123
Shit.

646
00:39:49,865 --> 00:39:54,043
Uh, hey, sorry, I got to...

647
00:39:56,568 --> 00:39:57,786
Yes. Yes, yes.

648
00:39:57,830 --> 00:40:01,007
On my way, over and out. Yes.

649
00:40:03,009 --> 00:40:06,012
Well, I, I should
hit the road too.

650
00:40:06,447 --> 00:40:08,580
Yeah. I...

651
00:40:12,061 --> 00:40:14,542
The real world beckons.

652
00:40:18,677 --> 00:40:22,071
So, uh, we still friends?

653
00:40:24,422 --> 00:40:26,032
Always, brother.

654
00:40:26,075 --> 00:40:27,773
Always.

655
00:40:28,991 --> 00:40:30,210
Good.

656
00:40:43,223 --> 00:40:45,007
Be well.

657
00:40:47,967 --> 00:40:49,534
You too.

658
00:41:11,512 --> 00:41:15,342
315, 317, 323.

659
00:41:15,385 --> 00:41:17,518
Where the hell 319?

660
00:41:38,583 --> 00:41:40,193
Can I help you?

661
00:41:40,541 --> 00:41:41,542
I don't know.

662
00:41:41,934 --> 00:41:43,936
Is this 319 Cypress?

663
00:41:43,979 --> 00:41:45,372
Yeah.

664
00:41:46,765 --> 00:41:48,070
Is that you, Jackson?

665
00:41:48,114 --> 00:41:49,376
Uh...

666
00:41:49,419 --> 00:41:50,614
Sorry I didn't tell
you about my roommate.

667
00:41:50,638 --> 00:41:53,162
I just thought it
sounded so collegiate.

668
00:41:53,206 --> 00:41:55,121
Well, you're in college.

669
00:41:55,861 --> 00:41:59,168
Hey, oh, look at
your little paw.

670
00:41:59,995 --> 00:42:01,257
What's your name?

671
00:42:01,301 --> 00:42:02,084
Ophelia.

672
00:42:02,128 --> 00:42:03,825
Ophelia?

673
00:42:03,869 --> 00:42:05,871
Ophelia.

674
00:42:08,961 --> 00:42:11,050
I'm telling you, I have band.

675
00:42:11,093 --> 00:42:12,617
Do not leave my sight.

676
00:42:30,504 --> 00:42:31,331
Jackson.

677
00:42:31,374 --> 00:42:32,680
Alright.

678
00:42:33,028 --> 00:42:34,377
That's inside.

679
00:42:34,421 --> 00:42:34,987
Oh.

680
00:42:35,030 --> 00:42:36,162
Oh.

681
00:42:45,432 --> 00:42:47,086
Dance with me.

682
00:43:10,065 --> 00:43:11,850
Sorry about your mom.

683
00:43:14,635 --> 00:43:16,985
Dude, what the fuck?

684
00:43:17,290 --> 00:43:19,422
Come on, Jackson, Matt.

685
00:43:19,858 --> 00:43:21,599
Matty P.

686
00:43:21,947 --> 00:43:25,428
Six. I was the sixth
man for Reynolds in '95.

687
00:43:25,472 --> 00:43:27,909
Matthew Price. Holy shit.

688
00:43:27,953 --> 00:43:30,651
What, what, what's going on?

689
00:43:30,695 --> 00:43:32,740
Living out by the
Biltmore, I'm selling ins...

690
00:43:32,784 --> 00:43:34,655
What about you, man?

691
00:43:35,177 --> 00:43:37,615
I'm a manager for musicians.

692
00:43:38,398 --> 00:43:40,182
Fuck, dude.

693
00:43:40,226 --> 00:43:42,097
It's so fucking good to see you.

694
00:43:42,141 --> 00:43:42,837
Yeah.

695
00:43:42,881 --> 00:43:44,056
Yo, Trent! We got...

696
00:43:44,099 --> 00:43:47,146
We got the fuckin'
Rocket over here, dude!

697
00:43:47,189 --> 00:43:49,757
Give him a fuckin'
beer! Let's do it!

698
00:43:51,977 --> 00:43:53,108
You know what?

699
00:43:53,152 --> 00:43:54,719
This is great. My
friend's in a band.

700
00:43:54,762 --> 00:43:56,068
Wow, you're married?

701
00:43:56,111 --> 00:43:58,113
Separated actually.

702
00:43:58,157 --> 00:43:59,157
Um...

703
00:43:59,767 --> 00:44:01,595
Separated really.

704
00:44:02,030 --> 00:44:03,292
You're not married.

705
00:44:03,336 --> 00:44:05,294
Not with who you're
with tonight.

706
00:44:05,338 --> 00:44:07,645
Walking in here with Kat.

707
00:44:09,168 --> 00:44:11,083
You were always a pimp.

708
00:44:12,432 --> 00:44:13,694
She's legendary.

709
00:44:13,738 --> 00:44:15,000
She really goes down.

710
00:44:15,043 --> 00:44:17,480
And you're going to
have a good night.

711
00:44:18,568 --> 00:44:19,569
What did you say?

712
00:44:19,613 --> 00:44:21,180
Okay, you know what?

713
00:44:21,223 --> 00:44:24,618
I see where this is going and
I'm about six inches taller,

714
00:44:24,662 --> 00:44:26,117
so you're gonna want
to take it outside

715
00:44:26,141 --> 00:44:28,100
or I'm going to do something.

716
00:44:31,886 --> 00:44:33,279
Do it.

717
00:44:34,236 --> 00:44:35,411
Do it.

718
00:44:38,763 --> 00:44:40,373
Good choice.

719
00:44:40,416 --> 00:44:41,591
Good choice.

720
00:44:41,635 --> 00:44:43,245
Take it outside.

721
00:44:43,289 --> 00:44:45,030
Go outside, go outside.

722
00:44:47,380 --> 00:44:50,035
Hey uh, we, we should go.

723
00:44:52,254 --> 00:44:53,449
Okay. Is everything all right?

724
00:44:53,473 --> 00:44:55,910
Yeah. Um...

725
00:44:57,085 --> 00:44:59,522
Let's just, I want to
show you something.

726
00:45:01,873 --> 00:45:03,918
Who wants a fucking beer?

727
00:45:04,484 --> 00:45:07,139
Who wants a fucking beer!

728
00:45:08,662 --> 00:45:10,098
All right.

729
00:45:10,142 --> 00:45:11,752
I almost feel like you should,

730
00:45:11,796 --> 00:45:14,146
you should close your
eyes as we're walking up.

731
00:45:14,189 --> 00:45:16,452
Yeah, ¢cause this
looks really exciting.

732
00:45:16,496 --> 00:45:17,889
It's a pretty
scary part of town.

733
00:45:17,932 --> 00:45:19,281
Are we close yet?

734
00:45:19,325 --> 00:45:21,719
At least there's
no lines. This here.

735
00:45:22,415 --> 00:45:24,243
Oh, shit!
This is the place?

736
00:45:25,244 --> 00:45:26,114
No way.

737
00:45:26,158 --> 00:45:28,421
You've got to be kidding me.

738
00:45:34,079 --> 00:45:35,558
What are you?

739
00:45:37,343 --> 00:45:38,561
Kat.

740
00:45:40,563 --> 00:45:43,305
Good evening Asheville!

741
00:45:47,135 --> 00:45:49,529
So why did you leave school?

742
00:45:49,921 --> 00:45:51,966
I flunked out.

743
00:45:52,532 --> 00:45:54,839
You know, by the time I
realized how poorly I was doing,

744
00:45:54,882 --> 00:45:56,101
it was too late.

745
00:45:56,666 --> 00:45:58,190
I went from walking on to the

746
00:45:58,233 --> 00:45:59,844
best basketball team in America,

747
00:45:59,887 --> 00:46:03,021
to living at home
in sixteen months.

748
00:46:03,848 --> 00:46:05,763
And the first few
weeks weren't so bad.

749
00:46:05,806 --> 00:46:08,200
You know I got a lot of
calls, a lot of emails,

750
00:46:08,243 --> 00:46:11,203
but people moved on.

751
00:46:11,594 --> 00:46:13,596
Everyone but me.

752
00:46:14,336 --> 00:46:17,165
I sat in my room
for weeks on end.

753
00:46:17,209 --> 00:46:19,254
I didn't know how to
get out of that house.

754
00:46:19,298 --> 00:46:22,170
And this town was
my personal prison.

755
00:46:22,214 --> 00:46:25,173
Hey, everyone's home
town feels that way.

756
00:46:27,219 --> 00:46:29,961
And we came here
for my 21st birthday.

757
00:46:30,004 --> 00:46:32,441
Ben, Foster, everyone.

758
00:46:33,225 --> 00:46:35,183
Nobody knew I was
going to kill myself.

759
00:46:35,227 --> 00:46:36,576
But at that point,

760
00:46:36,619 --> 00:46:39,318
I don't think anybody
would have been surprised.

761
00:46:41,886 --> 00:46:46,891
It's funny how
therapeutic suicide can be

762
00:46:47,587 --> 00:46:50,982
when you decide to end it.

763
00:46:51,025 --> 00:46:54,681
Every worry, every
responsibility just fades away.

764
00:46:57,727 --> 00:46:59,642
So we started
drinking at dinner.

765
00:46:59,686 --> 00:47:01,949
And when we got here we were,

766
00:47:02,210 --> 00:47:04,473
you know, we were hammered.

767
00:47:06,084 --> 00:47:07,484
And by the time
Whiskeytown came on,

768
00:47:07,520 --> 00:47:10,218
I was counting my final hours.

769
00:47:13,178 --> 00:47:15,920
And the most amazing
thing happened.

770
00:47:16,224 --> 00:47:17,747
Ryan Adams.

771
00:47:17,791 --> 00:47:22,796
He climbed on to the stage
like a drunken troubadour.

772
00:47:23,928 --> 00:47:26,626
He was young, sad and fucked up.

773
00:47:26,669 --> 00:47:28,236
Just like me.

774
00:47:29,411 --> 00:47:31,849
His songs were brutally
honest confessions

775
00:47:31,892 --> 00:47:34,895
of his failure and pain.

776
00:47:35,896 --> 00:47:40,814
And he sang about all the things
I thought I wanted to kill.

777
00:47:41,336 --> 00:47:43,077
It was the first time
in my life I thought

778
00:47:43,121 --> 00:47:45,384
that everything might be okay.

779
00:47:47,342 --> 00:47:50,563
And I wanted to be part
of the art form that

780
00:47:51,216 --> 00:47:53,696
celebrated imperfection.

781
00:47:54,697 --> 00:47:58,353
I recognized that it was
our most human quality.

782
00:48:10,452 --> 00:48:12,411
I left him here.

783
00:48:13,716 --> 00:48:15,022
All alone.

784
00:48:16,850 --> 00:48:19,374
I was all he had and I just

785
00:48:20,680 --> 00:48:22,247
left him here to die.

786
00:48:22,290 --> 00:48:25,206
You know what?
You lived your life.

787
00:48:25,250 --> 00:48:26,077
No.

788
00:48:26,120 --> 00:48:28,122
That's what you had to do.

789
00:48:28,688 --> 00:48:30,908
Your dad knows that.

790
00:48:49,317 --> 00:48:51,363
You have to decide
on radiation soon.

791
00:48:51,406 --> 00:48:54,192
It'll be unpleasant but you
got to fight this thing.

792
00:48:54,235 --> 00:48:56,237
That it, Doc?

793
00:48:56,672 --> 00:48:57,891
That's it.

794
00:48:57,935 --> 00:48:59,086
All I know is
we're coming here

795
00:48:59,110 --> 00:49:00,391
for all your
doctor's appointment.

796
00:49:00,415 --> 00:49:02,200
Shut up and drink your beer.

797
00:49:02,243 --> 00:49:04,463
Remember, it's
basketball season.

798
00:49:04,506 --> 00:49:06,900
Let's talk about
something important.

799
00:49:07,379 --> 00:49:09,250
Who do you guys
like this season?

800
00:49:09,294 --> 00:49:10,512
I like the Bobcats.

801
00:49:10,556 --> 00:49:12,775
I think they're going
to surprise them.

802
00:49:12,819 --> 00:49:15,256
Adam Morrison may need a
haircut but the guy can play.

803
00:49:15,300 --> 00:49:17,998
It says here the Knicks
might resign Allan Houston.

804
00:49:18,042 --> 00:49:19,304
You kidding me?

805
00:49:19,347 --> 00:49:20,846
The guy's legs haven't
been right for years.

806
00:49:20,870 --> 00:49:22,176
I'm just reading the article.

807
00:49:22,220 --> 00:49:24,439
I mean look,
the guy can shoot.

808
00:49:24,918 --> 00:49:26,311
He's no Adam Morrison though.

809
00:49:26,354 --> 00:49:27,225
Sure he can shoot.

810
00:49:27,268 --> 00:49:29,705
He set the SEC scoring record.

811
00:49:29,749 --> 00:49:32,186
Come on, he's human though.

812
00:49:32,230 --> 00:49:34,580
I mean, the body falls
apart after a while.

813
00:49:34,623 --> 00:49:36,495
You told me that.

814
00:49:36,538 --> 00:49:38,976
At least he knew
when to walk away.

815
00:49:39,019 --> 00:49:39,889
I'll be back in a minute.

816
00:49:39,933 --> 00:49:40,760
Hey, do you need any help?

817
00:49:40,803 --> 00:49:41,326
No.

818
00:49:41,369 --> 00:49:42,022
Are you sure?

819
00:49:42,066 --> 00:49:43,415
No.

820
00:49:43,458 --> 00:49:44,914
I can still wipe my own
ass, thank you very much.

821
00:49:44,938 --> 00:49:48,550
And I don't intend on
sticking around till I can't.

822
00:49:49,247 --> 00:49:51,292
I'm cancerman.

823
00:49:54,165 --> 00:49:56,080
He's not a superman.

824
00:49:56,123 --> 00:49:57,951
He's doing well.

825
00:49:58,865 --> 00:50:00,475
Yeah, he is.

826
00:50:00,519 --> 00:50:02,347
He's not eating well.

827
00:50:03,087 --> 00:50:05,002
Well, oxycodone,

828
00:50:05,785 --> 00:50:08,092
it's not really good
for the appetite.

829
00:50:08,135 --> 00:50:11,791
Look, I can't prescribe it,
but marijuana does help.

830
00:50:13,401 --> 00:50:15,012
How are you?

831
00:50:15,838 --> 00:50:17,231
I'm alright.

832
00:50:18,450 --> 00:50:21,453
It's unhealthy to
keep it all bottled in.

833
00:50:22,410 --> 00:50:23,810
You know if I didn't
have Allison...

834
00:50:23,846 --> 00:50:25,892
You know what I love about
our friendship, Foster?

835
00:50:25,935 --> 00:50:26,632
What's that?

836
00:50:26,675 --> 00:50:28,199
We don't need to talk.

837
00:50:28,242 --> 00:50:29,504
Some people want to analyze

838
00:50:29,548 --> 00:50:32,377
and nitpick life down
to nothing, but not you.

839
00:50:32,420 --> 00:50:35,423
You've always understood
my not wanting to talk.

840
00:50:36,424 --> 00:50:38,818
You let everything be okay.

841
00:50:41,342 --> 00:50:43,779
Are you sure you don't
want any more, Jackson?

842
00:50:43,823 --> 00:50:45,390
Oh, no, I'm fine.

843
00:50:45,433 --> 00:50:47,348
Four servings is
really sufficient.

844
00:50:48,436 --> 00:50:49,587
Mind if I turn
on the television?

845
00:50:49,611 --> 00:50:50,917
Oh, no. Go right ahead.

846
00:50:50,960 --> 00:50:52,397
This reminds me,

847
00:50:52,440 --> 00:50:54,418
ESPN Classic's playing the
Georgetown game from '82.

848
00:50:54,442 --> 00:50:55,269
The championship?

849
00:50:55,313 --> 00:50:56,749
Yep.

850
00:50:56,792 --> 00:50:58,031
You can watch
anything you like, Mr. White.

851
00:50:58,055 --> 00:50:59,099
Ah.

852
00:50:59,143 --> 00:50:59,969
Some people might
think it's crazy

853
00:51:00,013 --> 00:51:02,102
to watch a 25 year old game.

854
00:51:02,494 --> 00:51:05,105
No one's ever accused
me of being normal.

855
00:51:05,149 --> 00:51:06,759
Ain't that the truth.

856
00:51:09,283 --> 00:51:12,939
Yeah, we split Mom's
painting room into offices.

857
00:51:12,982 --> 00:51:14,636
Just finished in March.

858
00:51:15,028 --> 00:51:16,203
It looks good.

859
00:51:16,247 --> 00:51:18,423
I never would have
recognized the place.

860
00:51:18,771 --> 00:51:20,120
Thanks.

861
00:51:20,512 --> 00:51:22,340
Your dad loved this ball.

862
00:51:23,645 --> 00:51:25,362
I swear he must have
told us about Hank Aaron

863
00:51:25,386 --> 00:51:26,431
every time I came here.

864
00:51:26,474 --> 00:51:28,346
Look, Jackson.

865
00:51:28,389 --> 00:51:30,174
You got to deal with this.

866
00:51:31,523 --> 00:51:33,046
I told you I'm fine.

867
00:51:33,090 --> 00:51:35,092
No, you're not fine.

868
00:51:37,050 --> 00:51:38,486
How would you know, Foster?

869
00:51:38,530 --> 00:51:39,574
Because it torn me apart

870
00:51:39,618 --> 00:51:41,098
when my parents
were in that crash!

871
00:51:41,141 --> 00:51:43,448
You selfish son of a bitch.

872
00:51:45,885 --> 00:51:47,278
I'm sorry.

873
00:51:47,321 --> 00:51:48,757
I didn't want to bring that up.

874
00:51:48,801 --> 00:51:49,932
No, go ahead.

875
00:51:49,976 --> 00:51:51,543
You're the one
that wants to talk.

876
00:51:51,586 --> 00:51:54,502
Tell me what an asshole I am
for not coming to the funeral.

877
00:51:56,635 --> 00:51:57,505
What?

878
00:51:57,549 --> 00:51:58,787
That's not what you want to say?

879
00:51:58,811 --> 00:51:59,507
No, it isn't.

880
00:51:59,551 --> 00:52:01,335
Yes, it is. Say it.

881
00:52:01,379 --> 00:52:04,425
Tell me how much I suck at life.

882
00:52:05,034 --> 00:52:06,601
I couldn't leave my job, Foster.

883
00:52:06,645 --> 00:52:08,255
I'm sorry I couldn't
finish school.

884
00:52:08,299 --> 00:52:10,170
I'm sorry I didn't
become a damned doctor.

885
00:52:10,214 --> 00:52:11,476
Fuck you!

886
00:52:11,519 --> 00:52:13,193
What? You don't think
I see it in your eyes?

887
00:52:13,217 --> 00:52:15,393
You're judging me.
You always have.

888
00:52:15,436 --> 00:52:16,481
Hey.

889
00:52:17,743 --> 00:52:19,658
You have no idea how
much I care about you.

890
00:52:19,701 --> 00:52:21,050
How much I value our friendship!

891
00:52:21,094 --> 00:52:23,401
Hey, we haven't been
close since college.

892
00:52:23,444 --> 00:52:25,707
You think that's
my fault, Jackson?

893
00:52:33,802 --> 00:52:35,717
Look, Jackson, I've tried.

894
00:52:36,153 --> 00:52:38,198
I've tried for seven
years to be your friend.

895
00:52:38,242 --> 00:52:40,244
And I'll try for the next seven.

896
00:52:40,287 --> 00:52:43,116
But now that means
getting in your face.

897
00:52:43,986 --> 00:52:46,815
Because you can't push
this off any longer.

898
00:52:47,816 --> 00:52:49,011
You can't keep running
from everything

899
00:52:49,035 --> 00:52:51,516
that makes you feel pain.

900
00:52:54,475 --> 00:52:57,478
You might find out
the pain isn't so bad.

901
00:53:01,526 --> 00:53:04,529
It means that something
matters, Jackson.

902
00:53:11,666 --> 00:53:13,799
Elizabeth left me.

903
00:53:15,540 --> 00:53:17,150
I figured.

904
00:53:20,371 --> 00:53:22,155
It's just that

905
00:53:25,332 --> 00:53:29,989
I'm falling behind at
work and my dad's dying.

906
00:53:30,511 --> 00:53:34,559
And I'm going to be
all alone in the world.

907
00:53:39,216 --> 00:53:41,087
What about Kat?

908
00:53:43,524 --> 00:53:44,699
She's nice.

909
00:53:46,353 --> 00:53:48,486
I'm not used to that.

910
00:53:50,488 --> 00:53:53,404
And she lives in
Asheville and I don't.

911
00:53:53,969 --> 00:53:56,668
I think she's good
for you in any regard.

912
00:53:57,756 --> 00:54:02,064
I think it's worth
making an exception for.

913
00:54:02,108 --> 00:54:02,978
What is?

914
00:54:03,022 --> 00:54:04,022
Love.

915
00:54:17,689 --> 00:54:20,431
Have you ever been in love?

916
00:54:21,475 --> 00:54:22,998
I love my dad.

917
00:54:23,042 --> 00:54:23,912
I know you love your dad.

918
00:54:23,956 --> 00:54:25,653
That's not the question.

919
00:54:26,001 --> 00:54:27,568
I don't know, I
mean I've told girls

920
00:54:27,612 --> 00:54:30,179
that I loved them before,
but it's never been...

921
00:54:31,485 --> 00:54:34,314
Well, it's always
been safe and easy.

922
00:54:34,358 --> 00:54:37,404
Just regular sex with
someone I care about.

923
00:54:37,448 --> 00:54:42,061
Everything but that feeling.

924
00:54:42,801 --> 00:54:44,542
What are you laughing at?

925
00:54:44,585 --> 00:54:46,413
No. Nothing. It's just...

926
00:54:46,457 --> 00:54:47,999
If we hadn't spent
the last hour fucking,

927
00:54:48,023 --> 00:54:50,069
I'd swear you weren't a man.

928
00:54:50,504 --> 00:54:51,897
I'm not a man?

929
00:54:51,940 --> 00:54:53,638
No, not so much.

930
00:54:53,681 --> 00:54:55,379
Men just want sex.

931
00:54:55,422 --> 00:54:56,728
Wow.

932
00:54:58,120 --> 00:54:59,426
That's all I want.

933
00:54:59,470 --> 00:55:01,428
Yeah, I know.

934
00:55:03,778 --> 00:55:05,302
You're...

935
00:55:05,345 --> 00:55:07,086
I'm what?

936
00:55:08,435 --> 00:55:10,045
I don't know.

937
00:55:10,872 --> 00:55:12,570
I don't know.

938
00:55:12,613 --> 00:55:14,267
Guys my age they
just close their eyes

939
00:55:14,311 --> 00:55:17,226
and go straight ahead
like I'm not even there.

940
00:55:17,270 --> 00:55:20,621
Well that sounds
incredibly romantic.

941
00:55:23,668 --> 00:55:25,713
But your eyes are open.

942
00:55:26,584 --> 00:55:29,151
I can't take my eyes off you.

943
00:55:30,805 --> 00:55:32,459
I like that.

944
00:55:33,068 --> 00:55:34,896
Yeah, me too.

945
00:55:47,344 --> 00:55:48,475
What is it?

946
00:55:50,869 --> 00:55:52,261
What?

947
00:55:52,305 --> 00:55:54,568
It's the, I'm sorry, it's
the music. I kind of...

948
00:55:54,612 --> 00:55:55,961
You don't like James Cooper?

949
00:55:56,004 --> 00:55:57,876
It spoiled the moment.
No, I hate this song.

950
00:55:57,919 --> 00:56:00,487
It's amazing. I listen to
it every night before bed.

951
00:56:02,141 --> 00:56:04,535
Do you know what it's about?

952
00:56:05,362 --> 00:56:06,642
Okay, well, I know
it sounds sad,

953
00:56:06,667 --> 00:56:09,540
but it's about this guy

954
00:56:09,583 --> 00:56:11,063
who's in a relationship
with this girl

955
00:56:11,106 --> 00:56:13,239
who keeps on hurting him.

956
00:56:13,674 --> 00:56:14,825
And then by the end of the song,

957
00:56:14,849 --> 00:56:16,895
he lets you know that

958
00:56:17,461 --> 00:56:20,159
he's going to find someone
who deserves his love.

959
00:56:20,986 --> 00:56:22,770
And he says,

960
00:56:23,684 --> 00:56:26,208
close your eyes, come to me,

961
00:56:26,252 --> 00:56:28,820
tomorrow's where
you're meant to be.

962
00:56:29,516 --> 00:56:32,867
Her tears are wet,
complexion streaked

963
00:56:32,911 --> 00:56:35,740
the love that you
have yet to meet.

964
00:56:38,656 --> 00:56:40,266
You okay?

965
00:56:41,180 --> 00:56:42,616
Yeah.

966
00:56:57,849 --> 00:57:00,634
I feel like I'm
behind enemy lines.

967
00:57:02,070 --> 00:57:04,812
Your mom was
uncomfortable here too.

968
00:57:05,204 --> 00:57:07,249
Is that why you broke up?

969
00:57:07,293 --> 00:57:09,730
It's never one thing.

970
00:57:10,339 --> 00:57:12,603
We were meant for
certain people.

971
00:57:13,168 --> 00:57:15,649
She wasn't my soul mate.

972
00:57:16,650 --> 00:57:18,826
But she gave me you.

973
00:57:28,532 --> 00:57:29,837
I feel like he's
looking at me.

974
00:57:29,881 --> 00:57:31,709
Like he knows I'm Jewish.

975
00:57:31,752 --> 00:57:33,058
God doesn't have an ego.

976
00:57:33,101 --> 00:57:35,582
He doesn't care what
religion you are.

977
00:57:35,626 --> 00:57:37,932
Tell that to the
Christian right.

978
00:57:37,976 --> 00:57:39,606
Why do you have to
judge an entire faith

979
00:57:39,630 --> 00:57:43,198
on its most irrational faction?

980
00:57:58,866 --> 00:58:00,520
Let's go, okay?

981
00:58:00,564 --> 00:58:02,522
I'm fine, okay. Let's
just get out of here.

982
00:58:02,566 --> 00:58:03,586
Whoa, whoa, what happened?

983
00:58:03,610 --> 00:58:05,656
Nothing. Okay? Just...

984
00:58:05,699 --> 00:58:08,049
Did he do something to you?

985
00:58:08,441 --> 00:58:10,617
No. It was my fault, okay.

986
00:58:10,661 --> 00:58:12,421
There is nothing you could
have done that could...

987
00:58:12,445 --> 00:58:13,620
Hey!

988
00:58:14,403 --> 00:58:18,016
I hit him, okay?
With a golf club.

989
00:58:18,059 --> 00:58:21,759
Many, many times.

990
00:58:21,802 --> 00:58:24,239
So let's just get out of here.

991
00:58:26,328 --> 00:58:28,809
Sorry about the room.

992
00:58:28,853 --> 00:58:31,290
Taking you back
to my dying father

993
00:58:31,333 --> 00:58:34,641
seemed even less you know...

994
00:58:35,294 --> 00:58:36,774
Cheers.

995
00:58:42,997 --> 00:58:44,782
You okay?

996
00:58:45,347 --> 00:58:46,740
Yeah.

997
00:58:47,524 --> 00:58:50,657
Yeah, you know, I have
to tell you something.

998
00:58:53,921 --> 00:58:57,446
And I'm not sure how
you're going to take it.

999
00:58:57,490 --> 00:59:00,319
I'm really worried that
you're going to hate me.

1000
00:59:01,189 --> 00:59:02,060
No matter what it is...

1001
00:59:02,103 --> 00:59:05,585
Just don't speak for a minute.

1002
00:59:09,371 --> 00:59:13,375
When you showed up, my life
was really complicated.

1003
00:59:15,726 --> 00:59:19,033
Kevin has been my fuck
buddy for some time now.

1004
00:59:21,079 --> 00:59:25,126
Even when I've had
other boyfriends, I

1005
00:59:29,870 --> 00:59:33,047
I don't know, with you,
I just don't want to.

1006
00:59:34,266 --> 00:59:36,050
And he doesn't understand?

1007
00:59:36,573 --> 00:59:37,661
No.

1008
00:59:38,226 --> 00:59:40,664
He understands, I just...

1009
00:59:41,665 --> 00:59:43,580
I freaked out.

1010
00:59:45,669 --> 00:59:47,714
God, you're going to hate me.

1011
00:59:47,758 --> 00:59:49,194
I'm not going to hate you.

1012
00:59:49,237 --> 00:59:50,238
Not yet.

1013
00:59:50,282 --> 00:59:52,893
Wait until you see
who I really am.

1014
00:59:57,289 --> 00:59:58,856
I'm a whore.

1015
00:59:59,117 --> 01:00:00,858
You're not a whore.

1016
01:00:00,901 --> 01:00:02,903
This is what I'm
trying to tell you.

1017
01:00:02,947 --> 01:00:04,905
Men use me for sex all the time,

1018
01:00:04,949 --> 01:00:08,256
and I let them use me.
You are not a whore.

1019
01:00:08,648 --> 01:00:11,608
Every time I say
"Never again" and...

1020
01:00:13,784 --> 01:00:15,046
It doesn't matter.

1021
01:00:15,089 --> 01:00:16,090
But it does matter.

1022
01:00:16,134 --> 01:00:16,743
Not to me.

1023
01:00:16,787 --> 01:00:19,616
It does matter!

1024
01:00:21,705 --> 01:00:25,622
What good is my love if I've
given it to so many men?

1025
01:00:27,754 --> 01:00:30,148
Oh, this is a bad idea.

1026
01:00:30,191 --> 01:00:32,803
I shouldn't have
told you, I just...

1027
01:00:32,846 --> 01:00:35,588
I don't know. I thought if
I got it out of me that...

1028
01:00:35,632 --> 01:00:37,982
I don't, I don't
know what I thought.

1029
01:00:39,723 --> 01:00:41,507
We should go.

1030
01:00:42,769 --> 01:00:44,553
We should go.

1031
01:00:44,597 --> 01:00:47,905
We need to go, okay! Come on.

1032
01:00:48,688 --> 01:00:51,169
Please, I just want to go.

1033
01:00:53,475 --> 01:00:54,738
Come here.

1034
01:00:59,743 --> 01:01:02,397
I know you've been hurt.

1035
01:01:03,268 --> 01:01:06,663
Over and over and over again.

1036
01:01:07,315 --> 01:01:11,058
And you still managed to
see the best in people.

1037
01:01:11,885 --> 01:01:15,062
Have you got any idea
how amazing that is?

1038
01:01:16,455 --> 01:01:19,023
You made me find something.

1039
01:01:19,327 --> 01:01:21,286
Let's go get it.

1040
01:02:12,729 --> 01:02:14,818
They'll look for
a nurse this week.

1041
01:02:14,861 --> 01:02:16,863
You're sure you have to leave?

1042
01:02:16,907 --> 01:02:19,910
I got to find a new job
before I lose all my clients.

1043
01:02:19,953 --> 01:02:21,259
That bad.

1044
01:02:22,651 --> 01:02:23,803
I was holding it
together with Scotch tape

1045
01:02:23,827 --> 01:02:26,264
and baling wire before this.

1046
01:02:27,831 --> 01:02:30,355
I'm so proud of you.

1047
01:02:31,008 --> 01:02:34,141
I was terrified when you
got back from Durham.

1048
01:02:34,185 --> 01:02:36,491
I didn't sleep for months.

1049
01:02:36,840 --> 01:02:38,537
You never said a word.

1050
01:02:38,580 --> 01:02:40,974
You don't tell those
things to your kid.

1051
01:02:42,193 --> 01:02:46,284
You pulled yourself back up
and carved yourself a life.

1052
01:02:49,678 --> 01:02:51,811
I wish I understood you.

1053
01:02:51,855 --> 01:02:53,770
Don't waste time trying.

1054
01:02:54,335 --> 01:02:58,426
You're going to wake up
one morning and be me.

1055
01:02:59,776 --> 01:03:02,822
Life happens. No matter what.

1056
01:03:04,389 --> 01:03:05,912
You uh...

1057
01:03:06,913 --> 01:03:10,787
You'll get credit for
what you don't deserve,

1058
01:03:10,830 --> 01:03:14,181
blame for things that
weren't your fault.

1059
01:03:14,878 --> 01:03:19,317
You just have to stick
around for the rest.

1060
01:03:22,929 --> 01:03:24,061
Eh...

1061
01:03:25,845 --> 01:03:26,933
Eh.

1062
01:03:27,281 --> 01:03:28,935
Let's shoot some pool.

1063
01:03:32,983 --> 01:03:34,854
How'd it go with Ben?

1064
01:03:37,552 --> 01:03:39,554
Okay, I guess.

1065
01:03:40,425 --> 01:03:42,296
Tell him you love him?

1066
01:03:43,123 --> 01:03:45,082
It didn't come up.

1067
01:03:47,388 --> 01:03:49,869
He probably knows, but
you'll regret it anyway.

1068
01:03:49,913 --> 01:03:51,218
You should say it.

1069
01:03:51,479 --> 01:03:53,220
You certainly say it a lot.

1070
01:03:53,264 --> 01:03:55,222
I love you a lot.

1071
01:03:57,181 --> 01:03:58,138
I know.

1072
01:03:58,182 --> 01:03:59,836
You do?

1073
01:04:01,272 --> 01:04:04,144
It's the only thing
I've ever been sure of.

1074
01:04:09,933 --> 01:04:11,412
Nice.

1075
01:04:12,370 --> 01:04:13,980
One more game?

1076
01:04:14,024 --> 01:04:16,504
What can I say? The
man likes to lose.

1077
01:04:16,548 --> 01:04:17,897
Rack ¢em up!

1078
01:04:28,342 --> 01:04:31,868
Oh, I can't get
comfortable anymore.

1079
01:04:32,694 --> 01:04:35,001
Open the glove compartment.

1080
01:04:40,659 --> 01:04:41,921
This?

1081
01:04:42,400 --> 01:04:44,793
Medical marijuana.

1082
01:04:58,242 --> 01:05:00,548
What's your disease?

1083
01:05:02,115 --> 01:05:04,901
What kind of father
do you think I am?

1084
01:05:11,951 --> 01:05:14,214
I like this song.

1085
01:05:24,572 --> 01:05:26,531
That's enough.

1086
01:05:41,763 --> 01:05:43,156
Leaving for the night?

1087
01:05:43,200 --> 01:05:44,027
Yeah.

1088
01:05:44,070 --> 01:05:45,637
I told Kat I would stop by.

1089
01:05:45,680 --> 01:05:47,508
You're seeing a lot of her.

1090
01:05:47,552 --> 01:05:48,901
Yeah.

1091
01:05:48,945 --> 01:05:50,903
Okay.

1092
01:05:53,079 --> 01:05:54,602
Jack.

1093
01:05:54,646 --> 01:05:55,864
Yeah?

1094
01:05:56,256 --> 01:05:58,650
Thanks for coming down here.

1095
01:05:59,694 --> 01:06:01,914
It means a lot to me.

1096
01:06:03,742 --> 01:06:04,917
I love you.

1097
01:06:04,961 --> 01:06:07,311
I love you too, Dad.

1098
01:06:08,790 --> 01:06:09,878
You know, I was thinking

1099
01:06:09,922 --> 01:06:11,576
we could turn this
couch into a bed.

1100
01:06:11,619 --> 01:06:13,665
Sheets, blankets,
the whole nine yards.

1101
01:06:13,708 --> 01:06:15,014
That won't be necessary.

1102
01:06:15,058 --> 01:06:17,147
I could bring
your bed down here.

1103
01:06:18,713 --> 01:06:20,411
It was just a thought.

1104
01:06:54,010 --> 01:06:56,055
The professor is
completely biased

1105
01:06:56,099 --> 01:06:58,405
against anything
made in this country.

1106
01:06:58,449 --> 01:07:01,887
And I'm like, "Come on,
you teach American film."

1107
01:07:01,930 --> 01:07:04,150
It's so frustrating.

1108
01:07:04,585 --> 01:07:05,649
You know, why does
something has to be

1109
01:07:05,673 --> 01:07:07,327
in another language or just

1110
01:07:07,371 --> 01:07:10,765
incredibly obscure
to be artistic?

1111
01:07:13,116 --> 01:07:14,247
Are you listening?

1112
01:07:14,291 --> 01:07:15,944
You know, sometimes
the most simple,

1113
01:07:15,988 --> 01:07:17,729
direct things are
the most beautiful.

1114
01:07:17,772 --> 01:07:18,382
Kat...

1115
01:07:18,425 --> 01:07:20,079
I love you.

1116
01:07:20,123 --> 01:07:21,602
What?

1117
01:07:23,126 --> 01:07:24,518
I'm sorry.

1118
01:07:24,562 --> 01:07:26,999
I had to get that out there
or I was going to burst.

1119
01:07:27,608 --> 01:07:30,002
You don't have to say anything.

1120
01:07:34,615 --> 01:07:36,443
Okay, say something.

1121
01:07:40,230 --> 01:07:43,015
You're the most amazing girl.

1122
01:07:43,059 --> 01:07:45,061
But?

1123
01:07:50,414 --> 01:07:53,156
I've got to go back to L.A.

1124
01:07:53,895 --> 01:07:57,203
And this isn't right for me.

1125
01:07:59,292 --> 01:08:01,207
I wish I had met
you five years ago.

1126
01:08:01,251 --> 01:08:04,080
I wish I could be that guy.

1127
01:08:04,471 --> 01:08:07,909
I can't. Too much has happened.

1128
01:08:08,214 --> 01:08:09,781
You understand?

1129
01:08:09,824 --> 01:08:11,478
Too much has...

1130
01:08:15,221 --> 01:08:17,005
I know this is a bad time but

1131
01:08:17,049 --> 01:08:19,530
it's really essential that
you call me for Peter back.

1132
01:08:19,573 --> 01:08:23,011
They're not going to cover our
September or August expenses.

1133
01:08:23,055 --> 01:08:24,143
You need to call me back.

1134
01:08:24,187 --> 01:08:26,450
We're talking business affairs.

1135
01:08:38,592 --> 01:08:40,072
It's signed.

1136
01:08:40,681 --> 01:08:43,119
Have a drink. Celebrate.

1137
01:08:43,902 --> 01:08:45,556
Not tonight.

1138
01:08:50,256 --> 01:08:52,171
Is everything all right, Jeff?

1139
01:08:52,215 --> 01:08:53,129
It'll be fine.

1140
01:08:53,172 --> 01:08:55,174
He and Jackson were close.

1141
01:08:58,177 --> 01:08:59,874
Did you regret it?

1142
01:09:00,266 --> 01:09:02,616
I don't believe in regret.

1143
01:09:03,400 --> 01:09:05,445
I believe in mistakes.

1144
01:09:06,142 --> 01:09:07,317
Regret makes it sound like

1145
01:09:07,360 --> 01:09:09,493
you can actually do
something about it.

1146
01:09:09,536 --> 01:09:11,190
This isn't even my robe.

1147
01:09:12,191 --> 01:09:13,105
Come on, Kat!

1148
01:09:13,149 --> 01:09:15,063
Open up, Kat!

1149
01:09:21,896 --> 01:09:23,071
For better or for worse,

1150
01:09:23,115 --> 01:09:26,074
my actions have
made me who I am.

1151
01:09:27,075 --> 01:09:29,165
Writing that book

1152
01:09:29,991 --> 01:09:32,298
was a terrible idea.

1153
01:09:33,821 --> 01:09:35,234
But if I hadn't done it,
I'd be a different person

1154
01:09:35,258 --> 01:09:37,042
and I'd be in a different place.

1155
01:09:37,085 --> 01:09:41,046
I'd be with a different girl.

1156
01:09:42,569 --> 01:09:44,441
I'd be with no girl.

1157
01:10:06,419 --> 01:10:07,768
Dad!

1158
01:11:51,176 --> 01:11:54,179
Yes. I'd like to report a...

1159
01:11:57,356 --> 01:11:59,532
My dad is dead.

1160
01:13:06,207 --> 01:13:07,774
Why don't you watch
where you're going?

1161
01:13:07,818 --> 01:13:10,342
You got something to say, boy?

1162
01:13:12,300 --> 01:13:14,215
What'd you say?

1163
01:14:37,255 --> 01:14:38,255
Ugh!

1164
01:15:24,737 --> 01:15:26,304
I wasn't ready.

1165
01:15:30,090 --> 01:15:32,919
I wasn't ready to see you back.

1166
01:15:37,141 --> 01:15:38,795
Stay.

1167
01:15:39,665 --> 01:15:40,927
Stay in Asheville.

1168
01:15:40,971 --> 01:15:41,972
I can't.

1169
01:15:42,015 --> 01:15:43,582
I love you.

1170
01:15:43,626 --> 01:15:45,453
And you love me.

1171
01:15:45,497 --> 01:15:47,499
You can't say it
and that's okay.

1172
01:15:47,543 --> 01:15:49,545
But I know you do.

1173
01:15:49,980 --> 01:15:51,851
My life is here.

1174
01:15:52,722 --> 01:15:53,984
This is your life.

1175
01:15:54,027 --> 01:15:55,159
No.

1176
01:15:55,202 --> 01:15:59,685
Me. Ben. Foster.
Alison. We love you.

1177
01:16:02,558 --> 01:16:04,429
You're so fixated on this idea

1178
01:16:04,472 --> 01:16:06,344
of what you think your
life should look like

1179
01:16:06,387 --> 01:16:09,956
that you can't even see
what's really going on.

1180
01:16:10,391 --> 01:16:12,655
Right now! Here!

1181
01:16:13,177 --> 01:16:15,353
This is your life.

1182
01:16:17,094 --> 01:16:19,923
And it¢s going to hurt
for a little while.

1183
01:16:21,359 --> 01:16:24,362
But you just have
to do it anyway.

1184
01:16:28,322 --> 01:16:30,455
I'm not going to leave you.

1185
01:16:41,988 --> 01:16:43,468
Jackson.

1186
01:16:45,949 --> 01:16:47,733
What is this?

1187
01:16:50,475 --> 01:16:51,737
Tragic news from Los Angeles.

1188
01:16:51,781 --> 01:16:52,564
Asheville
native, Jackson murdered

1189
01:16:52,608 --> 01:16:54,305
in late Saturday evening.

1190
01:16:54,348 --> 01:16:55,915
Son of longtime
Democrat columnist...

1191
01:16:55,959 --> 01:16:56,742
Huh?

1192
01:16:56,786 --> 01:16:58,222
Thanks, big dog.

1193
01:16:58,265 --> 01:16:59,527
Hey!

1194
01:17:00,180 --> 01:17:00,877
Give me...

1195
01:17:00,920 --> 01:17:02,530
Get down! Get back down!

1196
01:17:02,574 --> 01:17:04,228
You want to play
somebody with a gun?

1197
01:17:04,271 --> 01:17:05,969
What's his name, man?

1198
01:17:06,404 --> 01:17:08,711
Dude, dude, dude, dude.

1199
01:17:08,754 --> 01:17:09,842
What's his name, man?

1200
01:17:09,886 --> 01:17:11,365
Jackson White,
man. Jackson White.

1201
01:17:11,409 --> 01:17:12,845
Let's go man. Let's go, D.

1202
01:17:12,889 --> 01:17:14,368
Jackson.

1203
01:17:14,412 --> 01:17:16,370
Look at me!

1204
01:17:17,241 --> 01:17:18,546
Yo, come on, D.

1205
01:17:20,679 --> 01:17:21,462
30 years...

1206
01:17:21,506 --> 01:17:23,377
Suspect is still at large.

1207
01:17:35,781 --> 01:17:37,609
It's okay.

1208
01:17:38,218 --> 01:17:39,002
Go.

1209
01:17:39,045 --> 01:17:40,917
I love you too.

1210
01:17:42,832 --> 01:17:44,311
I know.

1211
01:17:50,491 --> 01:17:52,102
Jesus.

1212
01:17:54,539 --> 01:17:55,671
Looks like a...

1213
01:17:55,714 --> 01:17:57,629
How many days?

1214
01:17:58,456 --> 01:18:00,501
Keep him behind the yellow line.

1215
01:18:02,590 --> 01:18:04,331
What's the
official time of death?

1216
01:18:04,375 --> 01:18:05,375
3:19am.

1217
01:18:07,726 --> 01:18:09,423
No!

1218
01:18:21,566 --> 01:18:24,047
Now do you know what happened?

1219
01:18:24,395 --> 01:18:25,918
I'm dead.

1220
01:18:26,266 --> 01:18:28,355
For a few weeks now.

1221
01:18:28,399 --> 01:18:30,531
We should go.

1222
01:18:34,231 --> 01:18:36,015
Are you God?

1223
01:18:36,537 --> 01:18:38,452
I'm afraid not.

1224
01:18:38,975 --> 01:18:40,454
An angel.

1225
01:18:40,498 --> 01:18:42,935
Just think of me as a friend.

1226
01:18:43,283 --> 01:18:46,069
I've always been
looking out for you.

1227
01:18:47,548 --> 01:18:49,550
I'm not the only one.

1228
01:18:50,116 --> 01:18:53,685
Just listen to the
people who surrounds you.

1229
01:18:55,252 --> 01:18:57,384
I'm not sure that one
life can mean anything.

1230
01:18:57,428 --> 01:18:59,430
One life can change the world.

1231
01:18:59,473 --> 01:19:01,519
You might find out
that pain isn't so bad.

1232
01:19:01,562 --> 01:19:04,348
That means that something
matters, Jackson.

1233
01:19:04,391 --> 01:19:05,828
Can't leave things unsaid.

1234
01:19:05,871 --> 01:19:06,785
Are we still friends?

1235
01:19:06,829 --> 01:19:08,526
Always brother.

1236
01:19:08,569 --> 01:19:10,223
Always.

1237
01:19:10,615 --> 01:19:12,535
You might be meeting
someone who lets you know.

1238
01:19:12,573 --> 01:19:17,013
But he's going to find
someone who deserves his love.

1239
01:19:18,318 --> 01:19:21,147
I'll never get to say good-bye.

1240
01:19:21,582 --> 01:19:23,541
You already have.

1241
01:19:23,584 --> 01:19:24,672
Did you ever lose someone

1242
01:19:24,716 --> 01:19:27,327
whose absence shook
your very core?

1243
01:19:27,371 --> 01:19:28,981
Then one day you felt
a flood of warmth

1244
01:19:29,025 --> 01:19:32,855
and the pain was gone, leaving
only those memories of love.

1245
01:19:32,898 --> 01:19:34,204
Everyone makes this journey

1246
01:19:34,247 --> 01:19:37,642
and your love never
leaves this earth.

1247
01:19:37,685 --> 01:19:39,905
Foster and Alison will help.

1248
01:19:39,949 --> 01:19:43,691
They become a family, united
by their love for you.

1249
01:19:45,128 --> 01:19:46,390
And Kat?

1250
01:19:46,433 --> 01:19:48,435
It's harder for her.

1251
01:19:48,479 --> 01:19:50,960
She'll never meet her soul mate.

1252
01:19:51,351 --> 01:19:54,441
Most people can deal with
a lesser lot in life.

1253
01:19:54,485 --> 01:19:56,748
You see them everywhere.

1254
01:19:56,792 --> 01:19:58,837
Living life out of habit.

1255
01:19:59,577 --> 01:20:01,492
She's not that resilient.

1256
01:20:02,623 --> 01:20:04,016
She'll wake up one morning

1257
01:20:04,060 --> 01:20:08,368
with an inexplicable sadness
she can no longer carry.

1258
01:20:13,504 --> 01:20:15,419
Kat! No!

1259
01:20:21,164 --> 01:20:23,427
Don't worry.
She will find you.

1260
01:20:23,470 --> 01:20:25,168
Same way you found her.

1261
01:20:25,211 --> 01:20:27,170
In this world or the next.

1262
01:20:27,213 --> 01:20:28,693
It doesn't matter.

1263
01:20:28,954 --> 01:20:31,522
We all find our love.

1264
01:21:14,565 --> 01:21:15,783
Jackson.

1265
01:21:15,827 --> 01:21:18,525
You have to finish this
journey on your own.

1266
01:21:18,786 --> 01:21:21,050
But you're going to be okay.

1267
01:21:21,398 --> 01:21:24,183
It was such a
pleasure to know you.

1268
01:21:24,880 --> 01:21:27,665
This is where we say good-bye.

1269
01:21:33,236 --> 01:21:34,628
Wait!

1270
01:21:36,979 --> 01:21:38,763
