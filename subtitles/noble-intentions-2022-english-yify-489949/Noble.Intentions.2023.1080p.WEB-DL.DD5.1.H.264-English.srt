Hey, Noble! How's it going?

1566
01:35:11,278 --> 01:35:13,047
I just came by to see your mama.

1567
01:35:13,080 --> 01:35:14,982
She's not home
right now, pastor.

1568
01:35:15,382 --> 01:35:17,985
Really? That's--
that's interesting

1569
01:35:18,018 --> 01:35:19,853
because I just spoke to her
on the telephone.

1570
01:35:19,887 --> 01:35:21,455
[chuckles] All right.
And you know what?

1571
01:35:21,488 --> 01:35:23,157
You boys need to come
to church more often,

1572
01:35:23,190 --> 01:35:24,526
I ain't seen you in a while.

1573

We good on church, pastor.

1574

So you can have a good night.

y'all to come to church...

1577

have to bring church to you.

Man, what kind of pastor is you?

1585
01:36:25,085 --> 01:36:28,255
That's a good question,
but I got a few for you.

1586
01:36:29,591 --> 01:36:31,258
Have you ever looked
into the eyes

1587
01:36:31,292 --> 01:36:33,460
of a young child
dying from a gunshot wound?

1588
01:36:34,361 --> 01:36:35,429
Hmm?

1589
01:36:36,163 --> 01:36:38,265
The only mistake that they made

1590
01:36:38,566 --> 01:36:41,235
is because they were trying
to steal something to eat.

1591
01:36:42,136 --> 01:36:43,304
What about you?

1592
01:36:44,872 --> 01:36:45,973
Hmm?

1593
01:36:47,107 --> 01:36:52,012
Have you ever spent your last
dime on a family in need

1594
01:36:52,046 --> 01:36:54,915
while you're waiting
for a government grant

1595
01:36:54,948 --> 01:36:56,016
to be approved?

1596
01:36:59,554 --> 01:37:00,821
Hmm?

1597
01:37:01,889 --> 01:37:04,825
Have you ever looked
at someone that you love...

1598
01:37:05,627 --> 01:37:07,061
who's dying?

1599
01:37:08,262 --> 01:37:12,366
And the only thing between
them living and dying is money.

1600
01:37:12,399 --> 01:37:14,201
Hmm? Hmm?

1601
01:37:16,437 --> 01:37:19,840
Tell me,
can you imagine the burden...

1602
01:37:21,609 --> 01:37:24,478
of trying to save a community...

1603
01:37:28,215 --> 01:37:32,219
that for generations has been
systematically disenfranchised,

1604
01:37:32,953 --> 01:37:36,190
beaten down, used and abused?

1605
01:37:36,924 --> 01:37:39,426
Some of them
so, so undereducated

1606
01:37:39,460 --> 01:37:43,931
that they can't even read
or write enough to get a job.

1607
01:37:46,300 --> 01:37:47,368
Hmm?

1608
01:37:51,238 --> 01:37:52,473
Do they deserve to die?

1609
01:37:53,207 --> 01:37:55,577
Do they not deserve
to have a good life?

1610
01:37:55,610 --> 01:37:56,944
A decent life?

1611
01:37:59,146 --> 01:38:01,882
They are why I do what I do.

1612
01:38:02,550 --> 01:38:03,917

1614

So, don't judge me.

1615
01:38:11,024 --> 01:38:12,259

1616

Trying to level
the playing field

1620
01:38:26,373 --> 01:38:30,344

has left for dead.

1622
01:38:35,983 --> 01:38:37,418
