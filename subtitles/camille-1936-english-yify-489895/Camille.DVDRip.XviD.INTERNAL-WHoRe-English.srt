1
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:16,800
For the lady of the camellias.

2
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:22,560
And they're almost twice as large
as usual.

3
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:25,600
I shall have twice as many
as usual tomorrow.

4
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:29,920
Twice as man...? Oh, don't listen to her,
Barjon. I know what those things cost.

5
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:33,560
Aren't you willing to listen to her when
she orders hats and dresses from you?

6
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:35,160
They're an investment.

7
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:38,520
Of course, I order too many flowers,
hats and too many everything.

8
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:39,960
But I want them.

9
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:41,680
To the theater.

10
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:48,800
And there's no limit to your extravagance.
Now, you won't be young forever.

11
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:51,800
It's high time you settle something
about your future.

12
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:54,960
And I know the very man for you.

13
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:57,720
- Really?
- Yes, really.

14
00:02:58,880 --> 00:03:00,920
Aren't you interested
to know who it is?

15
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:02,400
Oh, yes, who is it?

16
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:08,240
The Baron de Varville, one of the richest
and most elegant gentlemen in Paris.

17
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:10,520
One foot in the grave
and a wig on his head.

18
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:14,400
Not at all. Not at all. Quite the contrary.
He's young and handsome.

19
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:17,640
I heard from one of the girls in my shop
who heard from his valet...

20
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:22,080
...he's gonna be at the theater tonight.
That's why I wanted you to look your best.

21
00:03:56,440 --> 00:03:57,880
Come here.

22
00:03:58,040 --> 00:03:59,200
I want to send a note.

23
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:02,960
And I'll give you a handsome tip
if you get it to the right person.

24
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:04,840
Do you know the Baron de Varville?

25
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,840
- Yes, Madame.
- Good.

26
00:04:18,960 --> 00:04:20,920
Well, that's done.

27
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:23,080
We go this way.

28
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:32,040
My dear, you're as good
as a baroness already.

29
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:34,160
Don't forget. I arranged it all.

30
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:37,680
- Where are we sitting?
- Box A, of course. I always ask for Box A.

31
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:40,920
The baron can't miss it.
Come, come, old dear, open Box A.

32
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:42,680
- Someone else is in there.
- What?

33
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:46,040
- Good evening. Let me see your ticket.
- Here.

34
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:49,160
- Why, this says Box B.
- I asked for Box A.

35
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:51,680
If you'd wear your spectacles,
you'd see what you get.

36
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:53,600
- None of your lip.
- Not so much fuss.

37
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:56,800
- Wait, who's in there?
- A friend of yours.

38
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:00,240
- Olympe.
- Olympe.

39
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:01,840
Right.

40
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,120
Well, what's so funny about it,
I'd like to know.

41
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:06,680
How you arranged everything for Olympe.

42
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:09,840
That cat. If you think I'm going to let...

43
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,080
...a cheating, lying wretch like that
upset my plans, you're wrong.

44
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:17,800
- She's got to change places with us.
- Well, fight it out, ladies.

45
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:24,040
- My angel.
- Marguerite, darling.

46
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:28,200
Oh, how are you, my dear?
How beautiful we look this evening.

47
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:30,520
- Nice perfume. What is it?
- That's my secret.

48
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:36,000
- And how are you, you old robber?
- You're great for teasing, aren't you?

49
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:40,000
Is there any point in our staying out here
in this draft?

50
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:43,640
Oh, look here, Olympe, there's been
a little mistake about our tickets...

51
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:46,800
...and we want you
to change boxes with us.

52
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:48,440
Why?

53
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:51,920
I can't understand why you must sit
in this box when yours is just as good.

54
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:54,640
Well, you know Prudence.
She's a woman full of secrets.

55
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:56,840
Even changing her corset
is a great mystery.

56
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,200
Some things have to be a mystery.

57
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:03,240
But if you'll do what I ask you to do,
I'll send you that fur toque for a present.

58
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:05,640
It's a bargain.
During the intermission, I'll move.

59
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:06,800
Come here, Marguerite.

60
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:21,320
A note for Monsieur le Baron.

61
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:36,760
- Which is Box A?
- There, Monsieur le Baron. At the left.

62
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:38,800
Show me to my seat.

63
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:41,080
Doesn't Monsieur le Baron
wish to send an answer?

64
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:44,440
I'll wait and decide that later.

65
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:21,800
My dear, do you see that gentleman
standing up?

66
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:24,560
- Which one?
- In the second row on the aisle.

67
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,080
- Yes. Do you know him?
- I know who he is.

68
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:36,400
He's the fabulously rich de Varville,
Baron de Varville.

69
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:43,200
I didn't know that rich men
ever looked like that.

70
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:45,760
This one does. He's looking at us.

71
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:47,160
He's seen us looking at him.

72
00:07:56,520 --> 00:07:59,280
I've changed my mind, Prudence.
You can keep your fur toque.

73
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:03,160
The Baron de Varville is on his way to this
box, and I'm going to stay and meet him.

74
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:05,240
But he's coming here to meet me.

75
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:08,960
- So that's what you had up your sleeve.
- I invited him to join us here myself.

76
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:12,600
Nothing could be better. Thank you,
my dear Prudence, for arranging it.

77
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:16,160
But having done so much,
you really must let me receive him alone.

78
00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:19,960
- Unfortunately, I like him too.
- Why unfortunately?

79
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:22,640
Because his eyes have made love to me
all evening.

80
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:27,520
That's a lie. He barely glanced at you.
I never took my glasses from his face...

81
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:30,080
...except for an instant
to let him see mine.

82
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:32,760
Perhaps that was the instant
he smiled at me.

83
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:35,600
He did not smile at you,
and he won't meet you here.

84
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:38,600
- Then he must look for me somewhere else.
- Sit down, Marguerite.

85
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:43,040
Listen, Olympe, I appeal to your sense
of honor, if you have such a thing.

86
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:46,120
Oh, shut up, you old woman.
Get out before I have you dragged out.

87
00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:49,000
Come, come, Prudence.
You really are a fool, Olympe.

88
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:50,880
You're the fool.

89
00:08:52,280 --> 00:08:54,720
You know that Prudence
is nothing but an old vulture.

90
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:58,280
Vulture! She called me a vulture.

91
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:01,400
That one who'd pick
a dead man's pocket.

92
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:06,640
I'll tell you something else. If you don't
stop being so easygoing with money...

93
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:09,040
...you'll land in the gutter before
you're through.

94
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:11,080
Or back on that farm
where you came from...

95
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:13,760
...milking cows
and cleaning out henhouses.

96
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:18,000
Cows and chickens make better friends
than I've ever met in Paris.

97
00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:24,280
Come here. Stop the baron going to Box A.
Tell him to join us in Box B. Hurry. Hurry!

98
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:30,040
Monsieur le Baron. There has been
a mistake, Monsieur le Baron.

99
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:33,160
The lady who sent you the note
does not wish you to go to Box A...

100
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:36,160
...but to join her and her friend in Box B.

101
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:39,360
So it is you. Do come in, monsieur.

102
00:09:39,520 --> 00:09:41,080
But your answer, Monsieur le Baron.

103
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:44,120
You may say that for the moment
I am engaged.

104
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:05,880
- Are you following me?
- Yes.

105
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:08,640
You... Well, you did smile at me
a moment ago, didn't you?

106
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:11,680
Well, you tell me first whether
you smiled at me or at my friend.

107
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:14,200
- What friend?
- You didn't even see her?

108
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:17,160
- No.
- That's very nice.

109
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:21,000
I was wondering if you'd ask me to sit
down if I knocked at the door of the box.

110
00:10:21,160 --> 00:10:22,360
Why not?

111
00:10:22,520 --> 00:10:25,320
We really seemed fated to meet
this evening, didn't we?

112
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:50,120
Fate must've had something to do
with this evening.

113
00:10:50,280 --> 00:10:52,600
I've hoped for it so long.

114
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:54,640
- You don't believe me?
- No.

115
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:57,040
The first time I saw you
was a year and a half ago.

116
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:59,520
You were in an open carriage
and dressed in white.

117
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:01,880
I saw you go into a shop
in the Place de la Bourse.

118
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:05,320
Yes, that might've happened. I went
to a dressmaker in Place de la Bourse.

119
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:08,920
You were wearing a thin dress
with miles of ruffles...

120
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:13,560
...a large straw hat, an embroidered shawl,
a single bracelet and heavy, gold chain...

121
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:15,800
...and, of course,
the camellias at your waist.

122
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:17,840
You have a marvelous memory,
haven't you?

123
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:20,400
The next time was at the Opéra Comique.

124
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:22,600
You were sitting in a box
with a fur coat on...

125
00:11:22,760 --> 00:11:25,480
...and Gaston, a chap whom I know
who knows you...

126
00:11:25,640 --> 00:11:28,080
...said, "Marguerite's been ill. "

127
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:30,920
And that hurt me.

128
00:11:31,520 --> 00:11:34,200
- The next time...
- Tell me, if all you say is true...

129
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:36,600
...why have you never
spoken to me before?

130
00:11:36,760 --> 00:11:39,760
- In the first place, I didn't know you.
- You didn't know me tonight.

131
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:44,320
No, but after you smiled at me,
I knew you wouldn't mind.

132
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:46,560
And now, since you've met me?

133
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:48,760
Now I know that I love you...

134
00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:51,520
...and have loved you
since that first day.

135
00:11:54,640 --> 00:11:56,600
Marguerite, my dear.

136
00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:01,560
After what happened,
I had to have a brandy.

137
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:05,120
- And after that, two brandies.
- Yes, and then he made me have another.

138
00:12:05,280 --> 00:12:07,800
Well, that's only four.

139
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:10,360
Suppose you go and have another,
Prudence, and then...

140
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:12,000
Well, then another.

141
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:15,480
- You don't want to get me drunk, do you?
- She wants to get rid of us.

142
00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:17,520
She wants to be alone with my friend.

143
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:20,480
For once in your life
you're quite right, Gaston.

144
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:21,840
Who is your friend anyway?

145
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:25,280
Baron de Varville, this is my neighbor,
Madame Duvernoy.

146
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:27,680
- Baron de Varville?
- He, the Baron de Varville?

147
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:30,080
No wonder she wanted to get rid of us.

148
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:33,400
Well, I... I never said
I was the "Baron" anybody.

149
00:12:33,560 --> 00:12:34,960
There's the Baron de Varville...

150
00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:37,880
...sitting over there, big as life,
with that wretch, Olympe.

151
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:41,400
- Really?
- Certainly.

152
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:45,240
Well, this is rather funny.

153
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:49,280
- Funny?
- Yes, I quite agree with you. It is funny.

154
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:52,080
Oh, even if you're not Baron de Varville,
sit down.

155
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:55,440
I can't believe I'm wanted now that
my unimportance has been discovered.

156
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:57,720
Don't be silly. Who are you anyhow?

157
00:12:57,880 --> 00:12:59,200
My name is Armand Duval.

158
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:01,400
I've never had any reason
to be ashamed of it.

159
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:03,320
- Armand Duval.
- Yes.

160
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:08,840
I'm not always sincere.
One can't be in this world, you know.

161
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:13,000
- But I am not sorry the mistake happened.
- Nor am I.

162
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:17,880
The baron keeps looking over here.
That must worry Olympe.

163
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:23,920
Well, as long as you don't wish to sit down,
would you go and buy me some sweets?

164
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:26,280
You can afford a pound
of marrons glacés...

165
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:28,880
...even if you're not the rich baron,
can't you?

166
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:32,200
I'll not come back with your sweets
too soon.

167
00:13:45,160 --> 00:13:48,520
- What is your friend's name?
- I'm not sure which friend you mean.

168
00:13:48,680 --> 00:13:51,480
The girl in the opposite box
whom you just spoke to.

169
00:13:51,640 --> 00:13:55,400
Oh, her. Well, she's hardly a friend.

170
00:13:55,560 --> 00:13:57,240
I know her, of course.

171
00:13:57,440 --> 00:13:59,800
But she's not easy to get along with.
Ask anybody.

172
00:13:59,960 --> 00:14:01,240
What did you say her name was?

173
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:04,960
And she has a reputation of being one
of the most extravagant girls in Paris...

174
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:07,680
...as well as one of the most insincere.

175
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:11,160
- I like sincerity, don't you?
- It's an admirable quality.

176
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:13,480
Well, I insist on it.

177
00:14:13,640 --> 00:14:15,960
She's the kind who says one thing
and thinks another.

178
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:19,080
- Who?
- Marguerite, the girl we were talking about.

179
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:21,040
Marguerite.

180
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:25,480
- What is her other name?
- Gautier. Not that it's her real name.

181
00:14:25,640 --> 00:14:29,000
She had some sort of very common name,
I hear, when she came to Paris.

182
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:31,880
There's no use boring you about her.

183
00:14:32,040 --> 00:14:35,320
A friend of mine is giving a small party
tonight, if you'd care to come.

184
00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:39,400
I detest parties. Thank you
for a very charming entr'acte, my dear.

185
00:14:40,640 --> 00:14:41,880
Will I see you again?

186
00:14:42,040 --> 00:14:45,080
I should think it's very likely, sometime.
Good evening.

187
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:59,160
- Good evening.
- Good evening.

188
00:14:59,520 --> 00:15:02,080
- I hope I don't intrude.
- No.

189
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:04,480
You're very welcome, baron.

190
00:15:04,640 --> 00:15:07,720
I was delighted when I saw
that you were alone.

191
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:16,600
Oh, monsieur, I'm so sorry
I kept you waiting.

192
00:15:16,760 --> 00:15:19,400
I had to go to two shops
before I found your marrons glacés.

193
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:21,280
It doesn't matter. I'm in no hurry.

194
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:24,440
But since nothing but marrons glacés
would do, these are very fresh.

195
00:15:24,640 --> 00:15:26,960
- Will monsieur try one?
- Thank you.

196
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:34,160
Thank you, monsieur.

197
00:16:03,280 --> 00:16:05,600
The coachman wishes me
to remind Monsieur le Baron...

198
00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:08,280
...there are four horses to manage,
and they're restless.

199
00:16:08,440 --> 00:16:09,760
Very well.

200
00:16:11,160 --> 00:16:13,360
I must go.

201
00:16:13,520 --> 00:16:15,640
I think I'll change my mind
and take you with me.

202
00:16:15,840 --> 00:16:19,160
- The doctors warned me against Russia.
- But Russia isn't cold in summer.

203
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:21,840
Even so, the trip would be
too much for me.

204
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:27,200
I shall get tired. I shall get ill again.
And you'll be bored.

205
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:29,520
Now, what shall I give you
to remember me by?

206
00:16:29,960 --> 00:16:32,000
- You can't give the only thing I'd like.
- What?

207
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:33,680
A tear.

208
00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:37,920
- You're not sorry enough I'm going.
- Oh, but I am sorry.

209
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:42,360
Is there anything I can do for you
before I go?

210
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:45,240
Yes. I'm going to an auction
this afternoon.

211
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:48,240
- I would like to buy a pair of horses.
- I just gave you a pair.

212
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:51,640
Yes, but these horses belonged
to my friend, Eugenie Clivet...

213
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:53,760
...who died a few weeks ago.

214
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:56,080
And I know she'd like me
to have her horses.

215
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:58,520
Well, what of it
if you don't need them?

216
00:16:58,680 --> 00:17:02,160
Olympe wants them.
She always wants everything I want...

217
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:04,000
...and I don't want her to have them.

218
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:07,560
Are you really as jealous of Olympe
as all that? I don't believe it.

219
00:17:08,440 --> 00:17:10,000
I'll be frank with you.

220
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:13,160
I want Clivet's horses
because I want the coachman.

221
00:17:13,320 --> 00:17:15,960
And he'd be miserable
without the horses.

222
00:17:16,120 --> 00:17:18,640
- He must be very young and handsome.
- Oh, no.

223
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:20,960
He's quite old. He's older than Nanine.

224
00:17:21,120 --> 00:17:26,320
But, well, he needs someone to take care
of him, and I know Olympe won't.

225
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:30,360
So much heart and so little sense.

226
00:17:30,760 --> 00:17:34,080
I shall take a good look
at your new coachman when I come back.

227
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:38,960
- Thank you.
- Now, goodbye.

228
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:40,560
Goodbye.

229
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:44,440
Goodbye.

230
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:51,000
Keep an eye on her, Nanine.

231
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:54,520
Two thousand two hundred and forty
for this magnificent pair of chestnuts.

232
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:56,760
They're the finest pair
in the whole of France.

233
00:17:56,920 --> 00:17:58,640
Why, they're worth 5000 at least.

234
00:17:58,800 --> 00:18:01,160
- Two thousand five hundred.
- Bid, Nanine, 3000.

235
00:18:01,320 --> 00:18:04,040
- Twenty-five hundred once.
- Three thousand.

236
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:06,560
So that's what you came for.
I might've known it.

237
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:08,920
Three thousand and one hundred francs.

238
00:18:09,080 --> 00:18:10,960
Three thousand seven hundred and fifty.

239
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:13,920
- Four thousand. Four!
- Four thousand.

240
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:17,880
Four thousand for this fine pair of chestnuts
which is easily worth 7.

241
00:18:18,040 --> 00:18:20,360
- Oh, that's too much.
- Of course. Don't bid anymore.

242
00:18:20,520 --> 00:18:21,640
- I won't.
- No.

243
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:23,440
Four thousand one hundred.

244
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:26,680
- Four thousand one hundred.
- Four thousand five hundred.

245
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:29,880
- Five thousand!
- Five thousand. Five thousand!

246
00:18:30,040 --> 00:18:34,160
Five thousand francs for this magnificent
pair of chestnuts, ladies and gentlemen.

247
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:36,000
They can be sold any day for 10.

248
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:39,400
- Five thousand one hundred.
- Six thousand.

249
00:18:39,560 --> 00:18:42,680
- Six thousand.
- Six thousand. Six thousand.

250
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:45,560
Six thousand francs.
Six thousand francs.

251
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:51,320
Ladies and gentlemen. Once, twice.
Ladies and gentlemen, sold at 6000 francs.

252
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:55,920
Well, I hope they don't run away
and kill you. I hear they're none too safe.

253
00:18:56,080 --> 00:18:57,760
Go settle with the auctioneer, Nanine.

254
00:18:57,920 --> 00:19:00,480
Tell the old coachman
we'll take him with the horses.

255
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:04,320
- You really have a heart, Marguerite.
- Yes. It's going to cost her a lot.

256
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:07,040
- I hope mine never gets that soft.
- Don't worry, it won't.

257
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:10,880
It's a great mistake for any woman
to have a heart bigger than her purse.

258
00:19:11,040 --> 00:19:13,320
Prudence, did you invite them
to my party tomorrow?

259
00:19:13,480 --> 00:19:15,160
I thought the baron disliked parties.

260
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:17,440
He won't be there.
He'd be bored with my friends.

261
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:20,880
- Have you quarreled?
- Not yet, but don't give up hope, Olympe.

262
00:19:24,440 --> 00:19:27,160
- Nichette.
- Marguerite.

263
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:29,800
How well you look. How happy.
It must be love.

264
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:32,120
- It is.
- Still the same young man?

265
00:19:32,280 --> 00:19:36,560
Of course. And just think, Marguerite.
He talks of our getting married.

266
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:39,640
Just as soon as he's passed
his examinations and is a real lawyer.

267
00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:42,920
- You seem to think that's very fine of him.
- But of course I do.

268
00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:45,800
After all, I have no dowry,
and he's a gentleman and educated.

269
00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:48,800
Even so, why should the mention
of marriage go to your head?

270
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:52,640
But, Marguerite, it's ideal to love,
and to marry the one you love.

271
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:56,000
I have no faith in ideals.
Amuse yourself if you wish.

272
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:58,960
But remember, you can always do better
than a penniless lawyer.

273
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:00,840
I never want to do better
than Gustave.

274
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:04,640
Well, well, time changes our minds,
as well as our hearts.

275
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:07,360
Perhaps you won't go on being
a little goose always.

276
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:09,960
Only, come and see me now and then.

277
00:20:10,120 --> 00:20:12,200
Remember, you're my oldest friend
in Paris.

278
00:20:12,360 --> 00:20:14,360
I will, Marguerite. Soon.

279
00:20:14,560 --> 00:20:17,120
I often think of those days we worked
in the linen shop.

280
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:19,960
I'm so glad to see you today
and that you're looking so well.

281
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:22,520
I always look well
when I'm near death.

282
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:40,000
Armand Duval.

283
00:20:41,160 --> 00:20:44,800
- Where are my marrons glacés?
- I ate them, Madame, six months ago.

284
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:46,400
What a pity.

285
00:20:46,560 --> 00:20:50,760
However, I'm glad of this opportunity
of returning something belonging to you.

286
00:20:50,920 --> 00:20:53,880
- Yes?
- I found it on the floor when I came back.

287
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:56,360
- And you kept it with you all this time?
- Yes.

288
00:20:56,520 --> 00:20:59,960
- Always with you?
- Always with me, like an old friend...

289
00:21:00,160 --> 00:21:02,680
...to remind me that I'm not
the Baron de Varville.

290
00:21:04,160 --> 00:21:08,520
- That's not a very romantic reason.
- No, I kept it as a warning against romance.

291
00:21:08,680 --> 00:21:12,040
How sensible.
Has it made you very cynical?

292
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:15,880
- Yes, very.
- Is that why you've never called on me?

293
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:19,520
- Perhaps.
- I'm sorry. One needs friends.

294
00:21:19,680 --> 00:21:21,720
Well, I've been looking for you.

295
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:24,720
Monsieur, you can see for yourself,
she's quite well again.

296
00:21:24,920 --> 00:21:26,680
Oh, no, Nanine.

297
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:29,240
Well, or would be
if she took proper care of herself.

298
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:31,640
Why would my health interest
Monsieur Duval?

299
00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:33,800
Because he came every day
when you were ill...

300
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:36,080
...to ask how you were
and to leave flowers.

301
00:21:38,560 --> 00:21:39,760
He's the one?

302
00:21:39,920 --> 00:21:42,840
Tell her yourself.
He just said "a friend," so I thought...

303
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:47,200
- All right, Nanine. Wait for me downstairs.
- Yes, Madame. Monsieur.

304
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:56,240
- You might have asked to have seen me.
- Well, I knew there were so many others.

305
00:21:56,480 --> 00:21:57,840
There were no others.

306
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:01,560
None during all those weeks
the doctors thought I might die.

307
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:03,320
Not even the Baron de Varville?

308
00:22:03,480 --> 00:22:06,400
Baron de Varville chose
to be in England at the time.

309
00:22:06,560 --> 00:22:10,520
No, you were the only one
that took the trouble to ring my bell.

310
00:22:10,680 --> 00:22:15,000
- But now...
- Now I'm well again, and all goes merrily.

311
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:19,160
Would you come to a party I'm giving
tomorrow night? It's my birthday.

312
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:21,440
Aren't you afraid
you're not strong enough yet?

313
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:24,280
Oh, I'm afraid of nothing
except being bored.

314
00:22:24,440 --> 00:22:27,480
- It's supper after the theater.
- Thank you, I'll come with pleasure.

315
00:22:27,640 --> 00:22:29,880
And bring this book as a present.
Have you read it?

316
00:22:30,040 --> 00:22:32,360
<i>- I never read anything. What is it?
- Manon Lescaut.</i>

317
00:22:32,520 --> 00:22:34,400
- Who was she?
- A beautiful girl...

318
00:22:34,560 --> 00:22:36,520
...who lived for love and pleasure.

319
00:22:36,680 --> 00:22:39,120
It's a beautiful color.
It should be a very good story.

320
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:42,400
Yes, it is, but it's rather sad.
She dies in the end.

321
00:22:42,560 --> 00:22:46,000
Well, then I'll keep it, but I won't read it.
I don't like sad thoughts.

322
00:22:46,160 --> 00:22:48,560
However, we all die.

323
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:52,960
So perhaps this will be sold again
someday at an auction after my death.

324
00:22:53,960 --> 00:22:57,880
- I thought you didn't like sad thoughts.
- I don't. But they come sometimes.

325
00:22:58,080 --> 00:23:00,120
<i>- Au revoir, Monsieur Duval.
- Goodbye.</i>

326
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:09,320
Marguerite, my child, are we waiting
for someone, my dear?

327
00:23:09,480 --> 00:23:11,920
- Or are we just waiting for supper?
- Both.

328
00:23:14,360 --> 00:23:16,840
I was so afraid you wouldn't come.

329
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:19,720
- Here's the book I brought you.
- Thank you.

330
00:23:19,880 --> 00:23:22,040
We were just about to sit down.

331
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:25,320
- Will you come?
- Oh, I remember you, young man.

332
00:23:25,480 --> 00:23:28,880
- You're the bogus baron.
- Tactful as always, Prudence.

333
00:23:29,040 --> 00:23:31,640
- You may all sit where you wish.
- Thank you so much.

334
00:23:31,800 --> 00:23:34,840
Now, I'm going to sit next to Gaston,
and you sit over here.

335
00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:36,280
Thank you.

336
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:40,560
Oh, Marguerite,
how charming this table looks.

337
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:47,560
- And how are you this evening, Madame?
- Very well, and how are you, monsieur?

338
00:23:47,720 --> 00:23:50,680
Good gracious, listen to them.
Why so formal?

339
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:52,760
Why not? This is a very elegant soiree.

340
00:23:52,920 --> 00:23:56,280
Well, elegant or not,
if I'm going to enjoy my supper...

341
00:23:56,480 --> 00:23:59,640
...I've got to take off these tight shoes.
Help me, Gaston.

342
00:23:59,800 --> 00:24:01,680
Can't you manage to hold it
a little higher?

343
00:24:01,880 --> 00:24:03,160
There.

344
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:09,920
- What are those little fellas on that dish?
- Partridges, Madame.

345
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:12,920
- Put some on my plate.
- Some? How many do you think you'll get?

346
00:24:13,080 --> 00:24:15,000
Partridges are not oysters, you know.

347
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:17,280
Well, they don't look
much bigger than oysters.

348
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:21,480
- What's the joke?
- The funniest story I've ever heard...

349
00:24:21,640 --> 00:24:24,240
...in my life. I shall die!

350
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:27,520
- Tell me, tell me.
- Get closer.

351
00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:35,800
- Tell me.
- Oh, no, tell me.

352
00:24:35,960 --> 00:24:37,600
Well, no fair. Tell us all.

353
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:47,320
Tell me the story, Gaston.

354
00:24:52,840 --> 00:24:56,240
I know what's coming, but you go on.

355
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:59,280
I want a laugh too. Tell me the story.

356
00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:03,480
I'll tell you. You've probably heard
it before. It's as old as Prudence.

357
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:07,280
- What's that about my being old?
- I said that the story was as old as you are.

358
00:25:07,720 --> 00:25:09,280
I'm 36.

359
00:25:12,160 --> 00:25:15,880
Drink your wine, Armand.
He's as sad as a drinking song.

360
00:25:16,040 --> 00:25:17,720
What's the matter? Are you shocked?

361
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:22,000
No, certainly not.
Only, I know all Gaston's jokes.

362
00:25:22,160 --> 00:25:24,080
In fact, I told him most of them.

363
00:25:25,160 --> 00:25:27,800
I'd sooner they weren't repeated
at your table.

364
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:30,280
Oh, come, come.

365
00:25:30,440 --> 00:25:34,720
You must remember, I'm not a colonel's
daughter just out of the convent.

366
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:41,320
Bravo! Bravo!

367
00:25:48,040 --> 00:25:52,520
I do this better than anybody.
Nobody can do it as well as I can.

368
00:25:52,680 --> 00:25:56,320
- Slower, Charles, you're going too fast.
- You're getting tired.

369
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:58,680
If you don't stop playing,
Olympe will drop dead.

370
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:02,040
She can't keep that up forever,
she's not so young.

371
00:26:02,360 --> 00:26:05,240
Faster, I'm just getting into the mood.

372
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:06,840
You'll drop, dear.

373
00:26:09,040 --> 00:26:10,960
Well, go ahead and drop. I don't care.

374
00:26:15,080 --> 00:26:19,240
- Sit beside me, dear.
- I'm not tired.

375
00:26:21,280 --> 00:26:23,800
I appreciate you. I love you.

376
00:26:23,960 --> 00:26:25,240
I love you.

377
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:29,080
Now, don't go away. I adore you.

378
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:33,880
- Play a waltz, Charles.
- I don't want to. I want to play a polka.

379
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:35,760
Very well, play a polka.

380
00:26:35,920 --> 00:26:38,800
Dance with me, Gaston.
Dance, everybody.

381
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:16,440
Oh, it's you.

382
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:20,520
What's happened? You look ill too.

383
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:22,320
No, it's...

384
00:28:23,040 --> 00:28:25,560
It's seeing you like this, suffering.

385
00:28:25,720 --> 00:28:26,880
It's nothing.

386
00:28:27,040 --> 00:28:29,240
- It lasts only a minute.
- You're killing yourself.

387
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:32,360
If I am, you are the only one
who objects.

388
00:28:32,920 --> 00:28:37,160
Now, Armand, why don't you go back
and dance with one of those pretty girls.

389
00:28:42,040 --> 00:28:44,600
Come. I'll go with you.

390
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:51,240
What a child you are.

391
00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:54,200
Your hand's so hot.

392
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:58,040
Is that why you put tears on it,
to cool it?

393
00:28:58,240 --> 00:29:00,760
I know I don't mean anything to you.
I don't count.

394
00:29:00,920 --> 00:29:03,160
But someone ought to look after you.

395
00:29:03,680 --> 00:29:05,720
And I could if you'd let me.

396
00:29:06,600 --> 00:29:09,920
Too much wine
has made you sentimental.

397
00:29:13,360 --> 00:29:17,600
It wasn't wine that made me come every
day for months to find out how you were.

398
00:29:18,440 --> 00:29:21,080
No, that couldn't have been wine.

399
00:29:21,960 --> 00:29:24,120
- So you'd really like to take care of me?
- Yes.

400
00:29:24,280 --> 00:29:27,960
- All day, every day?
- All day, every day. Why not?

401
00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:30,760
Why should you care
for a woman like me?

402
00:29:30,920 --> 00:29:34,600
I'm always nervous or sick
or sad or too gay.

403
00:29:35,720 --> 00:29:37,720
But I do care for you.

404
00:29:38,360 --> 00:29:41,440
You know what you should do?
You should get married.

405
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:46,520
Come, come.

406
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:47,960
You're young and sensitive.

407
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:50,840
The sort of company you're in tonight
doesn't suit you at all.

408
00:29:51,040 --> 00:29:52,640
- Nor you.
- Nonsense.

409
00:29:52,800 --> 00:29:55,960
These are the only friends I have,
and I'm no better than they are.

410
00:29:56,720 --> 00:30:00,880
However, I've given you
some very good advice.

411
00:30:01,040 --> 00:30:02,840
Now, let's go back.

412
00:30:11,480 --> 00:30:14,480
What on earth am I going
to do with you?

413
00:30:18,360 --> 00:30:20,560
No one has ever loved you
as I love you.

414
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:23,880
That may be true,
but what can I do about it?

415
00:30:24,840 --> 00:30:28,200
You should go away
and not see me anymore.

416
00:30:31,080 --> 00:30:33,280
But don't go in anger.

417
00:30:33,640 --> 00:30:36,440
Why don't you laugh at yourself a little
as I laugh at myself...

418
00:30:36,600 --> 00:30:41,120
...and come and talk to me
once in a while in a friendly way.

419
00:30:41,480 --> 00:30:44,440
That's too much. And not enough.

420
00:30:46,560 --> 00:30:49,400
Don't you believe in love, Marguerite?

421
00:30:51,720 --> 00:30:54,200
I don't think I know what it is.

422
00:30:54,360 --> 00:30:57,440
- Oh, thank you.
- For what?

423
00:30:57,600 --> 00:30:59,800
For never having been in love.

424
00:31:00,680 --> 00:31:02,480
How funny you are.

425
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:06,000
That's right, laugh at me.

426
00:31:06,160 --> 00:31:08,880
Perhaps your laughter will cure me.
Nothing else seems to.

427
00:31:09,040 --> 00:31:11,720
I believe you're sincere, at least.

428
00:31:13,560 --> 00:31:16,360
After all, when one may not have
long to live...

429
00:31:16,520 --> 00:31:18,600
...why shouldn't one have fancies?

430
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:24,720
You see, I'm not laughing anymore.

431
00:31:32,600 --> 00:31:34,840
Take this and come back to me
when it dies.

432
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:37,520
- How soon will that be?
- Tomorrow night.

433
00:31:37,680 --> 00:31:39,280
Look...

434
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:42,440
...it's dead already. Now.

435
00:31:42,600 --> 00:31:45,440
- That's impossible.
- It's not. Send those people away.

436
00:31:45,640 --> 00:31:47,560
- I can't.
- I will. I'll tell them you're ill.

437
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:50,440
It's true. You're too ill to talk
with anyone but me tonight.

438
00:31:50,600 --> 00:31:52,000
If they go, you must go too.

439
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:53,440
- What?
- Yes.

440
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:57,840
Come back later, alone, so we'll have
supper in here tonight.

441
00:31:59,080 --> 00:32:02,560
Go in the other room, and I'll have
Nanine get rid of you all.

442
00:32:06,320 --> 00:32:08,520
You're not sending me for
marrons glacés, are you?

443
00:32:08,680 --> 00:32:11,160
How do I know you'll let me
in when I come back?

444
00:32:18,680 --> 00:32:22,320
There. You can let yourself in
when you come back.

445
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:24,520
You're an angel.

446
00:32:25,080 --> 00:32:27,240
I won't go, I can't.

447
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:38,240
Marguerite Gautier.

448
00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:53,760
Stretch your legs, ladies!
Remember, the hat's full of money...

449
00:32:53,920 --> 00:32:56,840
...and the one kicking it
out of my hand gets it all!

450
00:32:58,360 --> 00:33:01,000
Out of my way, everybody!

451
00:33:06,520 --> 00:33:12,360
Get back! I don't have to run a mile
to get my leg up.

452
00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:18,440
Let me try.

453
00:33:24,400 --> 00:33:25,960
Again.

454
00:33:26,520 --> 00:33:30,520
- Madame Prudence. Madame Prudence!
- Hello! Hello, Nanine.

455
00:33:30,680 --> 00:33:33,040
Madame is sorry,
but she must send everybody away.

456
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:36,560
Oh, what a pity. Just when we were having
such a good time too.

457
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:38,360
Bad news, everybody. Party's over.

458
00:33:38,520 --> 00:33:41,040
- What?
- Marguerite wants us to go home.

459
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:43,400
She started to cough while dancing.
She was ill.

460
00:33:43,560 --> 00:33:45,880
She's always ill
when anybody's having fun.

461
00:33:46,040 --> 00:33:48,040
What's the matter?
Did she drink too much?

462
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:49,360
Don't be a cat, Olympe.

463
00:33:49,520 --> 00:33:51,880
- Well, it's late anyhow.
- Let's go somewhere else.

464
00:33:52,080 --> 00:33:54,320
Let's go to my place!

465
00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:57,000
I wanna keep trying till I kick it.

466
00:33:57,160 --> 00:34:01,040
What about something to eat?
I'm just beginning to be hungry again.

467
00:34:02,520 --> 00:34:05,720
I think that I'll take some food.
Come get some, everybody!

468
00:34:05,880 --> 00:34:09,600
Don't forget the cheese!
Somebody bring the cheese.

469
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:12,000
Forward march!

470
00:34:20,280 --> 00:34:23,640
- But I thought you wanted your hair done.
- I do.

471
00:34:23,800 --> 00:34:26,920
- Have they been gone long?
- Just about half an hour.

472
00:34:27,080 --> 00:34:30,520
- Nanine, you told the servants to go to bed?
- They've gone.

473
00:34:30,680 --> 00:34:33,720
- But I fixed supper for the two of you.
- Oh, good, Nanine.

474
00:34:33,880 --> 00:34:38,040
Darling Nanine, perfect Nanine,
hurry up.

475
00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:04,080
- Good evening, my dear.
- Good evening.

476
00:35:05,800 --> 00:35:08,800
You've lost no time in celebrating
my departure, I see.

477
00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:11,280
So you didn't go to Russia after all.

478
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:14,320
- I had an idea you wouldn't.
- No.

479
00:35:15,400 --> 00:35:18,560
You may flatter yourself.
I can't do without you.

480
00:35:19,120 --> 00:35:23,240
After driving most of the day, I turned
round and drove most of the night back.

481
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:25,360
What's this? More supper.

482
00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:30,400
- For two. Whom were you expecting?
- You. Put it there, Nanine.

483
00:35:30,560 --> 00:35:34,240
I have learned never to believe a man
when he says he's leaving town.

484
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:37,280
- Won't you have something to eat?
- I'm not hungry.

485
00:35:37,480 --> 00:35:39,240
Then drink something.

486
00:35:39,400 --> 00:35:40,560
Come and drink with me.

487
00:35:40,720 --> 00:35:43,600
- I'm not thirsty.
- I am.

488
00:35:55,240 --> 00:35:58,520
- Many happy returns.
- Thank you.

489
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:12,400
This part is so difficult.

490
00:36:12,560 --> 00:36:16,280
- I hate all the sharps.
- I'm afraid your mind's not on it.

491
00:36:16,440 --> 00:36:19,400
Why, you know very well
I've never been able to play it.

492
00:36:20,520 --> 00:36:23,040
- But you play it beautifully.
- My one merit.

493
00:36:23,200 --> 00:36:27,000
- Won't you play it for me?
- Aren't you tired? It's very late.

494
00:36:27,160 --> 00:36:30,360
- Probably are wishing I'd go home.
- Please play.

495
00:36:41,360 --> 00:36:43,080
Oh, good, Nanine.

496
00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:45,960
Bolt the door. If the bell rings,
don't answer it.

497
00:36:46,160 --> 00:36:48,840
- No, I won't.
- Have you two finished whispering?

498
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:52,520
I'm sorry. I was just giving
Nanine some orders.

499
00:36:52,720 --> 00:36:54,840
I don't doubt it.

500
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:57,760
Now, play nicely.

501
00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:21,000
Someday I shall get temperamental and
object when doorbells ring when I play.

502
00:37:21,840 --> 00:37:23,760
Did the doorbell ring?

503
00:37:24,520 --> 00:37:27,280
Does my music shut out
the rest of the world for you?

504
00:37:27,440 --> 00:37:32,200
- Yes. You play beautifully.
- You lie beautifully.

505
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:35,720
Thank you. That's more than I deserve.

506
00:37:36,440 --> 00:37:39,400
It's not half as much
as you deserve, my dear.

507
00:37:43,080 --> 00:37:45,040
- I'll see who it is.
- No, I'll tell you.

508
00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:46,440
Yes?

509
00:37:46,640 --> 00:37:49,320
- But you won't believe me.
- No, I won't. Who is it?

510
00:37:49,520 --> 00:37:52,760
Well, I might say that there is someone
at the wrong door...

511
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:57,160
...or the great romance of my life.

512
00:37:57,360 --> 00:38:00,400
The great romance of your life?
Charming.

513
00:38:01,640 --> 00:38:03,600
Well, it might have been.

514
00:38:15,600 --> 00:38:17,800
Let your godmother take your veil.

515
00:38:17,960 --> 00:38:22,120
Oh, no, just a moment.
I want one more look at her.

516
00:38:22,280 --> 00:38:25,520
The way she looked when she
made her first communion.

517
00:38:25,680 --> 00:38:30,280
God keep you always so pure
and happy, my child.

518
00:38:31,400 --> 00:38:33,640
Come, come and sit down.

519
00:38:46,080 --> 00:38:49,200
And now, children,
on this happy occasion...

520
00:38:49,360 --> 00:38:53,640
...I ask you all to rise and drink a toast
to the happiness of this family.

521
00:38:53,800 --> 00:38:56,200
- We certainly will, sir.
- Oh, of course, a toast.

522
00:38:56,400 --> 00:38:58,520
- To health and happiness.
- Health and happiness.

523
00:38:59,400 --> 00:39:04,480
Now may I propose the happiness of my
sister and my friend, Louise and Valentine...

524
00:39:04,640 --> 00:39:07,880
...who've known each other from childhood
and are soon to be man and wife.

525
00:39:08,080 --> 00:39:11,720
- Louise and Valentine.
- Thank you, thank you.

526
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:16,040
Now, Ma, you must go in for your nap.

527
00:39:16,200 --> 00:39:20,360
- Take my arm, Mama.
- Such a happy day.

528
00:39:22,640 --> 00:39:24,880
Well, my boy, I'm glad you got down...

529
00:39:25,040 --> 00:39:27,840
...even though you weren't in time
to go with us to the church.

530
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:30,040
I came for a purely selfish reason, Father.

531
00:39:30,200 --> 00:39:32,200
- You in debt?
- No, no, it isn't that.

532
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:33,800
In love?

533
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:36,360
- Wrong again.
- Well, what then?

534
00:39:36,560 --> 00:39:38,240
- I want to travel.
- Where?

535
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:39,760
Anywhere. Everywhere.

536
00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:42,320
I'm tired of waiting for the office
to give me a post.

537
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:45,160
If I ever do get one, the more I know
the world, the better.

538
00:39:45,320 --> 00:39:47,840
Well, it mightn't be a bad idea.

539
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:51,040
Your income won't let you go very far
in any great style.

540
00:39:51,200 --> 00:39:54,280
- I could use some of the principal.
- You will do nothing of the sort.

541
00:39:54,440 --> 00:39:57,480
Your grandfather's legacy
mustn't be touched.

542
00:39:57,680 --> 00:40:00,600
However, I have a few thousand francs
I can spare.

543
00:40:00,760 --> 00:40:04,640
- You mean, you'll give me the money?
- I don't know where else you'd get it.

544
00:40:04,840 --> 00:40:07,960
You're not such a bad son.
When do you want to start?

545
00:40:08,120 --> 00:40:11,080
At once. If I get back to Paris
tomorrow, the next morning.

546
00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:12,440
Well...

547
00:40:12,600 --> 00:40:14,640
Ready, Marguerite?

548
00:40:15,720 --> 00:40:18,960
But we planned to go to the theater.
Why aren't you dressed?

549
00:40:19,120 --> 00:40:22,400
- I've changed my mind, Prudence.
- Oh, come now, get dressed. I'll wait.

550
00:40:22,560 --> 00:40:26,080
No, no, no.
Look, how do you spell "apology"?

551
00:40:26,240 --> 00:40:29,400
Good gracious, how should I know?
I'm no scholar.

552
00:40:29,560 --> 00:40:31,640
Even so, you've been living in Paris.

553
00:40:31,800 --> 00:40:34,120
Six years ago, I couldn't even
write my own name.

554
00:40:34,280 --> 00:40:36,440
Here's a letter which just came.

555
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:40,320
Perhaps Nanine knows how
to spell "apology. "

556
00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:43,840
She asked me that once before today.
Is it the same apology?

557
00:40:48,720 --> 00:40:51,520
Oh, don't bother. It isn't necessary now.

558
00:40:51,680 --> 00:40:56,840
If that young man has made you unhappy,
he's the one who should spell "apology. "

559
00:41:03,360 --> 00:41:05,600
It's all my fault.

560
00:41:05,880 --> 00:41:08,200
He's going away, Prudence.

561
00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:11,680
Stop your nonsense. He won't go.
They never do.

562
00:41:11,840 --> 00:41:15,640
No, I think he means it.
And perhaps it's better.

563
00:41:16,520 --> 00:41:18,640
But he had no right to write
such things to me.

564
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:21,520
Of course he didn't. Now, come along.
Let's go to the theater.

565
00:41:21,680 --> 00:41:25,080
But first you'll stop at his place
and find out if he's really going away.

566
00:41:31,680 --> 00:41:34,320
Why on earth does anyone
live four flights up?

567
00:41:34,480 --> 00:41:37,120
- You've come with a message.
- Yes, I've got to sit down...

568
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:38,600
...before I can talk.

569
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:40,720
- From Mademoiselle Gautier?
- Yes.

570
00:41:40,880 --> 00:41:42,280
Girl's a fool.

571
00:41:42,480 --> 00:41:45,400
She wants to know if you're really
starting out to see the world...

572
00:41:45,560 --> 00:41:47,040
...as you wrote her yesterday.

573
00:41:47,240 --> 00:41:50,560
- Yes, it's true. I'm leaving in the morning.
- Good.

574
00:41:50,720 --> 00:41:53,360
You and Marguerite are safer apart.

575
00:41:58,120 --> 00:42:00,960
Didn't I tell you to wait in the carriage?

576
00:42:03,520 --> 00:42:05,880
Oh, so you really are going away,
Armand Duval?

577
00:42:06,040 --> 00:42:07,320
Yes.

578
00:42:09,080 --> 00:42:11,240
Wait down in the carriage
yourself, Prudence.

579
00:42:11,400 --> 00:42:14,440
Oh, very well,
since I'm not wanted here.

580
00:42:15,640 --> 00:42:18,560
No, I think I'd better stay.

581
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:21,080
I think you'd better not.

582
00:42:24,640 --> 00:42:27,360
- Oh, don't!
- Haven't got much time if you want it back.

583
00:42:27,520 --> 00:42:30,400
Oh, don't. Don't, Marguerite.

584
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:36,480
Oh, what a girl. What a tease!

585
00:42:44,480 --> 00:42:46,960
You wrote me an unkind letter.

586
00:42:48,600 --> 00:42:51,360
What did you expect?
I saw the baron's carriage.

587
00:42:51,520 --> 00:42:54,040
- You were jealous.
- Of course.

588
00:42:55,920 --> 00:42:58,200
Well, then you do right in going away.

589
00:42:58,840 --> 00:43:01,760
Well, what does it matter
whether I go or stay?

590
00:43:02,640 --> 00:43:06,000
I played the fool again, and you've
probably been laughing at me ever since.

591
00:43:06,160 --> 00:43:08,360
I didn't laugh at all.

592
00:43:08,520 --> 00:43:13,160
I was angry because you dared write
such things to me, but I didn't laugh.

593
00:43:15,600 --> 00:43:18,320
You should have known
it was because I loved you.

594
00:43:22,040 --> 00:43:27,400
You know, once I had a little dog,
and he always looked sad when I was sad...

595
00:43:27,600 --> 00:43:29,800
...and I loved him so.

596
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:34,880
And when your tears fell on my hand,
I loved you too all at once.

597
00:43:36,560 --> 00:43:39,960
There are things that you wouldn't
understand, so that's why...

598
00:43:41,080 --> 00:43:43,000
Who's that pretty girl?

599
00:43:44,480 --> 00:43:46,440
My sister Louise.

600
00:43:47,440 --> 00:43:50,080
- And the other one?
- Another sister.

601
00:43:50,680 --> 00:43:53,600
- And that's your mother, isn't it?
- Yes.

602
00:43:53,920 --> 00:43:55,160
How happy she looks.

603
00:43:55,320 --> 00:43:57,960
- Does your father love her very much?
- Of course.

604
00:43:58,160 --> 00:44:00,360
Why, they must've been married
a long time.

605
00:44:00,520 --> 00:44:02,280
Nearly 30 years.

606
00:44:02,480 --> 00:44:05,000
And they loved each other
all that time?

607
00:44:05,680 --> 00:44:09,320
Yes. You sound as though
you didn't believe it.

608
00:44:10,800 --> 00:44:14,600
It's hard to believe that there's
such happiness in this world.

609
00:44:16,760 --> 00:44:18,600
Marguerite...

610
00:44:18,760 --> 00:44:21,440
...now you've put tears on my hand.

611
00:44:22,320 --> 00:44:23,720
Why?

612
00:44:25,960 --> 00:44:30,440
You will never love me 30 years.
No one will.

613
00:44:30,720 --> 00:44:34,360
I'll love you all my life.
I know that now.

614
00:44:34,800 --> 00:44:36,640
All my life.

615
00:44:40,800 --> 00:44:43,360
Sleepy head.

616
00:44:44,160 --> 00:44:47,320
I wasn't asleep. I was dreaming.

617
00:44:47,480 --> 00:44:50,120
- Yes?
- Of you.

618
00:44:50,680 --> 00:44:55,320
- And?
- We were in the country, alone, far away.

619
00:44:55,600 --> 00:44:57,520
I wish we were.

620
00:44:57,680 --> 00:45:01,560
- Marguerite, let me take you to the country.
- Yes.

621
00:45:01,720 --> 00:45:05,000
- Any day you like.
- I mean, let me take you for a long time.

622
00:45:05,160 --> 00:45:06,840
Until you're well and strong again.

623
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:09,560
- Oh, what nonsense.
- Why is it nonsense?

624
00:45:09,720 --> 00:45:12,800
- It costs money to go to the country.
- I have money.

625
00:45:12,960 --> 00:45:15,560
Yes, how much?

626
00:45:15,760 --> 00:45:17,960
Seven thousand francs a year.

627
00:45:18,400 --> 00:45:20,000
I spend more than that in a month...

628
00:45:20,160 --> 00:45:23,880
...and I have never been too particular
where it came from, as you probably know.

629
00:45:24,080 --> 00:45:26,800
- Don't say such things.
- Well, it's true.

630
00:45:28,160 --> 00:45:29,800
Give up the baron.

631
00:45:33,680 --> 00:45:36,120
I must give you up.

632
00:45:36,760 --> 00:45:39,760
I've told you before
that you should forget me.

633
00:45:39,920 --> 00:45:44,560
So you go on your trip around the world
and put me out of your mind.

634
00:45:47,080 --> 00:45:49,280
I thought I meant something to you.

635
00:45:49,560 --> 00:45:52,920
You mean too much already.

636
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:56,960
But you're young,
and your life is before you.

637
00:45:57,120 --> 00:45:58,960
You know what mine
has been already.

638
00:45:59,120 --> 00:46:02,440
- It doesn't matter.
- Doesn't it?

639
00:46:03,040 --> 00:46:04,760
Marguerite...

640
00:46:04,920 --> 00:46:07,840
...you need love more than
you need money just now.

641
00:46:08,040 --> 00:46:10,200
You need care even more than love.

642
00:46:10,360 --> 00:46:14,120
I can take such good care of you,
if you'll let me.

643
00:46:17,040 --> 00:46:19,560
You wouldn't be happy with me.

644
00:46:20,160 --> 00:46:21,560
No, probably not.

645
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:23,720
Nor you with me.

646
00:46:23,920 --> 00:46:26,000
I'll leave Paris today.

647
00:46:27,400 --> 00:46:30,960
I was...
I was only thinking of you, my dear.

648
00:46:31,120 --> 00:46:34,480
I wasn't thinking of myself, really.

649
00:46:37,360 --> 00:46:39,440
Then come to the country with me.

650
00:46:39,600 --> 00:46:43,080
Well, if I should, for a little while...

651
00:46:43,240 --> 00:46:46,800
...promise not to be jealous and not to think
things that'll make you miserable.

652
00:46:46,960 --> 00:46:48,080
Yes, I promise.

653
00:46:48,240 --> 00:46:50,920
- Swear?
- I swear not to be jealous if you...

654
00:46:51,120 --> 00:46:52,560
If...?

655
00:46:52,720 --> 00:46:55,760
- If you swear not to see the baron again.
- No, you see?

656
00:46:55,920 --> 00:46:59,080
- You will only torture yourself.
- But if you swear.

657
00:46:59,280 --> 00:47:02,120
One hour from now, you will ask me
to swear about something else.

658
00:47:02,280 --> 00:47:05,160
- You can't be sensible, Armand.
- It's true, I can't.

659
00:47:05,360 --> 00:47:08,840
- I want too much.
- So do I.

660
00:47:09,040 --> 00:47:14,160
How can one change one's entire life and
build a new one on one moment of love?

661
00:47:14,320 --> 00:47:17,280
And yet that's what you make me
want to close my eyes and do.

662
00:47:17,440 --> 00:47:21,120
Then close your eyes and say yes.
I command it.

663
00:47:21,280 --> 00:47:24,320
Yes. Yes. Yes.

664
00:47:30,320 --> 00:47:34,120
I'm going to tell him
that I love somebody else.

665
00:47:34,720 --> 00:47:36,840
I'm going to the country for the summer...

666
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:40,600
...and I'm never going to see him again.
- Are you crazy?

667
00:47:41,480 --> 00:47:43,960
You may be a fool, but I thought
you were an honest girl.

668
00:47:44,120 --> 00:47:47,080
It's because she's honest
she's telling the baron they're through.

669
00:47:47,280 --> 00:47:50,760
What about the money she owes?
Who's gonna pay it?

670
00:47:50,920 --> 00:47:53,440
I knew you'd ruin yourself
and everybody who trusted you.

671
00:47:53,600 --> 00:47:56,360
- How dare you say such things about her?
- It's true.

672
00:47:56,520 --> 00:48:00,920
Doesn't she owe me, me personally,
more than 17,000 francs?

673
00:48:01,080 --> 00:48:05,600
Do you think I'd let her leave Paris without
having the law on her unless she pays?

674
00:48:05,760 --> 00:48:07,880
I'm going to the country just the same.

675
00:48:08,080 --> 00:48:12,000
And what do you think will happen when
the rest of your creditors hear about it...

676
00:48:12,160 --> 00:48:14,800
...and come down on Armand Duval
for your debts?

677
00:48:14,960 --> 00:48:17,120
- They couldn't do that.
- Wait and see.

678
00:48:17,280 --> 00:48:21,280
They'll be after you in a pack.
A pretty holiday you'll have.

679
00:48:22,800 --> 00:48:26,440
Why can't anything ever be perfect once?

680
00:48:27,120 --> 00:48:29,080
What shall I do, Prudence?

681
00:48:29,240 --> 00:48:31,880
You can ask the baron
for money for your debts.

682
00:48:32,080 --> 00:48:35,560
- Now that I'm going to leave him?
- You don't have to tell him everything.

683
00:48:35,760 --> 00:48:39,400
She's right, Madame. If you've really set
your heart on going to the country...

684
00:48:39,560 --> 00:48:42,040
...you've got to get some money
from someone, somehow.

685
00:48:42,200 --> 00:48:45,120
What is the matter with you
anyway, Marguerite?

686
00:48:45,280 --> 00:48:49,200
Have you suddenly become
a sentimental schoolgirl?

687
00:48:50,800 --> 00:48:55,080
There's the baron now. The sooner
this matter's settled, the better.

688
00:48:57,840 --> 00:49:02,160
Oh, my dear baron, hail and farewell.

689
00:49:04,840 --> 00:49:07,920
I do hope you will encourage
this new plan of Marguerite's.

690
00:49:08,080 --> 00:49:10,960
A few months in the country would do
her a world of good.

691
00:49:11,120 --> 00:49:13,000
I know the doctor insists on it.

692
00:49:13,160 --> 00:49:14,760
- Really?
- Yes.

693
00:49:14,960 --> 00:49:18,240
- She'll tell you about it herself.
- I don't doubt it.

694
00:49:23,440 --> 00:49:24,960
Busy?

695
00:49:25,160 --> 00:49:26,880
Hello.

696
00:49:27,280 --> 00:49:29,760
Don't you think these accounts
are in a beautiful order?

697
00:49:29,920 --> 00:49:31,200
Beautiful.

698
00:49:31,360 --> 00:49:34,000
- Do you think me very businesslike?
- Very.

699
00:49:34,440 --> 00:49:36,080
But why?

700
00:49:36,520 --> 00:49:40,480
I decided that these bills ought to be paid.
I owe 40,000 francs.

701
00:49:40,800 --> 00:49:42,880
Will you lend me the money?

702
00:49:44,240 --> 00:49:45,640
No.

703
00:49:46,880 --> 00:49:49,960
Oh, but what will I do?

704
00:49:50,280 --> 00:49:54,160
Come to Russia with me, and you can
have as much money as you want.

705
00:49:55,280 --> 00:49:59,280
If you are my friend, why won't
you lend me the money anyway?

706
00:49:59,560 --> 00:50:02,400
Because then you might have
no further use for me.

707
00:50:05,920 --> 00:50:09,120
Well, I don't think you're very generous.

708
00:50:09,920 --> 00:50:13,040
Prudence tells me you plan to go
to the country this summer.

709
00:50:13,240 --> 00:50:15,080
Prudence is a chatterbox.

710
00:50:15,800 --> 00:50:18,840
Living quietly two or three months
in the country, alone...

711
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:22,160
...obeying your doctor's orders,
sounds an admirable idea.

712
00:50:22,320 --> 00:50:24,320
But extremely unlike you.

713
00:50:24,520 --> 00:50:27,720
- What can you do about it?
- I can deliberately put you out of my mind.

714
00:50:27,880 --> 00:50:29,040
Why should you?

715
00:50:29,200 --> 00:50:31,400
It's become a question
of either avoiding you...

716
00:50:31,600 --> 00:50:33,760
...or taking you
out of this life altogether.

717
00:50:33,920 --> 00:50:37,480
What will you do with me? Lock me in that
gloomy chateau you've got somewhere?

718
00:50:37,640 --> 00:50:39,240
I might.

719
00:50:42,920 --> 00:50:44,360
No one has to tell me...

720
00:50:44,520 --> 00:50:48,360
...you've found a playmate for this
rustic holiday of yours, it's in your face.

721
00:50:48,520 --> 00:50:50,760
But my consolation is...

722
00:50:50,960 --> 00:50:53,440
...I am well rid of such a fool.

723
00:50:54,560 --> 00:50:57,960
Here's the 40,000 francs you need.
But this is my last act of consideration.

724
00:50:58,120 --> 00:51:00,560
If ever we meet again,
it will be on a different basis.

725
00:51:00,720 --> 00:51:03,400
I never make the same mistake twice.

726
00:51:06,600 --> 00:51:07,920
Thank you.

727
00:51:40,560 --> 00:51:41,560
Quiet! Quiet!

728
00:51:51,160 --> 00:51:52,880
Let her sleep.

729
00:51:56,800 --> 00:51:58,880
Oh, no.

730
00:51:59,040 --> 00:52:02,360
You look after the other luggage.
I'll take care of these jewels myself.

731
00:52:02,520 --> 00:52:04,680
- Yes, Madame.
- Thank you.

732
00:52:08,120 --> 00:52:09,680
Not very big.

733
00:52:28,040 --> 00:52:31,840
- It's not very grand.
- It's heaven.

734
00:52:41,960 --> 00:52:45,480
- Madame, are you ill?
- No, why should I be ill?

735
00:52:45,640 --> 00:52:48,200
Because you're awake at this early hour
in the morning.

736
00:52:48,400 --> 00:52:51,560
I'm not ill. I'm awake
and I want to get up, Nanine.

737
00:52:51,720 --> 00:52:54,800
Am I dreaming? Are we really here?

738
00:52:54,960 --> 00:52:57,160
We are indeed.

739
00:52:57,320 --> 00:53:01,920
If I'm not mistaken, you'll soon wish you
were in your comfortable house in Paris.

740
00:53:02,080 --> 00:53:05,560
Monsieur Duval alone will see to that.
This place is nothing but a hut.

741
00:53:05,720 --> 00:53:09,320
There are no gaslights, and you have
to fetch water from a reservoir...

742
00:53:09,520 --> 00:53:11,280
...and heat it on a stove.

743
00:53:11,440 --> 00:53:13,800
You can't sleep at night
on account of the birds...

744
00:53:13,960 --> 00:53:18,120
...and before sunup, there was a big noise
like more birds, only worse.

745
00:53:18,280 --> 00:53:20,040
Chickens, I suppose.

746
00:53:20,200 --> 00:53:25,440
And as for that linen on the beds,
it's so coarse, I scratched all night.

747
00:53:25,600 --> 00:53:28,880
And I never slept better
in my life, Nanine.

748
00:53:29,040 --> 00:53:31,640
How far is it to the inn
where Monsieur Duval is staying?

749
00:53:31,800 --> 00:53:33,960
How should I know, Madame?

750
00:53:34,160 --> 00:53:36,360
Now, come, Nanine.

751
00:53:37,760 --> 00:53:40,520
He said he'd be over early this morning.

752
00:53:41,080 --> 00:53:43,600
And I'm so hungry too.

753
00:53:47,080 --> 00:53:51,560
What delicious air.
What a heavenly room.

754
00:53:51,920 --> 00:53:54,600
Good heavens, you scared me!
Can't you knock properly?

755
00:53:54,760 --> 00:53:56,240
Not when I've got me hands full.

756
00:53:56,400 --> 00:53:58,760
A wooden shoe makes a better noise
than your knuckles.

757
00:53:58,920 --> 00:54:00,520
- Good morning, Madame.
- Good morning.

758
00:54:00,680 --> 00:54:03,400
The gentleman said you were
to have milk for your breakfast.

759
00:54:03,560 --> 00:54:05,520
Madame likes coffee for her breakfast.

760
00:54:05,680 --> 00:54:09,360
No, no, Nanine. Up in the country,
I like milk better.

761
00:54:09,760 --> 00:54:14,440
At 10:00, when it's time to have another
bite, I'll do you a couple of nice, fresh eggs.

762
00:54:14,640 --> 00:54:16,680
- What kind of cows do you keep?
- Jersey.

763
00:54:16,840 --> 00:54:20,000
I thought so, they give the best milk.
What do you feed them?

764
00:54:20,160 --> 00:54:22,760
Plenty of red clover, hay and bran mash.

765
00:54:22,920 --> 00:54:25,440
That's silly. The cows get
all the grass they need now.

766
00:54:25,600 --> 00:54:27,680
The thing is not to let them
run their feet off.

767
00:54:27,840 --> 00:54:30,720
- If they want to, you've got to let them run.
- Oh, no, you don't.

768
00:54:30,880 --> 00:54:34,960
I'll take them out walking myself someday,
and I'll show you how to manage them.

769
00:54:44,840 --> 00:54:48,600
- Tired?
- Only nicely tired.

770
00:54:49,200 --> 00:54:52,360
Let's go as far as the top of the hill
and see what's beyond.

771
00:54:52,520 --> 00:54:54,120
Yes.

772
00:54:57,640 --> 00:55:00,640
I don't care what's behind, do you?

773
00:55:00,840 --> 00:55:02,480
No.

774
00:55:07,440 --> 00:55:09,000
Look!

775
00:55:11,680 --> 00:55:14,160
Oh, what a fine sight in this light.

776
00:55:14,320 --> 00:55:17,160
- It looks like a castle of a king.
- Yes.

777
00:55:17,880 --> 00:55:20,120
When I was a little girl,
I always wanted to see...

778
00:55:20,280 --> 00:55:22,600
...what a great chateau
would look like inside.

779
00:55:24,080 --> 00:55:26,240
You are tired.

780
00:55:26,400 --> 00:55:29,760
I'm not used to long country walks yet.

781
00:55:31,240 --> 00:55:33,000
Hello!

782
00:55:36,680 --> 00:55:39,000
- Good evening.
- Good evening, monsieur.

783
00:55:39,160 --> 00:55:41,680
- Are you going any distance?
- As far as the village.

784
00:55:41,840 --> 00:55:45,520
- Good. Could you drive us part of the way?
- With pleasure, monsieur.

785
00:55:45,680 --> 00:55:47,720
- Madame.
- Thank you.

786
00:55:47,920 --> 00:55:50,960
We went much further than we realized.

787
00:55:58,120 --> 00:55:59,880
By the way, whose chateau is that?

788
00:56:00,040 --> 00:56:04,680
You must be strangers here, or you'd know
it belongs to my master, Baron de Varville.

789
00:56:25,680 --> 00:56:27,600
Nanine? Nanine.

790
00:56:27,760 --> 00:56:30,520
Put the pail down.
I'll carry it for you in a moment.

791
00:56:31,640 --> 00:56:34,160
- Hasn't any letter come for me yet?
- No, Madame.

792
00:56:34,320 --> 00:56:37,280
Take this book, and if it comes while
I am with Monsieur Armand...

793
00:56:37,440 --> 00:56:39,520
...put it in the leaves
and send the book by Jacques.

794
00:56:39,680 --> 00:56:42,640
- Very well.
- Armand must not know about this.

795
00:56:42,800 --> 00:56:44,240
Yes, Madame.

796
00:56:44,400 --> 00:56:47,160
Oh, give me the book.
I'll explain to Jacques myself.

797
00:56:49,920 --> 00:56:54,240
- She has some good reason, monsieur.
- Yes, I'm sure of that.

798
00:56:57,880 --> 00:56:59,800
Oh, there you are.

799
00:56:59,960 --> 00:57:02,560
Isn't it the most beautiful day?

800
00:57:03,400 --> 00:57:05,160
Is it so beautiful?

801
00:57:06,480 --> 00:57:09,200
Well, the birds have noticed it.

802
00:57:11,200 --> 00:57:14,440
- Why so silent?
- Why not?

803
00:57:15,320 --> 00:57:16,960
Let's sit down here.

804
00:57:22,600 --> 00:57:26,640
How good the earth smells.
Better than any perfume.

805
00:57:28,880 --> 00:57:32,640
Look, I found a four-leaf clover.
My first good luck.

806
00:57:32,800 --> 00:57:37,480
When I was little, I used to hunt for them,
thinking they would change everything.

807
00:57:38,440 --> 00:57:40,520
Why so gloomy?

808
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:43,080
If you'll smile, I'll give it to you.

809
00:57:43,240 --> 00:57:45,920
- No, you keep it, it's yours.
- Excuse me.

810
00:57:46,080 --> 00:57:50,120
- This is the book Madame was looking for...
- Oh, yes, thank you, Jacques.

811
00:57:51,200 --> 00:57:54,560
<i>- So you're reading Manon Lescaut after all.
- Yes.</i>

812
00:57:54,760 --> 00:57:57,240
- No, I won't let you.
- Why not?

813
00:57:57,400 --> 00:58:00,240
Because she was unscrupulous
and faithless, a liar and a cheat.

814
00:58:00,400 --> 00:58:02,960
Well, you used to like her.
She loved him just the same.

815
00:58:03,120 --> 00:58:05,600
He was no better than she
to share her love with others.

816
00:58:05,800 --> 00:58:08,520
- Beggars can't be choosers.
- She shouldn't love a poor man.

817
00:58:08,680 --> 00:58:10,520
You're hurting me.

818
00:58:10,760 --> 00:58:12,480
Give me that book.

819
00:58:15,560 --> 00:58:17,480
Here's the letter you were expecting.

820
00:58:17,680 --> 00:58:19,240
Read it.

821
00:58:29,640 --> 00:58:31,560
You've been selling your jewelry.

822
00:58:31,720 --> 00:58:36,560
Only a ring. So Nichette can have
a wedding dress and a small dowry.

823
00:58:37,200 --> 00:58:38,800
Forgive me.

824
00:58:40,480 --> 00:58:44,960
- Don't I always when you are jealous?
- You're an angel.

825
00:58:48,520 --> 00:58:50,600
Why don't we give Nichette
a real wedding here.

826
00:58:51,560 --> 00:58:53,000
- May I?
- Of course.

827
00:58:53,320 --> 00:58:56,440
Let's write Nichette this moment
and tell her we'll give her a wedding.

828
00:58:56,600 --> 00:58:59,040
- Will you come and spell the hard words?
- Yes.

829
00:59:30,640 --> 00:59:31,800
Amen.

830
00:59:31,960 --> 00:59:35,880
- "With this ring, I thee wed. "
- With this ring, I thee wed.

831
00:59:36,040 --> 00:59:40,000
- "And I plight unto thee my troth. "
- And I plight unto thee my troth.

832
00:59:42,720 --> 00:59:43,680
Amen.

833
00:59:43,880 --> 00:59:47,880
- "With this ring, I thee wed. "
- With this ring, I thee wed.

834
00:59:48,040 --> 00:59:52,040
- "And I plight unto thee my troth. "
- And I plight unto thee my troth.

835
00:59:54,760 --> 00:59:55,920
Amen.

836
01:00:06,280 --> 01:00:08,920
Congratulations, my boy!

837
01:00:09,080 --> 01:00:13,120
My dear! Oh, what a pity all Paris
can't see that dress.

838
01:00:13,280 --> 01:00:15,760
It's the prettiest one
we've ever turned out of the shop.

839
01:00:15,920 --> 01:00:18,040
- Oh, congratulations, my dear.
- Thank you.

840
01:00:18,200 --> 01:00:21,120
Why is everybody crying?

841
01:00:22,280 --> 01:00:27,480
Wasn't it beautiful?
Wasn't it all beautiful?

842
01:00:29,160 --> 01:00:32,520
- Who are you?
- I'm the butcher, Madame.

843
01:00:35,240 --> 01:00:37,400
Darling Marguerite.

844
01:00:38,120 --> 01:00:41,640
- Oh, thank you. Thank you so much.
- My little Nichette.

845
01:00:41,800 --> 01:00:45,160
You've made me feel like a princess
with a fine wedding gown...

846
01:00:45,320 --> 01:00:49,200
...and a dowry and such
a beautiful, beautiful wedding.

847
01:00:49,360 --> 01:00:53,320
- I must kiss the bride too.
- And I, the happy bridegroom.

848
01:01:09,400 --> 01:01:13,320
- Ready at last. Come along, come along.
- Don't hurry me.

849
01:01:16,520 --> 01:01:19,080
Wine used to go to my head
and make me gay...

850
01:01:19,240 --> 01:01:22,120
...and now it goes to my legs
and makes me old.

851
01:01:22,280 --> 01:01:23,840
- Get along, get along.
- Goodbye.

852
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:25,440
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

853
01:01:35,280 --> 01:01:38,440
What did you and Prudence have
your heads together about so long?

854
01:01:38,640 --> 01:01:40,400
I won't tell you yet.

855
01:01:40,560 --> 01:01:43,360
Of course, she thinks you're a fool
for wasting yourself on me.

856
01:01:43,520 --> 01:01:44,920
Perhaps you are.

857
01:01:45,080 --> 01:01:47,840
What did Gaston mean by
"an appointment you'd lost"?

858
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:50,640
Nothing. Some chap was given
a post by the foreign office...

859
01:01:50,800 --> 01:01:52,680
...that Gaston seemed to think I wanted.

860
01:01:52,840 --> 01:01:55,000
- Are you sure you didn't?
- Yes, quite sure.

861
01:01:55,160 --> 01:01:57,320
It meant my leaving France.

862
01:01:57,800 --> 01:02:00,680
Shall we...? Shall we go inside?

863
01:02:01,560 --> 01:02:03,880
We might go to the top of the hill.

864
01:02:04,040 --> 01:02:07,360
- Look at the baron's chateau?
- No.

865
01:02:07,520 --> 01:02:10,280
Are you going to spoil a day like this
by being jealous?

866
01:02:10,440 --> 01:02:13,000
No, of course not. Only...

867
01:02:13,160 --> 01:02:15,400
...I always know he's there.

868
01:02:15,560 --> 01:02:17,800
But I'm always here.

869
01:02:20,880 --> 01:02:23,240
Don't ever leave me.

870
01:02:25,160 --> 01:02:27,000
I never will.

871
01:02:27,600 --> 01:02:29,240
But you...

872
01:02:30,760 --> 01:02:33,920
- I can't bear our summer to end, Marguerite.
- Nor I.

873
01:02:34,080 --> 01:02:38,360
- Could you go on living like this?
- I couldn't live any other way now.

874
01:02:38,520 --> 01:02:42,400
Listen, I've written my father,
asking him to turn my money over to me.

875
01:02:42,560 --> 01:02:45,920
- Oh, why?
- So I can make plans for our future.

876
01:02:46,080 --> 01:02:49,720
And you won't have to live in two rooms
five flights up like Nichette either.

877
01:02:49,880 --> 01:02:52,800
You'll have a little house
in the garden, all your own.

878
01:02:52,960 --> 01:02:56,520
I'm leaving for Paris tomorrow to see
the lawyer who made my grandfather's will.

879
01:02:57,360 --> 01:03:00,360
- Do you know what I asked Prudence to do?
- No, what?

880
01:03:00,520 --> 01:03:02,440
Sell everything, pay everything.

881
01:03:02,600 --> 01:03:05,320
So I could take a flat like Nichette's
with what I have left.

882
01:03:05,480 --> 01:03:07,720
Really? You mean you'd give up
everything for me?

883
01:03:07,880 --> 01:03:10,880
Everything in the world. Everything.

884
01:03:14,800 --> 01:03:19,200
Never be jealous again. Never doubt
that I love you more than the world...

885
01:03:19,400 --> 01:03:21,760
...more than myself.

886
01:03:22,600 --> 01:03:24,280
Then...

887
01:03:25,200 --> 01:03:26,920
...marry me.

888
01:03:29,760 --> 01:03:32,480
- What?
- I married you today.

889
01:03:32,640 --> 01:03:35,240
Every word the priest said
was meant for us...

890
01:03:35,400 --> 01:03:38,200
...and in my heart,
I made all of the vows to you.

891
01:03:38,920 --> 01:03:41,760
- And I to you.
- Then...

892
01:03:41,920 --> 01:03:45,640
No, no. That isn't fitting.
Let me love you. Let me live for you.

893
01:03:45,800 --> 01:03:48,520
Don't let me ask any more
from heaven than that.

894
01:03:48,680 --> 01:03:51,200
God might get angry.

895
01:03:58,840 --> 01:04:02,640
Oh, why does anybody want
to keep bees, anyhow? They're so fickle.

896
01:04:02,800 --> 01:04:04,520
If they want to fly away, let them.

897
01:04:04,680 --> 01:04:06,960
They'll fly away when they
get the swarming fever...

898
01:04:07,120 --> 01:04:09,600
...unless we make so much noise
they settle down again.

899
01:04:09,760 --> 01:04:11,960
They're going to settle in that tree.
Look.

900
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:19,400
Every time I eat a mouthful of honey,
I'll think what loons we look doing this.

901
01:04:19,560 --> 01:04:21,640
Who knows the bee song?
All together now.

902
01:04:46,120 --> 01:04:50,120
Please don't think us mad, monsieur.
Did you want to see someone?

903
01:04:50,280 --> 01:04:52,480
- Mademoiselle Gautier?
- Yes.

904
01:04:52,640 --> 01:04:55,560
I was told at the inn
that I'd find my son here.

905
01:04:55,720 --> 01:04:58,320
- Your son?
- Armand Duval.

906
01:05:02,920 --> 01:05:07,800
Yes, Armand Duval is very often here,
but he's in Paris today.

907
01:05:08,960 --> 01:05:11,280
- Do you wish to come in?
- Thank you.

908
01:05:18,240 --> 01:05:20,800
I'm sorry your son isn't here, monsieur.

909
01:05:20,960 --> 01:05:22,600
Well, it's just as well.

910
01:05:22,760 --> 01:05:27,040
I didn't look forward to seeing him
with any pleasure, under the circumstances.

911
01:05:27,240 --> 01:05:31,760
As a matter of fact, I'm glad to be able
to talk to you directly and frankly.

912
01:05:31,920 --> 01:05:34,600
You see, I know
what's been going on here.

913
01:05:34,760 --> 01:05:37,720
You don't think me worthy of your son.
You're right, I'm not.

914
01:05:37,880 --> 01:05:40,800
No. No woman is worthy
of a man's love...

915
01:05:41,000 --> 01:05:45,520
...who's willing to let him ruin himself
for her, as you're doing.

916
01:05:45,680 --> 01:05:48,480
I don't know what you've heard,
but it isn't true.

917
01:05:48,640 --> 01:05:50,240
Armand has told me himself...

918
01:05:50,400 --> 01:05:54,560
...that he wants to take his modest fortune
out of my hands at once.

919
01:05:54,720 --> 01:05:56,960
The reason is obvious, isn't it?

920
01:05:57,120 --> 01:06:00,240
Can you deny he wants the money
for you?

921
01:06:01,360 --> 01:06:04,720
Whatever the reason, I hope
you won't let him have it, monsieur.

922
01:06:07,120 --> 01:06:09,320
I wish I could believe you were sincere.

923
01:06:10,440 --> 01:06:13,480
A few years ago,
I lived on bread and soup.

924
01:06:13,640 --> 01:06:16,240
I can manage very well without
taking anything from Armand.

925
01:06:16,400 --> 01:06:21,960
I still say what I came here to say.
This thing must end at once.

926
01:06:22,120 --> 01:06:24,840
You might as well
save your breath, monsieur.

927
01:06:27,320 --> 01:06:30,600
How long have you
known Armand, Madame?

928
01:06:30,760 --> 01:06:33,000
Three months and 12 days, monsieur.

929
01:06:33,160 --> 01:06:38,120
Three months and 12 days. And how long
do you expect this thing to last?

930
01:06:39,000 --> 01:06:40,960
You have never known love
to last, monsieur?

931
01:06:41,160 --> 01:06:44,000
Never, when it was
unsanctified by marriage...

932
01:06:44,160 --> 01:06:47,040
...unblessed by children or social ties.

933
01:06:47,240 --> 01:06:50,680
I shall love Armand always, and I
believe he shall love me always too.

934
01:06:50,840 --> 01:06:52,360
- Always, eh?
- Always.

935
01:06:52,520 --> 01:06:56,480
Hasn't your own experience taught you
the human heart can't be trusted?

936
01:06:56,640 --> 01:07:00,040
I think I know my own heart
better than you can, monsieur.

937
01:07:00,200 --> 01:07:02,200
And I can trust it not to change.

938
01:07:02,360 --> 01:07:07,040
No woman, unprotected as you are, can
afford to give the best years of her life...

939
01:07:07,200 --> 01:07:10,400
...to a man who, when he leaves her,
will leave her with nothing...

940
01:07:10,560 --> 01:07:13,800
...and who is certain to leave her
in the end.

941
01:07:14,440 --> 01:07:18,080
I don't suppose you can understand
how any woman...

942
01:07:18,240 --> 01:07:23,720
...unprotected, as you say I am,
can be lifted above self-interest...

943
01:07:23,880 --> 01:07:27,280
...by a sentiment so delicate and pure
that she feels only humiliation...

944
01:07:27,440 --> 01:07:28,920
...when you speak of such things.

945
01:07:30,280 --> 01:07:34,160
I realize now that you
do love him unselfishly.

946
01:07:34,320 --> 01:07:36,840
But even so, I say it can't go on.

947
01:07:37,000 --> 01:07:39,480
- But it will go on!
- Armand is a young man...

948
01:07:39,640 --> 01:07:42,360
...with his way to make,
with a career waiting for him.

949
01:07:42,520 --> 01:07:45,960
And in his case, he can't serve
his best interests by being tied...

950
01:07:46,120 --> 01:07:50,680
...to a woman he can't present
to his family or his friends.

951
01:07:51,240 --> 01:07:54,080
- Armand is no different than other men.
- Oh, come, Madame.

952
01:07:54,240 --> 01:07:56,960
Be honest.
Haven't you found him different?

953
01:07:57,120 --> 01:08:00,600
Haven't you found him
more sensitive, more loyal?

954
01:08:00,760 --> 01:08:04,120
Or am I prejudiced
because I'm his father?

955
01:08:04,520 --> 01:08:07,680
No. No, no. Armand is different.

956
01:08:07,840 --> 01:08:13,360
And so you see, as long as Armand loves
you, he'll not enter rooms that you can't.

957
01:08:13,520 --> 01:08:17,000
But a man can go back.
He can always go back.

958
01:08:17,880 --> 01:08:19,440
Monsieur...

959
01:08:19,600 --> 01:08:23,160
...suppose I told you I have a feeling
I shan't live very long?

960
01:08:23,320 --> 01:08:27,800
Well, then I'd scold you for being fanciful
and a little foolish.

961
01:08:28,120 --> 01:08:31,520
What you probably feel
is the melancholy of happiness...

962
01:08:31,680 --> 01:08:34,440
...that mood that comes over
all of us when we realize...

963
01:08:34,600 --> 01:08:38,560
...that even love can't remain
at flood tide forever.

964
01:08:38,760 --> 01:08:42,760
- Without Armand, I'm doomed.
- With him, you're both doomed.

965
01:08:42,920 --> 01:08:46,400
Without a profession of any sort,
what can he do?

966
01:08:46,560 --> 01:08:49,280
Unless he sinks so low
he's willing to let some other man...

967
01:08:49,440 --> 01:08:51,280
...foot the bills for his life with you.

968
01:08:51,440 --> 01:08:53,400
You don't know Armand.
You wouldn't say that.

969
01:08:53,560 --> 01:08:57,320
No one knows the man he might become
if he loses his self-respect.

970
01:08:57,480 --> 01:09:01,440
But I think that's too high
a price to pay, even for love.

971
01:09:01,600 --> 01:09:06,040
I want Armand to enjoy life,
not to be sacrificed to it.

972
01:09:06,200 --> 01:09:10,840
You see, my son is as dear to me
as he possibly can be to you.

973
01:09:11,360 --> 01:09:14,160
Yes, but you have others
who are dear to you.

974
01:09:14,320 --> 01:09:17,160
I have only Armand.

975
01:09:17,960 --> 01:09:20,400
You don't know how I've changed.

976
01:09:20,560 --> 01:09:25,360
And he taught me that love is not
always selfish, nor goodness dull...

977
01:09:25,520 --> 01:09:30,480
...nor men faithless. No, no. You can't
expect me to give up such love as his.

978
01:09:30,640 --> 01:09:32,280
Think what's best for him.

979
01:09:32,560 --> 01:09:35,880
Think what you'd want for him
if he were your own son.

980
01:09:36,440 --> 01:09:40,440
Then think how you're killing
his right to a normal life.

981
01:09:40,600 --> 01:09:44,960
Try to realize that everything
you're ashamed of in your own past...

982
01:09:45,120 --> 01:09:47,920
...would only taint his future.

983
01:09:48,080 --> 01:09:51,560
You tell me that you love him.
I believe you.

984
01:09:51,720 --> 01:09:56,000
That's why I'm able to stand here,
a man who's getting old...

985
01:09:56,200 --> 01:09:58,840
...and ask this great sacrifice of you...

986
01:09:59,000 --> 01:10:03,000
...as humbly as I'd ask
a great favor of a queen.

987
01:10:03,160 --> 01:10:08,840
I can give you nothing in return,
except my thanks and my respect.

988
01:10:09,000 --> 01:10:11,560
Please give him up.

989
01:10:14,120 --> 01:10:19,120
- What shall I do?
- Talk to him. Tell him he must leave you.

990
01:10:19,280 --> 01:10:22,480
- I have talked.
- Leave him.

991
01:10:22,760 --> 01:10:25,960
- He'd follow me.
- Tell him you don't love him.

992
01:10:26,120 --> 01:10:28,040
He wouldn't believe me.

993
01:10:33,000 --> 01:10:34,680
No.

994
01:10:34,840 --> 01:10:37,520
I know only one way.

995
01:10:38,160 --> 01:10:40,920
But I shan't tell you what it is.

996
01:10:42,520 --> 01:10:45,000
I knew I was too happy.

997
01:10:45,160 --> 01:10:47,240
What are you going to do?

998
01:10:48,400 --> 01:10:50,880
Don't let yourself think of it.

999
01:10:51,240 --> 01:10:53,480
I'll send him back to you tonight.

1000
01:10:53,640 --> 01:10:56,680
How can I ever repay you
for all you're doing for me?

1001
01:11:00,320 --> 01:11:02,720
Make no mistake, monsieur.

1002
01:11:02,920 --> 01:11:06,520
Whatever I do, it's nothing for you.

1003
01:11:06,680 --> 01:11:10,080
- It's all for Armand.
- I thank you just the same.

1004
01:11:10,280 --> 01:11:15,760
And I shall never forget
what I and my family owe you.

1005
01:11:29,760 --> 01:11:33,880
Goodbye, monsieur.
Don't reproach yourself.

1006
01:11:34,040 --> 01:11:37,320
You've done only what Armand's father
should have done.

1007
01:11:37,480 --> 01:11:40,840
Only, don't let him know it.
He might hate you.

1008
01:11:41,000 --> 01:11:43,200
And I don't want that to happen...

1009
01:11:43,360 --> 01:11:48,280
...because he shall need all the courage
and comfort you can give him...

1010
01:11:48,440 --> 01:11:51,440
...for a long time, I think.

1011
01:11:53,960 --> 01:11:57,400
God bless you, Marguerite Gautier.

1012
01:12:20,440 --> 01:12:22,400
Did the gentleman go?

1013
01:12:23,520 --> 01:12:25,720
But, Madame, what's the matter?

1014
01:12:28,080 --> 01:12:33,800
I want you to take this letter
and give it to Baron de Varville yourself.

1015
01:12:33,960 --> 01:12:37,880
But I thought you were so happy
at last with Monsieur Duval.

1016
01:12:38,040 --> 01:12:39,880
I was.

1017
01:12:40,040 --> 01:12:41,280
I don't know what's in it...

1018
01:12:41,440 --> 01:12:44,760
...but I know the very thought
of this one makes you shudder.

1019
01:12:44,920 --> 01:12:47,600
Are you sure you want me to take it?

1020
01:12:47,760 --> 01:12:52,680
Yes, yes. Go now, Nanine.
And pray for me.

1021
01:12:52,840 --> 01:12:56,640
Pray for me that I'll have the strength
to go through with what I have to do.

1022
01:12:56,800 --> 01:13:02,520
Oh, your hands are like ice, child.
Tell Nanine what you're going to do.

1023
01:13:03,640 --> 01:13:07,200
Make my love hate me.
Make him hate me.

1024
01:13:07,360 --> 01:13:09,680
Oh, God help me.

1025
01:13:33,320 --> 01:13:35,760
Hello. I'm back.

1026
01:13:36,360 --> 01:13:38,640
Oh, I didn't hear you drive up.

1027
01:13:53,320 --> 01:13:56,040
Why are you all dressed up?
Not going to a ball, are you?

1028
01:13:56,200 --> 01:14:00,720
No. I wish I were. You don't know
of any balls I might be asked to, do you?

1029
01:14:00,880 --> 01:14:04,040
- If you're serious, I brought an invitation.
- Really?

1030
01:14:04,200 --> 01:14:07,800
From Olympe. There's a new gambling club
opening. She suggests we go together.

1031
01:14:07,960 --> 01:14:09,160
Where did you see Olympe?

1032
01:14:09,320 --> 01:14:12,640
She dropped in the shop while I was
talking to Prudence about your affairs.

1033
01:14:12,840 --> 01:14:15,120
I didn't ask you to discuss my affairs
with Prudence.

1034
01:14:15,280 --> 01:14:17,680
And I did ask her not
to talk to you about them.

1035
01:14:17,840 --> 01:14:21,080
Marguerite, you're angry.

1036
01:14:21,600 --> 01:14:23,520
Do you realize that
we're almost quarreling?

1037
01:14:23,720 --> 01:14:27,840
Well, everybody quarrels.
It keeps people from getting bored.

1038
01:14:28,680 --> 01:14:30,720
Something happened today.

1039
01:14:31,720 --> 01:14:33,960
What was it? I want the truth.

1040
01:14:34,440 --> 01:14:37,920
Well, this morning,
the bees left the hive...

1041
01:14:38,120 --> 01:14:39,680
...and we had to bring them back.

1042
01:14:39,880 --> 01:14:42,160
This afternoon, I washed my hair.

1043
01:14:42,320 --> 01:14:45,160
Those are the two exciting events
of my day.

1044
01:14:45,440 --> 01:14:48,200
The first time I leave you,
you change completely.

1045
01:14:48,360 --> 01:14:50,280
I come back to you happy,
with good news.

1046
01:14:50,440 --> 01:14:53,800
What do you call good news?
Have you been left a large fortune?

1047
01:14:53,960 --> 01:14:56,480
No, but I find I can do
as I please with my small one.

1048
01:14:56,680 --> 01:14:58,840
Well, don't you touch it.

1049
01:14:59,160 --> 01:15:02,440
Why, you'll be rich one month
and then have nothing.

1050
01:15:04,720 --> 01:15:07,840
If that's what you're afraid of,
you needn't worry.

1051
01:15:08,840 --> 01:15:13,000
We have something better to do than play
at being rich, even for a month.

1052
01:15:13,160 --> 01:15:16,480
Nichette and Gustave are already
looking for a house for us.

1053
01:15:17,280 --> 01:15:19,920
They're the sort of people
that think two rooms wonderful...

1054
01:15:20,080 --> 01:15:24,280
...three rooms a mansion,
and more than four rooms wicked.

1055
01:15:26,480 --> 01:15:28,120
What's the matter?

1056
01:15:29,960 --> 01:15:31,920
That's what I'm wondering.

1057
01:15:36,600 --> 01:15:38,840
Oh, darling, darling.

1058
01:15:40,200 --> 01:15:42,720
I'd begun to think you didn't love me.

1059
01:15:45,800 --> 01:15:48,240
Perhaps I don't really.

1060
01:15:48,680 --> 01:15:53,240
Yet only last night you were ready
to give up everything for me.

1061
01:15:53,400 --> 01:15:55,280
Well, that was last night, you know.

1062
01:15:55,440 --> 01:15:58,200
People say things they don't mean
sometimes at night.

1063
01:15:59,600 --> 01:16:04,360
Well, life is something besides kisses
and promises in the moonlight.

1064
01:16:05,200 --> 01:16:06,800
Even you should know that.

1065
01:16:11,720 --> 01:16:13,200
Yes.

1066
01:16:14,920 --> 01:16:17,120
Wasn't one summer all you wanted?

1067
01:16:23,400 --> 01:16:25,560
So you're going to leave me.

1068
01:16:27,760 --> 01:16:29,160
Yes.

1069
01:16:37,200 --> 01:16:41,040
- I could kill you for this.
- I'm not worth killing, Armand.

1070
01:16:41,200 --> 01:16:44,200
I've loved you as much as I could love.

1071
01:16:44,600 --> 01:16:46,760
If that wasn't enough...

1072
01:16:47,880 --> 01:16:51,560
...I'm not to blame.
We don't make our own hearts.

1073
01:16:52,280 --> 01:16:53,760
I guess that's...

1074
01:16:54,280 --> 01:16:56,040
That's true.

1075
01:16:57,440 --> 01:17:02,320
You're no more to blame because yours
can be faithful only a few weeks...

1076
01:17:02,480 --> 01:17:06,600
...than I am because mine
will be faithful as long as I live.

1077
01:17:08,400 --> 01:17:11,120
Yes, that's how it is.

1078
01:17:13,400 --> 01:17:17,200
It's as if one of us had died,
Marguerite, suddenly or I dreamed it.

1079
01:17:19,200 --> 01:17:20,840
Where are you going?

1080
01:17:21,320 --> 01:17:24,400
Baron de Varville is expecting me.

1081
01:17:28,240 --> 01:17:31,680
At last I shall see what a great chateau
looks like inside.

1082
01:18:19,520 --> 01:18:21,480
Marguerite.

1083
01:18:52,360 --> 01:18:56,320
And this, Madame, is the newest and finest
of all the private gambling clubs in Paris.

1084
01:18:56,480 --> 01:18:57,760
I hope you're impressed.

1085
01:18:57,920 --> 01:19:01,400
Must be a pleasure to lose money in such
a charming place. I wonder who's here.

1086
01:19:01,560 --> 01:19:04,120
Everyone who's anything to lose,
or nothing.

1087
01:19:07,720 --> 01:19:11,120
Am I dreaming, or do I see
a flock of birds?

1088
01:19:12,000 --> 01:19:13,440
No, it's Olympe.

1089
01:19:16,160 --> 01:19:21,120
- Hello, darling. Good evening, general.
- Good evening, general.

1090
01:19:24,800 --> 01:19:26,320
Would anybody like an omelet?

1091
01:19:26,480 --> 01:19:29,760
Stop that, you nasty thing.
Pardon us. The general wants to play.

1092
01:19:29,920 --> 01:19:32,040
So nice to have seen you.

1093
01:19:32,680 --> 01:19:36,960
- Well, what I could say about that one.
- There's Armand Duval.

1094
01:19:37,480 --> 01:19:40,760
Armand, my boy.

1095
01:19:41,320 --> 01:19:42,720
Hello, Prudence.

1096
01:19:42,880 --> 01:19:46,680
- How well you're looking.
- I return the compliment.

1097
01:19:46,840 --> 01:19:50,320
I... I think I ought to warn you.

1098
01:19:50,520 --> 01:19:53,800
Marguerite is coming here tonight
with the baron.

1099
01:19:53,960 --> 01:19:55,360
Well...

1100
01:19:56,360 --> 01:19:58,200
These things can't last forever.

1101
01:19:58,360 --> 01:20:01,640
Your little adventure was costing
Marguerite more than she could afford.

1102
01:20:01,800 --> 01:20:04,920
- It cost her nothing.
- Oh, what a child you are.

1103
01:20:05,080 --> 01:20:08,840
Who do you think furnished the money
for Marguerite's debts before she left Paris?

1104
01:20:09,000 --> 01:20:11,720
What do you think would've happened if
she hadn't left you...

1105
01:20:11,880 --> 01:20:13,400
...when her money was gone?

1106
01:20:13,680 --> 01:20:15,200
And now?

1107
01:20:15,840 --> 01:20:18,880
The baron has promised
to put her affairs in perfect order.

1108
01:20:19,040 --> 01:20:20,520
Good.

1109
01:20:21,040 --> 01:20:23,560
Then you don't really hold it against her?

1110
01:20:23,720 --> 01:20:28,880
No, why should I? The past is dead.
Heaven rest its soul, if it had one.

1111
01:20:29,320 --> 01:20:32,440
You have more sense
than I gave you credit for.

1112
01:20:32,600 --> 01:20:34,200
Hello.

1113
01:20:34,880 --> 01:20:36,240
- Armand.
- Hello, Charles.

1114
01:20:36,400 --> 01:20:37,640
- Hello, Gaston.
- Hello.

1115
01:20:37,800 --> 01:20:40,120
Well, when did you get back to Pa...?

1116
01:20:41,000 --> 01:20:42,160
To Paris?

1117
01:21:05,480 --> 01:21:07,560
You've dropped your fan.

1118
01:21:10,360 --> 01:21:12,800
I said, you've dropped your fan.

1119
01:21:22,280 --> 01:21:26,760
- I don't feel well. I'd like to go home.
- I insist on your staying. Come.

1120
01:21:34,760 --> 01:21:37,800
I'm so glad you've come, dear.
Good evening, baron.

1121
01:21:37,960 --> 01:21:40,440
- Good evening.
- Of course, you know each other.

1122
01:21:40,600 --> 01:21:42,960
- Monsieur Duval?
- No.

1123
01:21:43,760 --> 01:21:45,160
You're late.

1124
01:21:45,320 --> 01:21:47,480
- We went to the theater.
- What was the play?

1125
01:21:47,640 --> 01:21:49,440
<i>- Manon Lescaut. 
- Oh, yes.</i>

1126
01:21:49,600 --> 01:21:52,360
The story of a man who loved a woman
more than his honor...

1127
01:21:52,520 --> 01:21:55,320
...and a woman who wanted luxury
more than his love.

1128
01:21:55,480 --> 01:21:58,080
You should have found that
very entertaining.

1129
01:21:58,280 --> 01:22:01,000
Isn't that your tune, Marguerite?

1130
01:22:01,480 --> 01:22:04,040
Madame, you've dropped your fan.

1131
01:22:05,640 --> 01:22:08,360
- Thank you.
- Any gentleman would've done the same.

1132
01:22:08,520 --> 01:22:11,040
Aren't you playing, baron?

1133
01:22:11,560 --> 01:22:14,000
- Where is the baccarat table?
- Yes, Gaston, where is it?

1134
01:22:14,160 --> 01:22:16,080
- Straight ahead.
- I play for high stakes.

1135
01:22:16,240 --> 01:22:19,200
Good. I should like to make
a fortune tonight.

1136
01:22:21,120 --> 01:22:24,840
- Come, Marguerite.
- I'd rather not play, if you don't mind.

1137
01:22:25,000 --> 01:22:26,960
You can watch.

1138
01:22:28,120 --> 01:22:31,880
I can't watch, Prudence. Armand may lose.
He may lose everything, and it's my fault.

1139
01:22:32,040 --> 01:22:34,840
You needn't worry, dear.
He doesn't blame you at all.

1140
01:22:35,000 --> 01:22:39,640
That isn't true. His voice is too cold
and his face is too pale.

1141
01:22:41,480 --> 01:22:44,600
Monsieur le Baron wins.

1142
01:23:03,120 --> 01:23:06,800
- Can I get Madame anything?
- No, thank you.

1143
01:23:10,360 --> 01:23:13,320
Yes. Will you take a message
to Monsieur Armand Duval?

1144
01:23:13,480 --> 01:23:15,240
Tell him I would like to speak to him.

1145
01:23:15,400 --> 01:23:19,480
- How will I know the gentleman?
- Well, he's playing at the first table...

1146
01:23:19,640 --> 01:23:24,360
...and he's the youngest
and handsomest man there.

1147
01:23:24,520 --> 01:23:26,320
I'll find him, Madame.

1148
01:23:26,480 --> 01:23:30,160
- Nine, the right side wins.
- Congratulations, monsieur.

1149
01:23:30,320 --> 01:23:32,160
Well done, Armand.
Twenty thousand francs.

1150
01:23:32,320 --> 01:23:35,320
- Twenty thousand?
- Place your bets, gentlemen.

1151
01:23:35,960 --> 01:23:38,960
Armand wins again.
He drew nine three times.

1152
01:23:40,320 --> 01:23:42,440
Well done, well done.

1153
01:23:43,760 --> 01:23:45,400
Let it stand.

1154
01:23:45,560 --> 01:23:47,280
- You'll lose it all.
- Let it stand.

1155
01:23:47,440 --> 01:23:50,040
- Good. You owe me revenge.
- Take it if you can.

1156
01:23:50,200 --> 01:23:52,960
Only, I warn you,
lucky in love, unlucky at cards.

1157
01:23:53,120 --> 01:23:55,200
That also means
lucky at cards, unlucky in love.

1158
01:23:55,400 --> 01:23:57,640
- We shall see.
- Make your bets, please, gentlemen.

1159
01:23:58,280 --> 01:23:59,600
Card.

1160
01:24:05,720 --> 01:24:07,360
No card.

1161
01:24:11,000 --> 01:24:13,080
- Eight.
- Seven.

1162
01:24:14,120 --> 01:24:15,760
Baccarat!

1163
01:24:19,320 --> 01:24:22,160
You've won a fortune, Armand.

1164
01:24:24,920 --> 01:24:26,760
Make your bets, gentlemen.
Make your bets.

1165
01:24:26,920 --> 01:24:27,880
Pardon me.

1166
01:24:38,440 --> 01:24:40,320
You sent for me, Madame?

1167
01:24:40,760 --> 01:24:43,760
Yes. I want to beg you,
leave this place at once.

1168
01:24:43,920 --> 01:24:46,760
- Why?
- Baron de Varville is not a patient man...

1169
01:24:46,920 --> 01:24:48,880
...and you're in the mood
to quarrel tonight.

1170
01:24:49,040 --> 01:24:51,680
You don't want to lose
your rich admirer. I understand.

1171
01:24:51,840 --> 01:24:53,760
Your own fortunes would fall with him.

1172
01:24:53,960 --> 01:24:57,160
Armand, he's not to blame
for what happened. That I swear.

1173
01:24:57,320 --> 01:24:59,360
Then how could you do what you did?

1174
01:25:00,120 --> 01:25:03,400
I'll tell you. Because your heart is a thing
that can be bought and sold.

1175
01:25:03,560 --> 01:25:05,520
I know, you gave it to me
for a whole summer.

1176
01:25:05,680 --> 01:25:08,840
When it came to a choice, the jewels
and carriages he could give you...

1177
01:25:09,000 --> 01:25:12,200
...were worth more than my love,
my devotion, my life.

1178
01:25:12,880 --> 01:25:14,440
Yes, that's true.

1179
01:25:14,600 --> 01:25:19,120
I'm a completely worthless woman,
and no man should risk his life for me.

1180
01:25:19,480 --> 01:25:22,760
For that reason alone, I beg you,
leave this place at once.

1181
01:25:22,920 --> 01:25:24,480
I will.

1182
01:25:24,760 --> 01:25:27,360
I will, on one condition.

1183
01:25:27,960 --> 01:25:29,800
That you'll go with me.

1184
01:25:30,280 --> 01:25:31,480
No.

1185
01:25:32,480 --> 01:25:35,880
I came back to Paris to tell you
that I despise you, and I do.

1186
01:25:36,280 --> 01:25:39,400
But I love you too. Say you'll go away
with me. We'll forget the past.

1187
01:25:39,560 --> 01:25:41,680
- We'll never turn back.
- No, no.

1188
01:25:41,840 --> 01:25:44,040
I doubled my fortune tonight
at his expense.

1189
01:25:44,200 --> 01:25:48,600
And when that's gone, I'll work,
I'll beg, I'll borrow, I'll steal.

1190
01:25:48,760 --> 01:25:51,680
But I must be with you always, always.

1191
01:25:52,200 --> 01:25:57,320
When I hear you talk of such a future,
I realize I'm right in doing what I did.

1192
01:25:58,560 --> 01:26:01,640
Look, do you suppose
we could ever be happy together...

1193
01:26:01,800 --> 01:26:04,480
...even if I were free to act as I choose?
- You are free.

1194
01:26:04,640 --> 01:26:06,880
I've given a solemn promise
never to return to you.

1195
01:26:07,080 --> 01:26:08,440
To whom?

1196
01:26:09,160 --> 01:26:12,960
- To someone who had the right to ask.
- To the Baron de Varville?

1197
01:26:14,240 --> 01:26:17,120
- Yes.
- So you do love him.

1198
01:26:20,200 --> 01:26:24,280
Dare to tell me that you love him,
you're free of me forever.

1199
01:26:26,120 --> 01:26:27,760
I love him.

1200
01:26:32,840 --> 01:26:35,360
Come in! Come in here, all of you!

1201
01:26:35,800 --> 01:26:39,600
You see this woman? You know her?
Then listen to what I'm going to say.

1202
01:26:39,760 --> 01:26:42,080
I accepted her favors
because I thought she loved me.

1203
01:26:42,240 --> 01:26:45,280
I let her make sacrifices when there
were others who had more to give.

1204
01:26:45,480 --> 01:26:48,160
But bear witness, I owe her nothing.

1205
01:26:48,520 --> 01:26:50,280
Take it. Go on, take it!

1206
01:26:50,440 --> 01:26:54,480
Buy camellias. Buy diamonds, horses
and carriages! Buy moonlight! Buy a grave!

1207
01:26:55,600 --> 01:26:59,160
I congratulate you, monsieur. You know
how to treat a woman as she deserves.

1208
01:26:59,320 --> 01:27:01,680
Like the cheat this one is.

1209
01:27:03,840 --> 01:27:06,120
You shall answer to me for this!

1210
01:27:07,880 --> 01:27:10,080
Send me word when and where.

1211
01:27:15,600 --> 01:27:19,120
- Come, gentlemen, let's continue our play.
- Come, come, the game is continuing.

1212
01:27:19,280 --> 01:27:22,560
Place your bets, gentlemen.
Please, please make your bets.

1213
01:27:49,000 --> 01:27:50,640
He's safe.

1214
01:27:50,800 --> 01:27:53,560
Thank God. Oh, thank God.

1215
01:27:53,720 --> 01:27:54,880
But the baron is wounded.

1216
01:27:55,080 --> 01:27:58,800
That means Armand must leave the country
to avoid arrest. He's already on his way.

1217
01:27:58,960 --> 01:28:03,080
- My letter?
- I'm sorry. He sent it back.

1218
01:28:03,240 --> 01:28:05,080
He wouldn't open it.

1219
01:28:33,480 --> 01:28:35,520
Who's here we know?

1220
01:28:38,720 --> 01:28:40,800
- Oh, there's someone now.
- Come in.

1221
01:28:41,360 --> 01:28:43,360
- Armand!
- Armand Duval!

1222
01:28:43,560 --> 01:28:45,160
- Well...
- Do sit down.

1223
01:28:45,320 --> 01:28:47,720
- When did you get back to Paris?
- About a week ago.

1224
01:28:47,880 --> 01:28:50,680
- Why hasn't anyone seen you?
- Where have you been, anyhow?

1225
01:28:50,840 --> 01:28:54,080
- All sorts of places.
- It's good you didn't kill the baron...

1226
01:28:54,240 --> 01:28:58,400
...and have to stay away for years instead
of months. Have you seen Marguerite?

1227
01:28:58,880 --> 01:29:02,400
- Oh, I'm sorry, I meant...
- Well.

1228
01:29:02,600 --> 01:29:04,880
How does Paris look to the traveler?

1229
01:29:05,640 --> 01:29:07,760
The same as it looked six months ago.

1230
01:29:07,920 --> 01:29:10,600
The same girls singing the same song
on the same stage.

1231
01:29:10,760 --> 01:29:13,360
And I'm still wearing
the same dress, alas.

1232
01:29:13,720 --> 01:29:16,360
Don't hint.
Nobody's going to buy you a new one.

1233
01:29:16,520 --> 01:29:18,880
Only, Marguerite isn't here.

1234
01:29:20,560 --> 01:29:22,760
However, I suppose
there are worse places.

1235
01:29:22,920 --> 01:29:25,680
- I said, Marguerite isn't here.
- Don't shout. We all heard you.

1236
01:29:26,040 --> 01:29:29,320
- Do you know she's been ill, Armand?
- Stop teasing Armand, Gaston.

1237
01:29:29,480 --> 01:29:31,680
Can't you see that he isn't interested?

1238
01:29:31,840 --> 01:29:34,120
- Aren't you?
- No, not particularly.

1239
01:29:34,280 --> 01:29:36,640
After all, why should he be?
It's nothing new.

1240
01:29:36,800 --> 01:29:40,000
Marguerite is always ill
or pretending to be.

1241
01:29:40,160 --> 01:29:42,080
You really have a nasty tongue,
haven't you?

1242
01:29:42,240 --> 01:29:45,240
Why, if you mean to insinuate
that I haven't been a good friend...

1243
01:29:45,400 --> 01:29:49,280
...to Marguerite Gautier, ask Prudence
what I've done for her. Just ask her.

1244
01:29:49,480 --> 01:29:55,080
It's true. That angel has been buying
Marguerite's things, all of her jewelry...

1245
01:29:55,240 --> 01:29:57,760
...one after another.
- Look.

1246
01:29:58,480 --> 01:30:00,440
- Why?
- So she could raise some money.

1247
01:30:00,600 --> 01:30:03,040
Since the duel with the baron,
he's refused to see her.

1248
01:30:03,200 --> 01:30:06,120
Shut up, Olympe. I know more
about that than you do.

1249
01:30:06,280 --> 01:30:10,560
Marguerite won't see the baron,
or any other man who might help her...

1250
01:30:10,760 --> 01:30:13,920
...in spite of all my motherly advice.
- Well, that's what you say.

1251
01:30:14,080 --> 01:30:17,880
Only, this... Last week, I bought this.
Look.

1252
01:30:18,040 --> 01:30:21,560
Oh, you couldn't get it for 5000
at the jewelers. How much?

1253
01:30:21,720 --> 01:30:25,120
Two hundred Louis. Am I smart.

1254
01:30:30,760 --> 01:30:33,080
Shall we go around afterwards
and ask how she is?

1255
01:30:33,240 --> 01:30:34,720
No.

1256
01:30:35,640 --> 01:30:37,120
I couldn't.

1257
01:30:44,520 --> 01:30:46,480
- Hello, Nanine.
- Monsieur.

1258
01:30:46,640 --> 01:30:49,360
- How is she tonight?
- Oh, I don't know, monsieur.

1259
01:30:49,520 --> 01:30:51,400
The doctor tells me nothing.

1260
01:30:51,560 --> 01:30:54,920
Oh, forgive me, monsieur,
but these are bad times.

1261
01:30:55,080 --> 01:30:58,400
- There must be something I can do.
- There's nothing anybody can do...

1262
01:30:58,560 --> 01:31:01,120
...but watch and wait.
- Well, I'll watch and wait...

1263
01:31:01,280 --> 01:31:04,040
...while you get some rest.
- Gave yourself all the good cards.

1264
01:31:05,880 --> 01:31:07,560
You'll have to get out of here,
my men.

1265
01:31:07,720 --> 01:31:10,400
We're here for the creditors,
by order of the court...

1266
01:31:10,560 --> 01:31:14,080
...to see that nothing's taken out of
the house, and here we're going to stay.

1267
01:31:14,240 --> 01:31:16,240
There's a passage outside.
Wait there instead.

1268
01:31:16,400 --> 01:31:18,480
This room still belongs
to Mademoiselle Gautier.

1269
01:31:18,640 --> 01:31:21,720
- Our orders are to see...
- You can see nobody goes out that door...

1270
01:31:21,880 --> 01:31:26,000
...with a piano in his pocket
as well there as here. Get out.

1271
01:31:26,560 --> 01:31:27,960
Get out.

1272
01:31:39,680 --> 01:31:41,200
Lie down.

1273
01:31:42,320 --> 01:31:44,840
I'll call you the minute she stirs.

1274
01:33:16,080 --> 01:33:19,880
- Is it morning?
- Yes, dear child.

1275
01:33:20,640 --> 01:33:24,920
- Any letters?
- No. It's too early for the postman.

1276
01:33:25,320 --> 01:33:28,640
Who are you?

1277
01:33:32,360 --> 01:33:33,720
Gaston.

1278
01:33:35,560 --> 01:33:40,200
Nanine's sleeping. I made her lie down
when I looked in after the theater.

1279
01:33:41,280 --> 01:33:43,280
Dear Gaston.

1280
01:33:43,800 --> 01:33:46,040
So you've been here all night?

1281
01:33:46,320 --> 01:33:50,320
Well, I was thinking of taking you
for a drive, or maybe for a bit of lunch.

1282
01:33:54,240 --> 01:33:56,560
You still make me laugh.

1283
01:33:58,000 --> 01:34:01,320
Not today. Some other time.

1284
01:34:01,480 --> 01:34:03,640
All right, another time.

1285
01:34:09,920 --> 01:34:12,320
How kind you are.

1286
01:34:13,760 --> 01:34:18,200
You know, I used to think
you were such a gay fellow...

1287
01:34:18,360 --> 01:34:21,280
...with no other thought but for pleasure.

1288
01:34:21,440 --> 01:34:23,320
Forgive me.

1289
01:34:24,000 --> 01:34:25,480
But you were right.

1290
01:34:25,640 --> 01:34:28,560
Here, drink this.

1291
01:34:31,520 --> 01:34:33,400
It'll do you good.

1292
01:34:34,360 --> 01:34:39,400
Nothing will do me good anymore,
Gaston, except Armand's return.

1293
01:34:39,560 --> 01:34:42,880
- Armand's return?
- Yes.

1294
01:34:43,440 --> 01:34:46,160
That's what I'm waiting for.

1295
01:34:46,520 --> 01:34:48,480
That's why I live.

1296
01:34:50,560 --> 01:34:54,720
- He will come back, won't he, Gaston?
- Of course he'll come back.

1297
01:34:54,880 --> 01:34:58,160
How could he come to Paris
without coming straight to you?

1298
01:34:58,760 --> 01:35:00,480
Here, drink this.

1299
01:35:07,040 --> 01:35:09,360
I feel better already.

1300
01:35:13,800 --> 01:35:16,280
It's all right, Nanine. She's awake.

1301
01:35:16,440 --> 01:35:21,160
- Poor Nanine. Were you tired last night?
- Oh, a little, Madame.

1302
01:35:21,320 --> 01:35:24,680
That Madame Prudence is here
on her way home from a party.

1303
01:35:24,840 --> 01:35:27,080
I'll get rid of her.

1304
01:35:30,160 --> 01:35:33,720
So that's why you ran away from us,
you naughty boy.

1305
01:35:35,280 --> 01:35:37,960
Hello, my child.

1306
01:35:38,120 --> 01:35:40,920
Why, I expected to find you dying,
and you look better...

1307
01:35:41,080 --> 01:35:43,520
...than I've seen you look for months.
How are you?

1308
01:35:43,720 --> 01:35:46,280
- Much better.
- You certainly look better than I feel.

1309
01:35:46,440 --> 01:35:49,760
Oh, heavens, what worries I've had
this past week.

1310
01:35:49,920 --> 01:35:53,760
I couldn't, by any chance,
borrow some money from you, could I?

1311
01:35:53,960 --> 01:35:57,000
If you don't know how little money
there is in this house, you should.

1312
01:35:57,160 --> 01:36:00,640
Well, I've simply got to get 200 francs
from somewhere.

1313
01:36:00,840 --> 01:36:05,640
I didn't intend to ask you for it. In fact,
I didn't intend popping in on you like this...

1314
01:36:05,800 --> 01:36:11,400
...but as I passed your door,
I just remembered you still owe me some.

1315
01:36:12,760 --> 01:36:16,280
- I didn't know, Prudence.
- I can show it to you on my ledger.

1316
01:36:16,440 --> 01:36:18,760
If you look around,
you'll find my purse somewhere.

1317
01:36:18,920 --> 01:36:21,880
You'll see I haven't
but a few francs in the world.

1318
01:36:27,960 --> 01:36:30,000
Why, it's full.

1319
01:36:31,440 --> 01:36:34,000
A thousand francs.

1320
01:36:34,160 --> 01:36:37,480
Well, I'll just help myself.

1321
01:36:37,640 --> 01:36:40,440
Did you know Armand Duval
was in Paris?

1322
01:36:41,920 --> 01:36:43,560
Armand?

1323
01:36:44,360 --> 01:36:47,760
- When did he get back?
- Why, almost a week, I gather.

1324
01:36:48,520 --> 01:36:53,560
Gaston told him you were ill,
but he didn't seem terribly interested.

1325
01:36:53,720 --> 01:36:57,640
Oh, men are funny. Goodbye, my dear.
Goodbye, Gaston. Goodbye.

1326
01:37:00,920 --> 01:37:03,840
- Gaston?
- Yes?

1327
01:37:04,240 --> 01:37:08,640
- Thank you for filling my purse.
- That was nothing.

1328
01:37:11,240 --> 01:37:15,400
- Will you do me one more favor, Gaston?
- Of course.

1329
01:37:16,680 --> 01:37:18,880
Send for the priest.

1330
01:37:41,480 --> 01:37:44,240
Where is she? Let me see her.
Make her see me.

1331
01:37:44,400 --> 01:37:49,880
Oh, my dear boy, if you only knew
how happy, how happy...

1332
01:38:09,000 --> 01:38:12,960
- Nanine? It's not too late?
- No, no, let us hope not.

1333
01:38:13,120 --> 01:38:16,120
Let us hope you'll make her well again.

1334
01:38:18,240 --> 01:38:22,280
No, no, no, wait.
Let me prepare her first.

1335
01:38:30,880 --> 01:38:32,640
Madame.

1336
01:38:33,880 --> 01:38:36,440
I've good news, Madame.

1337
01:38:39,120 --> 01:38:41,480
There can't be any good news now.

1338
01:38:41,640 --> 01:38:45,920
But there is. Only, you must be calm.
You mustn't get excited.

1339
01:38:46,120 --> 01:38:51,440
- He's here, Madame. He's come back.
- Yes...

1340
01:38:51,600 --> 01:38:53,240
...he's back.

1341
01:38:53,920 --> 01:38:58,440
- But he won't come to see me.
- But he has come. He's here.

1342
01:39:03,280 --> 01:39:05,720
He's here, Madame.

1343
01:39:09,160 --> 01:39:10,800
He's here?

1344
01:39:12,000 --> 01:39:14,880
- Are you telling me the truth?
- Yes, yes.

1345
01:39:15,040 --> 01:39:19,480
- Only, be calm, and I'll call him.
- No, no. Not yet.

1346
01:39:19,640 --> 01:39:22,040
He mustn't see me like this, Nanine.

1347
01:39:22,200 --> 01:39:25,960
- Help me to the mirror.
- You mustn't think of getting out of bed.

1348
01:39:26,120 --> 01:39:28,840
Brush my hair. Get me some rouge.
Help me, Nanine.

1349
01:39:29,000 --> 01:39:30,920
No, no. What will the doctor say?

1350
01:39:31,080 --> 01:39:34,760
Oh, what does it matter?
I must look my...

1351
01:39:36,520 --> 01:39:38,080
Nanine.

1352
01:39:38,480 --> 01:39:44,040
Nanine. I beg you, Nanine, I must...
You must help me, Nanine. Come on.

1353
01:39:44,200 --> 01:39:46,280
I beg you, Nanine. I beg...

1354
01:39:46,440 --> 01:39:48,280
Come, Nanine.

1355
01:39:48,440 --> 01:39:51,080
Oh, I shouldn't do this.

1356
01:39:51,760 --> 01:39:56,800
You don't think he cares how you look.
He knows you've been ill.

1357
01:40:05,040 --> 01:40:08,360
You always said, "He'll come back,"
didn't you, Nanine?

1358
01:40:08,520 --> 01:40:10,040
Yes.

1359
01:40:10,440 --> 01:40:12,200
- Sit here.
- Yes.

1360
01:40:13,960 --> 01:40:15,520
Sit here.

1361
01:40:16,120 --> 01:40:18,960
- There. Here are all your things.
- My camellias.

1362
01:40:19,120 --> 01:40:22,360
Nanine, I'll even have camellias.

1363
01:40:29,160 --> 01:40:32,760
I'll be beautiful again
when I'll be well again, won't I, Nanine?

1364
01:40:32,920 --> 01:40:35,040
Of course.

1365
01:40:36,040 --> 01:40:38,400
I can't wait. Call him now, Nanine.
Call him now.

1366
01:40:38,600 --> 01:40:40,200
Yes.

1367
01:40:44,360 --> 01:40:45,920
Monsieur.

1368
01:40:52,680 --> 01:40:55,520
- Marguerite.
- Armand.

1369
01:40:55,680 --> 01:40:57,280
Marguerite!

1370
01:41:01,520 --> 01:41:06,240
- It's you. It's not a dream.
- No, no, it's not a dream.

1371
01:41:06,400 --> 01:41:10,400
- I'm here with you in my arms at last.
- At last.

1372
01:41:11,960 --> 01:41:16,320
- You're weak.
- No, no, I'm strong.

1373
01:41:18,160 --> 01:41:22,920
It's my heart. It's not used
to being happy.

1374
01:41:23,080 --> 01:41:25,320
Oh, how pretty you are.

1375
01:41:25,920 --> 01:41:28,920
I've been in the street half the night,
walking under your window...

1376
01:41:29,080 --> 01:41:32,840
...just as I did when I first knew you,
wanting to come up but not daring to.

1377
01:41:33,000 --> 01:41:36,760
I felt so guilty.
I didn't know how ill you were.

1378
01:41:37,160 --> 01:41:39,520
I've been everywhere trying
to forget I loved you.

1379
01:41:39,680 --> 01:41:43,000
And when I came back a week ago,
I was still determined to forget you.

1380
01:41:43,160 --> 01:41:46,920
Forget you, as if I could.

1381
01:41:48,640 --> 01:41:50,960
- Forgive me.
- Forgive you.

1382
01:41:51,120 --> 01:41:54,760
And to think I couldn't see
into this heart I knew so well...

1383
01:41:54,920 --> 01:41:57,920
...and see that it was
sacrificing itself for me.

1384
01:41:58,560 --> 01:42:02,760
No good can come to either of us
without the other. I know that now.

1385
01:42:03,200 --> 01:42:06,680
- I know that too.
- Nothing shall ever separate us again.

1386
01:42:06,840 --> 01:42:10,600
The future is ours.
My whole life belongs to you.

1387
01:42:10,760 --> 01:42:13,960
I'll take you far from Paris, where there
are no unhappy memories for us.

1388
01:42:14,120 --> 01:42:16,840
Where the sun will help me take care
of you and make you well.

1389
01:42:17,000 --> 01:42:20,200
We will go back to the country,
where we were happy all one summer.

1390
01:42:21,480 --> 01:42:23,960
Oh, if only we could. If only we could.

1391
01:42:24,120 --> 01:42:26,840
We can. We will,
as soon as you're well enough.

1392
01:42:27,000 --> 01:42:30,480
Well, I'm well now. Call Nanine.

1393
01:42:30,760 --> 01:42:33,080
- Nanine?
- Take me today.

1394
01:42:33,240 --> 01:42:37,720
Nanine? Nanine, help Madame to dress.
We're going to the country today.

1395
01:42:39,480 --> 01:42:43,240
Don't worry. I'll take good care of her.
You must come along too.

1396
01:42:44,040 --> 01:42:48,000
We're going to the country, Nanine.
Get my things out.

1397
01:42:49,080 --> 01:42:51,600
Don't stare at me, Nanine. Go.

1398
01:43:00,680 --> 01:43:02,400
I can't...

1399
01:43:06,840 --> 01:43:09,280
Nanine? Nanine.

1400
01:43:09,480 --> 01:43:11,440
Nanine, get the doctor, quickly!

1401
01:43:11,600 --> 01:43:13,480
The doctor?

1402
01:43:13,640 --> 01:43:16,640
If you can't make me live,
how can he?

1403
01:43:16,840 --> 01:43:21,760
No, no. Don't say such things, Marguerite.
You'll live. You must live.

1404
01:43:21,960 --> 01:43:28,160
Perhaps it's better if I live in your heart,
where the world can't see me.

1405
01:43:29,280 --> 01:43:34,360
If I'm dead, there'll be no stain
on our love.

1406
01:43:34,760 --> 01:43:36,960
Don't think such things, Marguerite.

1407
01:43:37,120 --> 01:43:39,520
Even if we can't go
to the country today...

1408
01:43:39,680 --> 01:43:44,040
...think of how happy we were once,
and how happy we shall be again.

1409
01:43:44,360 --> 01:43:48,360
Think of the day you found the clover,
and the good luck it's going to bring us.

1410
01:43:48,520 --> 01:43:51,200
Think of the vows we heard
Nichette and Gustave make...

1411
01:43:51,360 --> 01:43:54,120
...and that we're going to make
to each other.

1412
01:43:54,280 --> 01:43:56,600
This is for life, Marguerite...

1413
01:43:59,720 --> 01:44:01,240
Marguerite?

1414
01:44:06,200 --> 01:44:07,920
Marguerite?

1415
01:44:09,040 --> 01:44:12,360
No. No, don't leave me.

1416
01:44:12,520 --> 01:44:15,320
Marguerite, come back, come back.
