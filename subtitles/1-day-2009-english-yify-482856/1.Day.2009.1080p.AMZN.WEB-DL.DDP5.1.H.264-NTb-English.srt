00:22:03,038 --> 00:22:06,040
- I can get it sorted by tomorrow.
- Tomorrow?

319
00:22:08,627 --> 00:22:11,248
Yo, you got two hours maximum.

320
00:22:11,422 --> 00:22:14,210
Don't think I am fucking with you,
you know what happens.

321
00:22:14,383 --> 00:22:19,757
- Don't act like you don't know.
- Two hours, Don, a hundred bags.

322
00:22:20,764 --> 00:22:25,807
Yo, Don. Fucking hell, man.
I'm under pressure right now, blud.

323
00:22:25,978 --> 00:22:28,766
I didn't know you was
coming out of jail today.

324
00:22:28,939 --> 00:22:31,015
I'm going to lick off your fucking head.

325
00:22:33,861 --> 00:22:37,479
I hear you, Don. Give me about...
Yeah, I'll have it ready for you.

326
00:22:37,656 --> 00:22:40,444
- Where you want to go?
- Take me to your sister's yard.

327
00:23:04,766 --> 00:23:07,720
I am going to phone Evil
and see what this geezer's saying.

328
00:23:07,895 --> 00:23:10,730
He phoned me last week
talking about he wants food and all.

329
00:23:15,569 --> 00:23:18,143
- Yo, yo, wagwan!
- Evil.

330
00:23:18,574 --> 00:23:20,781

So what are the mans under?

00:23:31,502 --> 00:23:33,661
Chilling? Kicking back?

333
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:36,625
Hold on one sec.

334
00:23:36,798 --> 00:23:39,040

<i>- Yo, sir.</i>

335
00:23:39,218 --> 00:23:41,507

00:23:41,678 --> 00:23:43,754

You got the three boxes of the food?

00:24:10,582 --> 00:24:12,658
I can deal with that for you,

<i>Then safe. Cool, man.
Meet me at my baby mother's.</i>

353
00:24:57,254 --> 00:25:00,338
- Yo. I'm down by the ends.
- All right, say no more.

354
00:25:09,975 --> 00:25:12,099
Make sure you got
the money by one.

355
00:25:12,269 --> 00:25:14,475
- Definitely. One o'clock.
- One o'clock. Serious.

356
00:25:14,646 --> 00:25:16,687
- I'll have that.
- Cool.

357
00:25:48,180 --> 00:25:50,932

358
00:25:51,099 --> 00:25:53,508
- Mmm!

359
00:25:53,685 --> 00:25:55,393
Wagwan, Don? Tell me.

360
00:25:55,562 --> 00:25:58,433
- Tell me, cuzzie.
- Say you got the bricks for me, fam?

361
00:25:58,607 --> 00:26:01,775
- You got them three B's for me?
- Yeah, I got them there for you.

362
00:26:01,943 --> 00:26:03,651
- You got the scrilla?
- Scrilla?

363
00:26:03,820 --> 00:26:06,395
No I ain't got the scrilla, fam. Na...

364
00:26:06,573 --> 00:26:09,860
What do you mean "Na," blud?
That's what I said to you on the phone.

365
00:26:10,035 --> 00:26:12,325
I didn't know you wanted
the money right now.

366
00:26:12,496 --> 00:26:16,197
That's what I'm trying to tell you. That
back slam shallawa shallawa bullshit.

367
00:26:16,375 --> 00:26:19,542
You have to talk a bit slower,
I don't really too understand it.

368
00:26:19,711 --> 00:26:21,538
I thought you said "can I deal with it?"

369
00:26:21,713 --> 00:26:24,086
- I can deal with it.
- It's not a thing like that.

370
00:26:24,257 --> 00:26:26,417
It's not a work thing.
I need the scrilla now.

371
00:26:26,593 --> 00:26:29,962
My man's talking. I need to link him

374
00:26:35,560 --> 00:26:37,387
We can go to my baby mother's,
pick it up.

375
00:26:37,562 --> 00:26:39,971

376
00:26:40,148 --> 00:26:43,316
What do you mean? Come on.
Have you got a baby mother?

377
00:26:43,485 --> 00:26:45,229
Yeah, you know who my baby mother is.

378
00:26:45,404 --> 00:26:48,192
- Who's your baby mother?
- You don't know her. She's...

379
00:26:48,365 --> 00:26:51,034
She's not from around here,
but she's kind of close by.

380
00:26:51,201 --> 00:26:53,028
- Close by, rude boy?
- You get me so...

381
00:26:53,203 --> 00:26:55,742
A hundred thousand at your
baby mother's, rude boy?

382
00:26:55,914 --> 00:26:58,833
Don, it's B you know, fam, Eves.

00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:01,836
Yo, come on, behave yourself.
A hundred grand is nothing.

384
00:27:02,003 --> 00:27:06,832
It's a minor. Understand? What you going
to say, you wanna go for the paper?

385
00:27:07,008 --> 00:27:09,168
We can go for it now.
You wanna jump in my car?

386
00:27:09,344 --> 00:27:10,542

Living and breathing.

00:27:41,752 --> 00:27:45,038
- I can't complain. Doing my thing...
- That's the main thing.

392
00:27:45,213 --> 00:27:49,081
If my man didn't come out of jail today
it'd have been a lily more easy.

393
00:27:49,259 --> 00:27:51,750
It's a headache.
I wasn't expecting to see him.

394
00:27:51,928 --> 00:27:55,297
Good to see him still, differently,
but wasn't expecting to see him.

395
00:27:55,474 --> 00:27:59,341
- You get me?
- Rather you than me, B.

396
00:27:59,519 --> 00:28:02,094
Take a right when you
get down the bottom there.

397
00:28:12,783 --> 00:28:17,777
Yo, where the fuck you are
really bringing me, you know, Don?

398
00:28:18,872 --> 00:28:23,498
- You worry too much. You're with me.
- With you. It's Zampa Boy ends.

Fuck, blud.

You worry too much, man.

Frightened Friday all the time.

Don't watch nothing.

In fact I don't even like

489
00:34:25,864 --> 00:34:27,856
Don't like the look of me?
You don't know me.

490
00:34:28,032 --> 00:34:29,740
Forget the watch.

491
00:34:29,909 --> 00:34:32,199
- What's with the yellow bandana?
- My yellow bandana

492
00:34:32,370 --> 00:34:34,114

I'm colour coordinated.

00:34:34,289 --> 00:34:35,321

497
00:34:43,006 --> 00:34:44,417

God bless you. Goodbye.

543
00:37:17,452 --> 00:37:19,409
Just have to go
and do a couple of things.

544
00:37:19,579 --> 00:37:21,821
- Wait a little.
- I'm gonna go, Nanny.

545
00:37:21,998 --> 00:37:24,323
You can go buy something
down the shops for me.

546
00:37:24,500 --> 00:37:28,451
Go and buy two eggs for me,
one dozen eggs and two green bananas.

547
00:37:28,629 --> 00:37:34,052
Me say come back here. Flash!
You no hear me, I call you.

548
00:37:37,972 --> 00:37:40,345
- Flash!
- What brings you here today?

549
00:37:40,516 --> 00:37:43,055
- It's nice to see you.
- My car's broken down.

550
00:37:47,648 --> 00:37:52,809
Oh, yes, follow me this way.
Come this way with me.

551
00:38:01,882 --> 00:38:05,030
Terence,
if we weren't meeting at church

552
00:38:06,168 --> 00:38:07,600
where would you have gone?

553
00:38:08,463 --> 00:38:10,093
I don't know. I was lucky.

554
00:38:10,505 --> 00:38:12,462
I would have just had to
keep on running.

555
00:38:13,174 --> 00:38:16,840
Terence, I think I can see Raymond
in the car behind me, you know.

556
00:38:17,011 --> 00:38:20,547
- Let's see. What is it? A silver car.
- It's a silver car, man. Cover up.

557
00:38:33,152 --> 00:38:36,355
Hi, Raymond, hi, Keisha. I ain't seen
you lot around here for a long time.

558
00:38:36,531 --> 00:38:38,073
- You alright?
- Yeah, I'm fine y'know.

559
00:38:38,241 --> 00:38:41,029
It's nice to see you. You must
pop into church one of them times

560
00:38:41,202 --> 00:38:43,278
when you are in the area.
I need to see you there.

561
00:38:43,454 --> 00:38:45,779
One day. I'm busy
dealing with life. You get me.

562
00:38:45,957 --> 00:38:48,412
You're always saying that.
Look forward to seeing you.

563
00:38:56,259 --> 00:38:59,343
You've been running, Terence,
for a long, long time.

564
00:38:59,512 --> 00:39:04,138
The more you're running, the more
you're running into deeper trouble.

565
00:39:04,308 --> 00:39:06,515
There comes a point, man,
you've got to stop.

566
00:39:06,686 --> 00:39:11,846
Stop? How else am I meant
to support my five children, Big Man?

567
00:39:12,024 --> 00:39:17,814
You've got five children and three
baby mothers, and you actually feel

568
00:39:17,989 --> 00:39:22,319
that the way you're living your life,
they're going to be around to see you?

569
00:39:22,493 --> 00:39:26,111
You're going to end up
six foot in a grave.

570
00:39:26,289 --> 00:39:30,749
You're friends will mourn you
for a while, but they'll all walk away.

571
00:39:33,504 --> 00:39:39,543
I know, Terence, that crime does pay.
Else people wouldn't get involved in it.

572
00:39:39,719 --> 00:39:42,886
But it's the consequence
that crime brings,

573
00:39:43,055 --> 00:39:46,093
you're constantly
looking over your shoulders.

574
00:39:47,143 --> 00:39:51,390
- What kind of a lifestyle is that?
- I respect you, Big Man.

575
00:39:51,564 --> 00:39:55,230
We need to sit down and
reason differently, one of these days...

576
00:39:55,401 --> 00:39:56,979
- You walk tall.
- Yeah, man.

577
00:39:57,153 --> 00:40:00,404
No doubt that police siren
is another incident

578
00:40:00,573 --> 00:40:05,034
that's just gone off in the community.
Probably somebody else is dead.

579
00:40:05,203 --> 00:40:09,118
That's what we're hearing every day,
man. You are causing it.

580
00:40:09,290 --> 00:40:11,366
You and your friends are causing it.

581
00:40:11,542 --> 00:40:14,995
You are taking away
the very sanctity of the neighbourhood

582
00:40:15,171 --> 00:40:17,579
because of what you
are doing in the community.

583
00:40:17,757 --> 00:40:21,293
And, sadly, you are killing each other.

584
00:40:21,469 --> 00:40:24,304
You are exterminating your own race,

585
00:40:24,472 --> 00:40:27,805
because of the stupidities
of your actions.

586
00:40:27,975 --> 00:40:30,514
It's evil, Terence. It's evil.

587
00:40:32,438 --> 00:40:33,980
I hear you, Big Man.

588
00:40:34,148 --> 00:40:38,194
But, right now, if you give me
your number or something.

589
00:40:38,361 --> 00:40:40,401
I beg you drop me
by town 'cause I need to,

590
00:40:40,571 --> 00:40:42,564
I got one and two things I need to do.

596
00:41:09,433 --> 00:41:12,186
Just hold tight for me.
Right now I'm coming to you.

597
00:41:12,353 --> 00:41:14,394
You're really testing my patience now.

598
00:41:14,564 --> 00:41:16,853
- If you don't...
- Hello?

599
00:41:17,024 --> 00:41:21,070
Where are you?
I've already been here for four hours!

600
00:41:21,237 --> 00:41:23,112
- It don't look good!
- Four hours!

601
00:41:23,281 --> 00:41:26,235
How long you going to be?
Fuck, how long you going to be?

602
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:27,792
I'm sending someone
else out to get it.

603
00:41:27,867 --> 00:41:29,992
No, look I'm coming to you right now,
bear with me.

604
00:41:30,028 --> 00:41:31,985
Call that later... Yo.

605
00:41:33,601 --> 00:41:34,644
Hello?

606
00:41:36,460 --> 00:41:40,376
I know you've been there hours, I'm
coming to you. I can't move no quicker.

607
00:41:40,548 --> 00:41:43,003
I'm under pressure.
If I ever told you I was going--

608
00:41:43,175 --> 00:41:45,928
- I'm not joking.
- Relax yourself.

609
00:41:46,095 --> 00:41:49,179
You said that about four, five
hours ago, you're on your way.

610
00:41:49,348 --> 00:41:53,513
I know you're out, come out the heat,
sit down in the shade or something.

611
00:41:53,686 --> 00:41:55,928
Dickhead. Prick.

612
00:42:00,568 --> 00:42:02,478

<i>- Yo, where's my money?</i>

613
00:42:03,199 --> 00:42:05,522

00:42:05,698 --> 00:42:08,237
I'm waiting on you.
I've got people waiting on me.

615
00:42:08,409 --> 00:42:10,651
I'm looking like a fucking prick
in front of them.

616
00:42:10,828 --> 00:42:13,830
- That's your problem.
<i>- Got it sorted. I'm there in a bit.</i>

617
00:42:16,196 --> 00:42:17,239
Fuck.

618
00:42:22,798 --> 00:42:27,010
Yo! What you doing

619
00:42:27,657 --> 00:42:28,340
Huh?

620
00:42:28,512 --> 00:42:30,505
My mum brought me here
when I was younger.

621
00:42:30,681 --> 00:42:33,006
What you saying?
Come here to do some shopping?

622
00:42:33,184 --> 00:42:34,216
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:42:44,070 --> 00:42:45,980
Right now, blud. Listen to me.

627
00:42:46,155 --> 00:42:48,646
You can't be in this part of town.
It's not our endz.

628
00:42:48,824 --> 00:42:51,399
These youths are out here
looking for man right now.

629
00:42:51,577 --> 00:42:55,444
I'm sure I can see them right there.
Come on, I can see them right there.

630
00:42:55,623 --> 00:42:58,162
- Come. Come on!
- Yo, what!

631
00:42:58,334 --> 00:43:00,244
There he is! There he is!

632
00:43:27,947 --> 00:43:30,438
Got trousers that will match these?

633
00:43:30,616 --> 00:43:33,570
This would look nice
with some baggy jeans.

634
00:43:33,744 --> 00:43:35,619
That is a boom top...

805
00:54:15,510 --> 00:54:17,836

00:54:41,036 --> 00:54:42,531

815
00:54:42,704 --> 00:54:44,661
Well, let me cook a pot of food,

816
00:54:44,831 --> 00:54:46,788
I ain't got time to

817
00:54:46,958 --> 00:54:48,916
What you a say to me?
You don't have time?

818
00:54:49,086 --> 00:54:51,755
Right now, sit down,
fe long time to eat

819
00:54:51,922 --> 00:54:55,339

00:54:55,509 --> 00:54:57,834
- But, Mum, right now...
- But, Mum, but, but...

821
00:54:58,011 --> 00:54:59,968
- Listen to me.

822
00:55:00,138 --> 00:55:02,677
Yo, wagwan? What is with this man?

823
00:55:13,360 --> 00:55:15,733
- You seen Angel?
- You know I seen Angel.

824
00:55:15,904 --> 00:55:19,606
You dropped him off. He got
what he wanted and then he left.

825
00:55:22,953 --> 00:55:26,820
- You seen Evil?
- Evil? Who's Evil?

826
00:55:26,998 --> 00:55:31,910
- Why you asking me such nonsense?
- Why you always got this attitude?

827
00:55:32,087 --> 00:55:33,203
'Cause I am sick of you.

828
00:55:33,380 --> 00:55:36,417
What makes you think I want
Mum and everyone to know my business?

829
00:55:36,591 --> 00:55:39,296
Always talking with this attitude.
What's wrong with you?

830
00:55:39,469 --> 00:55:42,922
- 'Cause I'm sick of you.
- Taleisha, stop and eat your food.

831
00:55:43,098 --> 00:55:45,506
Why are you always defending him
and blaming me?

832
00:55:45,684 --> 00:55:48,389
Like the time I brought home
that pen that didn't belong to me,

833
00:55:48,562 --> 00:55:49,594
you beat me black and blue.

834
00:55:49,771 --> 00:55:52,855
What about when he brought that
stolen TV, you watched <i>EastEnders.</i>

835
00:55:53,024 --> 00:55:54,982
Did you never watch <i>EastEnders</i> 'pon it?

836
00:55:55,152 --> 00:55:57,477
- That's so not the point.
- You never benefit?

837
00:55:57,654 --> 00:56:00,656
You're a girl child,
you can't do what a man do.

838
00:56:00,824 --> 00:56:02,575
Me never bring
you up as no tramp.

839
00:56:02,982 --> 00:56:07,136
Aaah!
That's why pickney no should get beaten.

840
00:56:09,026 --> 00:56:10,663
You want to come to church with me?

841
00:56:10,834 --> 00:56:14,333
Nanny, my generation don't too believe
in the church thing, you know.

842
00:56:14,504 --> 00:56:15,833
We believe in the big bang.

843
00:56:16,006 --> 00:56:19,173
Big bang? What you name so?
What are you a call big bang?

844
00:56:19,342 --> 00:56:22,095
You know, evolution,
the beginning of time.

845
00:56:22,262 --> 00:56:25,798
Instead of, like, God at the beginning,
there was a big bang,

846
00:56:25,974 --> 00:56:29,225
and that's what created everything.
Don't you know about evolution?

847
00:56:29,394 --> 00:56:32,514
- No.
- Evolution. Beginning of time.

848
00:56:32,689 --> 00:56:35,358
- The big bang.
- You know something.

849
00:56:35,525 --> 00:56:38,942
If you no come a church with me,

850
00:56:39,112 --> 00:56:42,980
you're gonna hell and you a gonna burn.

851
00:56:43,909 --> 00:56:47,776
You know when they gave you that bible
they gave you in the slave days.

852
00:56:47,954 --> 00:56:50,624
To turn the other cheek.
It was a mind control.

853
00:56:50,790 --> 00:56:55,666
Right now there is a big conspiracy
going on. The Illuminati, Freemasons.

854
00:56:55,837 --> 00:56:58,376
- They got us really confused.
- Freemasons?

855
00:56:58,548 --> 00:57:00,090
- Yeah.
- What name Freemasons?

856
00:57:00,258 --> 00:57:02,215
Me not know about Freemasons.

857
00:57:02,385 --> 00:57:05,470
They're involved in the conspiracy
to keep the black man down.

858
00:57:05,639 --> 00:57:07,513
Me and you need to sit down and reason.

859
00:57:07,682 --> 00:57:10,720
Personally, I'm trying to
elevate myself, get my mind right

860
00:57:10,894 --> 00:57:12,970
so I can activate my seven chakras.

861
00:57:13,146 --> 00:57:15,187
Shackles, me no know what you call so.

862
00:57:15,357 --> 00:57:18,441
Chakras, if you activate your
seven chakras, you can activate

863
00:57:18,610 --> 00:57:21,564
your pioneer gland. Then me and you
can speak without speaking.

864
00:57:21,738 --> 00:57:26,068
Bullshit. All you're doing is running
out there with your gang-banging-self

865
00:57:26,243 --> 00:57:29,861
selling your drugs, keeping
yourself down. And what about us women?

866
00:57:30,038 --> 00:57:33,289
Breeding up. One after another.
You're just full of shit.

867
00:57:33,959 --> 00:57:36,829
Stop. We not talk about big bang,

868
00:57:37,003 --> 00:57:41,334
pioneer gland,
goddamn pen and thiefing TV.

869
00:57:41,508 --> 00:57:44,960
Wanna stop man, all me want to do
is eat me food and get fat.

870
00:57:45,136 --> 00:57:47,177
- Go away.
- Oi!

871
00:57:47,347 --> 00:57:49,803

872
00:57:50,439 --> 00:57:52,181

873
00:57:54,813 --> 00:57:57,268

00:57:57,440 --> 00:57:59,849
- Is Flash there?
- Yeah, he's here. Flash!

875
00:58:02,654 --> 00:58:04,445

876
00:58:08,118 --> 00:58:10,953

like some little bitch?

877
00:58:11,121 --> 00:58:15,285
- I'm not running away.
- Flash! Where's my money?

878
00:58:17,294 --> 00:58:19,998
No, on a level. Who is this sket here?

879
00:58:20,171 --> 00:58:22,545
Who you calling a "sket"?
I'm his baby mother.

880
00:58:22,716 --> 00:58:24,211
- Baby mother!
- Who's this?

881
00:58:30,390 --> 00:58:34,138
- I don't know this girl.
- You don't know me?

882
00:58:37,272 --> 00:58:39,846
If you don't know me,
then what is this?

883
00:58:41,901 --> 00:58:45,817
Oh, how did I know? So if she don't

889
00:59:05,091 --> 00:59:06,717

You're a wasteman, fully.

Why you making so much noise?
Why are you making up so much noise for?

Flash, wait for me!

So how come you're taking him, not me?

1010
01:07:43,067 --> 01:07:44,349
How old are you now, Swipe?

Cool.

1015
01:08:27,028 --> 01:08:28,938
Ladies and Gentlemen.

1016
01:08:30,072 --> 01:08:33,525
I've been trying to phone you
from ages ago. Where've you been, man?

1017
01:08:33,701 --> 01:08:35,409
Mum, man...

1018
01:08:35,578 --> 01:08:40,157
My baby, my baby.
Come give your Mama a hug.

1019
01:08:40,333 --> 01:08:44,248
- Don't even start, man.
- Why you just pushing me like this?

1020
01:08:44,420 --> 01:08:46,046
What is it? What have I done?

1021
01:08:46,214 --> 01:08:49,500
Baby, come give your mummy a hug.
I haven't seen you in ages.

1022
01:08:49,675 --> 01:08:53,175
Why are you cha, cha, cha this for?
What's that?

1023
01:08:53,346 --> 01:08:56,881
What the heck? Thought you'd have
been in something better than this.

1024
01:08:57,058 --> 01:08:59,098
But you look good though. I like it.

1025
01:08:59,268 --> 01:09:01,178
- You got new clothes and everything.
- So what?

1026
01:09:01,354 --> 01:09:03,975
You look good.
Come give your mum some money, man.

1027
01:09:04,148 --> 01:09:06,901
Money, Mum? I'm living on the street.

1028
01:09:07,068 --> 01:09:10,105
You roll with the top man,
and you ain't got no any money at all?

1029
01:09:10,279 --> 01:09:14,989
- Top man? No, I don't.
- So what am I going to do, huh?

1030
01:09:15,159 --> 01:09:18,243
- What am I going to do?
- What do you mean? What am I gonna do?

1031
01:09:18,412 --> 01:09:22,873
- I'm gonna get a new mum.
- Alright, I can't do this.

1032
01:09:23,042 --> 01:09:25,663
This is hurting my head.
Come give me something, man.

1033
01:09:25,836 --> 01:09:29,289
What the heck,
shotting my mum shit like that.

1034
01:09:29,465 --> 01:09:31,624
Come. See you later.
Why you still in here?

1035
01:09:31,801 --> 01:09:34,671
Always talking. Always talking.

1036
01:09:34,845 --> 01:09:36,756
- Chat, chat...
- Just shut...

1037
01:09:36,931 --> 01:09:39,719
- Relax up, man.
- Come give me something.

1038
01:09:39,892 --> 01:09:41,269
Two minutes, Pest.

1039
01:09:41,435 --> 01:09:43,974
- I need something.
- What the fuck's wrong with you?

1040
01:09:44,146 --> 01:09:46,899
How can you be behaving like that
in front of your youth? You mad?

1041
01:09:47,066 --> 01:09:49,356
- Just give me something.
- Take this.

1042
01:09:49,527 --> 01:09:53,312
- I don't want to hear this shit.
- What's this, man? Who's this for?

1043
01:09:53,489 --> 01:09:54,521
Ants?

1044
01:10:11,215 --> 01:10:12,674
What's wrong with you, blud?

1045
01:10:12,842 --> 01:10:15,297
What the fuck do you mean,
what's wrong with me?

1046
01:10:19,473 --> 01:10:22,724
- Right now, blud...
- Shotting shit to my fucking mum.

1047
01:10:22,893 --> 01:10:25,384
- You're on the road, Don.
- On the road.

1048
01:10:25,563 --> 01:10:27,639
Do I give a shit about the fucking road?

1049
01:10:27,815 --> 01:10:31,433
Make sure you've got money. This morning
you never had nothing to eat.

1050
01:10:31,610 --> 01:10:33,686
You hadn't had a change,
hadn't had a wash for days.

1051
01:10:33,863 --> 01:10:37,908
I don't care. Why are you shotting my
mum shit though, man? What the fuck?

1052
01:10:38,075 --> 01:10:40,828
Getting all emotional, blud.
You look weak, rude boy.

1053
01:10:40,995 --> 01:10:43,949
Man'll walk all over you if
you're looking weak, you know.

1054
01:10:44,123 --> 01:10:48,074
You understand that? Look,
you don't want to be doing that shit.

1055
01:10:48,252 --> 01:10:51,087
Fix up, rude boy.
Are you rolling with me or not?

1056
01:10:51,255 --> 01:10:54,292
If you crying and shit like a baby,
blud, get out of the car.

1057
01:10:55,968 --> 01:10:57,214
Huh?

1058
01:10:57,386 --> 01:11:00,257
- Treating me like this?
- Fix the fuck up, blud.

1059
01:11:00,431 --> 01:11:02,009
- You, blud.
- Me?

1060
01:11:02,183 --> 01:11:03,511
Shut up, man.

1061
01:11:05,311 --> 01:11:07,932
Crying like some
little fucking girl, blud.

1062
01:11:12,109 --> 01:11:14,150
Here, hold this.

1063
01:11:15,029 --> 01:11:18,695
Start work for me tomorrow, but take
note of everything I do, you hear me?

1064
01:11:19,950 --> 01:11:22,406
Trick is to deal with them
as quick as possible.

1065
01:11:22,578 --> 01:11:24,987
- Yo, blud.
- Fucking hell.

1066
01:11:25,164 --> 01:11:26,196
What's popping, G?

1067
01:11:26,374 --> 01:11:31,249
Man was beginning to think
you were dead. What the fuck?

1068
01:11:31,420 --> 01:11:34,208
Man, left man waiting out there
for over five hours.

1069
01:11:34,382 --> 01:11:36,873
- I'm going to give you the thing.

1070
01:11:37,051 --> 01:11:39,008
- Yeah, yeah. It's hot.
- Cool.

1071
01:11:39,178 --> 01:11:41,005
- Sauna.
- Yeah, yeah.

1072
01:11:45,684 --> 01:11:48,769
Yo, Flash, what the fuck you call this?

1073
01:11:48,938 --> 01:11:52,604
Here, take these couple.
Deal with the rest of it later on.

1074
01:11:52,775 --> 01:11:55,859
- What you got for me?
- You want more, Don?

1075
01:11:56,028 --> 01:11:58,781
Don't fuck with me, rude boy. Yo.

1076
01:11:58,948 --> 01:12:00,858
- Alright, yeah.
- Walk safe with it, G.

1077
01:12:01,033 --> 01:12:02,065
In a minute.

1078
01:12:03,160 --> 01:12:08,119
Yo, Flash, you take the piss.

1079
01:12:08,290 --> 01:12:10,497
Blud, my day's been fucked up.

1080
01:12:10,668 --> 01:12:14,001
I don't care about your day.
There's been money to be made out there,

1081
01:12:14,171 --> 01:12:18,217
and you there taking the piss.
Who's this little shit anyway?

1082
01:12:18,384 --> 01:12:21,172
- Shut the fuck up.
- See...

1083
01:12:21,345 --> 01:12:24,632
See, while you're there picking up
little hood rats, you get me,

1084
01:12:24,807 --> 01:12:27,633
money's just been taking its time
to come, you get me?

1085
01:12:27,659 --> 01:12:31,535
But anyway, sort me out
with a little soops.

1086
01:12:33,656 --> 01:12:34,482
Safe.

1087
01:12:36,193 --> 01:12:38,433
Just doing business.
Hold it, yeah?

1088
01:12:40,857 --> 01:12:41,865
That scrilla, blud.

1089
01:12:42,439 --> 01:12:45,651
Getting hold of the money,
seven thousand pounds

1090
01:12:45,828 --> 01:12:48,483
in a 120 seconds, rude boy.

1091
01:12:57,173 --> 01:12:58,750
What time is it?

1092
01:12:58,924 --> 01:13:02,590
- I'm on point.
- You better be.

1093
01:13:19,653 --> 01:13:22,323
You alright, baby? Hmm?

1094
01:13:22,490 --> 01:13:25,111
Sorry about earlier, man.

Don't move away from me.

1098
01:13:39,340 --> 01:13:43,717
Baby? Hmm?

1099

1101
01:13:49,225 --> 01:13:52,641
- You know I love you, innit.

1102
01:13:54,563 --> 01:13:55,545
Hmm?

1103
01:13:58,526 --> 01:14:00,518

1105
01:14:22,216 --> 01:14:23,793

Man, you alright?

1112
01:14:54,582 --> 01:14:56,408
- You alright?
- Yeah, I'm alright.

1113
01:14:56,584 --> 01:14:58,079
- You sure?
- Yeah.

1114
01:14:58,252 --> 01:15:00,494
- Sorted out everything still.
- You sure?

1115
01:15:00,671 --> 01:15:02,332
Yeah, it's alright.

1116
01:15:03,632 --> 01:15:05,424
See Ashantay, Mummy?

1117
01:15:05,593 --> 01:15:08,001
She over there in the kitchen
there, so you know.

1118
01:15:13,809 --> 01:15:16,430
Ashantay, baby. What's happening?

1119
01:15:16,604 --> 01:15:18,680
Why, what you saying?

1120
01:15:18,856 --> 01:15:25,108
Not much. Just come to tell you
how much I love you.

1121
01:15:25,279 --> 01:15:27,154
- Me?
- Yeah, you.

1122
01:15:27,323 --> 01:15:31,534
- Okay. What's brought all this on?
- Nothing.

1123
01:15:32,411 --> 01:15:35,329
Going to marry you one of
these days, you know that, don't you?

1124
01:15:35,497 --> 01:15:37,242
- Married.
- Married.

1125
01:15:40,002 --> 01:15:42,872
Suppose you're going get me
a big house in the country?

1126
01:15:43,047 --> 01:15:44,079
Umm-hmm.

1127
01:15:44,256 --> 01:15:47,127
- Big ring.
- So where's my ring?

1128
01:15:47,301 --> 01:15:50,800
I'm going to buy you one real soon,
when I buy you the house...

1129
01:15:54,850 --> 01:15:56,677
So, really, what's going on?

1130
01:15:58,979 --> 01:16:00,806
I'm kind of in some trouble.

1131
01:16:02,816 --> 01:16:06,020
You always come to me when you're
in trouble. What is it this time?

1132
01:16:07,363 --> 01:16:09,154
Money trouble.

1133
01:16:10,449 --> 01:16:13,154
I wanted to believe it,
but I was just waiting for it.

1134
01:16:13,327 --> 01:16:16,696
You're in trouble so you come
sniffing around me. What do you want?

1135
01:16:18,957 --> 01:16:21,662
You want the chain?
The one good thing you give me?

1136
01:16:23,796 --> 01:16:27,497
I'm going to get you another one.
I just need to take it for a hot second.

1137
01:16:27,675 --> 01:16:30,510
Not bad enough I have to care
for the youths all of the time,

1138
01:16:30,678 --> 01:16:33,299
and the one little thing
that I've got, you want.

1139
01:16:33,472 --> 01:16:36,924
You know what, take it,
I don't even want nothing from you.

1140
01:16:37,101 --> 01:16:38,596
You can have it. Yeah?

1141
01:16:38,769 --> 01:16:42,221

Bang! He's dead, blud.

Hmm? Can handle 35 years

1243
01:24:05,799 --> 01:24:07,923
And that's before parole.

1244

40 years and you're coming out
when you're 50-odd, Don.

1246
01:24:16,810 --> 01:24:19,479

Are you ready for that?

1247

Hopefully, Evil comes with the scrilla.
Pay Angel. Zampa boys keep my ride.
